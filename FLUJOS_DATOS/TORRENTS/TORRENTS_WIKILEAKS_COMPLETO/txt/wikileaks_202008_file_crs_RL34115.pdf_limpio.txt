government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34115reform of us international taxation alternatives summary striking feature of the modern us economy is its growing openness its increased integration with the rest of the world the attention of tax policymakers has recently been focused on the growing participation of us firms in the international economy and the increased pre ssure that engagement places on the us system for taxing overseas business is the current us tax system for taxing us international business the appropriate one for the modern era of globalized business operations or should its basi c structure be reformed the current us system for taxing interna tional business is hybrid in part the system is based on residence principle applying us taxes on worldwide basis to us firms while granting foreign ta x credits to alleviate double taxation the system however also permits us firms to defer foreignsource income indefinitely feature that approaches territorial tax jurisdiction in keeping with its mixed structure the system produces patchwor k of economic effects that depend on the location of foreign investment and the ci rcumstances of the firm broadly the system poses tax incentive to invest in c ountries with lowtax rates of their own and disincentive to invest in hightax countries in theo ry us investment should be skewed towards lowtax countries and away from hightax locations evaluations of the current tax system va ry and so do prescriptions for reform according to traditional economic analysis world economic welfare is maximized by system that applies the same tax bur den to prospective marginal foreign and domestic investment so that taxes do not di stort investment decisions such system possesses capital export neut rality and could be acco mplished by worldwide taxation applied to all foreign operations along with an unlimited foreign tax credit in contrast system that maximizes national welfare system possessing national neutrality would impose higher tax burden on foreign investment thus permitting an overall disincentive for foreign investment such system would impose worldwide taxation but would per mit only deduction and not credit for foreign taxes tax system based on territorial ta xation would exempt overseas business investment from us tax in recent year s several proponents of territorial taxation have argued that changes in the world economy have rendered traditional prescriptions for international taxation obsolete and instead prescribe territorial taxation as means of maximizing both wo rld and national econo mic welfare for such system to be neutral however capital would have to be completely immobile across locations case might be made that such system is superior to the current hybrid system but it is not clear that it is superior to other refo rms including not only movement toward worldwide taxation by ending deferral but also restricting deductions for costs associated with defe rred income or restricting deferral and foreign tax credits for tax havens this report was originally written with david brumbaugh and will not be updated

tax journal published fourarticle forum on international tax reform in its december 2001 issue reform of us international taxation alternatives the increasingly global scope of us bus iness has variety of dimensions in trade the overall level of exports plus imports has risen steadily and substantially in recent decades increasing from 16 of us gross domestic product gdp in 1975 to full 26 of gdp in 2005 crossborder investment is growing even more dramatically in 1976 us private assets abroad were roughly 7 of the us privatelyowned capital stock by year end 2005 us assets abroad were 29 of private us capital1 the bulk of the increase in outbound investment has been portfolio investment investment in financial assets such as stocks and bonds without the active conduct of overseas bus iness operations but fore ign direct investment by us firms actual foreign production by usowned companies has increased too rising from 41 of the private capital stock in 1976 to 54 in 2005 an increase of about onethird it is the taxation of us business operations that has been the recent focus of policymakers and that has raised the question of basic tax reform in the international sector is the current us tax system for taxing us international business appropriate in this age of gl obalized business operations or is reform needed2 moreover along with the increasing scope of international investment activities there is an increasing opportunity for tax shelters that take advantage of lowtax foreign jurisdictions how might revisions in the tax system exacerbate or address these tax shelter issues the current us system is hybrid construct embodying mix of opposing jurisdictional principles not surprisingly the mixed system in conjunction with foreign hostcountry taxes

243and their global operations in some cases taxing foreign operations favorably and posing an incentive to invest abroad and in other cases imposing high tax burdens and posing disincentive to overseas investment in some cases the system presents rough tax neutrality towards overseas investment it is perhaps the hybrid nature of the system that has led to calls for re form prescriptions for good tax system vary and the hybrid system satisfies none of them fully the report describes and ssesses the principal prescr iptions that have been offered for broad reform of the interna tional system the report begins with an overview of current law and of possible revi sions it then sets the framework for considering economic efficiency as well as tax shelter activities finally it reviews alternative approaches to revi sion in light of those issues the current system and possible revisions the systems structure there are two alternative conceptually pure principles on which countries base their tax in the international setting residence and territory under residence system country taxes its own resident s or domestically chartered resident corporations on their worldwide income re gardless of its geographic source under territorial or sourcebased system count ry taxes only income that is earned within its own borders in practice country uses pure reside ncebased tax hi storically virtually all countries tax income foreign investor s earn within their borders although they may grant tax holidays in some cases as an inducement to investment some countries however do have an exclusivel territorial or sourcebased tax3 the united states uses system that taxes both income of foreign firms earned within its borders as well as the worldwide in come of its uschartered firms despite these nominal residence features however us taxes do not apply to the foreign income of usowned corporations chartered abroad as result us firm can indefinitely defer us tax on its foreign inco if it conducts its foreign operations through foreignchartere d subsidiary corporation us taxes do not apply as long as the foreign subsidia rys income is reinvested overseas with some exceptions us taxes apply only when the income is remitted to the us resident parent as dividends or other in trafirm payments such as interest andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34115crs3 4 according to irs

income unpublished paper presented at the james baker ii institute for public policy conference on tax reform april 2728 2006 p 43royalties the deferral feature reduces the effective us tax burden on foreign income and imparts an element of territoriality to the system it also results in dichotomous structure for taxing overseas business income deferral in the case of foreignsubsidiary income and current taxation in the case of branches of us chartered corporations the bulk of activ business investment by us firms is through foreignchartered subsidiaries4 along with deferral another basic feature of the us system is the foreign tax credit while the united states taxes worldwide income on either current or deferred basis it also allows credits for foreign taxes paid on dollarfordollar basis against us taxes otherwise owed5 this treatment avoids the doubletaxation that would otherwise apply and concedes the fi rst right of taxation to the country of source in effect the united states gives the foreign host country the first opportunity to tax the income and collects onl what tax is left up to its own rate after the foreign host country collects its share when the foreign tax is higher than the us tax the credit is limited to the us tax that would be due on the foreign income the purpose of the limit is to protect the us domestic tax base without it fore ign countries could impose very high taxes without discouraging inbound us investment because the cost of the higher taxes would be shifted to the us treasury with the limitation if foreign taxes exceed the us tax that would be due the excess fore ign taxes cannot be cr edited foreign tax credits that exceed this limitation are termed excess credits currently foreign tax credits are allowed on what is sometimes termed an overall basis so that income and tax credits from all countries are comb ined this treatment allows for cross crediting where credits paid in excess of us tax in one country may be used to offset us tax in country where the fore ign tax is lower than the us tax to prevent abuse tax credits are divided into baskets which sepa rate passive income easily shifted to lowtax countries curren tly there are two baskets one for active income and one for passive income about half of foreignsource active business income is earned by firms with overall excess credits6 to address tax avoidance by shifting passive income into lowtax jurisdictions subpart f restricts the appli cability of deferral in some s ituations subpart f provides that us stockholders eg parent firms of foreign corporations are subject to current us tax on certain types of subsidiary income whether or not the income is repatriated only stockholde rs owning at least 10 of subsidiary stock and only subsidiaries that are at least 50 owne d by 10 us stockholders are subject tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34115crs4 subpart f countries that ve territorial tax systems ge nerally also have some type of antiabuse provision to protect their tax base tax deferral results in heightened importance for the systems rules for dividing income between related firms the more income firm can assign for tax purposes to foreign subsidiary in lowtax c ountry the lower its overall tax burden the current system generally requires firms to set hypothetical transfer prices which are required to approximate the prices tw firms would agree on if they conducted their transactions at arms length the system is complex and difficult to administer the foreign tax credits limitation also places pressure on the systems rules for determining the source of income sourcing rules because firms can only credit foreign taxes against the portion of taxable income attributable to foreign sources taxpayers must assign both re venue and costs to either domestic or foreign sources while the tax code contains rules for making such allocations they are likewise complex and difficult to administer in sum the united states taxes its re sident corporations on their worldwide income but permits indefin ite deferral of active business income earned through foreign subsidiaries where us taxes apply foreign tax credits alleviate double taxation but are limited to offsetting us tax on foreign income subpart f is designed to deny deferral to wh at is generally passive income possible revisions because the current us tax system is mix of worldwide system and territorial system the fundamental tax refo rm issue is whether moving toward either pure system territorial or worldw ide residencebased re gime would be an improvement moving toward territo rial system would involve permanently exempting most foreignsource active busin ess income most territorial proposals however would continue taxi ng passive income as under current laws subpart f moving toward worldwide tax would eliminate the deferral benefit and might also entail further restricting crosscrediting by increasing the number of baskets for the foreign tax credit limit some revisions that maintain the current system but tighten the rules for deductions include proposals to disallow certain deduc tions of the parent company such as interest that reflect the share of income that is deferred the report defers the discussion of th precise changes fundamental reform would entail first however the report explains the tools economists have developed for evaluating the various international tax systems httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34115crs5 7 for more detailed discussion of this concept see crs report rs22445 taxes and international competitiveness by david l brumbaugh 8 comparative advantage is not technical or unfamiliar concept it is common everyday occurrence lawyer may be able to do his or her paralegal employees work more efficiently but that activity is not the best us of his or her time lawyer has an absolute advantage in both law practice and paralegal work but comparative advantage in practicing lawneutrality efficiency and competitiveness the term competitiveness has often b een invoked in the debate about us policy in global economy including discussions of us tax policy7 in economic analysis however it is not countries that are competitive it is companies that are company generally thinks of itself as co mpetitive if it can produce at the same cost as or lower cost than other firms but countrys firms cannot be competitive in all areas indeed even if firms in c ountry are more productive than firms in all other countries in every respect country would still tend to produce those goods in which its relative advantage is greatest the other countries need to produce goods with their resources as well this notion is called comparative advantage and it is an important concept in economic theory8 when discussing national policy incl uding tax policy and its effect on the international allocati on of capital the issues are generally framed around issues of efficiency neutrality and optimal policies rather than notions of competitiveness these terms can mean the same thing or they can be slightly different neutrality generally refers to provisions that do not alter the allocation of investment from that which would occur without taxes when markets are operating efficiently neutral tax policy will also be an efficient policy since it will maintain the efficient allocation that would occur without taxes moreover even when there are market imperfections neutrality may still be the policy most likely to be efficient given the difficulty in identifying and measuring market imperfections optimal policy differs from efficiency in that it usually refers to particular agent or actor choosing policy that max imizes his or her own welfare country can also choose policy that leads to the greatest welfare for its own citizens even if that policy distorts the allocation of capital is not neutral and leads to less efficient worldwide production the op timal policy from the perspective of country in other words may not be the mo st efficient in terms of the worldwide allocation of capital and may not be the optimal policy from the perspective of world economic welfare economists have traditionally used three concepts to evaluate tax rules that apply to outbound investment these concepts are referred to as neutrality concepts although as shown below they are not alwa ys neutral in the sense of not distorting the allocation of investment the concepts are capital export neutrality capital import neutrality and national neutrality in order to evaluate the consequences of any multinational tax reform it is crucial to understand th concepts whether they are valid and what they imply for polic the concepts were developed when virtually all foreign investment took place as direct investme nt of multinationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34115crs6 companies virtually foreign portfolio i nvestment ownership of foreign stock by us citizens existed the growth in this portfolio investment has led to new neutrality concept referred to as capital ownership neutrality we address these traditional and new concepts in turn understanding capital export neutrality capital import neutrality and national neutrality capital export neutrality requires country to apply the same tax rate to its firms investments regardless of where they are located and is embodied in residencebased tax system capital import neutrality requires the same tax on firms with different nationalities th at invest in given location and is embodied in territorial or sourcebased tax national neutrality requires that the nations total return on investment including both that nati ons taxes and its firm s profits is equal in each jurisdiction foreign and domestic this form of neutrality is obtained by taxing foreignsource income and allowi ng deduction for foreign taxes some of these neutrality rules may so be rules for optimization national neutrality is often described as optimal but that outcome is only the case with perfectly mobile capital and retaliation by foreign countries there is also an optimizing rule for choosing the tax rate on inbound investment which depends on how responsive that investment inflow is to the return evaluating policy discussed subsequently is complicated because while some countries have territorial or sourcebased taxes count ry imposes pure residence based tax while worldwide taxation as practiced in the united states and other countries has some attributes of residencebased tax it is mixture of residence and sourcebased tax tax is imposed on foreign firms operating within the united states sourcebased attribute on out bound investment the pplication of tax to repatriated income creates some resemblance to residence tax but the foreign tax credit limitations cause it to depart from such tax and deferra l provisions introduce an element of sourcebased tax because these concepts are so frequen tly misunderstood it is useful to employ simple illustrative example to explain them with the pure tax systems that are consistent with capital export neutrality and capital import neutrality in these simple systems national neutrality is the same as capital export neutrality and its nuances will be discussed in the following section where more realistic tax systems are discussed in this instance it may be helpful to demonstrate the difference between residencebased and sourcebased taxes in achieving economic neutrality consider world beginning with taxes and assume that capital is perfectly substitutable across countries implying that firm will earn the same aftertax return in each location the return is 10 there are three c ountries high tax country that imposes 50 tax rate lowtax c ountry that imposes 25 tax rate and zerotax country all investment is made through the companies direct operations hence there is substitution of capital across firms and the capital owned by each country is fixed the high and lowtax ra countries have capital which can be used to invest in their own country or in the ot her two countries to simplify the zerotax country is assumed to ve only labor and capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34115crs7 table 1 shows the return to firms in the absence of any tax and with the two tax systems in place but before investment has shifted which would alter the pretax return residence taxation which produ ces capital export neutrality has effect on the allocation of investment by either countrys firm s because each firm still earns the same return in each location sourcebased taxation however will result in higher returns in the zero and to lesser exte nt lowtax countries as result capital will flow out of the hightax country raising its return and lowering the wages of the workers in that country and into th zerotax country lowering its return and raising the wages of the workers in that country the effect on the lowtax country depends on the size of that country and its bor force relative to the rest of the world in addition to the effects on the return to capital and wages output is produced inefficiently which reduces world welfare

while the lowtax country has 25 tax rate table 1 can also be used to show that the residencebased system is also consistent with national neutrality but the sourcebased system is not for the high tax country in each location it earns 5 in tax revenue and 5 in profits for total of 10 thus the total return to the nati on is equated in each jurisdiction the same is true of the lowtax country although th total return is split into 25 taxes and 75 profits the sourcebased system doe s not meet that standard even before investment shifts the hightax country while earning 10 domestically and in the zero tax haven country is earning only 75 in the lowtax country since that countrys government is collecting the tax the same is true of the lowtax country with respect to investment taxed by the hightax country httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34115crs8 9 mihir desai and james hines evaluating international tax reform national tax journal vol 56 september 2003 10 michael p deveraux capital export neut rality capital import neutrality capital ownership neutrality and all that unpublished paper june 11 1990 11 daniel j frisch the economics of in ternational tax policy some old and new approaches tax notes april 30 1990 12 frisch in the economics of internationa l tax policy some old and new approaches states in short major element of the cin view would seem to possess grain of truth p 590 referring to the capital import neutrality framework deveraux in capital export neutrality capital import neutrality cap ital ownership neutrality and all that indicated that he originally attempted to redefine capital import neutrality to cover the capital ownership neutrality conceptnational neutrality departs from capital export neutrality in the more complex real world circumstances it in fact re quires that foreignsource income be taxed and that any taxes imposed by the country of location be deducted rather than the current rule of some countries including the united states that allow taxes to be credited if foreign countries impose taxes national neutra lity does not lead to worldwide neutrality since foreign inves tment is discouraged in countries that impose taxes national neutrality is really about optimal policy which maximizes the welfare of the countrys residents it is an optima l policy if all capital is perfectly mobile if not it is actually optimal for country to impose even more tax on outbound investment than is suggested by the neutrality standard in sum according to these longstanding measures of neutrality and efficiency capital export neutrality is appropriate for maximizing world output national neutrality is appropr iate for maximizing nations welfare and capital import neutrality is not neutral at all capital ownership neutrality new concept of neutrality has appeared in recent years the term capital ownership neutrality is closely associated with desai and hines professors respectively of business at harvard and economics at the university of michigan9 the term itself however appears to have been coined by michael devereaux10 british economist the underlying justifica tion for the new standards development the growth of portfolio investment was so discussed independe ntly about the same time in paper by frisch11 essentially capital ownership neutrality is the same as capital import neutrality in that under certa in very restrictive assumptions it is achieved by sourcebased taxa tion and some of the earlier discussions viewed it as resurrection of capital import neutrality12 the issue of ownership neutrality deve loped because intern ational investment markets changed at the time the previous notions of neutral international tax systems were first developed genera lly the early 1960s virtually all ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34115crs9 13 the concepts were first developed by peggy musgrave see for example her united states taxation of foreign inves tment income issues and arguments cambridge ma

can also be found in the national income and product accounts at httpwwwbeagovnationaln ipawebni_fedbeasna tableviewasp selectedtable5firstyear 1998lastyear2005freqyear 15 this optimality issue has also been addr essed with the notion of national ownership neutrality which indicates that it is both fficient and optimal to have sourcebased taxationinvestment abroad was carried out through foreign direct investment by us firms13 us portfolio investors held almost stock in foreign firms until the mid1980s the share of foreign stocks in us resi dents stock portfolio s was less than 1 thus it was reasonable to assume as in the discussion above that there was substitution across the nationality of firms but rather only across locations that is us investors could not substitute investment abroad through foreign firms for investment in us firms with foreign operations over time however the share of foreign stock owned by us investors increased and by the end of 2006 it was 22 of corporate equity ow ned by us investors14 this increase did not occur smoothly it increased in the latter part of the mid 1980s to about 6 leveled out for number of years then again rose around 1993 nd 1994 to about 11 where it stayed until around 2001 and then rose again closer look at the concept indicates that to make the argument that capital ownership neutrality and therefore sourcebased taxation should be the guiding principle for an efficient and ne utral tax system th ree requirements are needed first firms are assumed not to substitute operations in one location for those in another capital is completely immob ile across locations second firms must differ in their productivity that is some fi rms are more efficient than others and there must be substitution across portfolios that results in firms being shut out of linesofbusiness that they could run more efficiently third there must be mechanisms available to obtain the benefits of productive efficiency short of owning the productive capital assets for ex ample relatively in efficient firms cannot rent efficient technologies or hire effi cient managers away from efficient firms if only the first requirement is met immobility across locations any system of taxing investment abroad would be neutral because the particular distortion allocation of investment acr oss locations is simply assumed away it doesnt matter if overseas operations are taxed high er or lower than domestic investment because investment has reason to move residence taxation would be efficient as well as sourcebased taxation because the national affiliati on of firms would not matter to productivity although residence taxation would not be optimal for the high tax country which woul d have revenues15 if the two remaining assumptions also apply productivity differs and mechanisms exist to boost efficiency it can be shown that residencebasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34115crs10 16 congressional budget office corporate tax rates international comparisons november 2005 17 data are from tax rates cited in congressional budget office corporate tax rates continuedtaxation is inefficient while sourcebased taxation produces efficiency for example returning to table 1 suppose some firms in each count ry are particularly productive and can earn 12 before tax rather than 10 with residen cebased taxation the aftertax return of the hightax country s productive firms which would yield an aftertax return of 6 would not be enough for these firms to operate and if the only way to realize the higher return is to own the capital the higher pretax yields of these more efficient firms would not be realized with sourcebased taxation the efficient firms in each country would ope rate and displace the less efficient ones in the more realistic tax systems where c ountries also tax capital income in their own location the hightax countrys esp ecially productive firms would still operate in their own country that is by taxing income within its borders hightax country that is attempting to practice capital expor t neutrality with worldwide tax still faces neutral ground in its home country thus an distortion arising in practice from the current system would involve foreign firm s and the solution of exempting foreign source income from tax is the solution consistent with capital ownership neutrality consider each of the restrictions in turn the first is the assumption that capital is immobile across locations as noted above there is considerable evidence that it is not and indeed that it is quite elastic so at best it would be question of picking which type of distortion is worse as long as capital is mobile across jurisdictions capital ownership neutrality is not neutral at most the model shows that there is way to achieve neutrality and that one is in secondbest world the second restriction requires hig h perhaps perfect degree of substitution in portfolios of different type s of stocks that would lead to the exclusion of stock of hightax countries there is considerable evidence to suggest that such perfect substitution is not the case it has long been known that there is significant home bias in the holding of both portfolio and direct assets despite global securities markets american residents continue to hold 80 of their stock portfolios in stock of us firms if portfolio investment were perfectly substitutable the us share would be expected to be closer to the share of total assets the us accounts for about third of total fixed inve stment of the oecd countries16 the fact that the portfolio share has grown does not in itself provide evidence of significant elasticity rather it may reflect variety of technical and institutional changes that make holding foreign stocks more feasible moreover the portfolio shares are consistent with the notion that the holdings that do exist are not so much due to tax differences but to general desire to diversify assets across countries to reduce cyclical risk twothirds of inves tment is in other count ries with similar tax rates at the end of 2005 the two largest sh ares were for the uk 16 and japan 15 while the uk with 30 corporat rate has lower statutory rate than the us 39 including state taxes japan has rate of 41 the next two largest claimants with 7 and 6 have rates of 35 and 3517 there are significant shareshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34115crs11 17 continued international comparisons november 2005 and portfolio share data are from us department of treasury report on us portfolio holdings of foreign securities 18 us department of treasury report on us portfolio holdings of foreign securities 19 principalagent costs occur when the objectives of the two parties are not identical for example the contract manufact urer the agent may want to increase the scale of the operation rather than maximizing profits fo r the firm authorizing the manufacturing the principalin two tax havens bermuda 5 and the ca yman islands 3 according to the department of treasury however the berm uda investments are largely former us firms that have moved their location to avoid us tax phenomenon called inversion which was subsequen tly addressed with legisla tive restrictions and the cayman islands investments are in offshore financial centers again likely tax avoidance issue rather than direct production issue18 an imperfect portfolio substitution elasticity also suggests that the phenomenon of eliminating efficient firms is less likely to happen firms that are especially productive and efficient will earn higher returns than other firms in similar circumstances of nationality nd location and they would be expected to be retained in both domestic and foreign investors portfolios any firms whose size is contracted by portfolio shifts due to tax rates are more likely to be the marginal firms that have normal level of productivity finally this model assumes that there are other ways to enjoy the additional productivity of more efficient firms in ffect the model begins with the assumption of productive advantages without defining in formal terms so that the effects can be modeled the source of the productivity for example if the greater productivity of the firm is due to the employment of managers with greater skills then that productivity arises at cost and these management skills embodied in the individua ls resident in given country should be free to move to their highest use and allocated efficiently since they add surplus value they would not be driven out of th market and worldwide efficiency requires capital export neutrality approach to labor resources as well as capital if the asset is uniquely tied to the firm such as value through trademark intangible rd or even management setup the model does not allow for the fact that ownership of the productive assets and ownership of the intangible asset can in most cases be separated trademarks nd patents can be franc hised and sold or if the intangible cannot be separately sold for example if the rd could be easily copied and thus is not patented but kept s ecret there are ways for the firm to operate without ownership of the capital assets such as factories machinery and equipment that give rise to normal products these ssets could be leased by the firm with the intangible asset moreover if the asset is not closely tied to management the firm could arrange for contract manufacturing technique commonly used to shift profits these techniques may be less than perfect if there are principalagent costs19 but this effect is of questionable importance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34115crs12 in light of the many ways in which th efficiency costs of capital ownership non neutrality are unlikely to be significant compared to location distortions it seems questionable to use meeting this standard of neutrality to evaluate tax reform changes and questionable to see source based taxation as an efficient international tax regime assessing the existing tax system the above examples illustrate the various traditional concepts of neutrality and how they are embodied in basi c tax structures however as described at the reports outset the us tax system is hybrid neither pure territorial or residencebased system accordingly it presents patchwork of incentive effects sometimes posing an incentive to invest abroad and in other situations presenting either disincentive or tax neutrality we look in this section at the existing systems principal incentive effects first in some cases the us system resembles residencebased taxation it taxes foreign branch income on current basis while allowing foreign tax credit even where current taxation applies however the us system departs from pure residence taxation by placing limit on its foreign tax credit if pure residencebased means taxing income of residents at the same rate regardless of where it is earned an unlimited foreign tax credit would be required under such credit when the foreign tax is lower than the home country tax the home country would collect residual equating the total tax imposed to that on its domestic investment when the foreign countrys tax is higher the home country would have to refund the excess so that again the tax on the foreign investment would be the same as the tax on domestic investment in practice however an unlimited foreign tax credit is not feasible because of its potential threat to th home country tax base here that of the united states without limit countries host to foreign investment could simply raise their taxes on inbound investment w ithout limit and without fear of driving foreign investors away the foreign invest ors could simply credit their high foreign taxes against their homecountry tax bill the us thus limits its foreign tax credit to offsetting us taxes on foreign and not domestic income the incentive effects of worldwide system with limited credit depend on exactly how the credit is limited if the limit applies sepa rately for each country percountry limit the system would achieve neutrality on outbound investment with respect to low taxrate countries but not high taxrate countries if taxes can be averaged across countries that is if firm calculates single limit aggregated across countries the neutrality consequences are less clear in that case the excess credits from the investment in hightax country can be used to offset tax due on investments in the lowtax country can be cross credited for example assume profits were 100 in hightax location with 50 rate and 100 in the notax location with the home country tax rate 25 with cross crediting firm from the 25 tax rate country uses the foreign tax of 50 to wipe out the home country tax of 25 with only the tax of 50 applying while the firm would pay home country tax of 25 on the income earned in the zero tax jurisdiction the total tax is 75 with cross crediting the total foreigns ource income is 200 the total foreign tax paid is 50 in the hightax country on 100 of profit and th total homecountryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34115crs13 tax due is also 50 25 of 200 of income in both countries all foreign tax is credited and the total tax is 50 cross crediting as allowed in the us tax system can therefore reduce the disincentive to invest in high tax countries if th firm already has investment in the zero tax country because the excess credits have value similarly it can increase the incentive to invest in the zero tax c ountry if the country already has investment in the hightax country since excess credits can effectively remove any residual tax in the zero tax country in either case foreign investment is encouraged relative to domestic investment in practice the us tax system permits extensive cross crediting it does not require percountry limitation although it does require firms to calculate separate limits for passive and active business income second the us tax system departs from residencebased taxation in its use of deferral as described bove us taxes generally do not apply to the foreign business income of foreignchartered subsidiaries this feature of the tax system introduces elements of territorial or sourcebased taxation into the system and also introduces distortion in firms decisions of whether to return profits to the united states or reinvest them abroad moreove r the interaction of deferral with cross crediting provides some scope for firms to choose the times and pl aces of repatriation to minimize tax liability in general the availability of deferral like the territorial taxation it at least approaches poses an incentive for us firms to invest in low tax countries also once capital has been invested abroad the provision encourages firms to retain their earnings overseas rather than returning them to the united states this mixture of treatments also provide s methods for avoiding tax apart from the direct effects on investment alloca tion deferral provides an incentive to artificially shift prof its to lowtax jurisdictions since firms can choose between branch operations and investme nt via foreignchartered s ubsidiaries they can use branch form when operations are starting up and typically lose money to allow losses to be deducted from the us worldwide income tax and then shift to subsidiary form when the operation becomes profitable in sum the current system poses patchwork of incentive effects that is in keeping with its hybrid nature where current taxation applies for example to branch income there is disincentive to invest in hightax c ountries and either an incentive or neutrality towards investment in lowtax countries depending on whether the investing firm can use crosscrediting of foreign taxes where deferral is available the system poses an incentive to invest in lowtax countries the system also provides mechanisms for artificially sheltering income from taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34115crs14 20 harry grubert and john mutti taxing international business income dividend exemption versus the current system washington american enterprise institute 2001

preceding sections showed why the theoretical argument that territorial taxation is optimal is difficult to defend some have argued however that while territorial taxation may not be the most efficient system in perfect world it is nonetheless superior to the hy brid patchwork system that is the current us system second best argument to best understand this argument for territorial taxation it is helpful to examine the sp ecific version proposed in 2001 american enterprise institute monograph by econo mists harry grubert and john mutti similar plan was set forth in 2005 by pres ident bushs advisory commission on tax reform20 grubert and mutti described their proposal as div idend exemption system thus focusing on the chief modification thei r plan would make to the current regime it would exempt from us taxes dividends repatriated to us parents from foreign subsidiary corporations thus moving fro m current laws deferral for foreign income to permanent exemption more generally an exemption system can be viewed as territorial tax system whose application is restricted to active business investment abroad but that continues to tax portfolio investment of firms such as interest royalties and similar income on current basis several additional feat ures of the plan are important to the advantages it might have over the current system first the plan would not permit foreign tax credits to be claimed for foreign taxes paid with respect to repatriated earnings the repatriations after ll would be exempt from us tax thus obviating the need for relief from double taxation second deducti ons allocable to taxexempt foreign source income would be disallowed here the reasoning is that the purpose of deductions is to remove items of cost from the tax base since overseas income would longer be in the us tax base removal of associated costs would not be necessary importantly this would mean that tion of debt incurred by us parent corporation would not be ductible the portion assumed to be used in financing taxexempt foreign subsidiaries as described in the preceding sections the capital import ne utrality and capital ownership neutrality standards both reco mmend adoption of terr itorial taxation but traditional economic theory is skeptical of the theoretical justification of the two standards grubert and mutti argue however that even if cin and are rejected on theoretical grounds an exemption system is superior to the current hybrid system in terms of several important factors efficiency simplicity and the raising of tax revenue first

tax credits would longer be applicable cross crediting of excess foreign tax credits would longer shield investment in lowtax foreign locations from us tax and the ar tificial diversion of technologyexploiting investment to lowtax loca tions would longer occur21 nevertheless elimination of these sources of inefficiency alone would not be sufficient to make an exemption system less wasteful than current law if elimination of tax on repatriations were the only feat ure of an exemption system the system would likely increase inefficiency by encouraging added investment in lowtax countries rather the crucial element to an exemption systems purported superiority is its elimination of interest deductions for overseas investment the inclusion of this provision would actually result in an incr ease in the average tax burden for overseas investment thus generating an efficien cy gain from an improved allocation of investment away from lowtax overseas locations and into the domestic economy22 an exemption system may also increa tax revenue th grubert and mutti analysis concludes that the system woul d generate 77 billion nnually in added us revenue23 their estimate is ba sed on 1994 data so it would likely be larger in the current economy more recently the jo int committee on taxation has estimated the revenue gain at about 6 billion per year24 as with the efficiency gains however the increase in tax revenues is crucially pendent on denial of deductions for costs allocated to taxexempt foreign income w ithout the new restrictions an exemption system would likely reduce tax revenue the joint committee on taxation has estimated that current laws deferral reduces revenues by approximately 6 billion25 by the same token an exemption system would lose tax revenue compared to the current system if the current system were to deny deductions to deferred income in the area of simplicity proponents of an exemption system emphasize its reduction in the need for tax

accompanying difficulties for tax administration exist when entities or activities are taxed according to different rules under an exemption system foreign subsidiary corporations would be tax exempt as under current law and since the exemption woul d be permanent rather than temporary its import for firms tax planners would be magnified accordingly the tax systems transfer pricing rules for allocating income among us parent firms and their foreign subsidiaries would become more important more pressure would apply to rules that are inherently difficult to enforce the same would be true for the distinction between active and passive income ce active income would be permanently exempt and passiveinvestment income would be taxed on current basis firms would have an even greater incentive to move from branch to subsidiary operations for startup firms in recent article critical of territori tax proposals kleinbard pointed out analyses by grubert and others that em phasized the growth in the importance of royalties as share of repatriated earnings for multinationals suggesting that the exploitation of intangible assets by multinationals in foreign locations is increasing however where the grubert and mutti analysis sees this as an important reason to adopt an exemption system crosscreditin g of foreign taxes would longer pose an incentive to lowtax investment under an exemption system kleinbard sees it as liability the growth of intangible s argues kleinbard would place enormous pressure on the administra tion of transfer prices26 proponents of an exemption system conced that it is not perfect but argue that it is at least superior to the highly imperfect system now in existence even this defense however has its shortcomings the most economically attractive aspects of the exemption proposals could in principle be adopted piecemeal and its most distortionary aspects could be left behind specifically more restrictive rules for deducting interest and other costs could be adopted without exempting dividend repatriations from us tax such plan s could enhance economic efficiency more than would the fullblown exemption systems even with these criticisms of

form of separate limitation would require separate limitation to be calculated for each investment firm makes clearly however such policy would present considerable administrative difficultiessubsidiaries whether or not the income is repatriated if it were not for foreign taxes deferrals repeal would move the system to the brink of capital export neutrality except for the portfolio investment cern the tax burden on foreign investment would roughly equal the tax rate on domestic investment foreign taxes however complicate matters and make pure capital export neutrality difficult to achieve in practice the problem arises when foreign host countrys tax rate exceeds the us domestic tax rate in such cases pure capital export neutrality would require an unlimited foreign tax credit foreign taxes would offset us taxes on domestic as well as foreign income only by this mechanism could the high foreign tax burden be brought into line with taxes on domestic investment yet as noted in the preceding section on the existing tax sy stem an unlimited foreign tax credit is impractical foreign governme nts could in effect draw on the us treasury by raising taxes on us investors ad infinitum advocates of residencebased system have in some cases advocated more restrictive form of the foreign tax cr edit limitation that would place more limits on cross crediting than does current laws twopart limit for example at various times in the past the united states has required firms to calculate their limitation on countrybycountry basis socalle d percountry limitation under which taxes paid to one country could not be credite d against us tax on income from another country27 an alternative approach to restricting cross crediting was implemented by the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 which instead of requiring separate limits for each country specified variety of different types of income for which separate limits baskets were required the americ an jobs creation act of 2004 ajca pl 108357 however reduced th number of separate limits to current laws two28 note however that more restrictive foreign tax credit limitation would not necessarily move residenceba sed system closer to pure capital export neutrality as noted above while cross cr editing may pose an incentive to invest in lowtax countries it also mitigates the disin centive to invest in hightax countries capital export neutrality requires equal tax burdens on foreign and domestic investment there are several features of the current system that favor domestic over foreign investment and whose modification would move the current system in the direction of capital export neutrality the most important of these is the 9 tax deduction for domestic production enacted in 2004 by ajca other tax benefits that are restricted to domestic investment are the section 179 expensing allowance for machines and equipment and the research and experimentation tax credit as noted above

would sh ift more of the overall us tax burden on corporations from the corporate to the sh areholder level virtue in the modern world where capital is increasingly mobile since shareholderlevel taxes are generally imposed on residence basis and thus achieve allocative efficiency it is also possible to move towards further restrictions on deferral without eliminating it entirely one such proposal

policy discussions tax havens do not fit n eatly into the traditional cencmnnn evaluation framework outlined above perhaps because the tax haven issue involves as much artificial shifting of income and inve stment as it does questions about how investment is actually allocated to the extent tax havens abet the shifting of income from its true geographic sour ce to lowtax jurisdictions the havens

in versions and expatriation by david l brumbaugh to reduce their us taxes by using tax have ns and to the extent tax havens reduce the tax burden on investment that truly ccurs overseas they also raise the same questions about economic efficiency and neutrality addressed by the traditional framework outlined above tax haven is not precisely defined rm but in most usages it refers to country in many cases small ones where nonresidents can save taxes by conducting various investments transactions and activities attributes that make country successful tax haven include low or nonexistent tax rates applicable to foreigners strict bank nd financial secrecy laws and highly developed communications financial and legal infrastructure at the heart of the tax haven issue is the discrepancy between real economic activity and what is only apparent much of the economic activity that appears to occur in tax havens actually occurs elsewher and is only associated with particular tax haven countries because of sometimes spuri ous relationships between the person or firm conducting the activity and the tax haven country thus for example much or even most of the income reported by uscontrolled subsidiaries chartered in tax havens may well have its true economic location either in some other foreign country or even in the united states itself as an illustration in tax year 2002 us controlled foreign subsidiari chartered in the cayman islands reported 80 billion in beforetax profits the cayman isla nds gdp for the same year was only 19 billion less than quarter of the profits of the us subsidiaries it hosted31 in part us firms may find tax havens useful taxsaving mechanisms because of particular aspects of the us tax structure here illegal tax evasion or even transferprice manipulation ma be necessary to obtain tax savings an example is the technique sometimes termed corporat inversion reorga nization under which the overall parent of corporate group shifts from uschartered entity to foreign corporation organized in an offshore ta x haven the rearrangement can potentially reduce or eliminate us tax that would otherwise be due when foreign income is repatriated32 us firms can also use tax havens to sh ift income out of foreign countries where there are corporate income taxes to the zerotax environment many tax havens offer short of outright tax evasion techniques for shifting income include manipulation of transfer prices affixed to intrafirm sales and other transfers and the structuring of intrafirm lending and in terest charges so as to shift income out of hightax countries to tax havens sometimes ca lled earnings stripping tr ansfer price manipulation can also theoretically be used to shift what is actually ussource income to

tax havens in some cases apparently abet the outright evasion of taxes in some cases by us citizens for example income from illegal activity in the united states can be shielded from us authorities if tax haven offers sufficient bank secrecy or taxes on legally generated us income are apparently evaded in some cases by depositing the income in secrecyprotected foreign bank accounts33 the focus of this report however is the activities of multinational firms so its concern with tax havens is more with legal albeit what some might term abusive income shifting rather than outright tax evasion in part the ability of firms to divert income from other foreign locations to tax havens has implications for the real locati on of investment just because tax haven is not the true source of income does not make the associated tax savings any less real for the underlying investment wherever it may be located we can interpret the effect of tax havens on actual investment in terms of the efficiency framework outlined in previous sections of the report first regarding the allocation of investment between the united states and foreign locations existing data indicate that the united states is relatively hig h tax country even if tax havens are omitted from the calculation34 thus much of the income shifted to tax havens is likely shifted from countries whose taxes are lower than us taxes to begin with as result it is likely that tax havens on balance magnify the distorting effects of deferral thus further diverting us inve stment to foreign locations and in turn reducing economic efficiency and us national welfare this efficiency effect however may be mitigated by reduction in the taxinduced distortion of location decisions across foreign countries35 along with efficiency effects tax vens reduce tax revenue collections by capitalexporting countries in the case of u s firms use of tax havens the revenue loss can accrue both to the united states in the case of income shifted from domestic sources and other countries in the case of income shifted from other countries with higher taxes tax havens likewise have the potential of damaging perceptions of tax fairness

has been the organization for economic cooperation and velopments oecds harmful tax practices project initiated in 1996 the focus of the oecds project has been to identify tax havens and to induce them to increase their transparency presumably reduce secrecy about financial transactions and to increase the number and scope of exchange of tax information agreements with tax havens38 unilateral approach was proposed by the clinton administration with its fy2001 budget proposal the basis of the pl an was to be list of jurisdictions identified by the treasury department as tax havens foreign tax credits and the deferral benefit would be re stricted for taxpayers using the identified tax havens39 more narrow unilateral approaches proposed in the past have primarily involved increasing

according to the statistics of income data assuming 15 rate differential rolling back the provision for dividends would have raised revenues by 156 billion the gain from raising the capital gains tax

would also raise great deal of revenue that could be used to lower corporate tax rates doin g so would also end concerns about using corporations with lower tax rates to shelter income base broadening provisions might be consider ed it could be feasible to lower the corporate tax rate to 25 with relatively modest changes in tax rules41 lower us corporate tax is desirable if one believes that the most serious distortion in the international tax system is the tendency of capital to flow to lowtax foreign jurisdictions because of deferral such proposition is reasonable one as the united states
