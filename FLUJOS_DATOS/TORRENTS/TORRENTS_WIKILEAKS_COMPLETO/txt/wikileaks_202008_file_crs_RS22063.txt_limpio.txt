aeronautics and space administration nasa was created by the 1958 national aeronautics and space act pl 85568 nasa conducts civilian space and aeronautics activities nasa opened its doors on october 1 1958 almost exactly one year after the soviet union ushered in the space age with the launch of the worlds first satellite sputnik on october 4 1957 in the more than 47 years since nasa has conducted far reaching programs in human and robotic spaceflight technology development and scientific research dr michael griffin is the administrator of nasa the agency is managed from nasa headquarters in washington dc links to nasas four mission directorates aeronautics research exploration systems science and space operations and individual nasa programs are at httpwwwhqnasagovhqorghtml nasa has nine

160704 million appropriated in the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act adjusted for the rescission nasa also received 126 million in fy2005 supplemental for hurricane relief giving it total of 161964 million for fy2005 the fy2006 request was 16 more than that total nasa substantially changed its budget structure again in the fy2006 request see footnotes to table 1 nasa submitted budget

house and senate bills and committee reports note totals may not add due to rounding some of the fields are blank because the committee bills and reports do not provide requisite data in the fy2006 request science incorporates the former space science and earth science line items b in the fy2006 request biological and physical research became part of exploration systems crs3 c in the fy2006 request funding for exploration systems was moved into the sae account figures in this column are from nasas initial operating plan iop and are not final several operating plan updates have been submitted but are not in budget format compatible with the fy2006 budget does not reflect acrosstheboard rescissions or hurricanerelated augmentations the fy2005 totals for the sae and exploration capabilities accounts are different from those in the table included in nasas fy2006 budget justification documents because omb shows the shift of exploration systems from one account to the other the nasa table uses the fy2006 budget structure without showing that trace hence the omb data are used in this report the final version of the nasa authorization act does not cover fy2006 only fy20072008 nasas fy2006 funding is combination of 16456 billion provided in the fy2006 science state justice commerce ssjc appropriations act pl 109108 minus 028 acrosstheboard rescission in that act minus 1 acrosstheboard rescission in the fy2006 department of defense appropriations and hurricane recovery act pl 109148 plus 350 million added for nasa for hurricane recovery in pl 109 148 the conference report on the ssjc appropriations bill hr 2862 hrept 109272 has net increase of 500000 164568 million compared with the 164563 million request among the increases above the request are 280 million for congressionally directed priorities 60 million for aeronautics 50 million for the hubble servicing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22063 mission 30 million for the glory earth science mission 20 million for

million for the space grant program 10 million for the space interferometry mission 10 million for the institute for scientific research 82 million for epscor 5 million for heavy lift launch vehicle and 5 million for the living with star solarterrestrial physics program among the decreases are 200 million from project prometheus 90 million general reduction from the science aeronautics and exploration account 34 million from the centennial challenges program 26 million from corporate ga expenses 25 million from exploration research and technology 25 million from human systems research and technology 25 million from the discovery program 15 million from optical communications 80 million from the international space station including 60 million from the iss crewcargo services line 10 million from space communications and 10 million generally from the exploration capabilities account congress also passed fy20072008 nasa authorization act pl 109155 in 2005 it authorizes 179 billion for fy2007 and 187 billion for fy2008 since the final version does not cover fy2006 funding its funding provisions are not discussed further in this report nasa submitted budget amendment on july 15 2005 that reflected in part its decision to move two programs into the exploration systems line iss crewcargo services 168 million was moved from the international space station and the lunar robotic exploration program 135 million was moved from the science mission directorate the total amount requested for the agency for fy2006 was the same as the original request other changes were made within those accounts in the budget amendment and in updates to nasas fy2005 operating plan see crs report rl32988 separately two nasa facilities in or near new orleans were damaged by hurricane katrina the stennis space center and the michoud assembly facility operated for nasa by lockheed martin nasa estimates that it will cost 760 million to repair damages and relocate staff the agency shifted 100 million in fy2005 funds crs4 to begin hurricane recovery efforts the administration requested 3248 million for nasa for hurricane relief the fy2006 dod appropriations and hurricane recovery act pl 109148 increased that to 350 million president bushs vision for space exploration on january 14 2004 president george w bush announced new vision for space exploration directing nasa to focus its efforts on returning humans to the moon by 2020 and someday sending them to mars and worlds beyond the vision involves both robotic and human space missions and other countries were invited to participate for more information see crs report rs21720 the president proposed adding only 1 billion to nasas fiveyear fy20052009 budget for the vision the remainder of the required funding is to be redirected from other nasa activities for example by terminating the space shuttle program in 2010 and ending us use of the international space station in 2016 at the time of the speech nasa issued sand chart with projected nasa budgets through fy2020 but did not offer cost estimate for the vision later in 2004 nasa stated that returning humans to the moon would cost 64 billion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22063 2003 dollars for fy2004fy2020 not including robotic probes cost estimate for sending people to mars was not provided under the vision nasa is to develop new spacecraft the crew exploration vehicle cev to take astronauts to and from the moon with an earthorbit capability by 2014 on september 19 2005 nasa released its implementation plan for the vision setting goal of having the cev ready by 2012 and estimating the cost of returning humans to the moon at 104 billion through 2018 that figure does not include another 20 billion for using the cev to service the international space station the presidents speech came almost one year after the space shuttle columbia tragedy that killed seven astronauts see crs report rs21408 one of the conclusions of the chairman of the columbia accident investigation board caib harold gehman was that the nation needs an agreed vision that nasa can execute president bushs announcement initiated the process of finding an agreed vision whether or not consensus has emerged is debatable supporters point to gallup polls in 2004 and 2005 that showed strong public support but others note that the polls were sponsored by the coalition for space exploration group of companies and organizations that support the vision httpwwwspacecoalitionorg supporters also point to congressional action funding the vision as an endorsement congressional committees however have stressed that while they agree with the moonmars goal they also think nasa should maintain balanced set of program including science and aeronautics not focus specifically on human exploration nasas fy2006 appropriations act pl109108 cut the following visionrelated programs 25 million from each of the two exploration systems research and technology subaccounts all 34 million from centennial challenges to award prizes for innovative technological developments and 200 million from project prometheus to develop space nuclear power and propulsion conferees added 5 million for heavy lift launch vehicle the fy20072008 nasa authorization act pl 109155 specifies that beginning in fy2007 nasa is to use budget structure that separates exploration systems from science aeronautics and education that would make it more difficult for nasa to shift funds from the latter programs into the moonmars human exploration program crs5 key congressional issues the relative priority of nasa in the federal budget with the current emphasis on cutting spending to reduce the federal budget deficit and the funding requirements associated with hurricane recovery some may question the amount of money proposed for nasa in fy2006 and beyond space program advocates often cite the small percentage of federal budget authority that is allocated to nasa 07 in fy2005 as an indication that it is not significant factor in the nations overall spending the coalition for space exploration points out that benefits accrue from space exploration in terms of stimulating children to study math and science and driving invention which supports robust economy skeptics counter that spending more than 16 billion on nasa is luxury when many domestic discretionary programs are being cut and federal rd spending overall is not keeping pace with inflation the relative priority of the vision versus other nasa activities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22063 funding the presidents plan calls for most of the funding for the vision to come from redirecting spending from other nasa activities in the 2004 sand chart discussed earlier the programs that are not included in the vision were labeled aeronautics and other science programs funding for those activities including aeronautics earth science and certain space science programs was shown as remaining flat through fy2020 advocates of those programs worried that funding for their research would suffer nasa administrator griffin who assumed office in april 2005 stated that he would not take funds from space science earth science or aeronautics programs to pay for the vision although he is cutting funding for life and materials sciences research that was to be conducted aboard the iss the committee reports accompanying the house and senate nasa appropriations bills and the fy20072008 nasa authorization act pl 109155 express support for the vision but as part of balanced program that includes science and aeronautics it should be noted that current budget constraints at nasa are due not only to the need to fund the vision but also to cost growth in existing nasa programs including several science missions the cost of returning the space shuttle to flight status and the need to fund congressionally directed items workforce and institutional issues funding for various nasa activities also will affect nasa workforce levels nasa officials insist that there are plans to close any nasa centers however nasas fy2006 budget request assumed that the number of budgeted civil service full time equivalents ftes would drop from 19227 in fy2005 to 16738 by the end of fy2006 how to right size nasa its facilities and its workforce and ensure nasa has the necessary skill mix for the vision are among the issues facing congress the fy2006 appropriations act that includes nasa pl 109 108 restricts nasas use of buyouts and reductions in force rifs prior to nasa providing certain reports to congress the fy20072008 nasa authorization act pl109155 prohibits rifs or other involuntary separations except for cause prior to march 16 2007 crs6 the future of the space shuttle and international space station the vision calls for the space shuttle fleet to be retired in 2010 when iss construction is expected to be completed nasa administrator griffin emphasizes his intention to meet that deadline placing fixed termination date on the shuttle system however may create schedule pressure similar to what the caib found to have contributed to the columbia accident see crs report rs21408 one alternative is to fly the shuttle until replacement is available another is to specify how many more shuttle flights are needed and continue the system until those requirements are met whenever that is the fy20072008 nasa authorization act pl 109155 states that it is us policy to possess the capability for human access to space on continuous basis and directs the nasa administrator to make number of related reports to congress in future years president bush directed nasa to build the cev which will replace the shuttle so that it would be available by 2014 dr griffin hopes to accelerate that to 2012 thereby reducing the gap between the end of the shuttle and availability of the cev during such gap the united states would be dependent on russia to take american crews to and from iss httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22063 nasa officials have indicated that nasa plans to complete its use of the iss in 2016 under the vision the only us research that would be conducted on iss is that needed to fulfill the vision nasa is downscaling its iss research plan accordingly nasa spends about 2 billion year on iss in addition to the costs of the shuttle program some question whether iss is worth that investment considering the modest research opportunities that remain others want to restore the iss research program to what was previously planned nasa is building iss in partnership with canada japan russia and 10 european countries fulfilling us commitments to those partners may be sufficient rationale for continued us involvement the fy20072008 nasa authorization act pl 109155 directs that 15 of iss research spending be used for non visionrelated research the final fy2006 appropriations act that includes nasa pl109108 cut 80 million from the iss program the future of the hubble space telescope two days after the presidents vision speech nasa announced that it would not use the shuttle to conduct further servicing missions to the hubble space telescope see crs report rs21767 thenadministrator sean okeefe cited shuttle safety concerns as the primary reason widespread criticism led nasa to explore the possibility of robotic servicing mission december 2004 report from the national research council however concluded that robotic servicing mission was not likely to succeed in the time available in the fy2006 request nasa requested money only for deorbit mission to ensure that hubble reenters from orbit without posing danger to populated areas dr griffin pledged to revisit the shuttle servicing decision after the shuttle completes its two return to flight mission the fy2006 appropriations act that includes nasa pl 109 108 added 50 million for hubble servicing mission which the accompanying conference report hrept 109272 said would bring the total available for hubble in fy2006 to 271 million
