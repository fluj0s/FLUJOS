rl32342 nato and the european union by kristin archick and paul gallis introduction the nato summit in riga latvia on n ovember 2829 2006 focused primarily on consolidation of support for existing initiatives above all key allies sought to ensure that member states demonstrate the political will to provide the troops and financing necessary to bring afghanistan to stability expected to require five years or more closely associated with the nato mission in afghanistan was discussion of military capabilities natos transfo rmation involves policies in tended to enhance capabilities develop multinational in itiatives and cooperation to solve or deter interna tional conflicts and find funding mechanisms to ensure an appropriate sharin g of the burden among member and partner states third theme of the summit was the evolving role of partnerships some allies ve doubts about new rounds of largement partnerships are in part means to develop closer associa tion with nonmember governments that play substantial role in the international community operations the effort to stabilize afghanistan is natos most important mission natos international security assistance force isa f in place

member states the mission has distinctly broa der international signature as it operates under resolution and includes important nonnato states such as australia and japan transformation also involves new capabilities such as more deployable forces and multinational formations using advanced co mmunications and combat technologies all evident in afghanistan2 there is growing sense of anxiety in th alliance about afghanistans future taliban insurgency is underway at time when public support for the government of president hamid karzai appears to be waning due to corruption and ineffective policies for nato some observers believe that there is an inherent tension in simultaneously undertaking combat mission and stab ilization and reconstruction effort nato secretary general hoop sc heffer has said that there is military solution the answer is development nati onbuilding of roads schools3 he has repeatedly urged international donors to meet their pledges of assistance the central element of isafs stabilization effort is the provincial reconstruction team prt of which nato operates 24 ar ound the country prts consist of civil military teams that provide security and undertake reconstruction projects such as the building of roads and hospitals in addition they support regional officials sent by the karzai government to extend the authority of kabul the success of isaf may depend upon the ability of the karzai government nd its successors to develop good governance in country that has long known corruption violent tribal competition for territory and resources and minimal central authority afgh anistans vigorous nd growing narcotics trade centered around poppy farms and heroin pr oduction is an additional factor that the international community must ove rcome to stabilize the country nato currently has 37000 troops in isaf of which approximately 17000 are from the united states the bulk of whom are in the south fighting taliban and warlord insurgency nato commanders have asked memb er states for more troops to quell the insurgency but governments have been reluct ant to send more combat troops in part due to public concern over casualties which have been incr easing and over availability of troops as some governments such as ital and france have substantial contingents committed to peace operations in banon kosovo and elsewhere national caveats are impeding isafs mission some governments place strictures on how and where their forces may be used for example the german parliament prohibits the countrys isaf contingent fro m going outside relatively stable northern afghanistan where they are located they cannot be used in more restive parts of the country some governments restrict the use of certain types of equipment at night there is

their caveats their forces may now fight where needed in afghanistan timeliness however remains an issue if there is an urgent need for such forces will the french or italian commander first call paris or rome to obtain permission to move their forces into harms way germany refused to lift its caveats4 nato has operations in other distant theaters that are testing the allies political will and military capabilities kfor kosovo force in kosovo has been in place since 1999 under imprimatur kfor is charged with maintaining secure environment supporting an in ternational civil administration and controlling ethnic violence the international community is seeking to resolv kosovos final status likely to be form of independence from serbia but any solution is unlikely to be fully embraced by the kosovo albanians and the serb minority in such circumstances nato forces now numbering 17000 may remain in so form for period of time5 nato has other operations as well nat supports the african union mission in darfur to protect refugees with assistance in training logistics and intelligence the allies have small training mission inside and outside iraq for that countrys military officers one other mission active endeavor is counterterror effort in the mediterranean that controls shipping traffic in the search for weapons of mass destruction capabilities at riga the allies declared the nato re sponse force nrf fully operational the nrf has 2000025000 soldiers supplied on rotation by member governments in high readiness state the nrf is an insertion force able to reach its destination within 530 days one of its key characteristics is flexibility nato can create nrf packages sized for example for humanitarian assistance na val operations or high intensity conflict on land the allies did not resolve the issue of what types of missions the nrf should engage some believe that it should be used only for combat others favor such missions as humanitarian assistance the nrf has brought to the forefront the emerging issue of how to fund nato operations nato now operate s under the principle of costs lie where they fall meaning that governments that send troops to an operation pay for their own troops because spain was leading the nrf on rota tion during the pakistani earthquake madrid bore costs substantially dispropor tionate to those of other allied governments the current system of paying for operations is theref ore disincentive for some governments to participate in ddition so nato members such as iceland luxembourg and belgium have or minimal armed forces larger states tend to bear much of the burden for operations the bush administration and several other allies ve proposed that all governments bear proportional cost of ope rations and that some equipment be bought and maintained jointly by the alliance at riga the allies were unable to agree to common funding for the nrfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22529crs4 6 riga summit declaration nov 29

af ghanistan joint use of such forces can be difficult given the differing signatures th at different governments give such units6 nato and its partners as part of natos transformation the allies are engaging countries that see similar threats and have the political will to contribute to security this development is in part the result of the emergence of terrorism and wmd proliferation as global threats and in part the result of concerted acti on by the alliance to persuade nonmember governments that there is much to be gained from closer consultation and joint operations us officials wish to see nato become platform for allies to work together to meet common needs in concert with interna tional organizations such as the and the eu and nonmember states7 this effort is most evident in afghanistan where non member states such as austra lia new zealand and japan have contributed forces or lead provincial reconstruction teams it is also evident in natos operation active endeavor the counterterror and counterprolif eration operation in the mediterranean noted above not all nato governments are enthusiastic about the partnership program some governments for example wish to limit israels association with nato they rule out the possibility of contemplating eventual membership for israel in the alliance as long as the arabisraeli conflict endur some governments also believe that the idea of advanced partnerships brings israel and some partnership for peace states with authoritarian governments such as kazakhstan too close to the alliance some also believe that the partnership program dilutes the atlantic nature of the alliance8 there was surprise development in the partnership for peace program at riga the bush administration had long opposed serbia s entry into pfp until

capabilities development of the concept of partnership and extensive traini ng missions in range of nonmember states have absorbed resources and energy in ddition more attention to political discussions is evident at nato the allies meet with energy specialists to explore enhancement of energy security and routinely discuss the threats posed by iran and north korea energy security is clearly an emerging issue in the alliance protection of vulnerable pipelines in such countries as nigeria and kazakhstan or escorting oil tankers in time of conflict are matters under discussion among several allied gove rnments senator lugar has proposed that energy security become an article v mission10 iran at the same time consensus is lacking on such issues some allies believe that the united states and the eu3 and not nato should manage the attempt to limit irans nuclear program or that energy security is an issue best left to market forces and managed through the european union11 enlargement enlargement of the alliance remains an issue of debate representative tanner and sena tor lugar have introduced bills hr 987 and s 494 respectively that endorse further enlargement of nato the bills state the principle that nato remains open to qualifie d candidates encourage the three candidate states albania croatia and macedonia to continue to work to qualify for membership and note the interest in georgia and ukraine to one da gain membership the bills underscore the need for candidate and other interested g overnments to meet the qualifications for membership by some accounts each of the three candida states has recently slipped somewhat in its efforts to make substantial progress in its membership action plan map which requires candidates to modern ize their militaries limit corruption develop strong rule of law and achieve other obj ectives although some us officials have recently given alternative possible dates for croatias entry as 2008 or 2009 others note that

ments has made cons iderable progress in establishing important democra tic institutions in the past decade changes of government have been orderly the governments par ticipate in important nato missions such as in afghanistan and the leaders of the th ree governments and most opposition parties strongly desire both nat and eu membership some european allies wish to move slowly on further enlargement in the european union there is clearly enlargement fatigu as member governments wonder whether new round of enlargement might dilute the identity of the union complicate decision making and shake prospects for economic gr owth the issues in nato are somewhat different clearly decisionmaking in nato has become more complicated as membership has grown from sixteen to twentysix states in less than decade other issues pose greater problems such as relations with and sharing of defense resources with the european union or finding cl ear consensus on nato missions now built increasingly around political objectives such as stabilization and reconstruction as in afghanistan in addition to the traditional mission of collective defense equally problematic for the europeans is the consideration of two prospective candidate states ukraine and the republic of georgia earlier in 2006 the bush administration considered proposing to the allie s that both countries be advanced to the map process some european allies such as germany and france do not wish to damage relations with russia by consider ation of ukraine and georgia or rapid advancement of those countries in the partnership process such as participation in map ukraine has large russian populati on and great economic potential that moscow does not wish to see wrested from its sphere there is division in ukraine over possible membership in nato the current prime nister opposes his countrys membership step effectively removing the country from nearterm consideration for path to membership georgia has two border and ethnic conflicts sometimes aggressively fueled by russia that give the tblisi government pronounced strategic problems the allies offered georgia an intensifi ed dialogue in early 2006 m odest but clear way station on the course to map and possible ev entual consideration for membership13 congressional action congress held broad range of hearin gs in the 109th congress on nato issues such as the conflict in afghanistan nato partnerships capabilities and political will in the alliance to counter the threats of terrorism and prolifer ation such oversight hearings are again likely in the 110th congress in particular it is possible that congress will debate the level of us and allied forces in afghanistan and what types of financial and developmental assistance are n ecessary to stabilize the country nato and energy security remains an emerging issue senator lugar and others introduced bill s 2435 on energy security in march 2006 hearings were held and there may be similar interest in such bill in the 110th congress in addition he introduced bill on nato enlargement the nato freedom consolidation act of 2006 s 4014 which passed the nate action was taken in the house as noted above in the discussion of enlargement tw bills are now before congress on the issue
