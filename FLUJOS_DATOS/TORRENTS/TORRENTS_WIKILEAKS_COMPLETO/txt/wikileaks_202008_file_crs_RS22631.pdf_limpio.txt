particularly socalled system ofsystems sos acquisition program1 lsis can have broad responsibility for executing their programs and may perform some or all of the following functions requirements generation technology development source selection construction or modification work procurement of systems or components from and management of supplier firms testing validation and administration 2 section 805 of the fy2006 national defense authorization act3 defines two types of lsis 1 lead system integrators with system responsibilityprime contractors who develop major systems 4 that are not expected at the time of the cont ract award as determined by the secretary of defense to perform substantial portion of the work on the system and major subsystems and 2 lead system integrators without system responsibilitycontractors who perform acquisition functions that are closely associated with inherently governmental functions in the development of major system lsis regardless of type are subject to the same rules as other federal contractors 5 1 an sos program is aimed at acquiring collection of various platforms ie ground vehicles aircraft and ships that are to be linked together by computer networking technology so as to create larger integrated overall system refer to lane joann and boehm barry systemofsystem cost estimation analysis of lead system integrator engineering activities intersymposium 2006 the international institute for advanced studies in systems research and cybernetics at httpsunsetuscedupu blicationstechrpts 20062006_mainhtml 2 generating program requirements is an important process in defining the mission scope and direction of major defense acquisition program source selection means the solicitation evaluation and hiring of subcontractors to work under the supervision of the lsi lsis manage the procurement of all systems and components including the construction and modification of such systems the testing of systems by validating their appropriateness and interoperability and by performing functions usually undertaken by contracting or other acquisition officials 3 hr 1815pl 109163 4 major systems are defined in the act as systems for which the total expenditures for research development test and evaluation rdte are estimated to be more than 155 million or for which the total amount projected for procurement is estimated to be more than 710 million 5 section 805 required dod to submit re port to congress on the use of lsis for the acquisition of major systems as result dod conducted survey to determine how many contractors met the two definitions in section 805 of 60 contracts reviewed dod determined that 39 fell within the scope of some but not all of the requirements of the first definition and that 21 contractors met the requirements of the second definition report to congress section 805 of the national defense authorization act for fy2006 use of lead system integrators in the acquisition of major systems office

limitations on contractors acting as lsis the director of of defense procurement and acquisition policy has stated that only contractors who have direct financial interest in the development or production of an individual system or element of an sos will be eligible for contract award as an lsi report to congress section 805 of the national defense authorization act for fy2007 use of lead

examples of programs being executed with lsis include the armys future combat system fcs and the coast guards deepwater acquisition program both of which are multibillion dollar sos acquisition programs6 the lsi for the fcs program is partnership between boeing and science applications international corporation saic the lsi for the deepwater program is integrated coast guard systems icgs joint venture between northrop grumman and lockheed martin both of these programs have experienced problems among them costs and schedule overruns and have been the subject of multiple congressional oversight hearings g20g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g142g561g8g152g155g561g23g156g146g151g144g561g14g21g11g156g561 in recent years federal agencies like the department of defense dod have turned to the lsi concept in large part because they have determined that they lack the inhouse technical and projectmanagement expertise needed to execute large complex acquisition programs it is not altogether clear what all of the reasons are for this insufficient expertise determination some possible reasons for the lack of inhouse expertise may include the downsizing of the dod acquisition workforce and the increase in the size and scope of dod procurement activities dod states that its acquisition workforce was reduced by more than 50 percent between 1994 and 2005 7 the lack of sufficient inhouse expertise could also result from the growing complexity of the systems being acquired supporters of lsis argue that lsi arrangements can promote better technical in novation and overall system optimization this is largely because privatesector firms often have better knowledge and expertise when compared to federal government agencies of rapidly developing commercial technologies that can be used to achieve the governments program mission and objectives

assume the lsi role for the deepwater program9 media reports stated that the department of justice is investigating parts of the deepwater program10 problems with the fcs and deepwater programs have raised concerns regarding the use of privatesector lsis for executing large complex defense acquisition programs given the size scope and costs associated with the fcs program congress mandated that dod hold an fcs milestone review following the preliminary design review scheduled for 2009 since the inception of the fcs program gao has performed audits of the programs cost schedule and performance one of gaos concerns was that the actual performance of the completely integrated fcs will be demonstrated very late in the program and could result in significant cost increase to the government congressional hearings on the deepwater program have raised number of oversight issues the dod inspector general ig reported on the increased deepwater costs due to design deficiencies and mismanagement and raised questions about lack of accountability and responsibility on the part of the lsi and coast guard management also the defense acquisition university has questioned the overall deepwater lsi approach and recommended fundamental changes to the program including revised acquisition strategy that does not rely on single industry entity or contract to produce or support all or the majority of us coast guard capabilities 11 g22g155g138g151g156g153g138g155g142g151g140g162g561 some observers have expressed concern that lsi arrangements can result in the government having insufficient visibility into many program aspects such as program costs optimization studies conducted by lsis for determining the mix of systems to be acquired lsi sourceselection procedures and overall system performance in an lsi arrangement the federal government has contractual relationship with the lsi prime contractor not with any subcontractors that report to the prime contractor lack of transparency in these areas can make it more difficult for the federal agency or congress to adequately manage and conduct effective oversight of an acquisition program also this lack of transparency could potentially increase the risk of cost overruns schedule slippage poor product quality and inadequate system performance given the threeyear rotation cycle of most senior military officers combined with dods decreased amount of inhouse technical expertise observers are concerned that the governments ability to make independent assessments of programs being executed by lsis has been reduced any difficulty in independently assessing an lsis performance in executing program could continued gao08638t april 10 2008 p 9 9 merle renae and hsu spencer coast guard to take over

some observers have expressed concern that lsi arrangements can create conflicts of interest for an lsi in areas such as determining system requirements and soliciting evaluating and hiring contractors they are concerned that an lsi might tailor system requirements to fit the lsis own products or that in selecting source for system or component the lsi might favor one of its own subsidiaries or favored supplier firm over other potential suppliers favoring some contractors over others could increase the governments costs or reduce technical innovation particularly if more innovative solution offere d by another firm would compete with core business line of the lsi g21g142g149g143g556g140g142g155g157g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561 some observers have expressed concern that lsi arrangements can result in lsis certifying that their own work has met contractual requirements for the program such selfcertification these observers argue can equate to real certification in particular the selfcertification issue has been raised in connection with the deepwater program earlier this year philip teel president of northrop grumman ship systems testified that self certification did not take place except in some foreign contracts 12 g20g142g556g140g152g150g153g142g157g146g151g144g561g14g21g11g561g20g152g149g142g561 acquisition programs being executed with lsis can span over many years although the role of the lsi in such program can be recompeted every few years some observers are concerned that in practice it would be very difficult for an outside firm to successfully challenge an incumbent lsi that has managed program for several years the incumbents greater knowledge of the program and the potential disruptions to the program that might be caused by switching to new lsi would likely pose barrier to another contractors ability to take over the program this could make it difficult for the government to terminate program as result these observers argue the government may have little real ability or leverage to use periodic recompetition to improve the performance of the lsi in longterm acquisition program

successor programs observers are concerned that if an lsimanaged sos program is central to the future capabilities of the military service in question as is the case for the fcs and deepwater programs

regarding how and when lsis might be used in acquisition programs are listed below some of these options could be combined reduce the possible need for lsis by pursuing separate procurement programs rather than sos programs require that certain conditions be met before privatesector lsi can be used on an acquisition program analogous to conditions set for use of the multiyear procurement program require that lsi arrangements include features to ensure transparency prevent conflicts of interest prohibit selfcertification require independent assessments and facilitate meaningful periodic competitions of the lsi role13 institute additional or stricter reporting requirements for programs being executed by lsis require dod and other federal agencies to share lessons learned regarding
