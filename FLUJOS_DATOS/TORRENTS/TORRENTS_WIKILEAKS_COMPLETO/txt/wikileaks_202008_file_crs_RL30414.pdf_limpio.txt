the primary way to reduce the nations growth in co2 emissions as result it occupies prominent role in proposals to curb future emissions the clinton administrations 1993 climate change action plan ccap sought to stabilize year 2000 emissions at the 1990 level global recognition that year 2000 stabilization would not be achieved led to the 1997 united nations framework convention on climate change third conference of parties cop3 in kyoto japan where new emission reduction targets were proposed for 20082012 subsequently the clinton administrations climate change technology initiative ccti proposed increased energy efficiency research and development spending tax credits and other policies to promote energy efficiency to curb emissions debate has emerged over estimates of the potential for energy efficiency to further slow the growth of co2 emissions the department of energy issued report by five national laboratories entitled scenarios of us carbon reductions potential impacts of energy technologies by 2010 and beyond also known as the fivelab study it projects that energy efficiency technology combined with permit price of 50 per ton of carbon could bring 2010 emissions to level just below the 1990 stabilization level the fivelab study projects that energy efficiency could account for 50 to 90 of the projected emissions reduction in 2010 this contribution would be achieved through an interaction between higher energy costs due to carbon permit prices that range up to 50ton of carbon and choice of response options that include substitution of lower carbon fuels and promotion of more energy efficient equipment however the energy information administration eia issued critique of the fivelab study entitled impacts of the kyoto protocol on us energy markets and economic activity eia finds problems with key doe assumptions about new energyefficient technologies which include increased performance and lower costs for new technologies new unspecified government policies that promote adoptio n into the market and greater propensity by consumers to buy them than they have shown in the past eia further criticizes the fivelab study for assuming an aggressive rd program and 19 annual economic growth rate which is 10 lower than eias assumption of 22 rate moreover eia says the fivelab study enduse models likely include some double counting of emission reductions also there is debate over the analysis of actual co2 emission reductions from past energy efficiency measures in this case methodological issues are at the core of disagreements between the general accounting office gao and the environmental protection agency epa about the best way to assess emission savings from epas various energy efficiency programs federal

conversion device such as household appliance automobile engine or steam turbine undergoes technical change that enables it to provide the same service lighting heating motor drive while using less energy1 energy efficiency is often viewed as resource option like coal oil or natural gas it provides additional economic value by preserving the resource base and reducing pollution energy security major driver of federal energy efficiency programs in the past is now somewhat less of an issue on the other hand worldwide emphasis on environmental problems of air and water pollution and global climate change have emerged as important drivers of support for energy efficiency policies and programs also energy efficiency is seen as technology strategy to improve the competitiveness of usmade appliances cars and other energyusing equipment in world markets the clinton administration views energy efficiency as the flagship of its energy policy for global climate change and other environmental reasons from 1975 through 1985 high energy prices served as strong catalyst to improved energy efficiency2 however the sharp drop in oil and other energy prices that began in 1986 has dampened the impact of prices on energy efficiency improvements federal policies and programs have also made significant contribution to improved energy efficiency3 one such program is does energy efficiency rd program which employs technologypush strategy that is it produces new evermore efficient technologies that form basis for new products and services in the private sector in contrast epas energy star programs employ marketpull strategy wherein businesses institutions and consumers are encouraged to buy more energyefficient equipment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30414crs2 4 this topic is discussed in crs issue brief ib10020 energy efficiency budget climate change and electricity restructuring issues 5 the trace gases include chlorofluorocarbons cfcs methane and nitrous oxidethe role of energy prices and the environmental benefits of energy efficiency often lead to discussion about barriers and market failures however the resultant debate over the effectiveness of market forces to stimulate energy efficiency and the merit of federal policies and programs that support energy efficiency is not the focus of this report4 instead this paper is focused on the projected contribution of energy efficiency to reducing co2 emissions energy efficiency is proposed as costeffective and reliable means for reducing the nations growth in co2 emissions due to fossil fuel use recognition of that potential has led to high expectations for the control of future co2 emissions through even more energy efficiency improvements than have occurred through past programs regulation and price effects thus in recent context of low energy prices and rising fossil fuel use the clinton administration has proposed increased government support for energy efficiency programs as its primary initiative to reduce emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gasesthat may cause global climate change however there is debate over projected estimates of the future potential for energy efficiency to curb the growth of co2 emissions through 2010 this paper discusses this debate which is centered on differences between key reports by the department of energy doe and the energy information administration eia doe report by five of its research laboratories projects that further gains in energy efficiency could be the largest future contributor to co2 emissions reduction however eia has criticized the doe reports assumptions about the character of future energy efficiency measures economic growth rates future government rd policies and market adoption of energy efficiency measures the paper also describes debate over the analysis of actual co2 emission reductions from past energy efficiency measures in this case methodological issues are at the core of disagreements between the general accounting office gao and the environmental protection agency epa about the best way to assess emission savings from epas various energy efficiency programs finally the paper notes that federal efforts to curb global climate change through increased energy efficiency may be affected by number of issues being debated by congress including program appropriations new tax incentives and legislation on electricity restructuring energy use impact on global climate change wherever energy efficiency and conservation measures reduce fossil fuel use they will reduce carbon dioxide co2

intensification of the natural greenhouse effect that otherwise moderates earths climate excess co2 is the major contributor to this effect the influence of humaninduced emissions on the greenhouse effect is subject of continuing research and controversy6 us use of fossil energy coal oil natural gas currently produces about onefourth of the worlds co2 emissions since 1988 the federal government has accelerated programs that study the science of global climate change and created programs aimed at mitigating fossil fuelgenerated carbon dioxide co2 and other humangenerated emissions the federal government has funded programs for energy efficiency as co2 mitigation measure at doe epa the agency for international development aid and the world bank the latter two agencies have received funding for energy efficiencyrelated climate actions through foreign operations appropriations bills7 efforts to study greenhouse gas emissions and to devise programs to reduce them accelerated after the 1992 united nations conference on environment and development unced concluded with the signing of the rio declaration agenda 21 an action program and the framework convention on climate change unfccc agenda 21 promotes the development transfer and use of improved energyefficient technologies the application of economic and regulatory means that account for environmental and other social costs and other energy efficiencyrelated measures the united states ratified the unfccc in 1992 and the convention entered into force in 1994 the unfccc calls for each nation to develop strategy for emissions reduction inventory emissions and promotion of energy and other technologies that reduce emissions energy efficiency and energy use increased energy efficiency of combustion and other fuelusing equipment has long record of reducing the rate of growth in fossil fuel use and thereby reducing carbon emissions this improvement is reflected in the ratio of us energy use to gross domestic product gdp which fell from 19750 british thermal units btus per dollar in 1971 to14040 btus per dollar in 19868 this represents an average annual reduction of 181 in the energygdp ratio for the period from 1972 to 1986 energy efficiency improvements cut energy use by 30 or 32 quadrillion btus per year9 by 1988 recognition of this accomplishment had led to focus on energy efficiency programs as key strategy for future control of co2 emissionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30414crs4 10 eia monthly energy review december 1999 table110 p 17 11 eia electric power annual 1998 volume ii december 1999 table

slowed the energygdp ratio declined from 14040 btus per dollar in 1986 to 12480 btus per dollar in 1998 but this represents an average annual reduction of 085 which is less than half the rate for 1972 to 1986 further the decline in oil prices since the mid1980s has led to historically low gasoline prices which in turn encouraged motorists to buy less fuelefficient automobiles such as sport utility vehicles and to increase travel by about 2410 overall national petroleum use for transportation grew 21 or 43 q during this period also since 1994 electric utility industry restructuring at the state level caused utility spending for energy efficiency to fall 48 by 1998 and the resultant rate of energy savings fell 20 from 1996 to 199811 meanwhile coal use for electricity production grew 33 from 1986 to 199812 thus despite the increase in efficiency as measured by btu total fossil fuel use has been rising steadily due to low energy prices economic growth and population growth this growth includes oil and coal which are the most intense emitters of carbon dioxide co2 as result co2 emissions have been rising eclipsing the 1993 clinton administration climate change action plan ccap goal of reducing emissions to the 1990 level by 2000 in fact energy information administration eia projections show fossil energy use and emissions increases continuing through 201013 carbon emissions reduction and energy efficiency climate change action plan ccap in 1993 the clinton administration launched climate change action plan ccap that sought to stabilize year 2000 co2 emissions at the 1990 level of 1346 million metric tons of carbon mmtc to achieve this goal the plan relied primarily on voluntary measures for increasing energy efficiency variety of ccap programs were funded at doe epa and other agencies but at levels well below budget requests the nation clearly did not reach the year 2000 stabilization goal instead emissions rose to 1485 mmtc in 1998 and are projected to reach 1552 mmtc in 2000 which would be 206 mmtc or 15 increase above the 1990 level kyoto protocols target for 2010 by 1995 growing worldwide recognition of the difficulty in reaching year 2000 stabilization led to meetings of the conference of parties to the unfccc to set enforceable targets for emission reductions for the post2000 period this effort culminated in december 1997 where the third conference of parties cop3 met in kyoto japan to set years 20082012 targets for emission reductionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30414crs5 14 for more details about the kyoto protocol see the crs

change reducing greenhouse gases how much and from what baseline by larry parker and john blodgett the 1997 kyoto protocol calls for 1 the united states to reduce by 7 from baseline years 1990 for co2 the average annual tons of carbon equivalent released by six greenhouse gases during the period 2008 to 2012 2 implementation through market mechanisms such as international joint implementation and emissions trading schemes and 3 encouragement of clean energy development in developing countries however critics maintain that the protocol does not require developing nations to meaningfully participate in the emission reduction effort this is major barrier to administration goals and senate ratification and that is fostering additional negotiations before the administration will seek senate ratification of the protocol14 inventories of co2 emissions are fairly well established and account for about 85 of the total carbonequivalent emissions from all six greenhouse gases in addition to using energy efficiency and other means to curb co2 emissions from energy production co2 can be sequestered through reforestation and other carbon sinks due to the way sinks are counted and due to other provisions in the protocol the actual reduction of us greenhouse emissions required to meet the kyoto target may be less than 7 below the 1990 co2 baseline the uncertainties about sinks and larger uncertainties about future economic growth rates and other variables create broad range of uncertainty about the projected average level of emissions over the 20082012 period for example two major studies yielded range from about 390 mmtc to 660 mmtc as the projected emission reduction requirement needed to achieve the us goal this represents 70 range of uncertainty in the emissions reduction task given the previous failure of the 1993 ccap to stabilize emissions by 2000 the current kyoto target for actually reducing emissions in the 20082012 time frame looms as major policy challenge assuming senate ratification of the kyoto protocol15 the kyoto agreement set 1990 as the baseline year for co2 emissions from which progress toward targets for future reductions are to be measured does energy information administration eia is the recognized authority for assessing actual levels and projecting baseline businessasusual bau future levels for co2 and all other us greenhouse gas emissions eia has established the 1990 co2 level at 1346 mmtc eias annual energy outlook aeo projects future co2 levels assuming major future policy actions the bau scenario in the aeo projects large growth in co2 emissions by 2010 however in accounting for recent policy changes and projected economic trends the aeos projections vary considerably from yeartoyear the projected bau level for co2 in 2010 stood at 1730 mmtc in the 1997 aeo 1803 mmtc in the 1998 aeo 1791 mmtc in the 1999 aeo and 1787 in the 2000 aeo thus for example the 1997 projection for 2010 would be 384 mmtc increase over the 1990 level the 2000 projection for 2010 would be 441 mmtc or 33 increase over the 1990 levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30414crs6 16 available at

efficiency and renewable energy eere issued september 1997 report by five national laboratories entitled scenarios of us carbo n reductions potential impacts of energy technologies by 2010 and beyond 16 also known as the fivelab study it assumed the 1990 baseline of 1346 mmtc and used the 1997 bau projection that emissions would reach 1730 mmtc in 2010 an increase of about 384 mmtc or 29 this is shown in table 1 the report analyzes some options for using cost effective highefficiency he energy technologies and other lowcarbon lc technology options to curb emissions it projects that combination of helc technology and permit price of 50 per ton of carbon could bring 2010 emissions to level just below the 1990 stabilization level lower permit price assumptions yielded 2010 emission levels between the bau and stabilization levels the fivelab study anticipates as table 2 shows that energy efficiency is the single largest contributor to meeting us co2 targets accounting for 50 to 90 of the projected emissions reduction in 2010 the transportation sector yields the most reduction from automobile weight reduction fuel cell breakthroughs and other options the buildings sector yields reductions from lighting space conditioning and other options the industry sector yields savings from combined heat and power chp motor system design and variety of technologies specific to each industry such as impulse drying for pulp and paper plants and direct smelting for iron and steel plants in the utility sector some savings come from improved power plant efficiency but the largest contribution is from carbon permit prices stimulating the use of low carbon fuels further the fivelab study projects that all emissionreduction scenarios can be achieved at low or net direct cost to the economy in 1998 report impacts of the kyoto protocol on us energy markets and economic activity eia finds problems with several key assumptions in the fivelab study about the use of new energyefficient technologies to reduce emissions these assumptions include increased performance and lower costs for new technologies new unspecified government policies that promote adoption into the market and greater propensity by consumers to buy them than they have shown in the past specific examples include use of 15year payback for buildings technology when consumers expect oneyear to fiveyear paybacks use of 6 industrial market penetration factor in an eia model that normally assumes 3 and use of 50 mpg for new car fuel economy while eia estimates about 33 mpg eia further criticizes the five lab study for assuming an aggressive rd program and 19 annual economic growth rate which is 10 lower than eias assumption of 22 rate moreover eia says the fivelab study uses series

measures whose savings are not easily disentangled from the impacts of energy prices consumer behavior and other variables as result claims to achieving certain amount of saving may be subjected to dispute for example gao and epa disagree about the methods used and the resulting savings estimates for assessing emission reductions due to epas ccap energy efficiency programs23 according to epa the administration evaluates the effectiveness of its climate programs through an interagency program review the first such interagency evaluation chaired by the white house council on environmental

this category has included tax credits for homes cars and equipment that meet energy efficiency standards third category of legislation focuses on policies to incorporate energy efficiency provisions
