abdullah welcomed white house counterterrorism adviser john brennan swci ambassador williamson and ambassador fraker to his private palace march 15 for 90minute discussion focused on us saudirelations counterterrorism cooperation the yemeni guantanamo bay detainees iran and iraq s brennan presented the king with letter from president obama expressing personal message of friendship appreciation for our close and collaborative relationship and concern over the disposition of yemeni detainees at guantanamo s the king said he had told iranian foreign minister mottaki only minutes before that iran should stop interfering in arab affairs and had given iran oneyear deadline to improve its relations with saudi arabia s the king expressed complete lack of trust in iraqi pm almaliki and held out little hope for improved saudiiraqi relations as long as almaliki remains in office s when asked what advice he had for president obama the king said he had one request that it was critically important to restore americas credibility in the world us saudi relations 2 s pledges of friendship brennan asserted that the ussaudi alliance must remain strong and assured the king of president obamas wishes for long and healthy ussaudi relationship and the presidents personal commitment that saudi arabia had friend in the white house the king replied that he appreciated the sentiments and that he had great respect for president obama we the us and saudi arabia spilled blood together in kuwait and iraq the king continued and saudi arabia valued this tremendously friendship can be difficult issue that requires work abdullah said but the us and saudi arabia have done it for 70 years over three generations our disagreements dont cut to the bone he stated 3 s us credibility is critical the bush administration is now in the past the king said both president bushes were his friends but the recent president bush didnt take his advice on dealing with issues in the region and they found their problems compounded the king said we are ready to consult provide guidance and to do whatever is necessary we are people of the region and we know it well brennan responded that president obama wants to listen and asked what advice the king would offer to president obama abdullah said his one piece of advice was that restoring us credibility in the world was critically important brennan responded that this was an important issue for president obama as well brennan said that under president obama we will restore our credibility he said the us is great country and we know what we have to do 4 s the world needs obama brennan said president obama looked forward to seeing the king at the g20 summit in london thank god for bringing obama to the presidency the king answered which has created great hope in the muslim world may god grant him strength and patience abdullah continued may god protect him im concerned about his personal safety america and the world need such president 5 c that without which saudi meeting is complete abdullah said as friend that it was mistake to limit access of saudi citizens to the us since this damages bilateral relations and the image of the us in saudi arabia the king noted there were 60000 saudi students abroad about one third of whom were in the us and others would have gone but for the difficulties in gaining access to the us the king noted that for many years very senior saudi officials including prince saud alfaisal had studied in the us he then noted that saudi ambassador to the us adel jubeir who was interpreting for the king had studied in the us and was half american as result he also said he was aware of and appreciated ambassador frakers efforts to improve the visa situation even though there were people in washington who fought him finally he observed that anyone from saudi arabia who studies in the us inevitably becomes friend and advocate of the united states and that we only hurt ourselves by cutting off this flow of students detainees 6 s guantanamo will be closed brennan explained that president obama had made commitment to close guantanamo to eliminate the potential propaganda benefits its existence provided to alqaeda but also because it was the right thing to do brennan reassured the king however that president obama would remain strong on counterterrorism brennan presented the king with letter from president obama addressing the issue of yemeni detainees at guantanamo brennan noted that he had met with prince mohammed bin nayef mbn the day before to discuss at length the issue of the yemeni detainees brennan further stated that he would be traveling to sanaa the next day to meet with president saleh as the issue of the remaining 99 yemeni detainees still needed to be resolved brennan praised mbn as an outstanding counterterrorism partner and that the moi was doing wonderful courageous job in countering the terrorist threat to the kingdom returning to the subject later in the conversation brennan warned that the us feared yemen could become another waziristan and urged that the us and saudi arabia needed to work together to keep alqaeda in yemen from growing even more dangerous the king replied that having somalia next door to yemen only adds to the danger brennan said that the capabilities of the ministry of the interior security forces had grown impressively over the past 10 years brennan added that counterterrorism and intelligence sharing cooperation between our countries had never been better and that mbn deserved the credit in an unusual concession made at the conclusion of their conversation the king said be assured i am fully briefed on the work you are doing with prince mohammed bin nayef 7 s how to track detainees ive just thought of something the king added and proposed implanting detainees with an electronic chip containing information about them and allowing their movements to be tracked with bluetooth this was done with horses and falcons the king said brennan replied horses dont have good lawyers and that such proposal would face legal hurdles in the us but agreed that keeping track of detainees was an extremely important issue that he would review with appropriate officials when he returned to the united states iran 8 s heated exchange the king noted that iranian fm mottaki had been sitting in that same seat as brennan few moments ago the king described his conversation with fm mottaki as heated exchange frankly discussing irans interference in arab affairs when challenged by the king on iranian meddling in hamas affairs mottaki apparently protested that these are muslims arabs countered the king you as persians have business meddling in arab matters the king said the iranians wanted to improve relations and that he responded by giving mottaki an ultimatum i will give you one year to improve ties after that it will be the end 9 s spare us your evil the king expressed hope the us would review its iran policy and come to the right conclusion brennan responded that president obama was personally reviewing us iran policy and wanted to hear the kings thoughts abdullah asserted that iran is trying to set up hizballahlike organizations in african countries observing that the iranians dont think they are doing anything wrong and dont recognize their mistakes i said to mottaki thats your problem recounted the king abdullah said he would favor rafsanjani in an iranian election were he to run he described iran not as neighbor one wants to see but as neighbor one wants to avoid he said the iranians launch missiles with the hope of putting fear in people and the world solution to the arabisraeli conflict would be great achievement the king said but iran would find other ways to cause trouble irans goal is to cause problems he continued there is doubt something unstable about them he described iran as adventurous in the negative sense and declared may god prevent us from falling victim to their evil mottaki had tendered an invitation to visit iran but abdullah said he replied all i want is for you to spare us your evil summarizing his history with iran abdullah concluded we have had correct relations over the years but the bottom line is that they cannot be trusted 10 s an empty channel the king said three years ago iranian supreme leader khamenei had sent his adviser ali akbar velayati with letter asking for abdullahs agreement to establish formal back channel for communication between the two leaders abdullah said he had agreed and the channel was established with velayati and saudi fm saud alfaisal as the points of contact in the years since the king noted the channel had never been used 11 s dangerous neighborhood brennan responded that the saudis lived in dangerous neighborhood with iran across the gulf with saudi arabia sharing long border with yemen and with number of other troublesome countries nearby brennan noted that we have lot of work to do in the middle east together the king responded that the worlds attention was focused on the region he further stated that he believed that the us could help in this sensitive region but that we should not take matters lightly brennan noted that president obama is fully aware of the dangers in the region that the us knew that it had to remain involved in constructing solution and that we would seek the kings counsel in dealing with the many issues in the middle east the king asked if that included iran brennan responded that it did brennan said that we had our eyes wide open to iranian ambitions that we were not nave to the dangers iran posed to saudi arabia and that iran could not be allowed to succeed in its destabilizing activites brennan observed that the president had ordered complete review of us iran policy and made reference to passage in the presidents letter that we needed to test irans intentions to cease its destabilizing behavior and live up to its international obligations brennan further observed that the ussaudi partnership had to remain strong and that together and with others we needed to thwart irans nuclear ambitions that is important responded the king finally brennan said the president wanted the king to know he had good friend in the white house who would be willing to assist in any way that he could the king thanked mr brennan said he appreciated the sentiments said that he had great respect for president obama and reflected that we had been great friends for many years and would remain friends as our disagreements were minor 12 u see reftel ref provided separate readout on the iran discussion and the kings meeting with mottaki iraq 13 s in the hands of god and iran brennan expressed the importance the us attaches to achieving peace and stability in iraq the king replied that this was in the hands of god though he agreed that iraq was vitally important to both the us and saudi arabia the king also pointed out that some say the us invasion handed iraq to iran on silver platter this after we fought saddam hussein 14 s hope for maliki the king said he had confidence whatsoever in iraqi pm maliki and the ambassador fraker is well aware of my views the king affirmed that he had refused former president bushs entreaties that he meet with maliki the king said he had met maliki early in malikis term of office and the iraqi had given him written list of commitments for reconciliation in iraq but had failed to follow through on any of them for this reason the king said maliki had credibility i dont trust this man the king stated hes an iranian agent the king said he had told both bush and former vice president cheney how can i meet with someone i dont trust maliki has opened the door for iranian influence in iraq since taking power the king said and he was not hopeful at all for maliki or i would have met with him an alert and engaging host 15 s i miss my horses the king appeared alert and at times animated entertaining his guests with anecdotes about his encounters with iranian leaders septel and throwing up his hands in complaint when asked if he spent time with his horses i see them on television when they race he said i love horses he exclaimed every couple of weeks i get to see them and then i have very calm and restful sleep 16 s dialogue and reform as duty in response to brennans praise for the kings interfaith dialogue initiative his commitment to advancing rights as reflected by his recent appointment of the first female deputy education
