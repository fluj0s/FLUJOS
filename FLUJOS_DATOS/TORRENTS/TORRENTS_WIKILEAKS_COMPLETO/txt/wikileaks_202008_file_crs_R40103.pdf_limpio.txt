carbon co 2 emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and by an additional 80 by 2050 fundamental question arising from carbon control proposals is how the co 2 reduction targets can be achieved in the electricity industry which is responsible for nearly 40 of us co 2 emissions it appears from the policy research and technical studies that substantially reducing co 2 emissions in the us electricity sector over the next few decades would likely require every key carbon mitigation measure at the nations disposal however it is also clear that significant uncertainty exists about the potential of indivi dual measures to achieve their hopedfor carbon impact energy efficiency can the united states overcome socioeconomic barriers to achieve four times more potential savings than ever before renewable energy will there be enough transmission for wind power is there enough land to grow the needed biomass nuclear power could the united states build new plants fast enough to matter advanced coal power will banks fund them and regulators approve them carbon capture and sequestration will the technology be commercially deployable in 10 years 25 years or never plugin hybrid electric vehicles how much low carbon electricity would be available to charge their batteries distributed energy resources would carbon costs change distributed energy economics enough to spur deployment as the nations co 2 mitigation policies develop the inherent uncertainty associated with specific carbon measures may be critical concern commitments to specific carbon emissions targets over time or to specific schedule of carbon costs whatever form they may take may be greatly affected by the success of the underlying measures relied upon to achieve them notwithstanding the best efforts of federal policy makers it is possible that given the uncertainties each faces few if any of the major measures proposed to moderate us carbon emissions will achieve their anticipated impacts in 20year time frame as congress considers implementing co 2 policies keeping close eye on the technology and market developments associated with every key measure could be priority balancing responses to energy market volatility and unexpected structural changes against the need for predictability in rd and private capital investment may be essential to maintaining the nation on course to meaningful

manmade carbon dioxide co 2 emissions on global climate change to address these concerns congress has been debating range of potential initiatives for reducing atmospheric co 2 from us sources legislative proposals would seek to limit us co 2 emissions to specific historical levels through emissions caps carbon taxes or other regulatory mechanisms many of these proposals dictate or anticipate declining longt erm trajectory for annual us carbon emissions in the 110th congress the most prominent co 2 proposals sought redu ctions of nationwide co 2 emissions to 1990 levels or lower by 20301 presidentelect barack obama has proposed carbon reduction targets as well intending to cut co 2 emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and by an additional 80 by 20502 fundamental policy question which arises from carbon control proposals is how the co 2 reduction targets can be achieved numerous analysts have been examining this question and identifying specific measures to reach particular targetsespecially in the electricity industry which is responsible for nearly 40 of us co 2 emissions in the electricity sector these measures typically include some combination of energy efficiency renewable energy nuclear power advanced fossilfuel power generation carbon capture and sequestration plugin hybrid electric vehicles and distributed energy resources figure 1 illustrates the co 2 abatement potential of these measures in the electricity sector as estimated in widely cited analysis by the electric power research institute epri in the epri example overall co 2 emissions associated with the electricity sector would be reduced below 1990 levels by 2030 other studies have generated their own projections with alternative targets and assumptions leading to distinct trajectories for co 2 emissions and different contributions from the various abatement measures3 analyses like that in figure 1 are important for understanding the potential opportunities and limitations of specific technological measures which may be needed to meet co 2 abatement goals however with their focus on technical potential such studies often have difficulty conveying in straightforward way the key infrastructural environmental regulatory or operational uncertainties which might affect how much of that potential could practically be achieved4 these uncertainties nonetheless are of critical concern to legislators overseeing existing carbonrelated programs or considering future co 2 abatement policies in addition to their technical aspects congress faces need to gauge the overall viability of specific co 2 abatement measureswhat are their prospects for helping to achieve co 2 targets in the electricity sector legislators also face need to assess the time frame over which such measures could be expected to work and how these measures may fit together to achieve overall co 2 abatement goals under national carbon policy 1 world resources institute

device such as household appliance or automobile engine undergoes technical change that enables it to provide the same service eg cooling lighting motor drive while using less energy it is said to have increased energy efficiency the energy saving result of the efficiency increase is often called energy conservation the energy efficiency of buildings can likewise be increased through the use of certain design changes such as more insulation thermal windows improved ventilation and solar orientation 5 energy efficiency is often viewed as interchangeable with energy supply options like electric generation oil or natural gas energy efficiency can also reduce energy resource use and associated environmental impactslike co 2 emissions from power plants 5 strictly speaking conservation means avoiding waste but the term is typically used interchangeably with efficiency in the energy policy context as it is in th is report efficiency and conservation contrast with curtailment or load management which decrease output eg turning down the thermostat or services eg driving less to decrease energy use at specific times curtailment is often employed as an emergency measure

economic response to changes in energy prices the availability of new techno logy turnover in enduse equipment and other factors however conservation studies since the opec oil embargoes of the 1970s have identified substantial potential for energy efficiency improvements above baseline levels one seminal analysis in 1976 stated technical fixes in new buildings can save 50 percent or more in office buildings and 80 percent or more in some new houses by 1990 improved design of new buildings and modification of old ones could save third of our current total national energy useand save money too 6 1981 study by the solar energy research institute7 likewise found that through energy efficiency the us can achieve fullemployment economy and increase worker productivity while reducing national energy consumption by nearly 25 percent8 the study further concluded that the consumption of electricity can be reduced to point where on national basis demands through the end of the twentieth century can be met with generating equipment now operating or in advanced stages of construction 9 more recent studies continue to identify significant electricity conservation potential the five lab study in 1997 estimated technical electricity savings potential of approximately 23 and maximum achievable potential of 15 among residential and commercial buildings assuming aggressive policies promoting conservation and 50metric tons 1993 dollars carbon cost 10 2004 metaanalysis by the american council for an energyefficient economy of several regional studies reported technical electricity conservation potential of 33 and an achievable potential of 24 over 5 to 15 year time horizon depending upon the study11 the us department of states 2006 climate action report concludes that by using commercially available energyefficient products technologies and best practices many commercial buildings and homes could save up to 30 percent on energy bills12 6 amory b lovins energy

federal and state agencies have implemented multitude of electricity efficiency initiatives over the last 40 years to capture energy efficiency potential in the electricity sector these initiatives have included appliance equipment nd building efficiency standards electric utility administered conservation incentives13 consumer information campaigns and other initiatives notwithstanding these efforts the levels of incr emental electricity conservation actually achieved since the 1970s have been more modest than the 2530 suggested in conservation potential studies 2004 analysis examining comprehensive range of both federal and utilitysponsored conservation and energy efficiency programs including federal efficiency standards administered through 2000 concluded as follows programs for which ex post quantitative estimates of energy savings exist are likely to have collectively saved up to 41 quads of electrici ty annually these estimates typically reflect the cumulative effect of programs eg all appliance efficiency standards past and present on annual energy consumption this total energy savings represents about 6 of annual nontransportation energy consumption 14 study of californias 2001 energy demand reduction initiative promoted heavily as an emergency measure to avoid blackouts during the states electricity crisis reported 6 reduced electricity usage compared to the prior year although only 2530 of this reduction was attributable to savings from energy efficiency or onsite generation projects likely to persist for many years 15 consistent with these studies 2008 analysis by epri projected realistic us electricity savings potential of 7 beyond baseline levels which would occur without additional market intervention16

studies of technical conservation potential and actual conservation impacts suggest perpetual opportunity for incremental electricity conservation on the order of 25 more than four times the savings such programs have actually realized moving beyond the 5 to 7 electricity savings range has been persistent challenge to conservation proponents primarily because of the diffuse nature of the efficiency opportunity and the economic complexity of decision making and capital investment by electricity consumers students of enduse markets have long been puzzled by the lack of adoption of ostensibly costeffective energy efficiency technologies rich literature has developed around this 13 commonly referred to as demandside management or dsm programs 14 kenneth gillingham richard g

efficiency technologies is widespread17 among the barriers to energy efficiency analysts have identified are limited market availability of new efficiency measures incomplete consumer information about efficiency options insufficient capital for efficiency investments fiscal or regulatory policies discouraging efficiency investments builder focus on first costs vs lifecycle costs lack of consumer focus on energy costs relative to other costs and energy prices not reflecting the full social costs of energy supply18 conservation advocates and federal policy makers have proposed range of additional policy approaches to further overcome these barriers but there is limited consensus on which policies would be effective and how much additional conservation they might achieve as study of conservation barriers from lawrence berkeley national laboratory concluded although these rationales provide basis for some type of intervention we acknowledge that they do not justify any particular intervention we suggest that differences of opinion about the appropriateness of public policies stem not from disputes about whether market barriers exist but from different perceptions of the magnitude of the barriers and the efficacy and possibly unintended consequences of policies designed to overcome them 19 there have been numerous legislative proposals to promote electricity efficiency and conservation20 the key uncertainty faced by all of them and future conservation proposals is whether as whole they may costeffectively capture much more of the latent electricity conservation potential than such programs have done in the past carbon control studies which project electricity efficiency savings on the order of 5 to 10 over 20year time frame appear consistent with us conservation program experience and may be aided by any future costs of co 2 emissions if they are reflected in electricity prices unlike large physical infrastructure however such as power plants or electric transmission lines conservation impacts do not necessarily scale up to achieve greater impacts simply by increasing the size or funding of given conservation program efficiency potential is also extremely diffuseexisting literally at the individual light socket level in nearly ev ery household consequently policy makers seeking large conservation impacts may need to try

types of power plants geothermal solar wind biomass and municipal solid wastelandfill gas21 many carbon control advocates and federal policy makers have high expectations for the potential of renewable generation to help reduce co 2 emissions in the united states the widely publicized pickens plan for example announced by t boone pickens in july 2008 envisions deploying enough wind generation in the great plains states to produce 20 of us electricity by 201822 the obamabiden presidential campaign similarly pledged to establish federal renewable portfolio standard requiring that 25 percent of electricity consumed in the us be derived from clean sustainable energy sources like solar wind and geothermal by 2025 23 some groups have advocated even more aggressive targets for us renewable power development24 others are less optimistic epri for example assumes renewable sources excluding hydroelectric generation could contribute 9 of electricity production in the electric power sector by 203025 according to the energy information administration eia biomass and wind generation are the two types of renewable power with the greatest overall economic potential and therefore the greatest potential to reduce co 2 emissions26 biomass and wind power are inherently different technologies however so they face distinct uncertainties related to their potential expansion under national program of carbon control they are discussed in turn in the following sections g25g146g151g141g561g18g152g160g142g155g561 wind power does not consume fuel and produces co 2 so it is an extremely attractive technology for co 2 mitigation in the electricity sector27 wind generation technology is also fairly mature it has been deployed commercially throughout the united statesalbeit with federal assistance in the form of renewable energy production tax credits and state renewable energy 21 this report excludes hydroelectric power generation from the renewables

electricity generation in 200829 1991 study of available us wind resources by pacific northwest laboratory concluded that the wind electric potential that could be extracted with todays technology across the united states is equivalent to about 20 of the current us electric consumption30 2003 analysis by the national renewable laboratory similarly concluded that by 2050 wind could account for about 25 percent of all generation in the us 31 consistent with these technical assessments the department of energy doe recently examined the practical possibility of 20 wind power production in the united states by 2030 longer time frame than either the pickens or obama biden campaign proposals the doe report c oncluded that 20 wind scenario in 2030 while ambitious could be feasible32

the rapid expansion of us wind generation faces significant challenges according to the doe these challenges are related to the integration of intermittent wind power into regional electricity control areas cost reduction and efficiency improvement for wind turbine technology and wind facility siting issues33 the principal challenge the doe identifies howeverand according to many experts the principal uncertainty facing wind poweris investment in the nations transmission system34 as figure 2 shows the nations most abundant wind resources tend to be located far from population centers where the electricity is needed consequently wind generators require robust transmission grid to move power to the market but the us transmission network is constrained significantly limiting the availability of transmission capacity to new wind farms transmission owners in agreement with the doe have pointed to transmission grid constraints as the single greatest impediment to aggressive wind power expansion although there is sufficient evidence showing that wind generation can be reliably integrated into the electricity system obstacles to new generation sources continue to exist due to the lack of adequate transmission system access the remoteness of wind sources an underinvested transmission infrastructure and lack of workable transmission investment policies all hinder the development of wind power in the us 35 28 federal tax credits are provided for under the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 1914 and subsequent statutes 29 us energy information administration

united states would involve building more than 12000 miles of additional transmission at cost of approximately 20 billion in net presentvalue terms36 similar conceptual transmission plan by the american electric power company aep to integrate 20 wind energy estimated that 19000 miles of new 765 kv transmission lines would be needed with net present value of 26 billion37 while such plans put needed focus on some of the specific requirements for us transmission upgrade marshaling the level of investment to expand transmission capacity quickly could stress the supply and price of materials labor and other resources any wind power project requiring the construction of extensive new transmission infrastructure from remote to populated areas also could face concerted community opposition to the siting of those transmission lines public challenges to electric transmission projects have long been considered among the most serious and most intractable challenges in the us energy sector

total us electricity production analysts raise concerns about the practicality of transmitting 20 times that amount of wind power in the near term in its 2007 wind program plans for example the doe itself states that large wind power deployme nt projections seem too good to be true39 2008 new york times assessment makes the point more strongly experts say that without solution to the grid problem effective use of wind power on wide scale is likely to remain dream40 the key uncertainty for wind power then is whether the electric grid after decades of under investment will expand sufficiently to support rapid expansion of wind power g4g146g152g150g138g156g156g561g18g152g160g142g155g561g9g142g151g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 biomass power plants are combustion power plants that effectively recycle the co 2 they emit through carbon sequestration in the crops grown continuously for fuel crops take up carbon dioxide from the air via photosynthesis as they grow and release it to the air when they are burned so they cause net increase in atmospheric co 241 currently most biomass power plants are fueled with waste materials from farming forestry and manufacturing eg paper

united states is the availability of biomass fuel biomass crops dedicated for power generation require land to growpotentially in competition with food crops lumber and other traditional crops up to point such competition may not be sign ificant barrier to growth since biomass power producers can use more waste from existing agricultural production eg corn stalks or grow fuel crops on us lands not currently in agricultural production 2002 analysis by the energy information administration concluded that u s biomass power generation capacity could increase by factor of ten from approximatel 7 gw to 70 gw through 2020 and not conflict with land requirements for existing crop production 43 2005 analysis by the department of agriculture similarly concluded that forestland and cropland had the

production others contradict them raising critical questions about the limits of biomass fuel supply in the united states as 2008 rand report states the cost and supply of future biomass feedstocks are highly uncertain factors45 this uncertainty is exacerbated by the possible expansion of biomass demand for transportation fuels such as ethanol and biodieselalso motivated by co 2 abatement objectives but in the transportation sector to the extent that biomass for power and biomass for liquid fuels are pursued aggressively and concurrently overall competition for us agricultural resources may become serious concern the significant resulting increase in biomass usage would require harvesting various energy crops at scale that vastly exceeds current practice greatly increased biomass production could be accompanied by adverse environmental and economic impacts due to land conversion 46 adverse impacts limiting biomass production for electric power could include increases in food prices some analysts for example have argued that corn price increases could be partly linked to the diversion of us corn crops from food and feedstock supply to fuel ethanol production47 biomass crops could also compete for land with forest carbon sequestration the latter likely to increase in importance as source of valuable co 2 emissions offsets under future carbon control policies48 some analysts have suggested that biomass fuel or food crops could be imported to alleviate domestic land constraints but such im ports would raise other concerns about us energy and food supply independence 2007 mit study concluded if we restrict usa biofuels to those produced domestically as much as 500 million acres of land would be required in the usa for biofuels production the result would be that the usa would need to become substantial agricultural importer this suggests that the idea that biomass energy represents significant domestic energy resource in the usa is misplaced 49 carbon release from previously untilled lands and from agricultural processing are other factors which may reduce the life cycle co 2 benefits and therefore the economic potential of rapid biomass crop expansion g16g158g140g149g142g138g155g561g18g152g160g142g155g561g9g142g151g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 nuclear power has been significant part of the us electricity sector for

raise questions about long term nuclear fuel supply constraints plant safety and security and public acceptance58 these are all vital questions any one of which could influence the viability of us nuclear resurgence perhaps more fundamental uncertainty however even if these questions were resolved is whether nuclear power plants could be construc ted quickly enough to significantly reduce us

because nuclear power plants are large complex and must go through lengthy and rigorous siting approval process furthermore global capability to construct nuclear plants has diminished since the 1980s 2001 doe analysis concluded that because of limited growth in the nuclear sector over many years there had been gradual erosion in important nuclear infrastructure elements such as qualified personnel in nuclear operations qualified suppliers of nuclear equipment and contractors with the necessary skills for nuclear design engineering and construction 59 little has changed since that report was released nuclear plant construction in the united states remains constrained by time access to critical construction resources and the availability of qualified engineering and construction firms given the decline in us nuclear infrastructure there is ongoing debate among nuclear analysts about the prospect for rapid nuclear power xpansion 2008 analysis by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd co ncluded that based on historical experience from the 1970s and 1980s and more recent growth in the world economy the capability could be rebuilt to construct 3560 1000 gwe reactors per year worldwide by 2030 and by 2050 capability could grow to 70120 reactors per year60 roughly consistent with this assessment 2008 study by the does nuclear energy advisory committee concluded that with additional infrastructure it would be plausible albeit major challenge to build 30 new us reactors by 2030 61 the latter rate of construction is substantially lower than that during the peak period of us nuclear development from 1963 to 1985 during which time 77 nuclear reactors were ordered constructed and began commercial operation62 others are more pessimistic about the potential for rapid expansion of nuclear power in the united states for example one analyst concludes that contrary to the publics perception and the industrys efforts nuclear power will continue longterm decline rather than move toward flourishing future revival 63 the debate is complicated by the need to replace us nuclear plant capacity retiring in the near future simply to maintain nuclear powers current electricity supply contribution referring specifically to such construction limitations another expert concludes that nuclear energy will remain an option among efforts to control climate change but given the maximum rate at which new reactors can be built much new construction will simply offset the retirement of nuclear reactors built decades ago 64 observing that the nuclear capability of the us has atrophied in the 30 years since the last nuclear plant was ordered secretary of energy samuel bodman has remarked more bluntly lets not kid ourselves about the

anywhere near the increasing demand would be virtually impossible the infrastructure human and physical legal permitting and construction hurdles are just too big only at the end of our 1520 year period are we likely to see serious ramp up of nuclear technologies 66 faced with these divergent assessments experts disagree on the ability of nuclear power to help meet co 2 mitigation goals members of the nuclear power joint fact finding njff reached consensus about the likely rate of expansion for nuclear power in the world or in the united states over the next 50 years some group members thought it was unlikely that overall nuclear capacity would expand appreciably above its current levels and could decline others thought that the nuclear industry could expand rapidly enough to fill substantial portion of carbonstabilization wedge during the next 50 years 67 consequently congressional policy makers face key uncertainty as to the achievable pace of nuclear power industry expansion and therefore the potential contribution nuclear generation may make to nearterm co 2 reduction

emissions from coal power plants is advanced coalfired power generation advanced coal technologies include ultrasupercritical pulverized coal plants and integrated gasificati on combined cycle igcc units the latter of which convert coal into synthetic gas prior to combustion compared to conventional coalfired power plants which typically operate at around 33 efficiency advanced technologies under development or demonstration could improve coal plant efficiency to 46 or more 68 because they use coal more efficiently advanced coal plants could yield proportionate reductions in co 2 emissions per unit of electricity output compared to conventional coal plants if carbon capture and sequestration technology discussed in the next section could be added to these plants their co 2 emissions could be further reduced some analysts and policy makers anticipate that advanced coal generation either in the form of new coalfired plants or upgrades to certain existing plants will make significant contribution to us carbon reduction goals they argue that until carbon capture and storage technology is commercialized advanced coal plants will be costeffective option for meeting future electricity demand growth while limiting co 2 emissions growth compared to its current rate of growth epri for example proposes co 2 reductions from advanced coal plants on par with those from

while power plants employing advanced coalfired generation technology face important questions about technological readiness and costeffectiveness the key uncertainty is whether they can be builtthat is whether the capital markets will finance them and whether regulators will permit them although they are more effici ent than traditional coal plants advanced technology coal plants still burn coal andabsent carbon capture technologystill release large volumes of co 2 to the atmosphere once constructed they may remain in service for 40 years or more hence they may not satisfy regulatory objectives for carbon control and may face financial risks stemming from future policies imposing costs on co 2 emissions furthermore industry arguments that these plants will be retrofitted with carbon capture technology when it becomes available are assuming the availability of that technology which faces uncertainties as discussed in the following section due to the potential carbonrelated risks faced by new coal generation projects major financial institutions are imposing greater requirements on developers seeking capital for new coal plant investments 70 regulatory agencies also have begun withholding regulatory approval from advanced coal project proposals for example in august 2007 the minnesota public utilities commission rejected developers proposal to co nstruct new igcc power plant in the state as not in the public interest71 the sierra club reports that at least 30 other proposed igcc or supercritical coal generation projects have been cancelled across the country over the last several years due to financial and carbon emissions concerns72 in november 2008 the environmental protection agencys epa environmental appeals board ruled that an epa region could not issue permit for proposed coalfired power plant without considering whether the best available co 2 controls should be required for such plant73 according to industry analysts the epa ruling would place freeze on the construction of as many as 100 new coalfired power plants around the us74 the epa administrator has subsequently overruled the boards decision apparently clearing the way for numerous coal plant permit applications to proceed but raising new questions about future regulatory treatment of coal plant emissions under the next administration75 70 citi jpmorgan chase and morgan

is direct sequestration of carbon dioxide capturing co 2 at its source and storing it indefinitely to avoid its release to the atmosphere carbon capture and sequestration ccs is of great interest because potentially large amounts of co 2 emitted from the industrial burning of fossil fuels in the united states could be suitable for sequestration in theory carbon capture technologies are seen as potentially removing 8095 of co 2 emitted from an electric power plant or other industrial facility power plants are the most likely initial candidates for ccs because they are predominantly large singlepoint sources and they contribute approximately onethird of us co 2 emissions from fossil fuels many analysts and policy makers have high hopes for ccs technology to help meet future co 2 reduction goals in the us electricity sector and worldwide for example one expert has testified before congress that capturing and sequestering co 2 emissions from coalfired power plants and eventually all fossil combustion is foundational technology component of any emissions reduction plan seeking to stabilize atmospheric co 276 in the international energy agencys 2007 forecast ccs is widelydeployed under global co 2 stabilization assumptions and accounts for 21 of avoided co 2 emissions by 203077 in epris analysis ccs makes the single greatest contribution to reduced co 2 emissions among all measures by 203078 g5g5g21g561g22g142g140g145g151g152g149g152g144g162g561g23g151g140g142g155g157g138g146g151g157g162g561 developing technology to capture co 2 in an environmentally economically and operationally acceptable mannerespecially from coalfired power plantshas been an ongoing interest of the federal government for decade nonetheless the technology on the whole is still under development commercial device is currently available to capture carbon from coal plants technology is currently available for capturing co 2 from certain industrial processes such as ammonia production or natural gas processing but the volumes of co 2 emitted from coalfired power plants dwarf any current industrial process in use today various new ccs technologies have been tested successfully in laboratories and some are being demonstrated in limited capacity field trials but they are costly and face technical challenges to reaching commercial scale consequently analysts disagree as to whether when and how ccs technology might be widely available in the united states at cost competitive with commercially available technologies for generating electricityparticularly natural gas turbines 79 policies that impose costs on generators for co 2 emissions such as carbon taxes or capandtrade programs presumably would benefit ccs competitiveness but they too are highly uncertain and constrained by other economic factors as one study notes the success of capandtrade 76 raymond j kopp director of the climate policy program resources for the future testimony before the

range of factors that cannot be controlled or even predicted in advance80 review of recent studies reveals broad rang of opinion as to how quickly ccs could be commercially deployed on large scale an analysis from imperial college london sees initial commercial deployment of ccs technology in the 20152020 period81 doe officials reportedly have stated that the agency hopes to have carbon capture technology in deployable position within decade 82 2008 study by mckinsey company projected that early commercial ccs projects would be built around 202083 the world business council for sustainable development believes ccs technology will enter commercial deployment by 202584 the intergovernmental panel on climate change 2005 report on ccs technology states that many integrated assessment analyses foresee the largescale deployment of ccs systems within few decades from the start of any significant regime for mitigating global warming 85 coalition including greenpeace friends of the earth and other public interest groups asserts that the best case scenario is that ccs technology would be ready by 203086 referring to ieas long term projections for carbon control the oecd states that there must be significant doubt as to whether or not it is feasible to achieve the assumed contribution from ccs by 203087 given the range of expectations for ccs technology readiness policy makers may not be able to establish to their satisfaction the contribution this technology may make to co 2 emissions abatement as one former doe official reportedly has cautioned peoples conception of how much ccs can deliver is probably wildly overrated so im hopeful that carbon capture and storage could be part of the solution but one just has to put big question mark on it88 echoing this view nobel laureate steven chu director of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory and nominee for secretary of energy reportedly has remarked its not guaranteed we have solution for coal 89 accordingly

potential introduction in the next few years of plugin hybrid electric vehicles phevs phevs like commercially available hybrid electric vehicles hevs would combine an electric motor and battery pack with an internal combustion engine to improve overall fuel efficiency phevs would use much higher capacity battery pack than typical hev however and would be able charge the vehicle on grid power rather than solely by the combustion engine during operation with their larger batteries phevs could achieve an allelectric range of 20 to 40 miles the average commuting distance by using grid electricity rather than gasoline in this way phevs could lower overall fuelcycle pollutant emissionsincluding co 2 emissionsfrom vehicles90 accordingly many analysts and policy makers believe phevs offer substantial opportunities to reduce the nations overall co 2 emissions 2007 joint eprinatural resources defense council nrdc study for example concluded that through the widespread adoption of phev technology cumulative co 2 savings from 2010 to 2050 can be large91 the obamabiden presidential campaign pledged to put 1 million plugin hybrid cars on the road by 201592 while phevs are an innovative technology ther are important questions about the impact phevs may have on co 2 emissions over the next 20 ot 30 years one key uncertainty is whether such vehicles would be purchased in sufficient numbers approximately 50 of new car sales by 2025 according to the eprinrdc study93 to have significant carbon impact despite their high cost phevs are projected to retail for over 40000 per vehicle in the nearterm compared to approximately 28000 for an hev and 23000 for conventional vehicle94 as point of reference conventional hevs accounted for 24 of new vehicle sales in the united states through november 200895 of greater uncertainty perhaps are the projected carbon emissions of power plants operating to supply phev electric ity as general rule phevs only reduce net carbon emissions if the power plants supplying them produce relatively little carbon per kwh but some studies show that if the us generation portfolio does not significantly reduce its overall carbon

located near homes or businesses to provide an alternative to or an enhancement of conventional grid power distributed resources include technologies such as rooftop photovoltaics natural gasfired microturbines wind turbines and fuel cells the category also includes combined heat and power chp systems which make productive use of waste heat from electricity generation thereby increasing the total useful energy extracted from electric generation fuels 97 distributed energy resources der offer potential benefits to customers in terms of energy costs power reliability and power quality der technologies also can help mitigate co 2 emissions because some use renewable energy sources or as in the case of chp systems they make more efficient use of fossil fuels than the utility power generation they displace98 among der technologies chp is the most widesp read accounting for nearly nine percent of us electric generating capacity in 200799 chp is also viewed as having the greatest nearterm potential to reduce co 2 emissions 2008 report from oak ridge national laboratory concludes that by achieving 20 percent generation capacity from chp by 2030 an aggressive target the united states could avoid 60 percent of the projected increases in co 2 emissions during that time100 2007 study by mckinsey company further concludes that much of this added capacity could be installed at negative marginal cost101 nonetheless chp along with other der technologies has not been implemented to its potential due to technical and utility infrastructure barriers chp or cogeneration has been around in one form or another for more than 100 years it is proven not speculative despite this proven track record chp remains underutilized and is one of the most compelling sources of energy efficiency that could with even modest investments move the nation strongly toward cleaner environment 102 other der technologies such as photovoltaics and fuel cells likewise face barriers limiting their implementation as united kingdom government study stated the complexity and novelty of some of the t echnologies together with their need to be integrated into the built environment often by players new to the energy business means there is significant gap between potential and delivery moreover many of the technologies are not yet costcompetitive at their current state of development and with current fuel and carbon prices 103 97 chp systems are also commonly referred to as cogeneration systems 98 sw hadley jw van dyke wp poore iii and tk stovall quantitative assessment of distributed

emissions would substantially increase der adoption due to the existing alignment of carbon reduction and cost reduction objectives even without carbon costs and the fundamental economics of renewables104 thus der faces key uncertainty similar to that faced by energy efficiency the key question is whether new programs and the imposition of carbon costs would enable the electricity sector to capture substantially more der potential than it does today g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 policy research and technical studies show that substantially reducing co 2 emissions in the us electricity sector over the next few decades like ly requires successful deployment of every major carbon mitigation measure at the nations disposal however it is also clear that significant uncertainties cast doubt on the potential of individual measures to achieve their hopedfor carbon impact for the measures discussed in this report the key uncertainties can be summarized as follows energy efficiency can the united states overcome socioeconomic barriers to achieve four times more potential savings than ever before renewable energy will there be enough transmission for wind power is there enough land to grow the needed biomass nuclear power could the united states build new plants fast enough to matter advanced coal power will banks fund them and regulators approve them carbon capture and sequestration will the technology be commercially deployable in 10 years 25 years or never plugin hybrid electric vehicles how much low carbon electricity would be available to charge their batteries distributed energy resources would carbon costs change distributed energy economics enough to spur deployment policy makers and interest groups recognize these uncertainties and have put forth numerous proposals to address them it is beyond the scope of this report to examine each of these proposals but they include the broadest range of policy instruments at governments disposal higher efficiency standards new regulatory authorities tax incentives direct subsidies research and development rd grants environmental rules public information campaigns and host of other policy instruments specific examples include calls for more federallyfunded ccs demonstration projects and proposals for federal preemption of state siting authority to promote new transmission development 105 while they run the gamut it remains to be seen which continued httprenewableconsultationberrgovuk

would have consequently the overall success of multimeasure co 2 mitigation scheme such as that proposed by epri in figure 1 and its economic underpinnings is inherently unpredictable the cost of building and operating coal plants with and without ccs systems the cost of natural gas nuclear power and renewable sources of power the cost of emissions offsets from outside the utility sector and ultimately the market price of co 2 itself are all variables that will dictate the decisions of future power plant developers these variables are all highly uncertain from todays perspective and may create set of economic drivers dramatically different from those anticipated by policymakers 106

measures is not the same as predicting their ultimate success or failure this report does not independently assess the likelihood of particular measures meeting any specific co 2 reduction target the whole point of this reports focus on uncertainty is that co 2 outcomes are not known and expert opinions vary as to what the future will be it is therefore entirely possible that portfolio of co 2 measures such as those in figure 1 implemented under the optimum subset of policies currently under debate could achieve the types of carbon reductions projected indeed epri has characterized its co 2 scenario as very aggressive but potentially feasible107 other co 2 abatement analyses have also been developed in good faith with similar belief in their practicality successfully reducing us carbon emissions to 1990 levels say by 2030 would validate the overall policy approach as well as the specific measures comprising it such an outcome would not be conclusive as deeper co 2 cuts would arguably need to follow but the intervening years would probably provide greater clarity on the best policy options to 2050 and beyond

implementation of all carbon abatement measures is the goal it is also entirely possible that under multimeasure strategy like epris one or more measures would fall short of meeting expectations for co2 reduction nuclear industry expansion for instance could easily fail to materialize or the transmission grid could expand too slowly for sustained wind power development in such case legislators might need to revisit both the enabling policies for the underperforming measures and for the carbon strategy as whole one obvious solution could be to rely on more successful measures to compensate for the underperforming ones as the oecd study posits if ccs andor enduse efficiency fail to achieve the required targets it follows that other technologies including nuclear power will need to make bigger contributions to fill the gap 108 but based on review of the relevant research cited in this report such an approach may simply not be realistic since the co 2 targets of the continued kelliher

ambitious aggressive or major challenge and there are questions as to whether the initial targets can be achieved increasing those targets may stretch credibility and sharply increase the uncertainty of the overall co 2 mitigation effort alternatively legislators could revisit measurespecific policies to see if more intervention could improve their particular prospects larger tax credits for renewable energy for example could potentially improve the competitiveness of biomass generation thereby encouraging biomass investment such an approach might still encounter difficulty making up for early underperformance of measure in the out years as co 2 emissions are cumulative but any improvement would arguably be helpful third option would be to increase the level of any future carbon costs with the expectation that an increase would benefit carbon mitigating technologies across the board such an action however could have broad implications for energy prices reliability and availability

policy makers it is possible that given the uncertainties they face that few if any of the major measures proposed to moderate us carbon emissions would achieve their anticipated impacts in 20year time frame in its 2008 report the national intelligence council suggests just such an outcome all current technologies are inadequate for replacing the traditional energy architecture on the scale needed and new energy technologies probably will not be commercially viable and widespread by 2025 even with favorable policy and funding environment for biofuels clean coal or hydrogen the transition to new fuels will be slow 109 under such scenario legislators may face different policy alternatives each with distinct but potentially significant implications congress might increase future carbon emissions costs even higher than under the previous scenarioto level that virtually guarantees the targeted co 2 reductionsalthough the effects of very high carbon prices on electricity costs might be detrimental to specific industries eg coal or to the economy as whole alternatively congress might refocus its efforts on single measure eg ccs or nuclear power restructuring its policies to expand the implementation of that specific measure far beyond its original targets congress could also reset its national co 2 targets deferring reduction goals until they are more in line with the maturation and implementation of the key co 2 reduction technologies in this case legislators would signal acceptance that nearterm targets could not be met and hope for greater success later in the century this alternative risks unacceptable implications however and might violate future international emissions treaties finally congress could abandon its focus on co 2 reduction altogether instead

2030 numerous studies support the potential of specific measures to lower co 2 emissions but also identify key implementation uncertainties which may impact their overall viability congress is considering policies to address these uncertainties but which policies may be implemented and how effective they may be cannot be known at this time as the nations co 2 mitigation policies continue to develop the inherent uncertainty associated with specific carbon measures may be critical concern commitments either domestic or international to specific carbon emissions targets over time or to specific schedule of carbon costs whatever form they may take may be greatly affected by the success of the underlying measures relied upon to achieve them the reverse is also true schedule of carbon costs may also influence the success of co 2 abatement measures therefore policy makers may benefit from complete and integrated understanding of measurespecific uncertainties and the range of carbon outcomes they imply as one study has concluded explicitly including uncertainty in both technical change and in climate damages is important for understanding the relationship between technical change climate change and pol icy optimal policy is different when uncertainty is taken into account110 as congress considers implementing co 2 policies keeping close eye on the technology and market developments associated with every key measure may be an oversight priority success or failure of any particular measure may be apparent early on in its implementation affording an opportunity through quick action to make policy adjustments to improve measures chances for success or to abandon it in favor of more promising options perhaps more importantly given the complexity and scale of the carbon control problem congress may also find it useful to expect the unexpected in the electricity sector apart from the measures discussed in this report new technologies consumer behavior or infrastructure developments eg rush to natural gas may emerge rapidly and unexpectedly to change fundamental aspects of the nations carbon emissions trajectory one way or another electricity supply will balance with demandbut perhaps in unanticipated ways the recent volatility in global oil prices is relevant example of unexpected structural changes in energy markets balancing responses to energy market volatility and unexpected structural changes against the need for predictability in rd and private capital investment may be essential to maintaining the nation on course to meaningful
