of march 2008 by shirley kan election results while many had expected victory on march 22 2008 for kmt presidential candidate ma yingjeou and his running mate vincent siew the size of the partys winning margin in taiwans presidential election 22 million votes was surprise to most outside observers and even to some in the party itself1 emphasizing platform of economic improvement and better relations with the prc and the united states mr ma did respectably even in southern and rural districts heavily dominated by the dpp in the past his tickets wide margin of victory echoed similarly dramatic kmt victory in the january 2008 legislative elections where the party gained majority of 81 seats in the new 113seat body compared to the dpp s anemic 27 seats2 when ma assumes office on may

implications for us policy by kerry dumbaugh crs2 the electoral chances of the dpps presidential ticket candidate frank hsieh and his running mate tsengchang were burdened by what was widely regarded as the poor performance of the incumbent president chen shuibian also member of the dpp corruption scandals in the party and by chens increasing emphasis on controversial proindependence agenda some observers felt that the dpp had lost the opportunity to make critical adjustments in its policies after public dissatisfaction with its performance became clear in 2005 instead of moving to where the voters were according to this view the dpp had tried to move the voters to it strategy that did not serve it well in the 2008 elections3 adding to the dpps march defeat was its failure to pass controversial referendum high priority for president chen asking whether taiwan should apply for membership under the name taiwan although 94 of those voting for the dpp referendum voted in favor this referendum as well as kmt alternative each failed to reach the threshold of 50 of the electorate turnout that was required for the measures to be considered for passage beijing had considered chens referendum in particular to be tantamount to public poll on independence prospect the prc has threatened to prevent by force if necessary the referendum also had been problematic for the united httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22853 states which had called chens proposal provocative political background to where we are now historically the kmt on taiwan began as party of mainlanders from the republic of china roc government that fled to taiwan in 1949 after chinese communist forces triumphed in chinas civil war although it is credited with engineering taiwans economic growth and transformation during its more than 50year rule on the island the kmt for decades remained associated with an increasingly untenable political premise that its military forces one day would retake the mainland and reunify china under the roc government as more countries recognized the prc government and severed official relations with the roc on taiwan the kmts inability to offer clear and more creative vision for taiwans political future made it vulnerable to challenge in 2000 the fledgling proindependence dpp party was able to elect to the presidency its candidate chen shuibian with bare plurality of the votes cast in threeway race chen was re elected to second term by slim majority in the 2004 presidential election4 chens tenure was hampered from the outset first by systemic weaknesses in taiwans political infrastructure that give limited power to either the legislative or executive and second by divided government in which the opposition kmtled coalition retained mere fingertip grip on legislative control many of chens policy initiatives were blocked by the legislature and he had insufficient power or political 3 shelley rigger brown associate professor of east asian politics davidson college in discussion roundtable on taiwan march 23 2008 4 the day before the 2004 presidential election president chen and his running mate were shot and wounded as they campaigned the central election commission later declared 327297 of the votes invalid due to polling place irregularities the chenlu ticket won by margin of 29518 out of over 13 million votes cast result the kmt challenged as suspicious and tainted by the shooting incident and the invalidated votes see crs report rs21770 taiwan in 2004 elections referenda and other democratic challenges by kerry dumbaugh crs3 support to surmount this moreover the prc rebuffed chens early efforts to improve crossstrait relations citing the dpps proindependence platform as an impediment to such progress as result an emphasis on taiwan nationalism identity and defacto sovereign status became centerpieces of much of chens eight years in office decision that took toll on ustaiwan relations and contributed to much divisiveness in taiwans political scene5 from the time it was voted out of power in 2000 the kmt has sought to portray itself as more responsible steward than the dpp for taiwans future the party gained political mileage from portraying president chen as insufficiently attentive to the needs of taiwans economy and business community kmt candidate ma pledged to revive taiwans economy by negotiating comprehensive economic agreement with the prc and seeking to reduce restrictions on crossstrait links such as direct air flights and financial matters that limit taiwans ability to engage in the booming chinese economy the kmt also soundly criticized president chens posture toward china as provocatively confrontational and promised to replace it with policy of engagement and cooperation with beijing still the kmt was forced to find ways to accommodate itself to the appeal of the dpps proindependence political views which resonated with not insignificant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22853 portion of the electorate in an attempt to walk this fine line during his 2008 campaign ma yingjeou promised that in addition to economic prosperity as president he would advocate three noes negotiations on unification with the prc pursuit of jure independence and use of force by either side domestic political implications for the kmt the decisive kmt election wins in 2008 provide new opportunities for the government to overcome the political gridlock of the past few years experts watching the taiwan political scene hold that in the last eight years the kmt has moved toward new political centrism and has adapted its policies to reflect the preferences of taiwans middle class6 this shift appears to have paid off for the party not only in the 2008 legislative and presidential election victories but in other recent election successes for county and city government leadership the majority of which the kmt also now controls for some then the kmt presidential victory was as much win for the party as it was vote of noconfidence for the chen administration presidentelect ma himself has reputation for thoughtful conciliation and many observers have suggested that his early choices will be important determinants in the course taiwan follows in the next few years for instance observers wonder whether ma will be able to restrain those in his party who may want to drive home the kmts success by revisiting the failures of the chen administration or instead will chart more charitable and forwardlooking policy direction that will help to heal taiwans political wounds they will watch to see if he appoints old guard kmt members to all the important posts or broadens his government to include younger party members and dpp and other nonkmt representatives they wonder whether he will be able to craft economic and political improvements in relations with china without being seen as 5 see crs report rl33684 underlying strains in taiwanus political relations by kerry dumbaugh 6 shelley rigger in conference in taiwan march 23 2008 crs4 having compromised taiwans interests to those of the prc with the kmts solid majority now in every aspect of government there will be doubt about where responsibility lies for any perceived failures in these early tests for the dpp analysts suggest that the dpp did not make the kind of centrist adjustments to public sentiment that the kmt made in recent years instead staying close to the proindependence interests of its core supporters in the wake of effectively having been crushed in two electoral outings in 2008 the party now is facing period of reassessment and rebuilding as it considers how to broaden its electoral appeal and maintain its vitality in the face of kmt dominance7 how it succeeds is seen as important since many believe both us interests and the health of taiwans democratic development would be better served by robust opposition rather than an anemic one in the aftermath of the election views have been mixed about the dpps nearterm prospects there are different views how robust the partys apparent 42 electoral support is will it shrink or even collapse if the kmt can deliver improved economic performance and stronger international role for taiwan or is it strong enough at 42 to remain viable opposition force some fear that the partys hardcore pro httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22853 independence base may blame moderates within the party for the 2008 losses and will seek to strengthen the partys hand by purging or marginalizing moderate members and reemphasizing the partys radical core values8 others believe that the dpps future would be tenuous with such narrow approach and that the only fertile ground for carving out greater than 42 electoral margin is within taiwans political center they suggest that the dpp seek to broaden its base while working harder in the interim to supervise kmt performance9 for democratic and political development for some taiwans 2008 presidential election means that taiwans democratic development has been validated by having passed the huntington test for established democracies that is having two successful consecutive changes of government through free and peaceful electoral process10 observers who may have harbored concern about how the dpps supporters would take such defeat were reassured greatly by the gracious concession speech of frank hsieh and the widespread apparent dpp acceptance of the results of the democratic process to some watching the march 22 election the taiwan electorate also appeared to have attained new level of maturity and sophistication apparently motivated more in its election decisions by pragmatic calculations of governmental performance than by 7 frank hsieh himself cited the need for thorough party reassessment saying we must let the sound of reform ring out reuters taiwans dpp chairman quits after election defeat march 26 2008 see also statement to this effect by shelley rigger taiwan ruling party to retool after another defeat reuters march 24 2008 8 observers of taiwan elections reported this view from conversations with dpp moderates 9 suggestions of larry diamond conference in taiwan on the implications of the election for taiwans democratic future march 23 2008 10 samuel p huntington defined this process in his book the third wave democratization in the late twentieth century norman and london 1991 taiwan qualifies by virtue of the dpp having wrested power from the kmt in 2000 and the kmt having regained power in 2008 crs5 more emotional issues involving membership or sovereignty issues11 in sum many have welcomed the election results as sign that taiwans democracy has continued to ripen and mature implications for taiwans prc and us relationships for relations with the prc by most accounts mas election presents unique opportunity to lay new framework in taiwanprc relations one that moves toward crossstrait improvements and new understandings and away from the more confrontational policies of the past ma will be faced with multiple delicate balancing acts he will have to improve crossstrait relations and taiwans economic opportunities on the mainland while not appearing overly eager to core dpp supporters who worry that he will sell out taiwans interests in pursuit of mainland ties he also will have to strike balance between those in the electorate who favor unification with china those who argue for strong defense for taiwan and the continuation of us weapons purchases and those who urge significant improvements in taiwans relations with beijing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22853 despite the challenges that ma faces many believe that the election results have placed the real burden for an improved taiwanprc situation squarely on beijing according to some observers the taiwan electorates choice of ma and its inability to pass the two referenda to which beijing objected are seen as first step toward crossstrait improvements having railed against president chen for eight years while wooing the kmt the prc now will have to follow through with creative initiatives with the ma regime if it is to capitalize on the election results the opportunity would appear to be too good to miss rebuffing new and more conciliatory taiwan government could damage the prcs credibility that it wishes to pursue peaceful and constructive solution for crossstrait ties any perceived prc reluctance also could serve to revitalize us and congressional opposition to the prcs taiwan policy opposition which has remained muted in recent years in part because of mutual usprc problems with chen observers suggest there are number of options now for beijing to make meaningful gesture toward taiwan that would not impinge on prc sovereignty claims these could include willingness to invite or to be willing to discuss inviting taiwan to be meaningful participant in the world health organization who an invitation to restart crossstrait talks on mutually acceptable basis halt to petulant posturing against taiwan in apec and other multilateral organizations or suspension of taiwan focused military exercises and other military maneuvers in the strait among other acts in the wake of the election prc premier wen jiabao has expressed hope that cross strait talks can resume quickly on the basis of the 1992 consensus12 unfortunately past experience demonstrates that the prc often is unable to adopt creative and flexible policy 11 many us and other foreign election observers were in taiwan before and after the march 22 election including this author this report draws heavily on these personal observations and insights 12 purportedly the 1992 consensus was mutual agreement between the prc and taiwan governments on formula of onechina two interpretations president chen during his tenure suggested the agreement was really onechina policy that compromised taiwan sovereignty crs6 initiatives at times of great tension as is currently the case with the crackdown against demonstrations in tibet or when there is intense pressure to be seen to be successful as there is now in the months leading up to the 2008 summer olympics in beijing in addition some have suggested that beijing remains concerned about potential controversies that could arise during the remainder of president chens term before ma takes office on may 20 2008 for these reasons many feel that at least in the short term beijing may be unable to make an important overture to the incoming taiwan regime for us relations us officials say they have had strong ties with taiwans dpp government and had developed considerable network of working economic and military ties with taiwan under president chen but such problems of trust had developed between president chen himself and us officials that many believe the bilateral atmosphere can only improve under the new kmt leadership13 presidentelect ma has said he will place high priority on repairing any residual difficulties in taiwans relations with the united states still some observers in the past have expressed concern that the united states may have underestimated the importance of the sea change in kmt thinking that arose from the visits to the prc by senior kmt officials beginning in 200514 those visits they say may have given prochina interests in the kmt new httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22853 alternate vision for taiwans future if this concern is founded one consequence could be the growing inurement of the kmt to us pressure or interests for instance taiwan could resist us pressure that it increase military spending on the grounds that such expenditures are too high too confrontational and may be unnecessary in light of potential improvements in crossstrait interactions some worry then that the kmt driven in large part by economic imperatives and pressures could reach an accommodation with beijing that ultimately may damage us regional interests in other respects the continued success in 2008 of taiwans democratic development is welcome validation of us goals and values it also further emphasizes the unique and delicate challenge for us policy that taiwan poses our ninth largest trading partner with vibrant and free democratic government on an island claimed by the prc with which the united states has diplomatic relations but does have defense commitments and whose independence from china us officials have said they do not support under the new kmt government then the united states will be faced with challenges familiar from past years including decisions on new arms sales how to accommodate requests for visits to the united states by ma and other senior taiwan officials the level of us relations with the ma government whether to pursue closer economic ties and what role if any washington should play in crossstrait relations 13 on march 28 2008 ray burghardt chairman of the american institute in taiwan ait which represents american interests in taiwan expressed confidence that the united states would have excellent relations with the incoming government 14 this was view expressed to the author by one us ait official in taiwan in 2006
