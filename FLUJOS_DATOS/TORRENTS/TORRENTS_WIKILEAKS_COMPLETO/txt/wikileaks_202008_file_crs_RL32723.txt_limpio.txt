division zimbabwe summary zimbabwes prospects appeared promising in 1980 as it gained independence after long liberation war rising inflation and unemployment bred discontent in the 1990s and led in 1999 to the formation of the opposition movement for democratic change mdc the new party surprised many with its initial success campaigning against 2000 referendum that would have legalized the presidents continued rule made government officials immune from prosecution and allowed the uncompensated seizure of whiteowned land for redistribution to black farmers the referendum failed and the mdc won nearly half the seats in the 2000 parliamentary election the ruling party has since taken numerous often undemocratic actions to bolster its power president robert mugabes government has been seen as autocratic and repressive by its critics and its human rights record is poor the regime has suppressed freedom of speech and assembly and many contend that the government has restricted access to food already scarce in opposition areas the mdc divided over how to respond split into two factions in 2005 hampering its ability to challenge the ruling party reports of political violence rose sharply after zimbabwes march 29 2008 elections when for the first time since independence the ruling party lost its majority in the national assembly mugabe has repeatedly extended his rule and his reelection as president in the june 2008 runoff election has been viewed as illegitimate by the united states and the united nations secretarygeneral among others on september 15 2008 after several weeks of negotiations in south africa mugabe and mdc leader morgan tsvangirai signed powersharing arrangement aimed at resolving the political standoff as part of the deal tsvangirai will become prime

support the adult hiv infection rate of 18 has contributed to sharp drop in life expectancy and five million are expected to require food aid in 2008 deteriorating conditions in the country have led many to emigrate to neighboring countries creating substantial burden on the region president mugabe has enjoyed considerable popularity in africa as former liberation leader however some african leaders have come to see his conduct as damaging to the continent and urged democratic reforms following controversial elections in 2000 and citing abuses of human rights and the rule of law the united states and some other former allies of the government became vocal critics the us secretary of state has labeled zimbabwe an outpost of tyranny and the united states has enforced targeted

2007 given the strong statements made by some southern african leaders many observers expected the sadc heads of state to increase pressure on mugabe to make reforms reports suggest that in private the leaders may have been tough on the zimbabwean president who was in attendance but their public response was deemed disappointing by human rights activists and critics of the regime6 during the summit the sadc leaders resolved to promote dialogue within the country at the same time suggesting that western countries should drop their sanctions against the mugabe government and that britain should provide funding to assist in land reform efforts south african president thabo mbeki was appointed to mediate between the zimbabwean government and the opposition mbeki who opposed calls for regime change pushed instead for democratic elections saying you might question whether these elections are genuinely free and fair but we have to get the zimbabweans talking so we do have elections that are free and fair7 talks between the mugabe administration and the mdc factions began in pretoria in june 2007 according to human rights activists and the us department of state political violence against opposition leaders and supporters continued in spite of the negotiations8 the mugabe administration accused the opposition of being responsible for series of bombings targeting shops trains and police stations although some observers suggest the attacks were an attempt to frame the opposition9 harassment of university students by police also reportedly increased on november 22 2007 22 members of the national constitutional assembly prodemocracy civil society organization reportedly sustained severe beatings during peaceful protest set to coincide with visit by president mbeki to harare10 although the south africa negotiations resulted in several agreements between the parties leading to the amendment of some laws seen to restrict press freedom and political activity

which split in 2005 remained divided prior to the elections despite rumors of dissatisfaction with mugabes continued rule from within his own party the partys central committee nominated mugabe to be their presidential candidate in march 2007 the committee also supported resolution to hold all elections presidential parliamentary and local council at the same time and to reduce the terms for all public offices from six to five years in addition they voted to back efforts to increase the number of parliamentarians from 150 to 210 and the number of senators from 66 to 8412 critics contend that these proposals were an effort to manipulate the electoral process through gerrymandering with the new constituencies created in rural areas where the ruling party has stronger support13 the ruling zimbabwe african national union patriotic front party zanupf also proposed to allow the parliament to select new president if the sitting president resigns is incapacitated or dies in office14 analysts suggest that mugabe may not have intended to serve an entire term if reelected instead planning to resign midterm and use parliament to handpick his successor15 the proposals were included in controversial constitutional amendment bill which to the surprise of many observers was passed by the parliament in september 2007 with the support of mdc mps the final version of the legislation did however include some changes seen as concessions to the opposition and reports suggest that the mdc supported the legislation because of progress in the south africa negotiations in february 2008 thenzanupf senior member simba makoni announced his intention to run against president mugabe in the upcoming elections he was subsequently expelled from the party and is running as an independent

administrations economic policies makoni also previously served as the executive secretary of sadc opposition leader tsvangirai dismissed makoni as old wine in new bottle but rival mdc leader arthur

factions which reunited on april 28 won 109 seats in the 220seat national assembly over zanupfs 97 after month of rising tensions the results of the presidential race were belatedly announced on may 2 they indicated that opposition leader morgan tsvangirai had received more votes than the incumbent president robert mugabe but had failed to garner the 50 percent needed to avoid runoff19 although the opposition accused the government of manipulating the results and initially objected to participating in runoff morgan tsvangirai agreed to stand against president mugabe in second round of voting while electoral law requires the government to hold runoff election within 21 days of announcing the initial results the zec declared that the runoff would not be held until june 27 three months after the first round during the following weeks reports of political violence increased dramatically in what many critics contend was governmentorchestrated attempt to punish opposition supporters and ensure mugabe victory in the runoff several of the countrys security service chiefs including the heads of the army and the police publicly announced that they would not recognize an electoral victory by anyone other that mugabe20 citing the high number of attacks against mdc supporters and the lack of level playing field tsvangirai withdrew from the race days before the election despite public

aimed at resolving the political standoff the agreement outlines time frame for the drafting and adoption of new constitution as part of the deal tsvangirai will become prime minister in new unity government and cabinet positions will be divided among the parties the mdc factions will reportedly take 16 ministerial positions three of which will come from the mdcm faction and zanupf will take 15 positions early reports suggested that tsvangirai would gain control of the police force but mugabe who will remain head of state would retain control of the armed forces the text of the agreement however leaves oversight of the police which falls under the ministry of home affairs undetermined mugabe will lead the cabinet but reports suggest that tsvangirai who will chair council of ministers will be responsible for the daytoday management of government affairs21 as was the case in kenya during power sharing negotiations in early 2008 the zimbabwe parties are now struggling to determine who will control key ministries and implementation will require major concessions from all sides background after years of economic sanctions by the international community and decadeslong civil war that resulted in more than 30000 dead the white minority rule government of southern rhodesia concluded series of agreements with the black majority in 1979 that resulted in the establishment of the government of the republic of zimbabwe among the greatest challenges facing the new government was the demand by the majority for greater equity in land distribution22 at independence the white minority who composed less than 5 of the population owned the vast majority of arable land many observers considered the countrys whiteowned commercial farms crucial to the countrys economy although there was general recognition that land reform was necessary britain initially funded willing buyer willing seller program to redistribute commercial farmland offering compensation to white farmers amenable to leaving their lands dissatisfaction with the pace of land reform grew and led in the 1990s to spontaneous and often violent farm invasions at the same time the countrys labor movement and segment of its urban middle class were becoming increasingly critical of the governments economic performance facing rising political and economic challenges the government of zimbabwe began to implement aggressive land expropriation policies leading britain and other donors to begin withdrawing financial support for resettlement 21 zimbabwe rivals sign powersharing deal reuters september 15 2008 22 for more information on zimbabwes land redistribution issue and other historical context see crs report rl31229 zimbabwe backgrounder by raymond copson crs6 in 2000 the government held referendum to approve changes to the constitution that would allow land seizures without compensation responsibility that in its view lay with britain the referendum was rejected by 55 of voters and was seen as victory for new opposition party the movement for democratic change mdc within days of the vote war veterans and ruling party supporters moved onto an estimated 1000 whiteowned farms and months later the president invoked emergency powers to take land without compensation during this time there were numerous attacks against white farmers and their employees as well as against supporters of the mdc more than 30 people were killed since then the countrys problems have deepened substantial political violence and human rights violations have accompanied elections since 2000 the broad scale of such abuses in the wake of the most recent general elections held on march 29 2008 brought international condemnation but little consensus on how best to stop the violence reports of governmentorchestrated human rights abuses continued for months after the elections zimbabwes political difficulties have been accompanied by sharp decline in living standards with more than 80 of the population living on less than 2 per day23 once touted as potential breadbasket of africa much of zimbabwes population is now dependent on food aid more than 18 of adults in zimbabwe are infected

deteriorated for more information see the failed states index foreign policy mayjune 2007 crs7 political situation zimbabwe has been ruled since independence by zanupf which has come under increasing scrutiny from human rights activists both at home and abroad critics cite high levels of corruption political violence and strictly enforced laws restricting basic freedoms the government contends its detractors have engaged in propaganda war backed by britain and the united states using democracy and human rights as cover to push for regime change26 many domestic and international observers have judged elections since 2000 to be far from free and fair the countrys main opposition party the movement for democratic change mdc split over tactical issues in 2005 and despite attempts at reconciliation the party remained divided until after the march 2008 elections the ruling party has also suffered internal competition and some observers suggest opposition to president mugabe himself has grown within the party parliamentary elections 2005 zimbabwe held legislative elections in 2005 the elections like those before them in 2000 and 2002 were controversial with the opposition disputing the results and alleging government efforts to deny fair race zanupf retained control of the 150member parliament taking 108 seats of these 30 are appointed by the president rather than elected the mdc won 41 seats and one seat went to an independent27 the mdcs representation in parliament had declined since 2000 when it won 57 seats in its first elections some observers argue that the mdc did not do as well in the 2005 election because it delayed decision to participate until december 2004 leaving little time to campaign violence against mdc voters in past elections and the alleged use of food distributions by the ruling party to secure votes and general climate of intimidation may have also discouraged mdc support government supporters suggest voters simply lost faith in mdc promises opposition access to the staterun media was severely limited according to reporters without borders parisbased organization that supports press freedom28 the mdc was rarely covered on television or in the herald the governmentcontrolled newspaper and the stories that did appear were typically disparaging electionrelated violence although most observers agree that the level of political violence surrounding the 2005 elections was significantly less than that which preceded the 2000 and 2002 elections many argue the election was not free and fair and that there were some incidents of violence critics suggest that state harassment of civil society and the political opposition combined with limitations on press and other political freedoms left little need for violent repression 26 imperialists cant preach human rights the herald january 19 2007 27 jonathan moyo former information minister left zanupf and was elected as an independent candidate 28 reporters without borders letup in abusive media tactics three weeks before legislative elections march 8 2005 crs8 nevertheless the zimbabwe human rights ngo forum coalition of 17 human rights organizations reported more than 300 assaults in the pre election period29 charges of election rigging many analysts argue that the zimbabwean political system is undemocratic because elections are administered by institutions and under laws that many consider biased in favor of the ruling party in response to democratic protocols established by the southern african development community sadc the government passed the zimbabwe electoral commission zec act and the electoral act prior to the 2005 elections however the new independent zec appointed by the president was only established two months before the election leaving many of the preparations to the old electoral commission which many considered discredited by its past performance according to the usbased democracy advocacy group freedom house despite some improvements the electoral act granted the zec powers to employ security forces retained biased residency requirements for voters denied most expatriates the right to vote and created an electoral court staffed by deeply compromised judiciary30 the mugabe government has employed other legal tactics seen by critics as designed to intimidate the opposition and produce political landscape favorable to zanupf the 2004 gerrymandering of constituencies which the government attributed to population shifts arising from its land reform program resulted in the redistricting of three urban seats held by the mdc into three new rural constituencies which zanupf candidates won in 2005 the international council of barristers and advocates described extensive efforts by zanupf to gain control over the legal system in 2004 report suggesting the ruling party has interfered in judicial appointments and forced the removal of impartial judges through combination of psychological and physical intimidation and threats of violence31 the mdc challenged the results of numerous 2005 races in court claiming that the election was rigged32 their allegations focused on several largely rural districts in which the zec announced voter turnout totals before the vote results were reported once the results came in the zanupf candidate won in each case but the vote for the two candidates added together exceeded the initial zecreported turnout total this created suspicion that additional votes had been given to the 29 zimbabwe human rights ngo forum political violence report march 2005

candidates during the tabulation phase to prevent mdc victories33 according to the zec they had initially released early totals coming in to provide an indication of voter turnout and the discrepancies between those initial figures and the final tallies were due to poor communications from rural areas other opposition allegations focused on large numbers of voters in contested areas reportedly turned away for alleged registration problems election observers many domestic election observers such as the zimbabwe lawyers for human rights zlhr and the zimbabwe election support network zesn were critical of the elections during the preelection period they cited lack of transparency surrounding voter registration as significant and serious threat to the overall credibility of the electoral process their reports cited incidents of overt political violence but noted the preelection period was marked by intimidation politicization of food distribution and lack of media access by the opposition the observers contended they were restricted access to the vote counting process at many polling stations and that in some cases the total voter tally did not coincide with the total number of votes cast for the candidates34 both groups reported the use of posa moa and aippa throughout the election period against opposition supporters the zlhr report concluded zimbabwean authorities have failed on most accounts to ensure free and fair electoral process35 the mugabe regime placed limits on foreign observers for the election us observers were invited and russia was the only european country asked to send team leading the southern african development community sadc delegation south african deputy president mlambongcuka congratulated zimbabwe on the holding of peaceful credible well managed and transparent election the people of zimbabwe have expressed their will in an impressively instructive manner that will go long way in contributing to the consolidation of democracy and political stability not only in zimbabwe but also in the region as whole36 the head of south africas parliamentary observer mission was quoted saying that the delegation had unanimously agreed that the elections were credible legitimate free and fair37 both statements received substantial criticism in the international press the sadc parliamentary forum which consists of legislators from the region and had issued report critical of the 2002 election was not invited to observe the vote 33 the zec eventually halted the release of turnout totals so it is not known if there were similar discrepancies in other districts 34 zesn report on zimbabwes 2005 general election april 2005 the zesn coalition of 35 human rights and civic groups based in zimbabwe deployed 260

elections based on reports from domestic observers and us embassy staff who were allowed to observe the election us secretary of state condoleezza rice issued the following statement although the campaign and election day itself was generally peaceful the election process was not free and fair the electoral playing field was heavily tilted in the governments favor the independent press was muzzled freedom of assembly was constrained food was used as weapon to sway hungry voters and millions of zimbabweans who have been forced by the nations economic collapse to emigrate were disenfranchised38 secretarygeneral kofi annan commended the elections lack of violence but noted concern that the electoral process has not countered the sense of disadvantage felt by opposition political parties who consider the conditions were unfair39 restrictions on political freedoms legislative actions in the zanupfdominated parliament raised concerns about human rights in zimbabwe laws that critics contend have been used to quiet dissent and influence political developments include the following the access to information and protection of privacy act aippa this 2002 act requires that all media services be licensed and that all journalists including foreign correspondents be officially accredited the government citing aippa closed the daily news the only remaining independent daily in 2003 in 2005 three zimbabwean correspondents for the associated press bloomberg news and the times of london fled zimbabwe after police raided their office the media institute of southern africa misa has stated that aippa is one of the most effective legal instruments of state control over the media and civil society communication anywhere in the world40 the government has countered that aippa encourages responsible journalism the public order and security act posa the criminal law codification and reform act criminal law code and the miscellaneous offences act moa posa also enacted in 2002 prohibits statements deemed to be abusive indecent obscene or false about the president or considered to undermine public confidence in the security forces and prohibits false

all necessary force to stop unlawful gatherings42 in 2006 many offences under posa and moa were transferred to the new criminal law code the private voluntary organizations pvo act critics suggest that the government has used the pvo act enacted in 2002 to limit the activities of domestic ngos they are required to register with the government and probe team of intelligence officers has wide powers to investigate groups and demand documents related to activities and funding the african commission on human and peoples rights has recommended that it be repealed the opposition has had limited success in preventing zanupf from passing other legislation that it contends would restrict freedoms the interception of communications bill which would allow the government to monitor all internet email and telephone communications for threats to national security was stalled by the parliamentary legal committee chaired by an mdc mp but was later revised and approved in june 2007 critics suggest the revisions are cosmetic in the 2005 elections zanupf won over twothirds of the seats in the house of assembly giving the party the power to amend the constitution the parliament subsequently passed several controversial constitutional amendments which some analysts contend breach international human rights standards the 2005 constitution of zimbabwe amendment act no17 allows the government to limit the right to freedom of movement when it is in the public interest or in the economic interests of the state and restricts the right to leave zimbabwe journalists mdc officials and union leaders have had their passports revoked under the act the government charged that they planned to lobby abroad for sanctions or military intervention against the country43 the act also prevents land owners from challenging the acquisition of agricultural land by the state it paved the way for the passage of gazetted land consequential provisions act in late 2006 making it illegal for former farm owners to occupy nationalized land and allowing the government to evict farmers and resettle the land without compensation the constitutional amendment also revived the upper house of the parliament the senate the south africaled sadc negotiations led in january 2008 to amendments to both aippa and posa critics suggest the amendments did not adequately 41 for the text of the posa

66seat senate were held in september 2005 and were marked by record low voter turnout of 26 mdc candidates who ran seven were elected zanupf gained the overwhelming majority of seats observers suggest one of the reasons for the low turnout may have been lack of solidarity on the part of the opposition which split prior to the election over whether to boycott the vote internal zanupf struggles in view of president mugabes advanced age presidential succession has been matter of intense interest to analysts for several years prior to the 2008 elections some analysts expressed concern that if the elections did not lead to democratic transfer of power zimbabwe could experience violent succession struggle or possible military coup under the constitution the president may designate one of the countrys two vice presidents to serve as acting president until the next election should he leave office but mugabe has never done so one of the vice presidential posts was vacant prior to the 2004 zanupf party conference setting off power struggle that transformed the political scene by revealing internal party divisions despite his age president mugabe is reportedly in good health and in rush to relinquish his post many observers suggest he has used the countrys anticorruption authority to check the political ambitions of his party members mugabe endorsed 2007 proposal to extend the next presidential elections to 2010 but it was defeated by the ruling partys central committee prior to the december 2004 party conference emmerson mnangagwa then speaker of the parliament and political veteran long touted as mugabes heir campaigned actively for the position of zanupfs second vice president his selection to that position would likely have assured his appointment as national vice president but mnangagwa was caught off guard when mugabe decided that the country should have woman in the post mugabes choice for the position joice mujuru was inevitably elected and she was sworn into office as zimbabwes second vice president mujuru veteran of the liberation war and womens movement leader had been serving as minister of water resources and infrastructure 44 human rights watch

media alert update january 12 2008 crs13 the outcome of any succession struggle may be affected by the countrys ethnic and clan divisions mugabe and many key party and clan officials are from the zezuru clan of the shona people who are dominant in wide area encircling harare the countrys capital retired general solomon rex mujuru zezuru and husband of joice mujuru has been one of mugabes closest advisors and was regarded as kingmaker mnangagwa was seen as representative of the large karanga clan which reportedly felt that its turn to control the reins of power had come mnangagwas viability as presidential contender was hampered by accusations that he led the purge of alleged regime opponents in provinces of matabeleland in the 1980s which is believed to have resulted in the deaths of 20000 ndebele civilians the events of the 1980s help to explain why bulawayo has long been regarded as center of opposition to the government although mugabe has sought to gain support in the region by elevating number of ndebele to party and government posts mnangagwas power was reduced following the events of 2004 as was that of number of his backers including the former minister of information jonathan moyo moyo was fired in early 2005 for his sharptongued defenses of the regime and for picking spats with other zanupf leaders he deeply angered mugabe by convening an unsanctioned meeting of mnangagwa supporters before the party convention allegedly to strategize on ways of derailing the mujuru candidacy moyo left the party and ran as an independent in 2005 he retained his seat in the 2008 elections according to reports neither the mnangagwa nor mujuru camps initially supported mugabes proposed term extension once strong mugabe ally solomon mujuru has been vocal in his disapproval and is rumored to have been pivotal in blocking the proposal at the partys national conference some have suggested that mujuru covertly backed another zanupf official simba makoni over his wife as potential successor to mugabe makoni technocrat was considered by some analysts to be compromise candidate untainted by the corruption scandals that have plagued others mugabes own choice for his successor is unknown mnangagwa appears to have reallied with mugabe leading the partys 2008 election efforts and taking central role in guiding the countrys security forces in recent months the movement for democratic change mdc origins of the mdc the mdc party rose from the zimbabwe labor movement as poverty deepened in zimbabwe in the late 1990s and allegations of corruption against regime leaders became more frequent the zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu organized number of strikes and protests in september 1999 the mdc was formed on this trade union base with support from many in zimbabwes churches and in urban areas in february 2000 mdc members elected the zctu secretary general morgan tsvangirai changgerai born in 1952 as mdc president and union president gibson sibanda as mdc vice president the mdc proved formidable in the 2000 referendum and in the 2000 parliamentary election some contend their success may have prompted range of repressive actions against the party and its supporters among the retaliatory measures alleged several leaders of the mdc including tsvangirai himself were crs14 arrested and charged with treason two weeks before the mdc leader ran against mugabe in the 2002 presidential elections treason charges on october 15 2004 tsvangirai was acquitted of treason charge based on video recorded in canada which the government claimed showed him calling for the elimination of mugabe the verdict surprised many observers in view of the regimes perceived influence over the courts the judge stated that the evidence had been unconvincing with the witnesses produced by the state suspect and the video unreliable the government can appeal the verdict and tsvangirai may be tried again because the law does not prohibit double jeopardy in august 2005 the government dropped second treason charge that had been based on claims that he urged violence to bring down the government in 2004 division in the opposition in late 2004 the mdc became increasingly divided in its strategy to defeat the mugabe government mdc officials initially decided that the party would not participate in the 2005 parliamentary campaign unless the government took steps to assure free and fair election several party members questioned this stance on grounds that nonparticipation would deprive the party of any influence in the next parliament some reportedly felt that refusal to participate would hand control of parliament to mugabe on silver platter tsvangirai supported boycott arguing that the elections should be postponed until substantial electoral reforms could be implemented the party did eventually participate under protest but did not do as well as in previous polls in the months prior to the 2005 senate elections the mdc was once again divided on whether to participate supported by some civil society groups who suggested the elections were meaningless and waste of time and resources tsvangirai argued that participating in the senate would legitimize previous rigged elections and vowed instead to lead the opposition through mass action he was opposed by group of mdc politicians led by the partys secretarygeneral welshman ncube who had also been accused by the government of treason in 2003 the charges were subsequently dropped and gibson sibanda in october the partys national council voted 3331 to participate in the election but tsvangirai overruled the vote and reportedly in violation of the partys constitution expelled 26 senior officials from the party he announced the boycott touring the country to encourage voters to stay home the ncube faction refused to accept their expulsion and fielded candidates in the senate race although they gained only seven seats both factions held party conferences in early 2006 tsvangirai was confirmed as the leader of one faction while ncube ceded control of the prosenate faction to arthur mutambara noted student leader in the 1980s the two factions attacked each other in the press and there were allegations that the tsvangirai faction was behind violent july 2006 assault on member of parliament mp trudy stevenson and several other mutambara supporters stevenson identified the youths who attacked her as known followers of the former labor leader but tsvangirai denied the charges and denounced the beatings although his faction was reported to have the larger support base and the backing of the zctu some observers suggested neither faction would be effective unless they could resolve their differences and reunite crs15 opposition defiance against ban on

509 incidents of assault and 11 incidents of politically motivated abductionkidnapping60 human rights activists suggest that abductions and beatings of opposition supporters have been more systematic and widespread since the events of march 200761 and despite provisions in the new electoral laws amendment act banning such acts and assurances by security officials that the government would take zero tolerance approach to violence reports of attacks on opposition supporters rose dramatically after the march 2008 elections62 some reports suggest the government may have increasing difficulty paying its police and security forces which rights activists infer could affect their willingness to suppress protests with violence or conduct other alleged rights violations nevertheless reports suggest that police still play significant role in political violence the genevabased international commission of jurists which investigated the may 2007 detention and beating of lawyers expressed

approximately 76 lost their source of income66 police and military who carried out the event reportedly arrested forty thousand for allegedly illegal activities and told those whose homes were destroyed to return to their rural origins although many had rural home to which they could return67 operation murambatsvina has had severe impact on the nations economy and on the livelihood of its citizens for many this was not the first time they had been forcibly removed from their homes as result of the 2000 land reform program an estimated 400000 black laborers on commercial farms lost their livelihoods andor homes and many fled to urban areas to find work political violence surrounding the 2002 elections also forced many from their homes reportedly displacing more than 10000068 in 2004 under new phase of land resettlement an estimated 500000 who settled on farms during the 2000 invasions were evicted69 many of these displaced inhabited the urban slums prior to the demolitions

the communal sector including the agriculture industry and 16 worked in the formal sector70 of those living in towns and cities an estimated 70 were involved in informal trading prior to the demolitions political motivations the government described murambatsvina as program designed to restore the capital city to its former image as the sunshine city ridding the countrys urban areas of illegal structures that foster criminal activity and stemming the black market trade in foreign currency71 launched shortly after the disputed 2005 parliamentary elections many contend the demolitions

characterized by mistrust fear and lack of dialogue between government and local authorities and between the former and civil society72 the international response international reaction was highly critical secretarygeneral kofi annan named tanzanianborn anna tibaijuka executive director of unhabitat as the special envoy on human settlements issues in zimbabwe to investigate the humanitarian impact of the demolitions following factfinding mission to the country she issued comprehensive report which concluded operation restore order while purporting to target illegal dwellings and structures and to clamp down on alleged illicit activities was carried out in an indiscriminate and unjustified manner with indifference to human suffering and in repeated cases with disregard to several provisions of national and international legal frameworks73 the report also described police preventing civil society and humanitarian organizations from assisting those affected by the demolitions and suggested that the groups were operating in climate of fear and practicing selfcensorship to avoid being closed down or evicted74 the chairman of the african union sent his own envoy but he was prevented from conducting an assessment see international perspectives below the presentation of the envoys report to the security council stirred controversy as china algeria benin and russia objected to debate on the report the majority of security council members voted to allow its discussion albeit in closed session secretarygeneral annan also issued strong statement condemning

virtual state of emergency that now exists allow unhindered access for humanitarian operations and create conditions for sustainable relief and reconstruction75 continued evictions and operation garikai many observers suggest the zimbabwean government did little to respond to the envoys recommendations76 reports suggest that forced evictions continued despite government declarations to the contrary77 as was the case during the initial evictions several thousand of those made homeless were taken in some cases reportedly against their will to policerun transit camps in late 2006 conditions in these camps were described as dire often lacking shelter water or basic latrine facilities78 in keeping with the findings of the report amnesty international alleges that zimbabwe has repeatedly prohibited aid organizations including the united nations from providing the displaced with temporary shelters such as tents until permanent housing became available secretarygeneral annan expressed his concern in october 2005 over the governments rejection of assistance to tens of thousands noting there is clear evidence that subsequent government efforts have significantly benefitted these groups79 the united nations was subsequently permitted to erect approximately 2300 shelters fraction of their target of 4000080 in response to international criticism of murambatsvina the government announced new housing scheme operation garikai in june 2005 under garakai also known as hlalani kuhle live well new housing for those rendered homeless was to be built with public funds the ambitious reconstruction program would allegedly create tens of thousands of new homes but given the shortage of building materials and the governments budgetary problems it is highly unlikely the original target of 5275 homes will be met reports suggest that few houses have actually been completed and instead of going to victims of murambatsvina the newly built houses have been more often occupied by soldiers police and members of the ruling party81 the government denies these allegations 75 the secretarygenerals statement made on july 22 2005 is available online at

defined by article 7 of the rome statute of the international criminal court icc83 and whether there is responsibility to protect84 those affected by murambatsvina among the report recommendations the envoy suggests although case for crime against humanity under article 7 of the rome statute might be difficult to sustain the government of zimbabwe clearly caused large sections of its population serious suffering that must now be redressed with the assistance of the united nations and the international community the international community should encourage the government to prosecute all those who orchestrated this catastrophe and those who may have caused criminal negligence leading to alleged deaths if so confirmed by an independent internal inquiryinquest the international community should then continue to be engaged with human rights concerns in zimbabwe in consensus building political forums such as the commission on human rights or its successor the african union peer review mechanism and in the southern african development community the report includes legal analysis of murambatsvina through international and regional and national legal frameworks several domestic and international organizations including the international bar association iba have called for the zimbabwean government to be brought before the icc not only for violations related to the demolitions but also for the governments alleged support of political violence against its critics responding to president mugabes comments supporting the beating of the zctu leaders in september 2006 the executive director of the iba made the following statement mugabes statements add to the weight of evidence that torture and other serious violations of international law are sanctioned at the highest level in zimbabwe this underscores the urgent need for international and regional action to hold the zimbabwean government to account the torture of the trade union activists is not an isolated incident but part of dangerous and illegal system of repression which constitutes crimes against humanity in international law decisive action is required by both the united nations and the african union to end impunity and violence in zimbabwe85 82 institute of war and peace reporting prosecution of mugabe urged january 20 2006 83 the united states is not party to the rome statute for

the icc given the objections of some security council members to the envoys report itself which as stated above suggested an icc case would be difficult to sustain it is unlikely such referral would be made the envoy found that the government of zimbabwe is collectively responsible for what has happened but cautioned that it appears there was collective decisionmaking with respect to both the conception and implementation evidence suggests it was based on improper advice by few architects of the operation86 according to one media source though zimbabwes state security minister has claimed all the decisions to do with the operation emanated from the politburo the ruling partys inner cabinet and were sent through to the government87 the government of zimbabwe has yet to prosecute those who might be responsible for crimes related to operation murambatsvina or the subsequent evictions the victims in most cases lack the financial resources to seek redress in the courts although zimbabwean human rights lawyers have represented groups of victims on several occasions in one such case in november 2005 residents of harare suburb were given temporary stay of eviction by the high court but police ignored the court order and forcibly moved the group to transit camp the inability of the countrys judicial system to protect its citizens or their property or to provide due process to those seeking remedy or compensation suggests fundamental crisis in zimbabwes rule of law zimbabwes food crisis several southern african countries have suffered from chronic food insecurity in recent years stemming from combination of weatherrelated and manmade factors including prolonged drought floods poor economic performance and the impact of hivaids88 zimbabwe has been particularly hard hit grain silos across the country that once held strategic grain reserves three times the populations annual food needs now stand empty experts attribute this food insecurity to unexpectedly severe crop failure89 but some suggest murambatsvina and other government policies significantly limited the populations ability to feed itself particularly in urban areas90 usaid and the world food

shortages analysts believe that disruptions to the farming sector resulting from mugabes land seizure program are the main reason for reduced food production92 nearly all of the countrys 4500 commercial farms have now been taken over the governments land redistribution program is reportedly plagued by inefficiencies with large portions of redistributed land not being actively farmed tractors and other inputs to production are reportedly in short supply thousands of experienced farm workers were reportedly forced to flee seized commercial farms and many of those who now hold farmland have agricultural expertise the governments introduction of price controls in 2007 may further restrict production the countrys seed and fertilizer producers report that the controls have created unrealistic prices which in turn have caused shortages for the latest farming season93 operation taguta in late 2005 the zimbabwean government established operation taguta or eat well move seen by many as an acknowledgment that the governments farm resettlement policies had failed to meet the countrys agricultural production needs with food distribution already under the control of the grain marketing board led by military officers the government established command agriculture system in which the military would be responsible for not only the distribution but also the production of food since the programs inception there have been numerous reports of the illegal seizure of farm equipment the destruction of the fruit vegetable and other cash crops smallscale farmers grow to sell at market to support their families and even army brutality against farmers some critics of the government suggest operation taguta was used by the government as an excuse to deploy military forces throughout the country to control the population94 food as political weapon the mugabe regimes stance on food aid leads many observers to suspect that food is being used as political weapon charge the government denies95 despite assessments by multiple international donor agencies suggesting the need for food assistance president mugabe confounded observers in recent years by repeatedly declaring

civil rights groups and the opposition have reported instances of the ruling party holding campaign rallies in conjunction with government food distributions in some areas government officials

in the prices of food and nonfood items in december 2003 mugabe selected gideon gono credited with turning around troubled commercial bank as governor of the reserve bank of zimbabwe the move was welcomed by some since gono was regarded as successful technocrat however critics maintain that his measures to fight corruption and discover illegally held foreign exchange are being used to damage government opponents and further the interests of zanupf109 regardless of gonos efforts international assessments of zimbabwes economic prospects remain bleak ignoring the advice of the imf the

addition to the governments attempts to revive its flagging agriculture industry through the introduction of command agriculture system see food crisis section above the administration has introduced longterm leases to provide security of tenure for farmers willing to cultivate land nationalized in the 2005 constitutional amendment one of the unintended side effects of mugabes 2000 land reform strategy which resulted in the abolition of land tenure was that farmers were unable to use their land as collateral to obtain bank loans to invest in their farms as result few commercial farmers were able to find the capital to maintain productivity the government began to distribute 99year leases in november 2006 and among the initial recipients were 19 white farmers which came as shock to many after mugabe declared in july 2005 that his land reform program would be complete only when there was not single white on the farms115 there are currently less than 500 white farmers left in zimbabwe some suggest financial institutions may be reluctant to accept the new leases as collateral given that the government reserves the right to cancel the lease if it deems the farm unproductive the government also announced in 2007 its intention to ration electricity to households across the country in order to divert its dwindling supplies for irrigation of zimbabwes winter wheat crop116 more

rather on the basis of capital investment and employment levels119 critics argue the law further deters much needed foreign investment the government has taken steps to crackdown on illegal mining police arrested an estimated 20000 illegal miners in late 2006 including several hundred reportedly legal smallscale miners confiscating gold diamonds emeralds and gold ore since the collapse of the formal economy many of the countrys unemployed have resorted to illegal mining selling their goods on the black market according to reports most of the miners were released after paying fines the

international perspectives the international community has been divided on how to respond to zimbabwes persistent crises in general western nations and institutions have expressed opposition to mugabes methods of rule and have pursued policies intended to pressure the zimbabwe government for reforms in contrast the mugabe government has enjoyed considerable sympathy in africa where he is viewed as an elder statesman and leader of the anticolonial struggle and among the non aligned nations generally this is changing to an extent however with some african leaders concluding that the

adequately allow for the free expression of the will of the electors140 consequently special committee appointed to monitor and respond to the vote consisting of australia south africa and nigeria determined that zimbabwe would be suspended from the commonwealth for one year the suspension was the first public action against mugabe by body that included influential african countries in december 2003 the commonwealth including 19 other african members voted to suspend zimbabwe indefinitely on this occasion the decision was strongly criticized by south africas president mbeki who had by then committed to his policy of quiet diplomacy and by other governments in southern africa mugabe responded by withdrawing zimbabwe from the commonwealth and ruling out any further discussions or possible return141 some speculated as result that the commonwealths action had backfired by placing zimbabwe fully outside the bounds of its influence others argued that indefinite suspension by body including many african members had important symbolic value in africa and worldwide china and iran while many western governments have moved to isolate the mugabe regime china and iran strengthened ties and deepened their involvement in zimbabwes economy china which became active on the continent in the 1950s and 1960s to gain global influence now looks to africa for natural resources to meet the needs

zimbabwe has also found an ally in iran during 2006 visit to tehran president mugabe reportedly secured commitments from iran for direct aid and iranian assistance to its energy agriculture and mining industries reports indicate that iran or one of the gulf countries may also provide technical assistance to zimbabwe to revive the countrys only oil refinery built 40 years ago to process iranian crude most of zimbabwes fuel comes by road from south africa the country has insufficient foreign currency to import fuel in bulk through pipeline from the nearest port beira mozambique to zimbabwe in spite of mugabes assurances of iranian assistance some observers suggest iran may not meet his expectations despite an agreement signed by the two countries in 2005 little financial assistance appears to have been provided as one economic advisor points out at the end of the day whether its china or iran investors want one thing return on their investment and they do not seem to believe they can get that return from zimbabwe145 likewise mugabe traveling to beijing in 2005 to request assistance to deal with the countrys foreign exchange shortfall and fuel shortage received scant 6 million for grain imports reportedly because zimbabwe was deemed unworthy of significant investment146 although mugabe did secure 200 million buyer credit loan from china to promote agricultural production

role in the september 2008 power sharing agreement some analysts point out that mbekis reluctance to openly confront or condemn president mugabe is understandable on number of grounds mugabe lent aid and shelter to the african national congress anc now the ruling party in south africa during its long struggle against white minority rule creating bond of gratitude mugabe enjoys considerable popularity around africa and in south africa itself not least because of his moves to seize lands owned by comparatively wealthy white farmers and this may have constrained mbeki as well nonetheless many have been dissatisfied that south africa which is immensely more powerful than neighboring zimbabwe and which has extensive control over zimbabwes transport links to the outside world as well as over its electricity supplies has not been able to do more to improve the zimbabwe situation as zimbabwes largest trading partner many consider south africa in position to exert substantial leverage at the same time south africa must weigh the unintended effects of such leverage state collapse across its northern border could produce sharp increase in illegal migration and have substantial impact

and an exit strategy for mugabe in exchange for negotiations with the opposition and commitment to free and fair elections have been unsuccessful until recently in 2005 as the imf threatened to expel zimbabwe from the fund for debt payment arrears the country requested loan from south africa for fuel food and electricity as well as to address the imf payments amid rumors that the south african government would make any loan conditional on economic and political reforms the negotiations stalled and mugabe found another source from which to repay the imf dues155 in early 2006 speech mugabe warned mbeki that he should keep away from interference in zimbabwes affairs mbekis zimbabwe policies drew criticism from within his country former president nelson mandela nobel laureate archbishop desmond tutu former opposition leader tony leon and even the ancs ally the congress of south african trade unions cosatu have been vocal detractors cosatu south africas powerful labor confederation strongly opposed the quiet diplomacy policy certain sympathy on the part of cosatu toward the mdc may be inevitable since the mdc has its roots in the union movement cosatu delegations have been forcibly expelled from zimbabwe twice first in 2004 and more recently in late 2006 when cosatu members traveled to harare to express their support for the zctu after the incidents of police violence one cosatu leader remarked we are not quiet diplomats and we will not keep mum when freedom does not lead to respect for workers and human rights156 when the mbeki government issued terse initial statement following the march 2007 arrest of mdc and civil society activists cosatu criticized the government for disgraceful response in the face of such massive attacks on democracy and human rights especially coming from those who owed so much to international solidarity when south africans were fighting for democracy and human rights against the apartheid regime157 defenders of president mbekis approach have argued that he is the only leader with the influence and prestige needed to sway mugabe some claim that mbeki and south african diplomats have already made contribution in zimbabwe helping to prevent the country from slipping into anarchy in 2002 for example158 some observers expressed hope for mbekis mediation role when the president and morgan 154 michael wines influx from

october 2004 after tsvangirais acquittal tsvangirai who had been critical of quiet diplomacy in the past said after the meeting that he welcomed president mbekis efforts to mediate159 but mbeki stunned the mdc and many supporters of democracy in zimbabwe in march 2005 when he told press conference that he had reason to think that anyone in zimbabwe will militate in way so that the elections will not be free and fair he insisted that there will be free and fair election in zimbabwe and that things like access to the public media things like violencefree election have been addressed160 earlier he had termed secretary rices description of zimbabwe as an outpost of tyranny as an exaggeration161 these remarks have left critics questioning the substance behind mbekis diplomacy the future of south africas policy toward zimbabwe may be determined by mbekis successor should the 2008 power sharing agreement falter mbeki who resigned in late september 2008 has been temporarily succeeded by anc deputy president kgalema motlanthe former deputy president jacob zuma among the possible candidates to represent the anc in the next elections was elected as president of the anc in december 2007162 zuma has referred to the zimbabwean president as monster but has defended mbekis quiet diplomacy163 following the march 2008 elections zuma did not call for mbeki to step down as mediator but said i imagine that the leaders in africa should really move in to unlock this logjam164 and called for african leaders to assist mbeki as mediator given the gravity of the situation165 the african union the african union au and its predecessor the organization of african unity oau have been supportive of mugabe in the past in 2002 an oau observer team labeled mugabes election victory legitimate free and fair in july 2004 when the au allowed report critical of the mugabe regime to be circulated at its annual summit some believed the regional body might be indicating change in its approach the 114page report prepared by delegation from the african commission for human and peoples rights achpr that visited zimbabwe in 2002 reportedly criticized the zimbabwe government for police abuses press censorship and compromising the judiciary166 the au tabled the report at the summit however and declared it would keep its contents secret until 159 tsvangirai changes tune on

report slams erosion of rule of law zimbabwe independent july 16 2004 crs40 zimbabwe has had chance to respond in detail according to some media reports the zimbabwean government used procedural regulations and technicalities to prevent its release167 the achpr passed resolution in december 2005 calling on the government of zimbabwe to respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of expression and to allow second factfinding mission to enter the country the achpr resolution was hailed by human rights advocates who suggested this will exert lot of pressure on zimbabwe this is the first time such significant body so close to african heads of state observes and condemns such defiance of human rights compliance168 but like the previous report the second missions findings were rejected by the aus council of ministers in 2006 because of irregularities and procedural flaws169 some observers and international human rights organizations such as the international press institute ipi suggest that the aus repeated rejection of achpr resolutions on zimbabwe tarnishes the integrity of the body as one au official warned if we continue to throw out every human rights report that comes before us people out there will stop taking us seriously170 ipi also suggests that refusal of the au to act on the achpr resolutions or to condemn human rights abuses in zimbabwe damages the credibility of the african peer review mechanism aprm initiative vital part of the new partnership for africas development nepad171 should zanupf fail to abide by the terms of the power sharing agreement criticism from the au may have little effect unless it is accompanied by more substantial policy changes toward mugabes administration zimbabwe has routinely ignored its detractors and frequently denies those who might be critical of the regime access to the country in 2005 au commission chairman alpha konare sent tom nyanduga special rapporteur on refugees internally displaced persons and asylum seekers in africa as his envoy to investigate operation murambatsvina the zimbabwean government prevented nyanduga from conducting his assessment and deported him accusing the envoy of western collusion and agenda adoption172 sadc many of the 14 members of the southern african development community sadc are linked to zimbabwe by common historical experience as well as cultural and economic ties and the

hopeful that these rules might motivate meaningful democratic reforms in zimbabwe particularly since they laid out detailed guidelines for sadc observer missions174 the signatory countries including zimbabwe are pledged to allow sadc observers freedom of movement and access as noted above the sadc observer delegations favorable report for zimbabwes 2005 elections was considered by critics of the mugabe administration to be disappointing although mugabes neighboring leaders have not singled him out for criticism they do appear increasingly concerned with the impact of zimbabwes crisis on their own countries southern african leaders blamed zimbabwe and swaziland for undermining economic growth in the region at sadc summit in lesotho in 2006 botswana has spoken out in the past on regional problems attributed to mugabes policies including the burden placed on the country by zimbabwes refugees in march 2007 following the arrest of tsvangirai and other opposition members tanzanian president jakaya kikwete traveled to harare to discuss the incident and after the sadc summit president mbeki was nominated as mediator sadcs election observer mission to the june 2008 runoff found that the election did not represent the will of the people of zimbabwe and called for dialogue among all political stakeholders toward negotiated solution175 botswana refused to recognize mugabe as president after the june 2008 runoff prospects for the future the future of zimbabwe in the short term remains grave inflation and the cost of living continue to rise and the countrys agriculture industry shows little sign of recovery prospects for zimbabwes youngest generation are equally grim primary school attendance has reportedly dropped dramatically since 2000 and the cost of school fees has risen exponentially many families are unable to afford basic food items not to mention medicines or doctors analysts have cited number of reasons for zimbabwes economic problems including recurrent drought difficulties encountered in implementing economic reforms and industrial competition from comparatively cheap south african imports176 at the same time analysts place considerable responsibility for zimbabwes problems on the policies adopted and actions taken by the government since 1997 the government has taken some fiscal measures to reverse the economic downturn but as hyperinflation continues to rise they have been largely ineffective as the implementation details of the september 2008 agreement are discussed it remains unclear how much influence the mdc will have in pressing its economic policies under unity government 173 sadc principles and guidelines governing democratic elections adopted by the sadc summit mauritius august 2004 available at httpwwwisscoza

origins of the zimbabwe crisis focus helen suzman foundation june 2003 crs42 the government of robert mugabe has displayed little respect for the rule of law which has according to reports in turn deterred desperately needed foreign investors while president mugabes allies may maintain their diplomatic solidarity financial support could dwindle if they do not see return on their investments likewise the african solidarity on which mugabe has relied has waned as countries consider the impact of his policies on their own countries nigeria botswana kenya and zambia for example have become increasingly critical the countrys gdp continues its decline and mugabes inner circle has found itself with dwindling resources from which to draw to maintain support from its civil servants and its security forces the countrys teachers and doctors have gone on strike several times in recent years over 1000 soldiers have reportedly deserted fleeing to south africa177 as zimbabwes economy continues to collapse and its government has found itself increasingly isolated following the 2008 elections the countrys political situation is now at critical juncture the international community has expressed support for the recent power sharing deal but its implementation will require considerable concessions from both sides should it stall or collapse foreign governments may consider tightening sanctions or other punitive measures until an acceptable compromise is reached should the unity government be established the oppositions role in zimbabwes political future may depend on its ability to present unified and credible alternative to zanupf while at the same time demonstrating its willingness to work with moderate elements and put the countrys economy on the path toward recovery 177 zimbabwe armys deserters underscore countrys economic troubles christian science monitor april 25 2007 crs43 figure 1 map of zimbabwe source map resources adapted by crs for other
