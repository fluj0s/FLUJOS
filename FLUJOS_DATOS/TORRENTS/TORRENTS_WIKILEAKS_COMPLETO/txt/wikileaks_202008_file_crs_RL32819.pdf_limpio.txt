manner of the projects estimated cost increase about 147 million is due to scope changes such as the addition of the house and senate expansion spaces about 45 million are attributed to other factors that are partially or outside the ability of aoc to control such as higher than expected bids on the sequence two contract due in part to some unexpected conditions below ground and about 58 million

construction schedules and costs and in some cases have not included accu rate worker safety data this has led to certain expectation gaps within congress while the aocs current scheduled completion date for the cvc is now ptember 2005 gao concluded that given past problems and future risks and uncertainties that the completion date may be delayed until sometime between d ecember 2006 and march

schedules and contract s including those contract provisions that address worker safety such actions are imperative if further cost growth schedule delays and worker safety problems are to be avoided aoc also needs to see that it reports accurate information to congress on the project additionally decisions by the congress will have to be made regarding the additional funding needed to complete
