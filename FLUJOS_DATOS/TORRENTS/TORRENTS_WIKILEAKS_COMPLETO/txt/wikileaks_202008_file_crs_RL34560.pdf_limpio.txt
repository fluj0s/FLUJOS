markets potential and drawbacks summary forests are major carbon sinks storehouses and activities that alter forests can release or sequester carbon dioxide co2 the most common greenhouse gas ghg some carbon markets have been formed under mandatory ghg reduction regimes such as the kyoto protocol and various regional and state initiatives in the united states other markets have formed fo r voluntary efforts to reduce ghg emissions offsets or credits for sequestering car bon or reducing emissions in unregulated sectors are typically allowed in both ma ndatory and voluntary markets forestry activities are among the largestvolume nd lowestcost opportun ities for generating offsets various forestry activities may be feasible for carbon offsets afforestation planting trees on open sites and reforestation planting trees on recently cleared sites are the activities most commonly incl uded for offsets some propose that the carbon stored in longterm wood products such as lumber and plywood could be credited as carbon offsets and mill wastes of ten substitute for fossil fuels to produce energy however shortterm products eg paper and the biomass left in the woods after timber harvesting release carbon ma king the net carbon effects uncertain some forest management practices also might qualify for carbon offsets certified sustainable forest practices provide sy stem of assured longterm forests while activities to increase tree growth face many of the same concerns as longterm wood products finally deforestation is ma jor source of ghg emissions accounting for as much as 20 of anthropogenic emissions thus avoided defo restation especially in the tropics potentially provides an enormous opportunity to reduce ghg emissions however avoide d deforestation is particul arly prone to leakage see below as well as many of the concer ns about forest carbon offsets generally forestry projects may offer considerab market opportunitie s for carbon offsets but several issues have gene rated concerns and controvers one concern especially for compliance markets is whether the project is additional to business as usual an activity that is common practice or industry standard or project that is required under current federal state or local laws cannot be used as an offset functional carbon markets also require costeffective practices to verify carbon sequestration current measurement and monitoring pr actices are costly and have several implementation challenges another concern is that compared to other types of offsets forestry projects present the great est risk of leakage emission leakage can occur if carbon sequestered in one location eg by avoided defo restation leads to carbon release eg from increased harvestin g in another location product leakage could occur if forest carbon sequestration encourages use of more carbonintensive substitutes eg cement or steel forest carbon projects are expected to generate offsets for decades some are concerned that the sequestration will subsequently be negated by human activity eg change in land use or natural occurrence eg forest fire or disease although there are legal and accounting mechanisms that can address this concern implementing these op tions may present challenges particularly for projects in developing nations finally forward crediting to allow early credits for expected sequestration faces many of the same concerns about not fulfilling expectationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34560contents forest carbon markets 1 c m p l i n c f f s t m r k t s 2 k t p r t c l 3

emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gases ghgs2 reducing deforestation and incr easing the amount of carbon stored in forests are approaches that have generated considerable interest for their ability to support climate change mitigation congress is considering climate change legislation that would among other things provide financial incentives for pa rties to reduce ghgs or sequester store co23 the possible use of forests to sequester co2 is part of this larger debate over ghgs and climate change this report describes current market s for forest carbon sequestration the potential for using forest to offset other sources of ghg emissions and the drawbacks related to forest carbon sequestration efforts forest carbon markets the potential economic and environmental impacts of global climate change have led many to consid er regulating ghg emissions from various sources and to seek ways to ameliorate their own ghg missions projects that sequester ghgs or reduce ghg emissions from unregulated econo mic sectors such as forestry can generate offsets or credits to sell to regulated entities or to those who wish to reduce their carbon footprints in either case for regulated entities or for voluntaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34560crs2 4 because offset projects can involve various ghgs they are quantified and described with standard form of measure us ually metric

forestry activities eg fforestation reforest ation and avoided deforestation present opportun ities to offset ghg emissions offsets are commonly projectbased in itiatives involving specific projects or activities whose primary purpose is to re duce avoid or sequester ghg emissions4 parties can develop offsets from wide variety of activities such as renewable energy and agricultural projects5 but forestryrelated projects offer the most potential in terms of volume of ghgs avoided or sequestered offsets or credits earned by an offset project would likely be the currency of most forest carbon markets offsets ar the measurable avoidance reduction or sequestration of co2 or other ghg emissions forest ry projects as offsets raise number of concerns to be credible th emissions reduced voided or sequestered must be additional to business as usual ie wh at would have happened anyway verifiable and permanent these concepts and the problems that arise in assuring credible forestry are discussed later in this report one concern for offset markets in ddition to the drawbacks discussed below is the potential for doublecounting the offsets that is that sellers might try to sell the same offset to multiple buyers thus compliance markets and some voluntary markets require some type of reporting and registration fo r offsets this has led to incentives for independent reporting and re gistry programs as discussed below compliance offset markets mandatory ghg reduction program such as capandtrade system could allow covered entities eg power plants to use offsets to comply with their ghg emissions cap for example regulated entity could purchase offsets rather than reducing direct onsite emissions if the offsets are less expensive assuming that the tonne of co2 reduced avoided or questered through an offset project equates to tonne reduced at regulated source th objective to reduce ghg emissions is met for global climate change it does not matter where or from what source the reduction or sequestration oc curs the effect on the atmospheric concentration of ghgs would be the same although forestryrelated projects are elig ible as offsets in several existing or developing compliance markets forest pr ojects have to date played negligible role if the recent capandtrade pr oposals discussed below are any indication however interest in allowing forestry offsets

least 5 below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012 although the united states originally signed the kyoto protocol it later reject ed participation and thus is not bound by its goals as of november 2007 174 nations and the europ ean union were parties to the treaty although major industrializing countries notably china india and brazil were not signatories to increase flexibility the protocol includes two mechanisms the clean development mechanism cdm and joint implementation ji that allow certain forestry activities to generate offsets clean development mechanism the cdm is projectbased mechanism that permits annex i countries under the ky oto protocol to earn credits for use in achieving their emission targets it is the only mechanism that allows annex i countries to earn credits for actions in nonannex i countries developing countries such as india or china for forestry projects the cdm includes only afforestation planting trees where none were previously growing and reforestation replanting trees on recently cleared forest sites7 further project velopers can only earn credits for additional projects those that would not otherwise have occurred if reforestation is required by countrys ws for example the reforestation project cannot earn credits under the cdm the cdm is the largest compliance offset market in the world both the trading volume and market value of the cdm have grown substantially in recent years see figure 1 although the forestry sector was initially expected to play significant role in the cdm that has not been the case an ipcc report stated that although the forestry sector can make very significant contribution to lowcost mitigation portfolio this opportunity is being lost in the current institutional context and lack of political will to implement and has resulted in only small portion of this potential being realized at present8 indeed of the offsets issued under the cdm to date afforestation and refo restation

states have individual programs that currently or w ill soon mandate re ductions in co2 or ghg emissions for example starting in 1997 oregon has set standards for co2 emissions from new power plants the plants can meet these standards by constraining emissions directly or by purchasing offsets from nonprofit or ganization the oreg on climate trust22 this organization has developed three fore stryrelated offset projects which account for 21 of current offsets to date all of the new facilities have chosen to purchase offsets instead of constraining onsite emissions washington passed similar legislation in 2004 in addition to these cu rrent requirements ca lifornia hawaii and new jersey have passed gislation that would establish statewide reduction programs these programs are still in development proposals in the 110th congress members have introduced several legislative proposals that would establis h ghg emissions reduction program such as capandtrade system23 almost all of the

of offsets by entities not subject to emissions caps in contrast to compliance markets forestryrelated and other land use projects have played much larger role in volunt ary markets 2007 study found that of the different offset categories in the voluntary market fore st sequestration accounted for the largest percentage 36 of transaction volume25 the primary components of the voluntary market are retail offsets and offsets generated through the chicago climate exchange both of which include forestry projects in the united states and elsewhere growing number of organizations and individuals not subject to mandatory emission caps are buying or selling offsets these exchanges are voluntary because there is requirement for these parties to curtail their ghg emissions26 buyers may be interested in offsetting some or all of their ghg emissions from various activitie s reducing their carbon footprint or becoming carbon neutral buyers might so be preparing for future mandatory federal ghg emission reductions getting into the market while prices are relatively low with the expectation that todays carbon offsets will be usable to achieve future federal emission ceilings or cap s sellers are interested in receiving income for various activities which without the vol untary market would likely not occur there is currently registry or tracking system that follows all exchanges in the voluntary market for this reason the preci size or value of the voluntary offset market is unknown however series of world bank reports provides estimates for recent years indicating that the size of the market has increased rapidly every year since 200427 in 2006 the market size was r oughly 20 million metric tons of co2 equivalent mtco2e28 the world bank report cites forecasts of increasing

organizations private and nonprofit entities develop provide or sell retail offsets to busine sses and individuals in the voluntary market32 the quality of the retail offsets in the voluntary market

sequestration in the agricultural and forestry sectors these technical guidelines are likely to provide consistent basis for carbon reporting and for offset projects in both voluntary and compliance markets forestry projects for offsets several types of forestry projects mig ht qualify as offsets for compliance or voluntary carbon markets the capacity of forestry projects to provide offsets is substantial with higher carbon prices in creasing the number of economically feasible projects one study estimated that us forestry projects could sequester more than 100 million mtco2e at carbon price of 5 per tonne or as much as 1200 million mtco2e at 50 per tonne as shown in figure 2 41 subsequent changes in law and policy as well as changes in energy carbon and forestry markets and different assumptions would lead to different conclusions still this potential is significant when compared to the 7054 mtco2e of us emissions in 200642 the inclusion of projects in other countri would affect the quantity and price of offsets this is particularly significan t for forestry since tr opical deforestation and forest degradation have b een estimated to cause as mu ch as 20 of anthropogenic carbon emissions whether to include inte rnational projects in compliance schemes has been subject of extensive debate see avoided deforestation below in addition international forestry projects may face more significant problems than domestic projects as discussed below afforestation and reforestation establishing stands of trees is one of the most basic objectives of forestry afforestation is planting tree seedlings or preparing an area for tree seeding on sites that have been without trees for several years generally decade or more such as pastures or recently abandoned or retired cropland reforestation is similar but applies to s ites recently cleared of trees due to timber harvesting or natural disasterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34560crs11 source prepared by

washington dc nov 2005 pp 421 afforestation and reforestation are common forestry activities included in trading schemes for forest carbon sequestration offsets successful projects must result in established stands to qualify as an offset planting failures can result from disease or adverse ecosystem conditions forest stands generally sequester more carbon than sites without forest cover fo rest biomes store as much as 10 times more carbon in their vegetation than do nonforest biomes usually at l east for decades and for centuries in some ecosystems afforestation will generally sequester more carbon than reforestation because of the carbon release from the site clearing prior to reforestation see longterm wood products below afforestation can provide broad array of other environmental benefits eg improved water quality and habitat for native animal species if the newly established tree stands restore historically native mix of species plan tations including plantations of exotic species probably provide less carbon storage th an natural mixed forests but can still be beneficial especially if fastgrowing species are us ed for products to displace harvests of natural forest s reducing deforestation the opportunities for afforestation are best in areas with long histories of land clearing for agriculture and other uses europe north america china india and the like some countries or regions with substantial ope n land may have limited opportunities for afforestation because of their arid conditions eg central asia sudan in other areas such as the united states strong demand for corn and other agricultural products eg soybeans or il palms to produce ethanol or biodiesel may also limit affore station opportunities00100020003000400050006000700080009000 1 5 15 30

especially in the tropics that can ameliorate the carbon release from tropical logging45 one source reported that ril reduces wood waste by more than 60 and soil distur bance in roads landings and skid trails by almost 5046 however one barrier to increased use of ril is illegal logging in the tropics47 the net carbon consequences of timber harvesting for wood products have been debated extensively with little resoluti on some argue that harvesting increases carbon sequestration by storing carbon in l ongterm products and sequestering largehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34560crs13 48 john

carbon sequestered by reforestation49 both conclusions may be valid in certain circumstances the consequences probably depend on many factors such as the products made and th amount and trea tment of the carbon left on the site thus whether timber harvesting for wood products could be carbon offset is uncertain forest management forest management incl udes variety of practices some are aimed at enhancing growth of the commercially desirable trees other plants compete for space light water nd nutrients the undesirable vegetation can be killed chemically with herbicides mechanically with machines or tools or sometimes by fire with prescribed burning the net result regardless of the tool is that the carbon from the dead vegetation is released by burning or decomposition one study found that mechanical thinning increased total carbon storage in dense young stands where competition had signifi cantly reduced growth rates elsewhere it released carbon by reducing canopy cover and disturbing soils50 this is significant because many forest carbon models pr oject carbon sequestration as fixed percentage of commercial timber volume not of total biomass on the site in contrast using fertilizers can enhance total vegetative grow th without disturbing the soil although many fertilizer s are derived from fossil fuels and thus might not result in total net carbon storage in sum forest ry practices to enhance growth apparently increase carbon sequestration in some circum stances but not in others this limits generalizations about potentia l of forestry practices to offset ghg emissions and raises questions about including growth enhancement for carbon offset projects another significant practice is certified sustainable forestry the sustainability of forests has long been an issue of environmental concern in 1994 the working group on criteria and indicators for the c onservation and sust ainable management of temperate and boreal forests was formed to develop internationally accepted measures of sust ainable forestry51 the 12 member countries representing 90 of the worlds temperate and boreal forests agreed in 1995 on set of criteria and indicators to measure forest conservati on and sustainable management these are presented in the santiago declaration52httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34560crs14 53 see crs report rl34436 the role of offsets in greenhouse gas emissions capand trade program potential benefits and concerns by jonathan l ramseurseveral systems have been developed to certify that forests are being managed sustainably consistent with the crite ria and indicators developed through the montreal process and similar processes for other forested regions the systems include programs from the forest stew ardship council fsc the sustainable forestry initiative sfi and the progr amme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc althoug h the programs differ in ma ny details they have many elements in common such as using ril re foresting after harves ts protecting water quality maintaining habitats for rare species and preserving native peoples rights furthermore most require longterm pla nning for forested areas and independent thirdparty monitoring to assure that implementation is consistent with the systems requirements most systems also require chainofcustody reporting to assure that wood products claiming to be from sustaina ble forests actually come from certified forest lands forest certification clearly provides legally enforceable standard for forest management that could establish perman ent contract for sustainable production it clearly produces environmental benef its and provides carbon sequestration when compared to unregulated timber harvesting however quantification of the carbon offsets that might result from forest certif ication reflecting the variation in forest types and traditional forestry practices poses challenge avoided deforestation as noted above tropical deforestation is estimated to account for about 20 of global anth ropogenic ghg emissions thus avoiding tropical deforestation has great potentia l to reduce ghg emissions since tropical deforestation is currently external to carbon compliance requireme nts it could be substantial source of forest carbon offset s at the project level preventing deforestation is relatively simple stra ightforward action contracts easements and other legal instruments can be created to assure that site is not cleared of its timber however avoiding deforestation is particularly prone to leakage deforestation of anothe r site to provide the desired pr oducts or outcomes this issue is discussed below some of the leakage problem can be addressed by determining offsets for avoided deforestation at the national or regional level this approach is used for some cdm and ji offsets proponents of includi ng aggregate national total for avoided deforestation argue that it lowers comp liance costs since avoiding deforestation can be substantially less expensive than active forestry or ot her emission reduction or sequestration efforts and b it pr ovides compensation to developing tropical third world nations opponents argue that it would be disincentive to and would raise eventual costs for developi ng countries to participate in global ghg emission reduction efforts b it would benefit the political elite of developing nations while their indigenous peoples woul d be further disenfra nchised and c it would delay technological developm ent and implementation to reduce ghg emissions in the industries that cause the emissions53 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34560crs15 54 see world resources institute the greenhouse gas protocol for project accounting dec 2005 at http wwwghgprotocolorgpotential drawbacks of forestryrelated projects although forestryrelated projects ma offer considerable opportunities to mitigate climate change several issues with offsets and with forestry projects have generated controversy the primary concern is the integrity and credibility of offsets generated by forestry activities to be credible forestry offset should provide net co2 reduction or sequestration equal to an emission reduc tion from direct emission source such as smokestack or exhaust pipe this issue is critical particularly if the offsets are to be used in an emissions trading program implementing this objective imposes challe nges for all offset types but forest offsets generally present more hurdles than other projects to generate credible offsets projects must be additional to what would have occurred without the incentive supplied by the carbon market they must be verifiable ie measurable and enforceable they must control or adjust for leakage and they must address the issue of permanence forward crediting is proposed by some to accommodate the long period of carbon accumulation in forests but others are concerned about assuring payments only for actual carbon sequestration these issues are discussed below additionality additionality is significant factor in determining offset integrity indeed if project is not additional it cannot qualify as an offset in compliance market additionality means that the offset project is an activity beyond what would have occurred under businessasusual scenario in other words in the case of forestry project would the sequestra tion have happened anyway test of additionality would examine whether the offset project would have gone forward in the absence of the fore st carbon market for instance does the activity represent common practice or conf orm to an industry standard is the forestry project required under other federa l state or local laws would the sequestration project generate financial gain ie be prof itable due to revenues from outside the offset market54 for example in the united states and canada reforestation following timber harvest would generally not qualify as an offset because most states and provinces require reforestation similarly disposal of sawmill waste by burning to produce energy and displace the use of fossil fuel would not qualify as an offset because all us sawmills burn their waste except for what is sold for paper production for energy additionality is at the crux of an offsets integrity but applying the additionality criterion may present practical challenges assessing projects additionality may involve some degree of subjectivity whic h may lead to inc onsistent additionality determinations for instance it may be impossible to accurately determine what would have happened anyway for some project s data on historic deforestation are sketchy at best making it difficult to assess whether an voided deforestation program would be additional

amount of carbon sequestered meeting these objectives requires measurement mon itoring and enforcement measurement measuring forest carbon seque stration can be problematic various approaches have been taken incl uding tables models and protocols for estimating carbon sequestration by various practices in di fferent locales common limitation is that many estimators use commercial timber volume as the basis for carbon stored but the relationship between commercial volume and carbon sequestered may not be linear for example thinning is forestry practice intended to increase commercial volume by concentrating the same total growth on fewer commercial stems55 total growth also varies wide ly from site to site depending on host of localized physical and environm ental factors thus many observers recommend and some existing carbon markets require field measurements to adjust the estimated carbon storage to ontheground reality56 one problem is that field measurements are expensive and subject to sampling error monitoring to verify that sequestration projects are meeting their stated level of sequestration some level of monitoring is require d for enforceable contracts periodic monitoring is essential to assure that the contract is fulfilled for agreements larger than projects such as avoided deforestation for an entire landholding or country periodic monitori ng becomes more important and more difficult remote sensing eg satellite imagery and field sampling are common practices for monitoring largescale changes but both are expensive and both are subject to sampling error the two practices are commonly used together with field sampling to assure the ontheground accu racy of remotely sensed data enforcement often the reality of project is assured through an enforceable contract such as an easement attached to the forested property to require continued forest cover many existing forest carbon markets require third party verification for forest carbon credits for some markets and practices assurance of sustainable forest management can be obtained through forest certification number of organizations such as the forest stewardship council fsc the

storage and low energy intensity should be considered dovetail partners inc april 28 2008leakage leakage occurs when economic activity is shifted as result of the emission control regulation and as result emission abatement ach ieved in one location that is subject to emission control regulation is diminished by increased emissions in unregulated locations57 in the context of forestryrelated offsets the opportunity for leakage exists on two fronts missions leakage and product leakage emissions leakage compared to other offset types forestry projects particularly those that seque ster carbon by curbing logging likely present the greatest risk of leakage58 for example if large landowners or countries agree to preserve their forests wood processors might simp ly shift their harvests to neighboring landowners or countries as result the to tal harvest total forestation might be unchanged even though par ticular landowners or count ries might have avoided deforestation of their forests the only recognized solution is for majority of landowners or countries to agree to partic ipate in program to reduce deforestation59 product leakage forest products face another type of leakage product leakage producing longterm wood produc ts such as lumber and plywood uses much less energy and thus emits fe wer ghgs than comparable quantities of alternative products used to build homes nd other structures such as concrete and masonry walls and steel and aluminum framing60 thus avoided deforestation might lead builders to replace wood with ot her more energyintensive ghgemitting products the net carbon consequences of such shift are unclear permanence for forestryrelated projects one concern is that the projected sequestration will be halted or reversed forest offset projects are typically expected to generate offsets via sequestration for decades some are concerned that the emission offsets will be subsequently negated by human activity eg change in land use or natural occurrence eg forest fire disease or pestilence permanence is especially problematic fo r forests because forests are composed of living organisms they are born seed s germinate they

removals to assure st able or increasing carbon storage forward crediting many biological sequestration projects ch as afforestation or reforestation present unique challenge because of th significant time gap between the initial project activity eg planting trees nd the actual carbon sequestration although the project may generate considerable offs ets in aggregate the offsets are produced gradually over the course of many years or decades tree growth patterns follow traditional sshape with slow growth in the early years accelerating for many years to decades before tapering off to an eventual maximum the age at which growth has reached its maximum varies widely am ong species as short as 200 years for shortlived species eg aspen and southe rn pines and more than 1000 years for longlived species eg western hemlock and douglasfir however even old growth forests that have little or additional tree growth apparently continue to sequester carbon in the soils62 this aspect of sequestration projects raises the question of how sequestration offsets should be distribute d should they be allotted as they are produced on an annual basis or should they be allotted up front in an aggregate sum based on expected future sequestration the latter option is referred to as forward crediting forward crediting entails risk because th ere is some uncertainty about whether the offsets will actually be realized this risk can be addre ssed through discounting much as the permanence risk is addressed through buffers by retaining percentage of the offsets that are expected over the
