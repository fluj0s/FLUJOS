originally proposed or estimated by the president cbo or congress budget estimates and proposals cbos first budget report for fy2005 the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20052014 outlook january 2004 cont ained baseline estimates and projections for fy2004 through fy20141 the report estimated an fy2005 deficit of 362 billion down from an estimated at that time deficit of 477 billion in fy2004 the actual deficit for fy2004 wa s 412 billion by fy2009 the baseline deficit estimate had fallen to 268 billion under the baseline assumptions the cbo estimates increased discretionary spending at the rate of inflation expected the tax cuts to expire as scheduled and allowed the alternative minimum tax amt relief to expire as scheduled whi ch would then boost receipts the report also under baseline assumptions had the budget in deficit through fy2013 16 billion the baseline estimate s produced small surplus 13 billion in fy2014 the reduction in the deficit afte r calendar year 2010 leading to the small surplus was largely explained by the scheduled expiration of major tax cuts after calendar 2010 producing large increase in revenues cbos budget reports generally include the estimated budgetary costs including higher or lower debt service costs of lected policies not included in the baseline estimates these alternative policies have included the cost of extending expiring tax provisions in cbos january 2005 report this would increase the fiveyear cumulative deficit by 103 billion and th 10year cumulative deficit by 14 trillion reforming the alte rnative minimum tax 147 b illion fiveyear cumulative increase in the deficit and 430 billion cumulative increase over 10years it provided several alte rnative assumptions about the growth rate of

increasing discretionary spending at the growth rate of gross domestic product gdp 236 billion fiveyear cumulative increase in the deficit and 13 trillion 10y ear cumulative increase president bushs fy2005 february 2004 budget called for extending and making permanent large number of the tax cuts adopted in 2001 and 2 003 the treasurys estimates at that time of the tax proposals produced 213 billion revenue reduction from admin istration baseline estima tes between fy2005 andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32264crs4 fy2009 and 1240 billion revenue reduc tion between fy2005 and fy2014 most of the cost of extending the tax cu ts would fall on the budget after fy2009 the administration modified its presentation of the current services baseline estimates instead of following the tr aditional method of c onstructing baseline estimates as set out in the balanced budg et and deficit contro l act of 1985 and the congressional contro l and impoundment act of 1974 the administrations fy2005 current services baseline assumed the exte nsion of certain tax provisions that by current law are scheduled to expire excluded the future cost of one time events such as fy2004 emergency funding and included timing adjustment to the calculation of federal pay increases for fy2005 the administrations modified current services deficit timate was 33 billion smaller th an the traditional baseline estimate by fy2009 the administrations modified estimated ba seline deficit was 60 billion smaller than the trad itional baseline ficit estimate the administrations budget provide d minimum amount of information beyond fy2009 the budget did include estimates of the cumulative proposed revenue changes and proposed mandatory spending changes for the periods fy2005 through fy2009 and fy2005 through fy2014 but little other information for the individual years after fy2009 in march 2004 cbo released revised ba seline estimates including 1 billion increase to 363 billion in the expected deficit for fy2005 the revised projections also had deficit of 15 billion in fy2014 instead of the surplus expected in the january estimates the cbo september 2004 revisions had smaller 348 billion fy2005 baseline deficit estima and larger fy2014 ba seline deficit 65 billion estimate than its previous estimates the administration provided revised estimates of the pr esidents budget in the midsession review july 30 2004 in general th revisions showed improvement in the budget outlook with smaller deficits recovery in receipts and somewhat higher outlays through fy2009 the net in crease in estimated receipts between the january and july reports came from change s in underlying economic assumptions and technical reestimates rather than any substantial changes in policy most of the increase in outlays between the two estimates came from changes in policy in january 2005 cbo included revise d baseline budget estimates for fy2005 in its budget report the budget and economic outl ook fiscal years 20062015 the report had revised fy2005 baseline ficit 368 billion that was similar to the baseline deficit estimate 362 billion that cbo had made year earlier in january 2004 the presidents fy2006 budget request feb ruary 2005 contained revised and reestimated fy2005 budget data including larger deficit estimate for fy2005 427 billion than it had shown in its ju ly 2004 midyear report 331 billion the proposed policy changes combined with ch anges in underlying assumptions produced smaller receipts larger outlays and larger deficit for fy2005 than in the administrations previous estimates the presidents fy2006 budget included the estimated effects of his proposed defe nse supplemental for the fy2005 budget cbos analysis march 2005 of the presidents fy2006 budget proposals producedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32264crs5 2 some things are known with certainty about the direction of future spending and receipts demographics can partly determine the shape of future budgets in the next decade the beginnings of the retirement of the baby boom generation will rapidly increase the spending for social security and medicare as well as other federal spending or tax breaks for the elderly because virtually all those who will become eligible for these benefits are alive today estimating the growth in the populations eligible for these programs is relatively straightforwarda smaller fy2005 deficit 394 billion smaller outlays nd similar receipts to those in the administration forecast see table 1 the administrations midsession review msr july 2005 and cbos budget and economic outlook an update update august 15 2005 included smaller deficit estimates than in their respectiv budget reports released earlier in 2005 omb reduced its fy2005 deficit estimate to 333 billion 27 of gdp from the 427 billi on 35 of gdp defic it estimate in february 2005 cbos fy2005 deficit estimate fell to 331 billion 27 of gdp from its march 2005 baseline deficit estimate of 365 billion 30 of gdp the reduction in the deficit estimates resulted from higherthanexpected receipts in 2005 that did not result from po licy change the administration expected the higher receipts to persist in slightly diminishing amounts throughout its five year forecast period cbo expects the higher receipts to diminish fairly rapidly over the next several years and ve little longterm effect on the budget the cause of the higher receipts remains somewhat uncerta in additional data that are not yet available are needed to determine the cause of the higher receipts once the cause is known whether the higher receipts are mporary or persistent will also likely be known uncertainty in budget projections all budget estimates and projections are i nherently uncertain their dependence on assumptions that are themselves subject to substantial variation over short time periods makes budget estimate s and projections susceptible to fairly rapid and dramatic changes2 information in appendix the uncertainties of budget projections of cbos budget report the budget and economic outl ook fiscal years 20052014 january 2004 indicated how greatly the budget outco can be altered especially over time in this case over five years by changes in economic and the related technical factors that underpin the budget estimates cbo in cluded but not separa tely discussion of uncertainty in its january 2005 budget re port the chapter contains discussion of optimistic and pessimistic alternative scenarios for cbos baseline projection the optimistic scenario assumes more favorable ec onomic and budget conditions than the baseline while the pessimistic scenario assumes ss favorable conditions than the baseline cbo estimated that the 10year cumulative optimistic and pessimistic baseline surpluses or deficits would be 8 trillion apart according to cbo twothirds of the growth in the difference occurs in the last five years of the estimates figure 1 is from cbos january 2005 budget and economic outlook httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32264crs6 figure 1 uncertainty in cbos projections of the surplus or deficit under current policies deficit or surplus as percentage

or surplus will have 90 chance of falling somewhere between the top and bottom of the fan over the five years covered the presidents fy2005 february 2004 budget also included information on budget uncertainty in the chapter comparis on of actual to estima ted totals in the analytical perspectives volume of the budget the administration used budget data from fy1982 to fy2003 to produce statistical measures of the differences between the estimated and actual surpluses or deficits over these years according to the administrations february 2004 calculations there would be 90 chance that the fy2009 budget will have deficit or rplus that would fall within 500 billion above or below the administra tions then currently estima ted deficit for that year this produced range of outcomes from deficit of approx imately 740 billion to surplus of approximately 260 billion with in which the deficit or surplus has 90 chance of falling budget projections are very dependent on the underlying assumptions about the direction of the economy and expected fu ture government policy and how these interact along with other factors such as changing demographics that affect the budget any deviation from the assumptions used in the budget estimates such as faster or slower economic growth higher or lower inflation differences from the expected or proposed spending and tax policies or changes in the technical components of the budget models can ve substantial effects on moving the eventual budget outcomes away from the pr evious budget estimates and projections source chart created by cbo from the budget and economic outlook fy2006fy2015 january 2005 p 11 note this figure calculated on the basis of cbos forecasting track record shows the estimated likelihood of alternative projections of the budget deficit or surplus under current policies the baseline projections described in this chapter fall in the middle of the darkest area of the figure under the assumption that tax and spending policies will not change the probability is 10 that actualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32264crs7 deficits or surpluses will fall in the darkest area and 90 that they will fall within the whole shaded area actual deficits or surpluses will be affected by legislation enacted in future years including decisions about discretionary spending the effects of future legislation are not reflected in

documents that they expect unde r existing policies and assumptions that demographic pressures will produce large and persistent deficits cbo states in the decades beyond cbos projection period the aging of the babyboom generation combined with rising health care costs will cause historic shift in the united states fiscal situation over the next 30 years the number of people age 65 or older will double while the number of adults under age 65 will increase by less than 15 percent driven by rising health care costs spending for medicare and medicaid is increasing faster than can be explained by the growth of enrollment and general inflation alone if excess cost growth c ontinued to average 25 percentage points in the future federal spending for dicare and medicaid would rise from 42 percent of gdp today to bout 115 percent of gdp in 2030 outlays for social security as share of gdp are projected to grow by more than 40 percent in the next three decades under current law from about 42 percent of gdp to more than 6 percent by c ontrast federal revenues credited to social security are expected to remain close to their current level around 5 percent of gdp over that period together the growing resource demands of social security medicare and medicaid will exert pressure on the budget that economic growth alone is unlikely to alleviate consequently policymakers face choices that involve reducing the growth of federal spending increasing taxation boosting federal borrowing or some combina tion of those approaches14 omb echoed the cbo language in the presidents budget documents the document included section on the longterm fiscal challenge that stated that unlike the administrations positive nearterm fiscal expectations the same cannot be said of the longter m deficit picture as result of long standing imbalances between what major entitlement programs currently promisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32264crs24 15 omb budget of the united states go vernment for fiscal year 2006 feb 2005 p21 16 potential gdp represents an estimate of what gdp would be if both labor and capital were as fully employed as is possiblein benefits and the resources expected to be available to meet those promises due to combination of demographic and cost pressures social securitys and medicares unfunded obligations pose the real fiscal danger to the federal budget and to our economy in general15 the shortterm budget outlook can change when it is buffeted by economic or policy changes as indicated by both cbo and omb the longterm budget outlook is expected to be dominated by the spe nding growth for social security medicare medicaid and other programs for the elde rly as the baby boom generation begins retiring in large numbers in the next decade not only will these programs be affected but their constant growth will put great stress on the rest of the budget the governments ability to finance its oblig ations and the ability of the economy to provide the resources needed the tax cuts and spending increases of the last few years have not produced the difficult fiscal future but they appear to have made solution more difficult the budget and the economy the budget and the economy affect each other unequally small economic changes have more significant effect on the budget than the effect large policy changes have on the economy the wo rsethanpreviouslyexpected economic conditions that lasted from 2001 into 2003 pl ayed substantial role directly and indirectly in the deterior ation of the budget outlook over those years the rebound

product gdp will grow about as fast as potential gdp16 under governmental policies that are in fiscal balance return to economic growth that is close to the growth of potential gdp should reduce or eliminate deficit or produce surplus in both the presidents budget and in cbos budget reports the budget under current policies ex periences shrinking deficit and under cbos january 2005 baseline moves into surplus in fy2012 under the cbo alternative policies based on cbo estimates the deficit grows as percentage of gdp it does not shrink or disappear durin g period of expected normal economic growth this result implies that the budget has basic fiscal imbalance that cannot be eliminated by economic growth to pr oduce balanced budget or one in surplus will require spending reductions or tax increases the last extremely positive budget outl ook that was forecast in early 2001 and was substantially based on the favorable future economic conditions that were then expected along with government policies that were in approximate balance if not favoring surpluses that outlook expected continuation in the overall improvement of the budget situation that had occurred since the early 1990s much of the budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32264crs25 improvement in the 1990s had come from st rong and sustained economic growth and the rest from policy changes to reduce the deficit when
