member dies the house and senate carry out number of actions based on chamber rules statutes and longstanding practices some congressional practices related to the death of sitting member predate the national legislature established by the constitution on october 23 1775 the continental congress sittin g in philadelphia was informed that peyton randolph delegate from virginia and president of the continental congress suddenly departed this life the day before and resolved that its members would attend his funeral as mourners with crape round their left arm and continue in mourning for the space of one month committee of three delegates was appointed to superintend the funeral and the reverend jacob duché rector of st peters episcopal and christ churches1 was requested to prepare proper discourse to be delivered at the funeral2 during the first congress 17891791 the first instances of the death of sitting senator and representative occurred senator william grayson of virginia died on march 12 1790 direct mention of the event is recorded in the senate journal or the annals of congress 3 on june 1 1790 the house was informed of the death of representative theodorick bland of virginia the house ordered the virginia delegation to be committee to superintend the funeral and that the house attend the same the next day it was ordered that the house members go into mourning for one month by the usual method of wearing crape around the left arm 4 1 see university of pennsylvania penn in the 18th century jacob duché 17371798 website at httpwwwarchivesupenneduhistyf

graysons demise occurred at the beginning of the third session of the first congress on december 6 1790 senator john walker was ppointed to the seat held by senator grayson by the governor of virginia and served in the senate from march 31 to november 9 1790 taking his seat in the chamber on april 26 when senator james monroe was elected to the seat by the virginia legislature when senator walker took his seat on the first day of the third session the journal noted that he had come to the senate in place of senator grayson see senate journal 1 st cong 2nd sess april 26 1790 washington gales

of direct official recognition of senator graysons death does not conclusively demonstrate that the senate took action during the early years of the republic substantially verbatim records of congressional pro ceedings were not required available records are limited official minutes of measures considered and formal actions taken by the chamber in the journal of each chamber moreover the senate until 1794 met in secret accordingly while it appears that the senate adopted resolution in response to senator graysons death it cannot be determined whether individual senators spoke on the matter or whether the chamber marked the occasion with moment of silence or other tribute the first public direct acknowledgment by the senate of the death of one of its members appears to have occurred on march 19 1806 the day after the death of senator james jackson of georgia in response the senate adopted resolutions appointing committee to superintend the funeral attend the funeral notify the house observe 30 days of mourning and wear crape see senate journal 9th cong 2nd sess march 19 1806 washington gales and seaton 1821 p 60 searchable version of the senate journal entries

of the expenses of funeral services for sitting members services were sometimes held in the house5 or senate6 chamber on february 27 1838 for example funeral services for representative jonathan cilley of maine were held in the hall of the house with the house and senate in attendance7 when services or interment were not held in washington dc it was the practice of both chambers to appoint committee of members to escort the remains of deceased colleague to their final destination on june 28 1847 the house and senate each voted to accompany the remains of senator john fairfield of maine from his house to the depot where they were to be delivered to representative franklin clark who accompanied them to maine 8 by the 41st congress 1869 1871 it had for long time been custom to appoint joint committee to attend the remains of deceased senator or member to his home as in the instance of senator daniel s morton of minnesota on july 14 1870 9 in contemporary times chamber rules and statutes set out some of the congressional response to the death of sitting member and former members who served as speaker10 evidence from the senate journal house precedents and other historical documents shows that some longstanding observances such as adjourning briefly as mark of respect to the deceased appointing member delegations to attend funerals of deceased colleagues or paying the costs of funeral from public funds may be employed other customs such as wearing crape holding services in the house or senate chambers 11 or appointing members to escort the body back to the home state have not been observed for at least several decades in addition to some evolutionary changes in institutional patterns it appears that contemporary congressional response is affected by number of external factors including the following 5 funeral services were held for 31 deceased representatives who died in office between 1820 and 1940 see clerk of the house website funerals in the house chamber at httpclerkhousegovart_historyhouse_historyfuneralshtml 6 senate documents indicate that between 1812 and 1959 funeral services were held in the senate chamber for 40 people including vice president george clinton 1812 35 senators who died in office and four former senators see funerals held in the senate chamber retrieved from the senate library and available from the authors upon request 7 following the services funeral procession accompanied th body of representative cilley to place of interment the procession consisted of the chaplains of the house and senate sevenmember

branch department secretaries judges of the supreme court and its officers foreign ministers and citizens and strangers see congressional globe vol 6 february 26 1838 washington blair and rives 1838 p 200 while the house and senate typically voted to attend services held in washington dc for sitting member the presence of officials from the executive and judicial branches and diplomatic corps appears to be atypical partial explanation may be found in the circumstances of representative cilleys death representative cilley was killed in duel with representative william j graves of kentucky on february 24 1838 congress subsequently passed legislation prohibiting the giving or accepting within the district of columbia of challenges to duel chap xxx feb 20 1839 5 stat 318 see biographical

if the house is in session the death of sitting member is typically announced on the floor specific protocol has been identified but notices of death have typically been made by the speaker by member who indicates that they have been informed by house leaders of the death of colleague or by member from the decedents state delegation depending on floor business the house may continue with pending matters suspend business for special order speeches and other memorials to the deceased member or immediately adjourn for the day in honor of the decedent 13 12 in addition to congressional activity related to the death of sitting member or former speaker 4 usc 7 provides that the american flag be flown at half staff for former speaker of the house for 10 days from the day of his or her death and on the day of death and the following day for member of congress in practice the flag is typically flown at half staff on the capitol and congressional buildings in washington dc from the day of death until the funeral of the deceased member 13 regardless of when the house adjourns on the day the death of member is acknowledged it adjourns as further mark of respect to the memory of the decedent

committee of members from the chamber in which the deceased served to prepare the body for transport to family or friends the measure provided for specially appointed sergeant at arms to accompany the body to its final destination s 236 would have authorized payment for the preparation and transport of deceased member and prohibited payment on any other related expenses in introductory remarks the bills sponsor senator william alfred peffer of kansas noted that the costs associated with member funerals were rising and that the services themselves were not usually conducted reverently and with that outward deportment which ought to characterize the bearing of eminent persons who accompany the remains of public man s 236 was reported by the committee on civil service but the senate took further action 54 finally some concern was expressed in 1906 after representative robert adams jr of pennsylvania committed suicide and left letter for speaker joseph cannon indicating that he would accept payment of his funeral expenses but asked that the house not appoint committee or hold memorial services55 in contemporary practice as described below both chambers may pay for funeral services
