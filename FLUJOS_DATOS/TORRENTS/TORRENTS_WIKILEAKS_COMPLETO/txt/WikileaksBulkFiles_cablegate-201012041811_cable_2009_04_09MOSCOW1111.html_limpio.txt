rs subject fm lavrov discusses missile defense and iran with codel levin classified by ambassador john r beyrle for reasons 14b and d 1 s summary foreign minister lavrov told visiting codel levin april 15 that arms control issues were russias top priority noting that moscow was waiting for concrete proposals including specific language from the us on poststart treaty agreement lavrov said he recognized that the us would not want to address the link between offensive and defensive weapons in the poststart negotiations but it would be important to have such dialogue in the future russia was interested in developing joint missile defense system md with the us but we should start from scratch with joint threat assessments determination of necessary resources and best location for md assets lavrov rejected quid pro quo in which the us would discontinue its md plans for eastern europe in exchange for russia pressuring iran to end its nuclear weapons program emphasizing that each issue should be considered separately he acknowledged that moscow was concerned about irans longerrange missile development and said russia would be prepared to undertake dualtrack approach towards irans nuclear program offering incentives to tehran but keeping in reserve measures within the agreed framework he reconfirmed that moscow had suspended the sale of s300s to iran for the moment in followon meeting dfm sergey ryabkov stressed that while russia was interested in working with the us on md it would be difficult for russia to join us md effort that included sites in poland and the czech republic and urged that if the us intended to pursue sites in europe they should be further west and south so as to diminish the effect on russian capabilities ryabkov emphasized that one can deliver iran to the us except the us itself and argued that while the s300 sale was frozen the less moscow heard from washington about it the better end summary 2 c in meeting with foreign minister sergey lavrov in moscow april 15 chairman of the senate armed services committee carl levin dmi together with sasc members bill nelson dfl and susan collins rme emphasized that they were united in their hope that the us and russia could strengthen their cooperation to address common challenges noting the senates constitutional role in ratifying treaties and providing advice and recommendations on foreign policy issues to the president senator levin raised missile defense md as an issue that had divided the two countries but should unite them he suggested that if russia and the us could work together on md it would send powerful message to those who might threaten us including to iran 3 c fm lavrov welcomed the senators visit and noted that it was timely coming two weeks after the first meeting between presidents obama and medvedev he highlighted the important role parliaments play in building constructive relationships and expressed the hope that the us and russia could overcome the inertia that had characterized the relationship in the past arms control npt 4 c lavrov said that arms control issues were russias top priority the usrussia agenda was positive even though we had differences moscow hoped the us administration would submit the comprehensive test ban treaty for ratification and would reconsider sending the 123 agreement to the hill he welcomed president obamas remarks supporting nuclear weapons reductions saying that such reductions were not just matter of security for the us and russia but carried political message that would be important for the 2010 review of the nonproliferation treaty npt while characterizing the elimination of nuclear weapons as noble goal lavrov said it was not an immediate project we needed to have some clear proposals which would give others clear idea of the way forward he suggested that the next stage after the poststart negotiations should consider how to engage others such as the uk in discussions of further reductions as well as looking at tactical nuclear weapons 5 c there was lot to do on nonproliferation issues lavrov said including iran and north korea pakistan was concern and we should think about engaging them as well as india and israel the us and russia had cooperated to moscow 00001111 002 of 005 address the danger of nonstate actors acquiring nuclear material though programs such as the global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism and security council resolution 1540 the us and russia should also look at ways to strengthen the npt regime including how to universalize the additional protocol we should also work on issues like fuel supply the nuclear fuel center russia had started and programs like the global nuclear energy partnership poststart 6 c lavrov expressed appreciation for the senates confirmation of rose gottemoeller as as for vci noting that the us and russia had lot of work to do to achieve followon agreement to the start treaty the issue would be discussed at the meeting between dvbr director anatoliy antonov and as gottemoeller in rome on april 24 as well as in his meeting with the secretary in washington in may the teams would report to the presidents in july and hope to reach framework agreement by the end of the year he said that while the presidents in their statement april 1 had endorsed reductions below the moscow treaty limits and had agreed to use many of the verification procedures of the start treaty moscow was waiting for more concrete proposals from the us including specific language 7 c lavrov highlighted the april 1 joint statements reference to the link between offensive and defensive weapons saying that the balance between the two that had existed in the soviet union had been thrown off kilter when the us withdrew from the abm treaty he stressed that he recognized this did not mean the us would support addressing the linkage during the poststart negotiations but it was important to have discussion on it at some point in the future missile defense and iran 8 c senator levin said the sasc was interested in exploring the possibility of us and russia working together on md the us was focused on the threat from iran but he recognized that russia may have broader perspective however we were both opposed to nucleararmed iran which would be able to put pressure on other countries in the region the us also perceived the possibility of an iranian longrange missile as threat he noted that press reports indicated that medvedev had told henry kissinger and the harthagel commission that he was concerned that the iranian nuclear program was more of threat than russia had previously believed lavrov emphatically corrected this saying medvedev had expressed concern about irans missile launch noting that the us had made commitments to poland and the czech republic senator levin said the us would need to consider how to keep those commitments and include europe in common md program with russia 9 c agreeing that md should unite the us and russia rather than divide us lavrov said russia was interested in developing md system with the us but the us proposals for an md system in poland and the czech republic 3rd site disrupted the balance between the us and russias nuclear potential he stressed that thenpresident putins kennebunkport proposal for cooperative md effort using russian resources joint analyses and determinations of the threat and data exchange centers was still on the table he welcomed president obamas statement that if the iran nuclear issue were resolved satisfactorily there would be less need for the 3rd site but took care to emphasize that russia did not support quid pro quo between russia helping to get iran to end its nuclear weapons program and the us discontinuing its deployment in eastern europe these two issues should be dealt with separately on their own merits lavrov stressed 10 c noting that the congressional budget office had presented three alternatives on the md project lavrov said this showed there were issues with the proposal hastening to add that russia did not endorse any of the three alternatives lavrov commended the administrations intent to review them noting this was the difference with the new administration it was willing to listen and take the time to analyze the alternatives instead of saying this is what moscow 00001111 003 of 005 must be done everyone must say yes sir 11 c in response to senators levin question why russia was not more concerned about irans missile capabilities since russia was closer to iran lavrov said moscow was not complacent we are closer but whenever russian negotiators had protested to the us side that the proposed radar could cover russia up to the urals and the interceptors could reach russian territory the us response had simply been that the system was not aimed at russia as medvedev and putin had said when there is something risky on the ground you need to take it into account russia had warned it would need to take countermeasures if the 3rd site was deployed and that it would put missiles in kaliningrad noting that moscow would announce soon just how much it had withdrawn from kaliningrad lavrov said he hoped the us and russia could find common ground on md 12 c lavrov cautioned that russia did not perceive iran in the same way as the us iran for russia was much more than country which might cause concern in the international community russia opposed iran getting nuclear weapon because russia did not want any more members of the nuclear club but iran and russia were historical and traditional partners and neighbors with rich bilateral agenda lavrov said he was certain iran wanted to have full nuclear fuel cycle and would negotiate from that basis it was unfortunate that the us had not accepted the proposals few years before when iran only had 32 centrifuges now they had over 5000 nonetheless russia wanted iran to cooperate fully with the iaea and implement and eventually ratify the additional protocol as agreed to in the e3plus3 statement russia wanted iran to prove the peaceful nature of its nuclear program in verifiable way 13 c lavrov commended the new us approach to iran welcoming president obamas readiness for the us to engage fully in talks with iran willingness to discuss all the issues was welcome step and one which russia had been advocating for several years lavrov said iran wielded lot of influence in the region including on afghanistan iraq hizbollah hamas gaza etc iran had long been concerned about israel and saw pakistan as nuclearweapons competitor putin had asked ahmadinejad during meeting in tehran few years before why he made such antiisraeli statements but ahmadinejad had not responded only saying that iran was not doing anything in the nuclear sphere different from brazil putin had replied that brazil was not in the middle east while iran wanted to dominate the region and the islamic world which was of concern to arab governments the us should realize that the arab street considers iranian leaders to be heroes 14 c noting that russia was watching events in iran closely lavrov said moscow would be prepared to undertake the dualtrack approach first offering incentives to iran but keeping in reserve measures within the agreed framework the administrations new approach give us much better chance than we had in the past we will do everything we can to make it work lavrov said 15 c senator nelson said he was encouraged by the fms remarks noting that it might be possible to consider cooperating on use of russias radars at gabala and armavir he said he hoped lavrov was right that iran would be deterred from building nuclear weapon but he was skeptical the best deterrence might be for the us and russia to cooperate on md s300 sales 16 s senator levin said that russia had taken practical and pragmatic step with the suspension of the sale of s300 missiles to iran senator levin said this helped make israel less nervous and sent message to iran that the us and russia were working more closely together on iran issues lavrov acknowledged that russia was not supplying the system for the moment but reiterated the usual mantra that russias s300 contract with iran did not violate any international or national laws or arms control regimes and that the s300s were defensive system only he added that nothing russia had sold iran had been used against anyone whereas us weapons provided to georgia had been used moscow 00001111 004 of 005 against russian soldiers this did not mean the us did not have the right to sell weapons to georgia but moscow did not want repeat of the august 2008 conflict overall he said the iranians had legitimate security concerns they had been attacked more than once by their neighbors and saw pakistans nuclear status as competition for regional leadership 17 s in followon meeting with dfm ryabkov senator levin asked whether iran believed the s300 sale was canceled or just suspended ryabkov replied that contract existed and it was impossible to break contract without consequences he repeated that moscow had taken us and israeli concerns into account and at present russia was not providing any components of the system to teheran thus it was obvious the degree to which iran was dissatisfied with this he said but the contract was not canceled it was merely frozen ryabkov stressed he argued that the less we hear from washington about this the better afghanistanpakistan 18 c senator collins expressed appreciation for russias allowing transit of nonlethal equipment to isaf in afghanistan and asked how the us and russia could work together to counter terrorism in afghanistan and pakistan lavrov said pakistan was place were lot of problems start for afghanistan and questioned the term moderate taliban he said the people on the unscr 1267 committee list should be blacklisted for as long as possible but for anyone else as long as they renounced terrorism cooperated with the kabul government and refrained from extremist activity it would be all right to deal with them ryabkov meeting 19 c in followup meeting with dfm ryabkov immediately afterwards ryabkov cited the nonpaper lavrov had given the secretary in the hague on march 31 and said there was already good basis to cooperate with the us on md progress had been made in the nato russia council on theater missile defense and moscow believed there was more that could be done there but he reiterated lavrovs position that bilateral discussions would need to start from scratch he disagreed with senator levins statement that the system could not have significant impact on russias nuclear capabilities he noted that russia was more concerned about the radar than the interceptor sites because the former could see the location of russias strategic forces but even with the interceptors nobody could predict what would be at those sites in 10 years time in response to senators levins asking whether the deployments couldnt be limited by an agreement ryabkov acknowledged that was possibility but stressed that the radar could still be used with other us md assets the sites in poland and the czech republic were part of global md architecture which when linked together could almost knock russia out 20 c ryabkov stressed that while the us and russia were not adversaries now intentions could change whereas capabilities were much harder to change he noted that the countries in eastern europe saw the 3rd site as more of geopolitical issue bringing them closer to the west than as response to potential threat from iran we are not in zerosum game and we do not want to use your possibly legitimate security concern as geopolitical pawn ryabkov argued noting link to the poststart negotiations ryabkov said the greater the reductions in number of warheads each side could possess the more strategically important md became he added that it would be politically difficult for russia to join us md effort that included sites in poland and the czech republic if the us intended to pursue sites in europe they should be further west and south so as to diminish the effect on russian capabilities 21 c in response to senator levins question whether it would be possible to develop joint radar system with russian radars at gabala armavir and moscow connected to us aegis and thaad systems ryabkov responded that he had not considered such an idea before and would need to think about it such system he noted would become strategic and would lack the xband capability of the radar proposed moscow 00001111 005 of 005 for the czech republic since all the systems cited were earlywarning radars only but it could be an option 22 c ryabkov said russia hoped it would be possible to have meaningful dialogue with iran and noted that president obamas remarks had had strong impact in teheran and the arab world but it was still difficult to predict how teheran would react he characterized the p5plus 1 e3plus3 statement as very promising but claimed experience showed iran would not make concessions under pressure he emphasized that it was very clear that one can deliver iran to the us except the us itself civilian space cooperation 23 c in response to senator nelsons question about prospects for increased civilian space cooperation and what would happen when the us was fully dependent on the soyuz spacecraft to reach the international space station ryabkov said he saw difficulty with meeting the uss needs and said we should both be forwardleaning he noted that roscosmos had suggested to nasa that russia cooperate on development of the uss new spacecraft but the idea had not been pursued ryabkov proposed we discuss the issue further with roscosmos and said moscow favored closer cooperation with the us and europe in this area while it was not linked to md the more progress we could make on md the better able we would be to move forward on other issues 24
