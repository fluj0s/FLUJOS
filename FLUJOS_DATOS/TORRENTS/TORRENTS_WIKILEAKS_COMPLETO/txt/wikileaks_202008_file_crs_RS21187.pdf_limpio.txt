professional offices of health care providers and gymnasiums3 although the sweep of title iii is broad there are some limitations on its nondiscrimination requireme nts failure to remove ar chitectural barriers is not violation unless such rem oval is readily achievable4 readily achievable is defined as easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense5 reasonable modifications in practices policies or proce dures are required unless they would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods servi ces facilities or privileges or they would result in an undue burden6 an undue burden is defined as an action involving significant difficulty or expense7 the remedies and procedures of section 204a of the civil rights act of 1964 are incorporated in title iii of the ada8 this allows for both private suit and suit by the attorney general when there is reasonable cause to believe that there is pattern or practice of discrimination against individuals with disabilities monetary damages are not recoverable in private suits but may be av ailable in suits brought by the attorney general9 the impact of these provisions on sma ll businesses was of concern to congress when the ada was enacted generally title iii provisions were not to become effective for eighteen months and there were specifi c further extensions for small businesses concerning the requirements for new constr uction and alterations actions under section 303 of the ada were not allowed during the firs t six months after the effective date for businesses that employed 25 or fewer and have gross recei pts of 1000000 or less similarly section 303 actions we re not allowed during the firs t year after the effective date against businesses that employed 10 or fewer employees and had gross receipts of 500000 or less10 section 204c of the civil rights act require s that when there is state or local law prohibiting an action also prohibited by title ii civil action may be brought before the expiration of thirty days after written tice of such alleged act or practice has been given to the appropriate state or cal authority although the ada does not specifically incorporate this requirement seve ral courts have found that it was prerequisite to suit11 but the one court of appeals to consider this issue found that this requirement was not incorporated in the ada12 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21187crs3 12 continued provide notice to defendant before filing suit under title iii of the americans with disab ilities act 2001 wisc l rev 107 2001 this article argues that the best reading of the ada is that it requires like title ii of the civil rights ac t that plaintiffs provide thirty days notice to state or local agency responsible for combatin g discrimination prior to filing suit the article concludes that this interpretation renders federal legislation to provide notice unnecessary 13 hr 914 was introduced by rep foley 14 s 782 was

location at which the violation occurred and the date on which the violation occurred the notice also shall inform the defendant that civil action may not be commenced until the expiration of ninety

these requirements are not met when civil action is filed the court shall impose an appropriate sanction on the attorneys involved18 if the criteria are subsequently met and the action proceeds the

judiciary on hr 3590 on may 18 200019 arguments for and against requiring notification arguments in favor of requiring notification act the main argument in favor of requiring tification is that such notification would prevent what some of the legislations suppor ters have described as drive by lawsuits in his testimony on hr 3590 106th cong representative foley who along with rep shaw introduced the bill noted that the ada was an important piece of civil rights legislation but stated that to put it simply the ada is being used by some attorneys tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21187crs4 20

thousands of businesse s from florida to california20 rep foley observed that title iii of the ada does not allow for the collecti on of damages by plaintiffs but does allow for attorneys fees and stated that some attorneys appare ntly have figured out that the ada can be real cash co w for minimum work on their part21 he cited the actions of group in florida that filed blizzard of lawsuits against dozens of businesses as exemplifying the reason fo r hr 3590 representative foley noted that in all the cases of which he was aware the businesses had agreed to fix the problems once they were made aware of them but still found themselves faced with thousands of dollars in attorneys fees22 representative canady made similar arguments at the hearing on hr 3590 and also observed that even if some businesses refuse to make their properties accessible after notice these businesses would still be subject to the requirements of the ada23 similarly one of the most prominent supporters of hr 3590 clint eastwood testified in support of the gislation at hearings on may 18 2000 noting that he had been sued because hotel he owned was not in co mpliance with the ada the suit against his mission ranch hotel and restau rant alleged that at least one bathroom and the hotel parking lot did not comply with the ada and asked for 577000 in attorneys fees like the bills sponsors mr eastwood argued that he and other small businesses were being preyed upon by money seeking attorneys24 christopher bell the managing partner of national management labor and employment law firm also argued in s upport of hr 3590 at the 2000 hearings he described ada drive by suits as all too common with four major ada enforcement groups having filed 112 lawsuits since january 1 2000 mr bell further argued that hr 3590 does not make any s ubstantive legal changes to the ada it does not reduce in any way or to any degree the substantive rights of persons with disabilities25

the americans with disab ilities act 2001 wisc l rev 107 178181 2001 this article notes that the plaintiff in the case attempted to provide mr eastwood with notice via registered mail but he refused to accept the mailarguments opposed to requiring notification those opposing notification have made several ar guments including that legislation requiring notification would undermine enfor cement of the ada that if attorneys are preying upon business such actions are best dealt with by state bar disciplinary procedures or by the court and that such legislation would re quire individuals with disabilities to know the details of the adas requirements the department of justice in letter nt to rep canady argued that hr 3590 106th congress would work to undermine vol untary compliance with the americans with disabilities act and would unduly bur den legitimate ada enforcement activity26 the letter noted that if attorneys are engaging in frivolous or harassing litigation the appropriate mechanism for addr essing such problems is with the ethics and disciplinary bodies of state bar associations or the court where the litiga tion is pending in addition he detailed the efforts the department of justice has made to provide technical assistance27 similarly one of the witnesses for th 2000 hearing on hr 3590 andrew levy trial lawyer from maryland argued that the proposed amendment will make enforcement of the ada cumbersome much more expensive and from practical sta ndpoint frequently impossible worse it will eliminate much of the existing incentive businesses have to attempt to comply with the law voluntarily28 he noted that there was damage provision in the law and observed that since th ere was risk of damages the effect of prohibiting lawsuits unless they get 90 days notice is to allow indeed encourage them to do nothing until they get letter29 he also observed that attorneys fees are only available if the plaintiff wins and are limited to what the judge finds is reasonable and that the department of justice has significant technical assistance available for small businesses in addition mr levy questione d the attorneys fees mr eastwood indicated were involved in his case stating the fees could only have grown to the size they did because of his refusal to comply with the law voluntarily and the scorched earth manner in which his lawyer conducted the defense30 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21187crs6 31 testimony of fred shotz hr 3590 the ada notification ac t before the house committee on the judiciary subcommittee on the constitution may 18 2000 published at httpwwwhousegovj udiciaryshot0518htm 32 id another witness at the 2000 hearings fred shotz the ada consultant for the city of lake worth florida also argued against the legislation stating that the ada is not broken and it does not need to be fixed31 mr shotz argued that bill would require every individual with disability to know the details regarding ada access requirements and would limit an individuals ability to obtain gal representation for example he noted that if an individual with quadriplegia encounter s an inaccessible restaurant he or she would have to go to the library to find the tails for the width of door and then go back to the restaurant to measure the door and eith er pay lawyer to wr ite letter or write one herself and go to the post office to mail the letter certified mail then he or she must go back to the restaurant after 90 days to termine if the condition has been corrected32
