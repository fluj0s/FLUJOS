first time fda promulgated regulations for most provisions of the new statute within several years of enactment including definitions safety thirdparty literature nutritional support statements ingredient and nutrition labeling and new dietary ingredients dshea also created an offi ce of dietary supplemen ts at the national institutes of health the regulations on g ood manufacturing practices gmps remain to be completed although fda s announced plans to publish the final rule by december 2006 dshea established procedures for dietary supplements d s that differ from those that fdca requires for prescription drugs under fdca drug manufacturer must submit evidence of the safety and effectivene ss of product based on human clinical trials before the fda can approve drug for sa in the united states marketing of supplement product however can begin without evidence of safety or effectiveness being submitted to the agency dshea placed the bur den of proof on the fda to demonstrate that supplements were unsafe after they were on the market this provision is different from the burden of proof placed on manufacturer s of all other fda regulated products to demonstrate that products are safe be fore they are placed on the market adverse event reporting was not part of the legislative debate when dshea was being considered there was requirement in either dshea or the implementing regulations for manufacturers to report adverse events to the agency this issue came to the attention of congress during hearings following media reports of consumers experiencing health problems after using ephedra3 in 1997 after receiving hundreds of reports of adverse events attributed to phedracontaining suppl ements the fda proposed to restrict the dosage prohibit formulations containing other stimulants and require warnings on ephedracontaining products the fdas proposed rule was criticized for the lack of scientific evidence to support it4 government accountability office gao report that reviewed the scie ntific basis for the fda ephe dra proposal raised concerns about the process by which fda had comp iled the reports on the harmful effects of ephedra and concluded that the agency l acked adequate data to set dosage levels5 when manufacturers were asked if th ey had any adverse event repor ts some denied having any such information on their products howe ver the fda and congress subsequently learned that some companies di d have adverse event reportshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22480crs3 6 see crs report rl30989 the us drug approval process primer by blanchard randall 7 21 cfr 31480 8 ibidsince 1972 mandatory reporting of adverse events to fda has been required of prescription drug manufacturers when they learn that consumers have experienced undesirable effects from use of their products6 by regulation prescription drug manufacturers must report all rious and unexpected adverse drug experiences that they become aware of to fda within 15 days7 this postmarket reporting system allows the agency to determine whether there are pattern s of adverse events in the general population using the drug that are serious enough to warra nt focused study or so type of regulatory action drugs in clinical trials prior to f da approval are tested in study populations that are much smaller than the number of anticipated potential users so until drug is on the market the agency has only limited evidence of side effects that may occur these postmarket requirements for prescription drugs do not apply to nonprescription drug products in 1993 fda expanded its postmarket surv eillance capabilities by establishing voluntary reporting system called medwatch8 the agency designed the medwatch program to facilitate its use by health professionals ie physicians nurses pharmacists and consumers through voluntary reporting of side effects nd other health problems that they suspect are related to the use of prescription drugs and medical devices the system also allows the reporting of adverse effects associated with the use of otc drugs dietary supplements infant formulas and medical foods when dverse events are reported to fda they are entered into the medwatchs postmarketing surveillance database for further evaluation the collect ed data are analyzed to ssess whether the relationship between the use of product and the reported adverse events might be causal if relationship is determined to be supported by the evidence in the database the information is forwarded to the appropriate center offici als to decide on further study and whether public notification is needed provisions of pl109462 definitions for both otc drugs and ds serious adverse event is defined as one that results in death lifethreatening expe rience inpatient hospitalization persistent or significant disability or incapacity congenital anomaly or birth defect or requires medical or surgical in tervention the term serious adverse event report means report that is required to be submitted to the secr etary under this act the bill defines an adverse event for nonprescription drugs to mean any dverse healthrelated event associated with the use of an otc drug including an overdose whether accidental or intentional drug abuse drug withdrawal or any failure of expected pharmaceutical action of the drug for dietary supplement ds an adverse event is defined as any healthrelated event associated with the use of ds that is adverse the law does not outline the detail for ds that it does for otc drugs reporting for both otc drugs and ds the law would require manufacturer packer or distributor whose name appears on the label of the product referred to as the responsible person to submit to fda any report received of serious adverse eventhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22480crs4 associated with otc drug or ds product us ed in the united states along with copy of the label or information within the reta il package of the product reports are to be submitted to fda within 15 days of receipt by the manufacturer and any additional new medical information related to case received within year of the initial report is to be submitted within 15 days the secretary is to develop systems to ensure consolidation of reports for single case the secretary is so to establish an exemption to the reporting requirements if he determines that such an exemption would have adverse effect on public health each serious adverse event report is to be submitted to the secretary using medwatch form that has been modi fied for otc drugs and ds and may be accompanied by additional information ma nagers amendment on the bill as adopted by the senate help committee included provision that would allow fda to take action against foreign manufacturers that do not comply with these reporting requirements for ds retailer whose name appears on th label as distributor may through an agreement authorize the ds manufacturer or packer to submit required reports to the secretary as long as the retailer provides to the manufacturer or packer notice of all adverse events associated with ds that are reported to the retailer through the address or telephone number on the labe l the law contains comparable provision on otc drugs record keeping for both otc drugs and ds records for each adverse event report are to be maintained by the manufacturer for six years the responsible person would be required to provide access to these records for designated officer or employee of the department of health and human services hhs dur ing factory inspection serious event report including any new medi cal information submitted to the secretary is to be considered safety report if it is released for public disclosure the report may be accompanied by statement that denies that the report or records constitute an admission that the product involved caused or contribut ed to the adverse event all personal identification information must be redacted from any record that is released under the freedom of information act preemption for both otc drugs and ds state or local government can establish or continue in eff ect any requirements related to mandatory system for adverse event reports for otc drugs or ds that are di fferent from the provisions of this act this provision does not affect the secretarys aut hority to provide adverse event reports and information to any health food or drug offi cial or employee of an state territory or political subdivision under memorandum of unders tanding currently in effect however the personally identifiable information in adve rse event reports provided by the secretary to employees in other jurisdictions is not to be made public or ot herwise disclosed without written consent of both the secretary and the individual who submitted the report safety report may not be used to suggest that the information is an admission that the otc drug or ds product caused or c ontributed to the adverse event authorized appropriations for both otc drugs and ds the law would authorize appropriations of such sums as ma be necessary to carry out the provisions on serious adverse event reportinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22480crs5 miscellaneous provisions for otc drugs the secretary may modify requirements under the provisions of the act to maintain consistenc with international harmonization efforts over time ds were exempted from all international harmonization efforts under provisions of the fda modernization act of 1997 for both otc drugs and ds the labeling provisions would be amended to require that product marketed in the united states bears the address or phone number of the person who is responsible for receiving any re ports of serious adverse event eg the manufacturer the amendments would take effect and apply to any otc drug or ds product labeled on or after the date that is one year af ter the date of enactment within 270 days of enactment the secretary is to issue guidance on the minimum data elements that are to be included in serious adverse event report prohibition of falsif ication of reports for otc drugs and ds the fdca provisions would be amended to prohibit the fa lsification of serious adverse event report submitted to responsible person or the secr etary of hhs this prohibition takes effect one year after the date of enactment issues several earlier bills included provisions on mandatory reporting of adverse events for dietary supplements but none saw any legisl ative action senate amendment to the fy2006 defense appropriations legislation would have prohi bited the sale of dietary supplements on military facilities unless there wa s mandatory reporting of adverse events while that amendment was not adopted inte rested parties in congress and in the supplement industry and consumer community agreed to work on provisions that would achieve mandatory reporting by manufacturers as result s 3546 bipartisan bill was introduced on june 21 2006 with the support of numerous trade associations and consumer groups including the consumers ion the center for science in the public interest the consumer hea lth care products associati on the national nutritional foods association the council for responsible nutrition the american herbal products association and the utah na tural products association the requirements for mandatory reporting of serious adverse events for ds and otc drugs would provide an opportunity for fda to improve its ability to monitor and evaluate the potential adverse events associated with the use of these products single report of an incident alleged to be associated with specific product is not necessarily indicative of product with problems however the accumu lation of numerous such reports attributed to given product may indicate trend for whic h the agency needs to take further action information in standard form received in timely manner with identification to specific product will also assist the agency one problem that ar ose over the reports on ephedra was that they were incomplete making it virtually impossible to successfully draw conclusions about what had occurred to in dividuals who allegedl had taken ephedra containing products the fdas decision to regulate the sale of ephedra based on incomplete reporting of adverse events was cited in the 1999 gao report which subsequently led to the withdrawal of some provisions in the agencys proposed rule the mandatory reporting requi rements of pl109462 are similar to the regulatory requirements for the postmarketing surveillance system that fda relies on for monitoringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22480crs6 9 gao adverse drug events the magnitude of health risk is uncertain because of limited

nonprescription drug and consumer protection act cost estimate as reported by the senate co mmittee on health education labor and pensions september 5 2006 8 pthe safety of prescription drugs by comp arison medwatch is system that relies on health care professionals and consumers for voluntarily reporting concerns about products 2000 gao study estimated that fda receives reports on more than 10 of all adverse drug events providing data th at is fragmentary and inconsistent9 recent gao drug safety report has suggested that f das postmarket decisionmaking and oversight process needed improvements10 among its recommendations gao concluded that fda needed to improve the process for establishi ng mechanism for systematically tracking postmarket drug safety issues according to fda once it receives the data whether from manufacturers or through the medwatch program the agency needs fficient resources in terms of personnel with expertise to evaluate the data in response to question raised at the press conference when the bill was introduced senators indicat ed that the fda has estimated that it would need 4 million to implement the bills provisions ie 2 million to implement the otc drug provisions and 2 million to implement the ds provisions the congressional budget office estimates that implemen ting pl109462 will result in additional discretionary outlays of 3 million in 2007 and 50 million over 20072011 assuming that the necessary funds are appropriated11 while the law authorizes such sums as are needed to implement the bill it is unclear whether fda will request or the congress will appropriate such funding now that the bill is enacted finally the law contains provisions that address enforcement of mandatory serious adverse event reporting by manufacturers of otc drugs and ds products the ability of fda to receive accurate data on adverse events would seem to require some type of enforcement mechanism or penalties in the cas of prescription drugs failure to maintain records may result in fda withdrawal of appr oval for marketing drug such provision could be applied to an otc drug however approval is needed for the marketing of dietary supplements so this pproach would not be useful proponents say the surveillance of serious dverse events associated with otc drugs and ds can only be successful if manufacturers packers di stributors and re tailers report to fda when they receive information on even ts that may be linked to their products parallel system that requires information on every package with the intent to encourage health care professionals and consumers to report directly to the agency would also facilitate data coll ection they say in this view pr oviding medwatch c ontact information on product packages which the law does not do might be an additional way to improve the agencys database on adverse events ot hers observe that pub lic education program in conjunction with the medwatch contact in formation on packaging may be needed to promote voluntary reporting to the agency
