worldwide to leave the tsa out of the new department and that to do so would create problems of dual lines of authority for transportation security they also assert that by ears end tsas size importance and law enforcement role will make the tsa so significant to homeland security that meaningful homeland security department cannot be created without it opponents of shifting tsa out of dot

the transfer of the recently created transportation security administration from the department of trans portation to the new partment is part of the proposal hr 5005 introduced by request congressional proposals to create department of homeland secur ity predate the presidents plan the national homeland security and combating terrorism act of 2002 hr 4660 s 2452 introduced on mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21244crs2 1 much of what follows draws from both variety of written sources as well as informal discussions with agency and industry officials see also homeland security the presidential coordination office by harold c relyea crs report rl31148 and homeland security office issues and options by rensselaer lee crs report rl31421 on the crs home page see office of homeland security and also department of homeland security by harold c relyea 2 this report is not an overall analysis of pr esident bushs department of homeland security proposal hr 5005 or s 2452 it is restricted to the purported advantages and disadvantages of transferring the tsa to the new department broader organizational i ssues are discussed only to the extent necessary for context for more detailed description of the bills see crs report rl31513 homeland security sidebyside comparison of hr 5005 and s 2452 107th congress 2 2002 has many provisions similar to the pres idents proposal at that time however the sponsors chose not to include the tsa in their proposal preferring to focus more narrowly on two areas of concern border s ecurity and emergency preparedness and response since the release of the presidents plan members from both parties have expressed general support fo r the new department so members however have expressed interest in modifying the plan as the implementing legislation is written and considered since the presidents plan was made public few have expressed an absolute opposition to any government reorganization that creates new department or agency for homeland security the debate over which ex isting agencies or agency components will be consolidated into department of homeland security however has now begun in earnest the transfer of the tsa from the department of trans portation to the proposed department is part of this debate1 after brief summary of recent developm ents this report discusses some broad issues involved in creating partment of homeland security that are relevant to the debate over including the tsa it then provi des procon analysis of including the tsa in department similar to that proposed by th president finally the report mentions number of other issues that could influence the debate2 recent developments on july 22 2002 modified version of the administrations proposal hr 5005 introduced by representative armey emerge d from contentious markup meeting of the house select committee on homeland security hr 5005 as repor ted transfers the tsa to the proposed department of homeland security the bill requires that the tsa be maintained as distinct unit within the new department for 2 years after enactment the bill also provides process by which air ports that determine that they cannot meet the december 31 2002 deadline for the atsa re quirement that all checked baggage be screened by explosive detection system s eds can have up until december 31 2003 to execute their eds implementation plans in addition the bill prohibits the new department from receiving any funding from the various transportation trust funds in the senate senator lieberma n has proposed an amendment in th nature of substitute to s 2452 the national homeland secur ity and combating terrorism act which is more in line with the administration proposal than the original version of s 2452 that was marked up by the senate government affairs committee in june the bill differs from the house version significantly in that it transfers the authoritie s functions personnelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21244crs3 and assets of the tsa to the directorate of border and transpor tation protection within the new department but does not require that the tsa be maintained as distinct entity the senate bill also does not extend the eds d eadline or prohibit the use of transportation trust fund revenues for the new department broader issues number of broad issues form the contex t within which the debate over whether or how to fold the tsa into the new depar tment are worth mentioning as follows appropriate span of control number of observers have commented that there are probably 40 to 50 federal agencies with responsibilities that directly support the war on terrorism the debate over span of control can range from arguments that all antiterrorist functions should be drawn together into one department to having coordinating entity that w ould facilitate communication nd cooperation across federal agencies all of the legislative proposals to date fall in the middle of these two extremes s 2452 as introduced would have established department of homeland security made up of all or part s of seven federal agencies nd would also establish in the executive office of the president national office for combating terrorism to coordinate oversee and evaluate the imple mentation and execution of national strategy for combating terrorism and the hom eland security response the presidents plan hr 5005 draws the proposed depar tments components from broader range of federal agencies and would also continue the operation of the office of homeland security and the homeland s ecurity council the tsa would be part of the proposed departments division of border and trans portation security the theme of effective communication across departmental lines s been the focus of much of the post september 11 antiterrorism polic debates the reported ve rsion of hr 5005 as well as the substitute amendment to s 2452 now both agree with the broad outline of president bushs proposal on institutional span of control current differences in degree of control include differing budgetary flexibility nd civil service protection provisions security vs efficiency in the united states avia tion railroads trucking and marine transportation operate at least in part on co mmercial basis even airport authorities which are generally public entities are nearly ways managed like businesses within the context of the security debate this situation creates tension between the traditional mission of most transportation organizationsto facilitate the efficient movement of people and goodsand the height ened priority of the security mission airline and airport managers in particular have expre ssed concern that heightened security measures could reach point where travel and shipping by air could be discouraged leading to period of prolonged financial losses as well as loss of market share to other modes of transportation law enforcement and security stakeholders generally assert that in the postseptember 11 environment s ecurity must be the highest transportation priority and argue that the public has shown willingness to accept securityrelated delays and hassles to gr eat extent the security vs efficiency debate was resolved in favor of security by passa ge of the aviation and transportation security act atsa in november 19 2001 departmental purpose an underlying issue which may be seen as being parallel to the security vs efficiency issue is the historical purpose of the department of transportation and whether it enhances or inhibits the security mission of the tsahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21244crs4 3 the senatepassed bill s 1447 would have shifted the screening of passengers and property to the department of justice the federal ai r marshal program would have been administered by the secretary of dot but under guidelines pres cribed by the attorney general the house passed version provided for the creation of the tsa inside the dot but outside the federal aviation administrationhistorically the dot has seen its purpose as facilitating the movement of people and goods some would argue that this places th dot in tacit alliance with transportation industries for example the views of comme rcial air carriers are seen as influential in policymaking within the federal aviation administration faa during the atsa debate in the autumn of 2001 both the dot and the air transport association which represents the major air carriers argued against shifting the responsibility for the screening of passengers and baggage to the partment of justice in the end congress established the tsa outside of the faa but within dot some would still argue that even outside the faa but within dot the tsa will reflect proindustry perspective however some air carrier executives as well as some airport executives have expressed frustration based on their perception that th tsas focus is unbalanced dominated by strict law enforcement view of transportati on security and lacking adequate concern for the hassles and other inefficiencies that air travelers are facing law enforcement perspective vs transportation perspective during the process of forming the tsa and implemen ting atsa some airport as well as airline executives have complained that tsa employ ees and contractors ve shown an absence of understanding and lack of concern for ai rport and air carrier methods of operation some speculate that in part this as an outgrowth of tension between the law enforcement perspective of many of tsa s recently hired former law enforcement officials and the transportation industry pers pective of airport and airline officials transferring the tsa to department of homeland security prior to the release of the presiden ts proposal there wa s little public debate concerning proposed transfer of the tsa to new homeland secur ity department this was probably because atsa placed the tsa in dot and the issue was initially settled in the minds of many observers3 although the versions of hr 5005 and s 2452 now under active consideration would both transf er the tsa to the proposed department some continue to express concern over the transfer of the fledgling agency the timing of the proposed transfer and its organizational implications pro transfer the tsa to the proposed new department atsa created the tsa and charged it with responsibility for the security of all modes of trans portation given that roughly onethird of all terrorist attacks worldwide targ et transportation department of homeland security would be incomplete without the tsa not including the tsa in the new department would give two departments the responsibility for tran sportation security including thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21244crs5 4 hr 4660 includes responsibility for elements of transportation security in two of its proposed directorates the directorate of prevention and the directorate of critical infrastructure this language would probably need to be modified or removed from the bill if the tsa is kept out of the proposed department or there would be conflict of authority over transportation securitytsa in new department could be an opportunity to consolidate and clarify the lines of authority4 international airports are to air tr ansportation what border crossings are to surface transportation not includi ng tsa in new homeland security department would leave out ma jor component of border control historically dot as an agency has been the lead federal agency in supporting transportation infrastructur building and facilitating safe and efficient transportation the agency has been responsive to air carrier and airport concerns about the cost and delay implications of security measures removing the tsa from the dot would help keep the tsa focused on security and make it less easily swayed by the profit concerns of the transportation industries the tsa is too big to be left out of the new department or left inside the dot with tsa staffing timates approaching 70000 personnel leaving it out of new homeland secu rity department could in effect establish the latter as rump agency leaving the largest homeland security agency outside of its control if left inside dot the tsa would dwarf most other dot agencies and divert the agencys efforts away from its traditional transportation mission leaving the tsa within the dot endangers the budget of the remainderof the dot the combination of the high funding priority for security and the tsas escalating needs estimates could constrain spending on other transportation needs in this budgetary environment for example the balances of the airport and ai rway trust fund could be siphoned off for aviation security leaving other av iation needs such as spending for increased airport capacity and air tr affic control modernization short changed do not transfer the tsa to the proposed new department the tsa is an agency under constr uction it is facing enormous challenges of technology and pers onnel as it works to meet the ambitious timetable set forth in the atsa shifting the agency to new department would disrupt its forma tion and delay its urgently needed implementation it would also weaken useful ties to other parts of dot in passing atsa congress placed the tsa in the dot there is reason to replay policy debate th at congress decided last november the tsa is already under criticism from airline and airport industry officials for not having customer friendly mindset shifting the tsa out of the dot can only exacerbate the hassle factor that passengers face from redundant and multilayered s ecurity measures at airports effective transportation security requires an understanding of law enforcement transportation systems and infrastructure shifting the tsa out of the dot would separate these components and would requirehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21244crs6 hiring more staff in the new departme nt to provide expertise that already exists at dot keeping the tsa in the dot will help keep the agency focused on thesecurity element of transportation it is accident that atsa the major security legislation passed in the af termath of the september 11 attacks was entirely concerned with transpor tation security and to remove that concern from dot is counterproductive as mentioned earlier the tsas budg et and estimates of its personnel needs have grown rapidly in cluding the tsa in the proposed department could overw helm the latter diverting its resources from securing of us sea ports and bor der crossings improving emergency response capabilities and strength ening security coordination related unresolved issues committee jurisdiction as part of the dot the tsa falls under the jurisdiction of the house transportation and infrastructure committee and the senate committee on commerce science and transpor tation should the tsa be incorporated into new department this juri sdiction could change and be ssigned to one or more other committees it is also uncertain which of the 13 appropriations subcommittees in either the house or senate would have or share jurisdiction over new department but it is possible that the tsa or its components w ould shift to the jurisdiction of other subcommittees how tsa will fulfill its role in n onaviation transpor tation security atsa places the tsa in charge of the secur ity of all modes of tr ansportation the act is however largely silent on the specifics of how the fledgling agency will assert its authority over the security of the nonaviation modes of transportation for example the role of the tsa in port security is unclear given that both the us coast guard and the us customs service are active in port security whether or not the tsa becomes part of the proposed department and how the tsa will fulfill its role under atsa in assuring the security of nonaviation transpor tation awaits further clarification what will be the tsas ro in border security within the context of the presidents proposal the tsa would be placed in the border and transportation security division along with the coast guard customs service the animal and plant health inspection service and the border patrol and other enforcement elements of the immigration and naturalization service ins the major federal players at us points ofentry poe including inte rnational airports as well as land border crossings are the customs service and the ins whether the tsa will have security role at us poes has not been clarified should tsa become player its role visavis the other federal agencies at the border would need clarification labor issues some are concerned that tsas more generous salaries relative to the other agencies transferring to the border and transportation security division bts could become contentious issue within th division would for example customs and ins salaries be adjusted another unresolve d labor issue is tsas less restricted power to hire and fire personnel
