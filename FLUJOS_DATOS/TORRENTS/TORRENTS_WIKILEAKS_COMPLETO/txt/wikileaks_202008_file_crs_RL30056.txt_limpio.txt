considered the emergency farm relief aid separate from other supplemental requests adding 426 billion to the regular fy1999 agriculture appropriations bill hr 4101 president clinton vetoed hr 4101 however on october 7 saying he regarded the amount of emergency agriculture spending as inadequate congress considered the vetoed agriculture funding measure plus all remaining supplemental spending packages as part of the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act 1999 hr 4328 that includes eight regular appropriation bills and other legislative initiatives congress cleared the measure and the president signed hr 4328 on october 21 all supplementals with the exception of the 1 billion defense readiness request were designated by the president as emergency spending which under the 1985 balanced budget and emergency deficit control act means that if congress agrees the costs would not require corresponding reductions in existing expenditures some members however challenged the emergency status arguing that the entire amount should be offset by the cancellation of previously enacted funds as passed all but about 100 million of the 2076 billion supplemental is designated as an emergency congress included one offset in the bill 67 million rescission of dod fuel costs as signed into law the omnibus spending measure included 59 billion for

congress approved and the president signed on october 21 the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 105277 hr 4328 that included 2076 billion in supplemental spending the legislation provided most of the approximately 89 billion officially requested by the president plus about another 118 billion of congressional initiatives including 200 million for us capitol security and visitor center 14 billion for domestic natural disasters 943 million for counterdrug and interdiction programs 1 billion for ballistic missile defense and about 35 billion for additional national defense priorities some of the items added by congress also had strong white house support the final omnibus measure also included 589 billion for emergency agriculture spending an increase from the 426 billion package vetoed by president clinton on october 7 saying it was inadequate background before congress adjourned it considered series of emergency and non emergency supplemental appropriation proposals totaling 2076 billion for agriculture programs counterterrorism and diplomatic security at us facilities around the world governmentwide y2k requirements us forces in bosnia defense readiness counternarcotics interdiction activities and several domestic natural disaster requirements of the total the president officially requested about 89 billion in supplemental spending with the remainder added through congressional initiatives nevertheless in most cases congressional leaders worked closely with executive officials in shaping the supplemental proposals and as such there was general support in congress for the broad outlines of administration recommendations and congressional additions the largest disagreement occurred over the size of emergency agriculture aid president clinton vetoed on october 7 hr 4101 the fy1999 agriculture appropriations because the bill contained what he and many senate democrats said was an inadequate amount 426 billion to meet crs2 current farm relief needs second area of contention was over the issue of whether these appropriations needed to be offset with reductions in spending on existing programs and if so which activities to cut the president proposed that all but the defense readiness supplementals be designated as emergencies thereby not requiring cuts in existing funds to pay for the added appropriations as enacted hr 4328 designated all but 100 million of the 2076 billion supplemental as an emergency and included 67 million in offsets major components of the supplementals and congressional initiatives the president submitted four separate emergency supplemental requests three of which arrived in september the other fy1999 funding to cover the incremental cost of deploying us troops in bosnia was received by congress in march 1998 as part of an earlier emergency spending proposal congress however did not act on the fy1999 bosnia funding issue at that time fifth initiative although not designated as an emergency supplemental was transmitted to congress on october 5 by omb proposing 1 billion for defense readiness other supplemental initiatives arose during the final days of the 105th congress and were included in the omnibus appropriation measure hr 4328 major emergency and nonemergency supplementals added to hr 4328 included the following agriculture several regions of the country had been experiencing low farm commodity prices primarily for wheat corn soybeans and cotton andor natural disasters in 1998 particularly in the northern plains and the south this had the effect of significantly reducing farm income on october 6 1998 the senate cleared for the white house the conference agreement on the fy1999 agriculture appropriations bill hr 4101 containing separate titles that would provide 426 billion in direct payments to farmers to mitigate the effects of low crop prices and natural disasters conferees included language which declared budget emergency for this expenditure which meant that if the full house and senate and the administration concurred with the emergency designation budgetary offsets would be required for the new spending president clinton however vetoed hr 4101 on october 7 stating that the relief for farmers was inadequate following further congressionaladministration negotiations 589 billion supplemental agriculture package was added to the omnibus appropriations bill the compromise however did not include provision lifting the cap on loan rates for certain commodities the amount provided in the agriculture appropriations conference agreement was based on proposal announced by house republican leadership on september 17 and included 15 billion in disaster payments to farmers who have incurred significant crop losses in 1998 due to natural disasters an additional 675 million in direct payments to producers who have experienced multiple years of disasters particularly those in the northern plains and upper midwest 165 billion increase in fy1999 market transition payments which translates into 29 increase in these payments for each participating farmer of wheat feed grains cotton and rice and 175 million in costshare assistance for livestock growers who lost to natural disaster significant amount of feed grown on the farm crs3 provision not included in the conference agreement but strongly supported by the administration and senate democratic leadership was temporary increase in the loan rate price guarantees for certain farm commodities in july the senate rejected an amendment to s 2159 that would have removed the current cap on the loan rate for wheat feed grains cotton and rice for the 1998 crop year another attempt to remove the cap on loan rates was defeated on september 15 when the senate tabled similar amendment to the interior appropriations bill s 2237 in september the administration threatened veto of the agriculture appropriations bill if it contained farm economic assistance package that did not include provision to remove the cap on the loan rates the estimated cost of uncapping the loan rates for year is approximately 5 billion the administration proposal also included more than 2 billion in disaster payments bringing the total cost of its recommendation to more than 7 billion the president and congressional democrats contended that the 426 billion in the conference agreement on hr 4101 was not sufficient to address the financial problems of farmers republicans maintained that the democratic package would spend too much and would fundamentally undermine the policy changes made by the omnibus 1996 farm law for more background on the agriculture issues see crs report 98201 appropriations for fy1999 us department of agriculture and related

in response to the terrorist bombings of the us embassies in nairobi kenya and dar salaam tanzania the white house submitted 18 billion emergency supplemental appropriation request for embassy security and antiterrorism programs of the total 14 billion would fund state department improvements of perimeter security at us facilities hire more diplomatic security agents establish new security review panel which would require authorization from congress and rebuild the two bombed embassies in africa although the recent terrorist attacks prompted the supplemental proposal concern over embassy vulnerability dates back many years and led in 1985 to series of recommendations issued by the advisory panel on overseas security the socalled inman report identified 126 facilities with inadequate security but by september 30 1998 only 49 facilities had been built or enhanced to meet the security standards recommended by the panel in addition to embassy security the supplemental proposed 400 million among other things 1 to reimburse the defense department for its response to the embassy bombings and other securityrelated efforts 200 million 2 to improve secret service protection activities and perform law enforcement training 90 million 3 to augment the state departments 20 million annual worldwide antiterrorist program 20 million 4 to provide additional economic aid to kenya and tanzania 50 million that would be used to compensate bombing victim families and rebuild some structures that surrounded the destroyed embassies and 5 to increase the fbis capacity to respond to terrorist acts 217 million crs4 as enacted hr 4328 included the 18 billion embassy security request plus over 600 million for other antiterrorism initiatives attached by congress added to the original proposal was 206 million to enhance security at the capitol and to construct new visitor center 100 million for the federal aviation administration to install more explosive detection devices at airports and about 350 million for dod antiterrorism activities for more details see crs report 98771f embassy security background funding and fy1998 supplemental request by susan epstein year 2000 computer conversion for over two years congress has helped to focus national attention on the year 2000 computer problem the inability of many computer systems to process dates correctly beyond january 1 2000 the problem arises because most computer systems store dates using only the last two digits for the year field eg 98 for 1998 with this format the year 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900 the year datafield in computer programs can perform various functions such as calculating age sorting information by date and comparing dates when years beyond 1999 are entered in the twodigit format those functions will often fail to operate properly federal agencies maintain many computer systems that manage large databases conduct electronic monetary transactions and control numerous interactions with other computer systems these agencies face major challenge to convert their software and hardware to handle dates beyond the year 2000 ombs cost estimate for federal agency year 2000 conversion increased steadily and is currently 54 billion omb has targeted march 31 1999 as the deadline for federal agencies to have completed the renovation validation and implementation phases of all year 2000 conversions agencies of greatest concern are the departments of defense education energy health and human services transportation in particular the federal aviation administration state and the agency for international development on september 2 1998 president clinton asked congress for 325 billion emergency supplemental to address governmentwide y2k conversion activities such funds would be transferred as necessary by omb to all affected federal agencies and departments the senate in the regular fy1999 treasury and general government appropriation bill hr 4104 included similar funding provision to address the y2k problem housesenate conferees however deleted the y2k funds from hr 4104 expressing their expectations that the issue would be resolved as part of supplemental appropriation the omnibus appropriations act pl 105277 included 335 billion for y2k conversion slightly more than the request of the total 11 billion was designated for the defense department for more information on the y2k issue see crs issue brief 97036 year2000 computer problem activity in the 105th congress by richard nunno us troops in bosnia on march 1 1998 the administration submitted an amendment to its fy1999 defense budget request asking congress to approve emergency funding of 19 billion for costs of operations in bosnia the money would mainly pay for increased personnel and operating expenses associated with ongoing peacekeeping mission in bosnia the senatepassed version of the regular fy1999 defense appropriations bill hr 4103 included the requested funding but crs5 the housepassed version of the bill did not the conference agreement on the defense bill did not include the money explicitly leaving it for consideration in supplemental appropriations measure as enacted the omnibus appropriations act included the full 19 billion proposal for more information see crs report 98 205 appropriations for fy1999 defense by stephen daggett

funding for bosnia southwest asia and other operations questions and answers by nina serafino defense readiness senior appropriations committee members had been considering for some time whether to add emergency funding for military readiness either to the regular fy1999 defense appropriations bill or to separate supplemental measure the funding was intended mainly to bolster military recruitment purchases of spare parts maintenance of equipment and real property and training emergency funding for this purpose was added to the regular defense bill hr 3616 and was widely expected that appropriators would therefore propose some emergency funding for military readiness in supplemental measure on october 5 omb sent letters to the chairmen of the appropriations committees outlining 1 billion defense readiness package that would include funds for additional spare parts 239 million personnel recruiting enhancements 113 million marine corps and army operating force support 348 million navy and air force depot maintenance 251 million and other items 49 million the entire amount would have been offset by funds becoming available due to lowerthan expected fuel costs 180 million and inflation 530 million and by the rescission of unidentified lower priority projects 290 million congress raised the administration proposal by about 300 million in the omnibus appropriations act designated all but 118 million as an emergency and included 67 million rescission related to lower fuel prices for more information see crs report 98205 appropriations for fy1999 defense by stephen daggett defense infrastructure repair in south korea and other storm damaged facilities the president requested 2538 million to restore defense department infrastructure in south korea that was severely damaged during monsoons that struck the korean peninsula in early august the funds were intended to cover repairs in barriers and fortifications along the demilitarized zone dmz in the omnibus spending measure congress included the full 254 million for damaged facilities in south korea plus added 115 million for other dod infrastructure damaged by recent hurricanes in the united states other national defense supplementals included in the omnibus appropriations act were several other emergency supplementals for national defense initiated by congress 525 for the disposition of russian fissile materials managed by the department of energy 1 billion for ballistic missile defense programs crs6 15 billion for classified intelligence programs1 domestic natural disaster relief in addition to supplemental funding provided for damaged dod facilities noted above hr 4328 included about 14 billion to address the impact of hurricane georges most of which 906 million was provided to the federal emergency management agency the omnibus bill also included 250 million for community development block grants 101 million for the small business administration and 30 million for the american red cross counterdrug and interdiction funding another congressional initiative enacted as an emergency supplemental in hr 4328 was series of appropriations for counterdrug and interdiction activities largest recipients of the 943 million package included the state departments international narcotics control program 233 million primarily to bolster activities in the drugproducing countries of peru bolivia and colombia 344 million for the coast guard and 276 million for the us customs service including funds for the procurement and conversion of several p3 and citation aircraft for more information see crs issue brief 88093 drug control international policy and options by raphael perl other foreign aid initiatives also included as an emergency supplemental appropriation were funds for two foreign assistance activities pl 105277 added 46 million in aid to russia and other former states to the 801 million funded elsewhere in the bill as part of the regular foreign operations appropriations for fy1999 the 847 million available for assistance to the former soviet union fell short of the 925 million request for fy1999 but was significantly higher than the house 590 million and senate 740 million approved earlier in september in votes on the regular foreign operations measure the supplemental further added 50 million in emergency funds for usaid child survival programs an activity that has become one of the highest congressional foreign aid priorities in recent years combined with the 650 million appropriated in the regular foreign operations appropriations congress approved nearly 100 million more for child survival and infectious disease programs than the administration proposed for fy1999 emergency designation and the debate over offsets the white house designated all but the defense readiness supplementals as emergency requirements the emergency designation allows congress to approve the additional funds without offsetting the amounts with rescissions in enacted discretionary appropriations or finding cuts in mandatory spending programs if congress agrees with the president to define the supplementals as an emergency and not offset the amounts discretionary spending would rise above the budget caps 1 subsequently in february 1999 omb said it wants to use 320 million of the missile defense funds and 562 million of the intelligence money to offset the costs of new 900 million fy1999 supplemental to help implement the wye memorandum and provide additional assistance to israel jordan and the palestinians omb says the president would request that congress restore these dod funds at later date most likely for fy2001 some members oppose the use of the missile and intelligence funds for supplemental middle east aid and are recommending offsets from other funding sources crs7 set in 1998 by congress and reduce the size of the budget surplus for fy1999 over the past five years congress has usually enacted budget authority offsets for supplementals the question over whether to include corresponding reductions when approving additional spending became highly contentious earlier in 1998 during debate over another supplemental appropriations package pl 105174 hr 3579 as enacted congress provided 26 billion to offset natural disaster supplemental funding but did not offset 286 billion in additional defense spending lawmakers supporting the emergency designation believed that with the enactment of each new rescission package to offset supplementals the past few years most of the viable options for reductions had been exhausted that what choices remained for further cuts had narrowed to very difficult set of alternatives moreover many said that defense spending reductions in recent years combined with the practice of paying for overseas missions by raiding other dod accounts had stretched military readiness capabilities to the limit protecting defense spending by finding offsets exclusively among domestic programs however presents the problem of breaking the socalled firewalls between defense and domestic accounts in the past defense supplementals would be offset by cuts in the defense budget while additions for domestic programs would be paid for by reducing existing domestic appropriations members critical of the emergency designation argued that congress and the president should adhere to the discretionary caps established for the next five years in the balanced budget act of 1997 and include offsets for the entire supplemental package exceeding the caps they believed would set dangerous precedent for future spending requirements some members challenged the use of the emergency designation for parts of the supplementals as one example group of house republicans proposed offsetting items that represented true emergencies with changes in fha and ginnie mae mortgage programs and medicaid administrative reforms that would generate more revenues under their plan other nonemergency elements would be paid for by an acrosstheboard cut in nondefense discretionary funds on march 1 1999 if the administration had not yet found other spending cuts livingston optimistic as funding deadline approaches national journals congress daily pm october 5 1998 even though the presidents official supplemental requests did not include offsets reportedly on october 12 administration negotiators identified several possible offsets totaling about 4 billion that might be considered if congress insisted on covering the costs of some parts of the supplementals administration delivers offsets for requested spending national journals congress daily pm october 13 1998 reversing recent practice congress chose to designate all but about 100 million of the 2076 billion supplemental as an emergency the enacted bill included one offset proposed by the president for military readiness 67 million rescission of dod fuel costs crs8
