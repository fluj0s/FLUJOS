public pressu re to halt trade in conflic t diamonds and due to the persistence of several diamondrelated conflicts governments and multilateral organizations have pursued efforts to end such trade several international policy forums national legislatures and divers private parties have proposed various reforms and legislation to achieve such goals effective regulation of the diamond trade is difficult diamonds ar highly fungible concentrated form of wealth and the global diamond industry is historically insular and selfregulating the illicit diamond trade exploits these factors propos als to end illicit trad ing generally center on legally identifying the origin of diamonds and requiring the registration identification and monitoring of cross border trade in diamond as is common for trade in other goods methods for achievi ng such ends include the cataloging of unique physical diamond featur the tagging of diamonds with minute markings and the creation of certificationoforigin laws to document the origin of diamonds the clinton administration worked to create certificates of originbased international diamond trade regime but sought to ensure that such efforts would not negatively affect the legitima industry it also backed marketing reforms and regulatory capacity building in diamondrich african countries consulted with the diamond industry pushed for sanctions to

to the depth and extended durati on of hostilities diamonds have also led to the internationalization of these conflicts and added significantly to their complexity the possibility of gaining access to diamonds and other natural resources has also motivated diverse foreign actors including governments private securitycummining firms armed nonst ate groups and mercenaries to become party to seve ral conflicts geographic context the persistence of conflic ts in sierra leone and angola in the late 1990s and the first year s of the present decade was attributed in part to the role of diamonds in

curtailing the tr ade in conflict diamonds center around implementing systems to identify the origin of diamonds to ensure that diamonds sold by illicit sellers do not enter legitimate international commerce43 such proposals provide the basis for laws nd international actions such as security council sanctions that ban trade in conflict diamonds three primary approaches for determining the origin of diamonds have been proposed44 1 physical or geochemical identification of diamonds research on geochemical methods for identifying diamonds by type or as individual units focuses on the comparative analysis of trace elements and impurities within diamonds such information would be used to establish common characteristics of diamonds from similar areas or to pinpoint unique characteristics in manner analogous to fingerprinting of individua l diamonds this research employs plasma mass spectrometry and related technologies related approach for purposes of track ing is to classify diamonds by their place of origin and possibly on an individual stonespecific basis by correlating surface crystalline and other structure related features of rough diamonds such identification would be based on visual assessments and on the use of spectral refraction methods or opti cal laser xray and ot her scanning technologies geochemical and automated physical ch aracteristic identifi cation technologies have not yet been perfected according to many experts many of whom also assert that such technologies are likely to rema in prohibitively expensive in the short to medium term another limitation of such t echnologies is that some of the physical characteristics upon which identification thods depend are permanently altered orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30751crs15 destroyed when diamonds are cut or polis hed third challenge is that alluvial surface diamonds are often carried far from their points of origin by water or movements of geologic elements this m eans in many cases that diamonds from particular country or sub region cannot be physically di fferentiated from those found in neighboring countries or regions 2 tagging of diamonds this approach seeks to use laser and focused ion beam technologies to inscribe on indivi dual diamonds identifying information such as microscopic bar codes which can then be used to register and track stones several firms market such technolog other firms offer technol ogy that use laser scanning technologies to identify unique spectral f eatures of individual cut diamonds the costs of tagging technology currently repres ent barrier to their widespread use in diamond commerce but expert opinion suggests that these prices may fall in the near to medium future critics point out that it may be possible to cut off or otherwise physically alter or obliterate identifying marks th at are cut onto diamond surfaces 3 certificate of origin laws this approach seeks to create legallybinding chain of warranties from the point of mining origin to the country of importation or in some proposals to the re tail level the objective is to create trade documentation that based upon verification by the authorities of an exporting country validates the legal origin of di amonds such documentation would form the basis for findings of legal fact in efforts to track and monitor the diamond trade and in determining the legitimacy of comme rcial diamond transactions the approach relies on diamond importing countries to implement effectiv administrative processes and law enforcement procedur and adhere to shared regulatory procedures this

specified additional reporting requi rements and references the us trade representative in statement of policy it also authorized the president to direct the bureau of customs and border security among other potential agencies to assist countries seeking to export rough diamonds to the united stat by providing them with technical assistance related to compliance with us trade laws on april 8 2003 an amended version of hr 1584 was passed by the house key amendments to the bill included changes to the specification of appropriate committees of jurisdiction viz section 3 of the bill and to related reporting requirements statement of policy removed reference to particular agencies and instead expressed support for the policy th at the president shall take similarly another provision on

proposed kimberley process implementation coordinating committee on april 11 2003 representative thomas speaking in favor of the bill asked unanimous consent that the house agree to the senate amendment which was agreed to without objection the enrolled bill was signed into law by president bush on april 25 2003 and became pl 10819 when president bush signed hr 1584 in to law he did so after referring to several significant caveats relating to the manner in which he stated that he will construe the duties that the law gives discretion to the president to carry out some may view these caveats as lending novel interpretation to th effective date on which the law is to take effect and the manner in which it is to be implemented president bush stated that although under this act i have discretion to issue regulations consistent with future changes to the kpcs under the constituti on the president ca nnot be bound to accept or follow changes that might be made to the kpcs at some future date absent subsequent legislation i will construe this act accordingly if section 15 imposed mandatory duty on the president to certify to the congress whether either of the two spec ified events has occurred and whether either remains in effect serious ques tion would exist as to whether section 15 unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to international bodies in order to avoid this constitutional question i will construe the certification process set forth in section 15 as conferring broad di scretion on the president specificallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30751crs30 75 george w bush statement by the president april 25 2003 i will construe section 15 as giving the president broad discretion whether to certify to the congress that an applicable waiver or decision is

secretary of state to publish in the federal register certain information pertaining to countries and foreign authorities responsible for re gulating trade in rough diamonds the version of the bill

pertains only to rough diamonds some groups who have sought strict and more comprehensive regulation of the international diamond trad have criticized the kpcs for not including measures to control diamonds that have been rud imentarily processed po lished or made into jewelry they see the omission of such requirements in the kpcs as loophole and assert that unscrupulous diamond traders might skirt the spirit of the kpcs by superficially altering diamond to make it meet minimal standards qualifying it as polished or otherw ise processed and thus not subject to kpcs regulations or setting diamond in temporary mounting for purposes of exportor import thus qualif ying it as jewelry to prevent the potential use of such alleged loopholes these policy advocates generally call for all rough and loos polished diamonds as well as mounted diamonds ie diamond jewelry to be acco mpanied by certificate of origin in order to offer consumers more robus t guarantee that diamond being purchased is legitimate and not of conflictrelated origin 76 some in the diamond trade have genera lly argued against more extensive certificate regime they assert that the financial administrative and logistical costs of such an approach would outweigh the be nefits and might negate what are often described as marginal prof it margins in the diamond i ndustry generally some have also argued that the imposition of such costs might also sharply cut revenues earned by developing nations such as botswa na namibia and south africa which rely significantly on diamonds to fund socio economic development

during the negotiation process that produced the kpcs and such debate had persisted after the signing of the interlaken declaration in late february 2003 the council for trade in goods of the world
