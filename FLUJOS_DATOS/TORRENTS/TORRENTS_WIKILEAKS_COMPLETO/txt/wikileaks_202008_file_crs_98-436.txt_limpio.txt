dhabi shaykh khalifa bin zayid nuhayyan made an official visit to the united states the highest ranking uae official to do so since the uae federation was founded in 1971 abu dhabi is the capital and the politically and economically dominant member of the seven emirate principality federation that was formed after the british pullout from the persian gulf region1 the primary purpose of the visit was to discuss the f16 sale crown prince khalifas profile and influence in the uae has grown as his aging father shaykh zayid bin sultan nuhayyan has withdrawn from daytoday politics however the key interlocutor with the us on the f16 sale has been the crown princes charismatic younger brother shaykh mohammad bin zayid alnuhayyan the third of shaykh zayid shaykh mohammad serves as chief of staff of the uae armed forces and pivotal figure on all major uae arms purchase and defense cooperation decisions 1 the seven emirates are abu dhabi dubai sharjah ras alkhaymah ajman fujayrah and umm alqaywayn congressional research service the library of congress crs2 strategic issues the context of the crown princes visit and the f16 sale was the uaes perception of growing security threat primarily from iran the uae which is directly across the persian gulf from iran fears that country more than it does iraq since 1971 when the shah was in power iran has occupied two strategically important gulf islands claimed by the uae the greater and lesser tunb island since 1992 iran has assumed greater authority over another island shared by iran and the uae under 1971 agreement abu musa island us defense officials have said publicly since early 1995 that iran has made some military improvements to these islands2 and both the united states and the uae have noted that irans recent naval and missile acquisitions3 give it greater ability to hit us and allied targets in and across the gulf perhaps because the uae perceives growing military threat from iran it has tried not to antagonize iran and has conducted intermittent negotiations with it over the islands there is substantial iranian community in the emirate of dubai and large market in the reexport of usmade goods to iran through the uae giving the uae commercial motive to engage iran such reexportation of us goods technically is prohibited under may 1995 executive order banning us trade with and investment in iran irans president mohammad khatemi is widely considered moderate on most foreign policy issues but he has not yet been willing to compromise on the islands issue the uae has been increasingly critical of saudi arabia and other gulf states for their willingness to improve relations with iran in advance of resolution of the uaeiran islands dispute because the uae is located at the far end of the gulf from iraq it is less fearful of iraqi military power than is kuwait or saudi arabia iraq remains major land power but its naval capabilities are limited although the uae participated in the usled coalition that expelled iraq from kuwait in 1991 many uae officials believe iraq should be allowed to remain sufficiently powerful that it can balance out the growing power of iran uae leader shaykh zayid has been outspoken among the gulf rulers in calling for an easing of international sanctions on iraq and for reintegration of iraq into the arab fold during the 199798 crises with iraq over weapons inspection access the uae did not support us air strikes against iraq and did not host us strike aircraft although us defense department officials say the uae did assure secretary of defense cohen that the united states could overfly the uae in the course of any airstrikes according to the administration some of the smaller individual emirates of the uae federation fujayrah and sharjah in particular perhaps with some tacit federal approval have allowed offloading of illicit exports of iraqi oil and other highvalue exports dates the united states has made several demarches to the uae that it cease allowing smuggled 2 these improvements according to us military officials include expansion of air and sea facilities to handle military sea and aircraft and emplacement of tanks and air defense and artillery batteries on the island 3 us officials have said publicly that iran has acquired since 1992 three russianmade kilo class submarines and about 15 chinese fast attack craft armed with c802 antiship missiles as well as airlaunched c801 missiles iran also has c802 and other cruise missiles deployed in batteries on its gulf coast crs3 iraqi oil to be offloaded and the federation has adopted law preventing the trafficking president clintons april 7 1998 report to congress on iraq states that the uae has begun preventing the offloading of illicit iraqi cargoes in uae ports or through its waters the uae publicly supports the arabisraeli peace process however shaykh zayid is strong arab nationalist and the uae has been generally hesitant to improve relations with israel even during periods of progress in the arabisraeli peace process unlike qatar oman and bahrain the uae has not hosted visits by israeli leaders nor has it hosted sessions of the multilateral peace process working groups shaykh zayid was strongly critical of the establishment of middle east development bank which he says will help israel dominate the region economically the uae did not attend the middle east north africa economic summit in qatar in november 1997 on the other hand the uae gives official aid to palestinian opponents of yasir arafat such as the hamas organization although hamas might receive some private donations from uae nationals as member of the sixcountry gulf cooperation council gcc the uae is abiding by the 1994 gcc decision to stop enforcing the secondary and tertiary boycotts of israel while maintaining the primary boycott because of the progress on the boycott and the national interest in helping the gulf states defend themselves president clinton has waived the ban on us arms transfers to the gulf countries including uae even though they maintain the primary arab boycott of israel4 usuae security cooperation5 security cooperation between the united states and the uae has broadened since the 1991 persian gulf war after about three years of negotiations on july 25 1994 the uae announced it had signed formal defense cooperation agreement with the us which reportedly provides for joint training and exercises the prepositioning of some us military equipment and us arms sales the growing defense cooperation led to discussions of major aircraft purchase by the uae the f16 buy under consideration the defense cooperation agreement also reportedly discusses the legal status of us forces operating in the uae governed by statusofforces agreement or sofa the sofa provision has been sensitive issue since early 1996 when the uae refused us request to turn over us sailor involved in traffic accident in the uae in which an emirates national was killed the uae allows prepositioned us equipment to remain afloat at the large manmade port of jebel ali just outside the emirate of dubai and about 20 us ships dock there each month us military personnel in the gulf take shore leave during these port calls the dispute over the traffic accident caused the uae to reopen for negotiation the portion of the defense cooperation agreement dealing with status of forces after year of further negotiations the sofa issue was reportedly resolved in mid1997 with an agreement that us personnel who commit minor crimes in the uae will not be placed under uae legal jurisdiction the compromise on sofa has not yet been tested and may be subject to further reinterpretation or renegotiation if another incident occurs 4 this ban is contained in section 5641 of the foreign relations authorization act for fy199495 pl 103236 5 information in this section was provided by defense security cooperation agency and conversations with wide range of defense analysts familiar with usuae defense negotiations crs4 purchase of us f16 fighter aircraft for well over two years prior to the crown princes visit the uae had been considering various advanced fighter aircraft with the view of procuring large number of them to significantly upgrade the capabilities of the uae air force historically france has played major role in supplying the uae with combat fighters through contracts originating in the 1980s france has sold the uae its mirage 2000 fighter aircraft the uae currently has over 30 mirage 2000e fighters and 8 mirage 2000rad reconnaissance aircraft in its inventory in december 1997 the uae ordered an additional 30 mirage 20009 fighters for an estimated 34 billion this purchase was not finalized until late 19986 at the march 1997 idex military show held in abu dhabi the uae made it known that there are three candidates for its advanced fighter aircraft requirement these candidates are the usbuilt f16 combat fighter the frenchbuilt rafale and the eurofighter 2000 built by consortium including the united kingdom germany italy and spain the f16 fighter is particularly attractive because it is an allweather aircraft capable of day or night operations and can be configured for both ground attack or interceptor missions it has speed in excess of mach 2 and depending on weapons loading and mission profile combat radius of approximately 7801000 statute miles the f16 fighter is currently in service with the air forces of several middle east countries including bahrain egypt and israel 7 the purchase of up to 8 billion in new combat fighter aircraft by the uae is especially significant because in the postgulf war period there have been increasingly fewer major weapons purchases by foreign customers as well as reduction in overall defense spending domestically by major arms producing nations in 1998 for example the total value of all international arms agreements combined was nearly 23 billion8 an 8 billion agreement for fighters represents over onethird of that amount in this context the uae purchase appears likely to be the most significant contract for advanced fighters to be made for the foreseeable future thus competition has been intense among the contenders prior to the visit of the crown prince to the united states there was press speculation that the uae would announce its choice of the f16 during the visit media accounts and defense analysts suggested that the f16 fighter would be chosen as long as the united states was willing to provide the weapons systems avionics and support systems that the uae insisted be part of the sale package the united states has been traditionally reluctant to provide the most advanced stateoftheart weaponry to arab states because of concerns expressed by israel among the advanced us systems reportedly under discussion with the uae have been the electronic warfare suite for the 6 janes defense weekly april 22 1998 p21 forecast

whatever form final f16 fighter sale takes under the arms export control act the congress must be given 30 days to review the sale and has the option of blocking it by passage of joint resolution of disapproval should it believe this is appropriate9 on may 12 1998 it was announced in washington by uae and united states government officials that the uae had chosen to purchase 80 f16cd combat fighter aircraft according to lockheedmartin the aircrafts manufacturer the uae will receive 80 block 60 f16s fighters for an estimated cost of nearly 7 billion the block 60 f16 is the newest version of this aircraft and incorporates variety of modern systems including conformal fuel tanks for increasing range new mission computer and cockpit display an internal sensor suite and new agile beam radar the finalization of the contract reportedly was delayed by uae demands that the united states provide software codes for the f16s weapons systems technology the united states generally provides only to the closest allies of the united states as well as other technology release and price issues10 after nearly two years of negotiations over the f16 contract the uae and the us side reached final agreement in mid2000 on april 27 2000 the president sent to congress the formal statutory notification of the proposed final deal for sale of the f16s the proposal for the 80 f16 block 60 aircraft to be sold under us commercial export license is valued at 643 billion the weapons munitions and services portion of the proposal sold through the foreign military sales fms program is valued at slightly more than 2 billion11 9 defense news april 2026 1998 pp 1 50 janes defence weekly april 22 1998 p 21 10 blanche ed way could be open for f16 sale to emirates janes defence weekly may 26
