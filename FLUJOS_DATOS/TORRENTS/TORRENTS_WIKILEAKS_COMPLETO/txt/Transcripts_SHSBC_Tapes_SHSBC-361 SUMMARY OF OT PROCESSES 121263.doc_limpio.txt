summary of ot processes lecture given on 12 december 1963 thank you whats the date audience december 12th ad 13 twelve dec ad 13 the sun is still going south i was keeping close check on it its very difficult to do this i still have tendency to go into suns and so forth i dont hope you have that trouble in the near future but its rather funny feeling you know theres the thing and it isnt that its hot its that its sort of going slurp and you say well one too many crashes well probably have to cut this off the tape we mustnt talk about things like this now you see because of scientology zero and all that perfectly all right in this particular lecture because im going to try to give you now very fast and rapid summary of ot processes and this is matter of record not so much matter of education but matter of record its very important that we have rapid rundown it may not have been entirely in your view that how ot processes are done and the technology which is the final finished technology of internal bank running and so forth has not been made matter of record it is not matter of record its the bits and pieces which are around and even the materials on tape that are around do not form concise picture yet the technology itself is very precise its extremely crisp its probably the crispest piece of technology which we have and it is rounded off now to point where it isnt varying thousandth of millimeter ifs just dean on its not something you vary from now the liabilities are is having pc who doesnt know what the score is with regard to bank and who will argue with you about the structure of gpm some people become very concentrated on various parts of the bank and very easily make mistakes about parts of the bank and so on and get misconceptions about what theyre looking at you take some pc for instance who has two ris in view well lets take that that pc could very easily say well i have two gpms you see and become quite upset if you insisted they had more than that in terms of gpms because these are the visible manifested manifestations theyre just these two big ris and of course these are two horrendously overwhelming large pieces of mass and quite convincing and so on and you take somebody else that says well they dont have the helatrobus implants or they dont have this this is at the lower level dont you see well theres some possibility that thats true you see they might have missed and they might be from another galaxy and that has already been cared for in some of the bulletins but you know what some implants they do have however they wouldnt be on this planet without having the train implants thats impossible you couldnt have gotten here otherwise so there are sets of implants there that you could run into and so forth and there are variations and so on which occur at level v at what is now level v and there are variations somebody could have missed out on it and i found the other day back around trillions two whole set of implants i say the other day ive been colliding with them here and there and going back on the track running actual gpms but theres whole set of implants back around trillions two which are quite similar to the helatrobus implants for which we do not have the pattern which i dont have the pattern for and yet they look quite like it theres the standing parkingmeter type of implant jet and theres the wide fields and the railroad track and that sort of thing and heres this whole series of implants gpm type implants back there which we dont have well theres particular reason for to wrestle around with this someday somebody wants to get his star of something or other why he can go back and dig up the pattern for these things for ive taken enough knocking around on that line thank you and were just lucky i held together as long as i did now the upshot of this is that you can get variations you see in bank composition at level v heres somebody without the helatrobus implants and heres somebody else with another strange set of implants that nobodys ever seen you see you get these ar differences so there are case differences the patterns if youve got the helatrobus implant he hasnt got another helatrobus implant pattern its the same one but case differences dont you see hes come down different route because this has lot to do with the individuality of the individual you see and what he some of us were standing in the wrong place at the wrong time and he was fortunate enough to be in the right place at that particular time you see and he missed maybe he was incarcerated in stone while lot of things were going on who knows what happened to him at that period but you can get variations at level v is the only point im making but you dont get any variations at level vi if you had any variations the person wouldnt be here one person hasnt made different types of gpms than actual gpms than another person but lack of data on the part of that person and an overburdened case and not any complete or comprehensive understanding of what the symbols are supposed to apply to could bring about an apparent difference in the case am i making my point see they dont quite know what youre talking about and therefore they say they havent got them they have got them or something youve got leadpipe crash ive already gone through thinking cases were different at the ot process levels see ive already gone through this and i find out they arent different and that is that the differences are simply mistakes being made by the auditor or the pc and those mistakes show up catastrophically after little while now every gpm is composed similar to every other actual gpm actual gpms are not different in their basic composition the goal as an ri always is the first ri in the bank it then runs on up the line on solve basis not on an oppose basis its problem its the goals problem mass with the opposite items going on up the bank dont you see but those masses actually are very huge spheres theyre the all the accumulated energies and so forth anybody ever had anything to do with on this particular subject and they have been lived through and they have been accumulated now an actual gpm on the middle track they have sixteen to eighteen ris in them thats in the middle track area and late on the track they go that is closer to pt they go twentytwo to twentyfour ris each one has crossover the middle pair lets say if something has twenty reliable items in it then at the point of ten reliable items from the top you see youre going to get the crossover and the crossover is very important that means where the individual ceases to be for the goal and starts to be against the goal and on the opposition terminal side you get progression from all the way away from the goal up through the opposition terminals to the top oppterm which is dead for the goal and on the terminal side you have the goal as an ri at the bottom and it progresses up to the crossover for the goal and then on gradient scale goes against the goal the top terminal of an actual gpm is dead against the goal if the goal were to be strong the top terminal would be something like weak see it would be something like being weak now that pattern has to be pretty well understood otherwise the pc is going to get into trouble and the auditor is going to get in trouble thats invariable so those patterns are all similar it doesnt matter where the thing positions on the track the pattern is similar but this change does take place as you go earlier track you get more items for the goal the crossover drifts higher but this is monitored by whether or not the pc as thetan liked the goal or not you can have the crossover appear almost at the bottom of the goal on one which the pc detests to be servant if the pc really detested that you could expect the crossover to occur along about the first couple or three pairs theres this individual variation they detest it in other words but this isnt something the auditor has to pay very much attention to doesnt have to pay very much attention to that eccentricity so that its not an important eccentricity it isnt its something that you can expect to find occasionally to be obedient or to be good dont be too alarmed if your crossover takes place very early and the pc turns against the goal along about the second pair third pair up from the bottom the pc is dead against it now and the rest of it is just long decline in other words the point of the crossover can be monitored by whether or not the pc liked having this goal and living with it do you understand theres only that variation as far as the crossover is concerned and theres the variation of shorter gpms the earlier they occur on the track now the time span occupied by gpm is longer earlier in other words the earlier an actual gpm is the more time span it occupied and the later the closer to pt that gpm is the less time it occupied its nothing to have modern gpm for instance only occupy billion years you see and it is nothing for an early gpm to occupy as much as trillions thirty to trillions twenty one gpm these things have tremendous space tremendous time spans early on the track horrendous there are about this is now guess but is an educated guess about twentysix of these things or thereabouts in bank very few the closest to pt gpm can be expected to be what is called truncated and that makes it very difficult to enter the track because it may have any number of items in it and if anything anyone ever called an emeter lie detector they were in error on case analysis you can only really take those things which blow down the tone arm dont take those things that just go tick you can only really count on what blows down the tone arm and you very often are asking the right answer without tone arm blowdown and there are many variations of and upsets which occur trying to ouijaboard an emeter trying to get it to give you the truth as to what you are looking at it is something for you to know that an emeter is not reliable in this particular line it is only of relative use and if you find that all is perfectly correct on the emeter why then theres some possibility that youre right but it doesnt work the other way if its all perfectly correct on the emeter and you take it that way you sometimes are trying to pound square pegs into round holes and do all kinds of oddball things that wont go now you do know that gpm when found will read it doesnt necessarily read forever but it does read and it does give you nice long rocket reads and it does give you blowdowns when found and so forth but dont expect it to go on reading forever now the present time gpm of course being truncated will have less than full gpm which makes it very hard to find its top let us say you are trying to find the top of the present time gpm and you have gratuitously counted out on your meter that is has sixteen ris in it which means that its well past the crossover and is not yet complete the pc has not lived this one out yet all the way up so therefore you wont have the exact top then its something short of the final attainment of the goal on the oppterm side and its something short of being dead against the goal on the terminal side how short see and dont cut your throat after you have worked with the pc for seventyfive hours to get this all straightened out to find out that your trouble is that it only had two ris in it the bottom oppterm and the goal as an ri and when you have done one on which you understood it only had the bottom oppterm this is what you got off the meter and the goal as an ri dont be too alarmed or cut your throat or kill the pc just because you find that it was really the second gpm and is there in full and has its top oppterm and its top terminal you may not find this out until youve run eight gpms out of the pc in full beautiful confidence you say we found his present time gpm we ran it out beautifully and youre getting down the bank and you find out every once in while the pc has somatics and theyre sort of sticky and things are upset and sooner or later youre going to have to repair all this anyway so you go back and you take look and much to your horror you find out that full gpm you didnt even find anything out of it really because of course it didnt discharge you didnt find the top items and theres full gpm sitting there as the present time gpm and then you ran all that out and you asked the meter is there any gpm closer to present time and the meter just smooth absolutely smooth rise not trace of any so you say well just in case here were going to try to do the present time list in other words were going to list as though there is one up here because every time we mention this fact we get rise rised tone arm must be some mass there to make the tone arm rise so lets see if we cant possibly try this you list it and you do relatively short list and the pc gives you the pt gpm and it has six items in it and you do get all those and they run out rapidly and then you of course where youve parked the pc back down the track thats now going to raise hell with you because youve poured all the charge of running where you had to patch up the upper bank onto the ri that was waiting to be run so your next list off of that is going to be awfully corny and messy and youre going to have trouble you cannot be sure youve got the present time gpm you do the best you can you find the next goals you run them down you do the best you can all the time you do it as nearly perfect as you can do it and then always suspect that there are more ris up into pt and that the thing can be straightened out and repaired do you understand that see you go ahead with great confidence and do everything that you can get done because after all youre getting charge off all the way and it isnt unremediable if you make terrible mistakes with the first couple of gpms this is not unremediable and earlier gpms on the track will run and they will give you trouble and the pc will have more somatics ordinarily its harder to find items but not much harder and the pc can live through it you understand this doesnt then isnt any particular reason to commit suicide but dont underestimate the ability of these processes to practically kill the pc that pc with gpms missed top of the bank chopped up everything going to hell in balloon the pc not too well educated auditor not too well educated this is always going to happen at the beginning of the bank dont you see now youre going to have all the trouble sitting on your head and youre all of sudden going to skip gpm supposing you did anything like this you skipped whole gpm because of the listing and you actually skipped two and you started running one out below it and oohhhh the pc goes around with articular sclerosis or palpitations of the medulla oblongata feels like hell man pc can never feels worse than on r4 run wrong if big error has developed in r4 you can guarantee that this pc is going to feel like hospital case heart hurts brain hurts back of the neck hurts you get into quote actual gpm that has shown up every place as an actual gpm oh everything is fine and then you find out youre running an implant gpm with actual items you get the wrong wrongly worded gpm as youre going on down the bank and the pcs rr shuts off and there he is sick at his stomach throwing up bad bad business but he can live through it the one you should be afraid of is the auditor not living through it its mainly the auditor pc will ordinarily keep going but the auditor sometimes gets very quivery indeed i dont wish to paint this up blacker than it is but im certainly not going to give it to you whiter than it is so your pt gpm is the one you are listing for and working for and so forth and very often isnt found until several gpms are run you think you have found it and then and behold you havent found it you think you got all the items out of it and you find out youve got nothing but items from other banks youve made mistake but somehow or another youve kept going and you can always straighten these things out now the programing of this is only done one way now let tell you that with great earnestness theres only one program there arent several programs ive tried them all and they just dont work they make trouble for the case they make trouble for the auditor and they are undoable there is only one program i cant be too emphatic on that and that is you find the pt gpm you find its top terminal you list the top terminal for two items in other words you list it twice because youve got to get the first and second oppterms from it and then from the second oppterm getting the solved it you go on down the bank all right ive said that very fast and probably left you bit adrift but im ill go over it again but i want to give you the programing you find the present time gpm you list the present time gpm out you find the next gpm and you list it out and you find the next gpm and you list out that and you keep going that way now you can cut in and find the second gpm by accident and find out later that it was the second gpm and then by doing goal oppose of it find the actual first gpm but that is always just in the thats just at the risk of the game youre just correcting mistake made that doesnt alter the type of programing youre trying to do the type of programing is you find the pt gpm or something that you could believe was the pt gpm or that answers up and behaves like the present time gpm you run all the items out of it then you do goal oppose list and find the next gpm and run get its top oppterm and then run it on all the items out of it and then find the next gpm and so forth and you just keep up that action until you are at the beginning of track and you will arrive at the beginning of track and that is the only programing that is successful finding any gpm that fires and trying to goal oppose it to present time is not hard to do its impossible you will not arrive with the pt gpm youll arrive with messedup track its not doable program now somebody has had goal somebody has had goal to be mean all right had this goal and it was run back in 1962 and something like that this case then is specially handled nope you do the same programing as before you can sometimes get away with doing goal oppose and its been gotten away with often enough that it was not noticed that it wasnt gotten away with hardly ever you handle this case the same way in 1962 they had goal to be mean and this goal was run out and two or three other gpms were run out and all this was very interesting and copacetic and fascinating to one and all and so forth this does not alter your programing one single scrap the programing is find the present time gpm by listing for it the command is very very short and sweet what is your present time actual gpm or any other such wording just list for the present time gpm thats all this can be very long list and it follows goals list and when youve finally got the thing down to where youve gone fifty past the last rr seen on listing and youre getting tone arm action while listing it the gpm is on that list somewhere and you do it by elimination now oddly enough it sounds impossible that it would ever arrive it sounds impossible that this could be done and let tell you that in actual fact it has been successful wherever tried now the barout there was that it didnt sound like guy would ever come up with his present time gpm but actually that was only theoretical supposition in actual fact they come up with their present time gpm every time you ask for it youll get it of course this has to be an educated pc pc who hasnt gone through the lower classes up to this point hasnt got prayer not prayer i mean they even if you got them into the top of the bank you wouldnt get them anyplace well im looking at an oldtimer now that says oh i bet you i could take it away and so forth and i could show them and so on and hed wind up with it and along about the time he was about four or five gpms back along the track hed wish to god hed kept them on find something that is really real to you in this room laughter look it isnt that they dont know the parts it isnt that they couldnt be tracked through on some brief instruction its they themselves have insufficient security on being audited to know they can be gotten out of what theyre getting into and theyll panic and theyll panic requires terrific stability on the part of pc to go through this the auditor finds wrong item goes three or four down below this wrong item gets into an endless list somatic turns on pcs jaw feels like its being wrapped around to the back of his head stomach feels like its being tied into bowline on bight feels worse at this particular moment than hes ever heard of arc broken like mad through some basic auditing flub which keys in all the rest of the bypassed charge pc without stability education the long haul and knowingness who hasnt been brought up as an auditor at this point will say show the nearest hospital and that will be the end of him he gets in there the doctors say oh your chin is on the back of your head hes had it hes had it its basically matter of understanding that will carry him through it and all too often you running up the line when you get there you will finish session where somebody has wrapped you around telegraph pole quite accidentally and inadvertently and youll say whats going on whats going on and the only thing thats holding you steady is you know basically whats gone on that it can only be certain number of elements that have gone out and you start sorting these things out and the auditor has practically gone around the bend between sessions and go into the next session and say well you found the right top terminal but the wrong top oppterm so therefore were bypassing the charge of the top oppterm and thats why we arent getting anyplace you check it reads on the meter and so forth and he promptly and immediately gets the right top oppterm and you give him the terminal and hes away but in that short space of time why an uneducated uncomprehending pc just would have thrown in the sponge now its the pc this is whats interesting about this process it is the pc who comes up with the answers its the pc who finds out whats going wrong now very very clever auditor can very often take pc who has quit quit trying to find out and get enough bypassed charge off so as to get some facts back on the table again ill give you an instance pcs next gpm found but wouldnt read for some reason or other mistake made wouldnt read so the list is continued and continued and continued all during that space of time the pc is doping off cant keep awake gpms missed see go back the invalidation is so severe on the actual goal that it reads like wrong goal is this wrong goal and it rocket reads after while the pc says well it just must be something thats so invalidated that its got everything all upset pc by this time might be quite ill by the way feeling terrible and so forth and so well you just better get on to that goal you just better get onto that goal and you better prepcheck it the auditors tried to prepcheck it before and the pc wouldnt consent to it because he said it was the wrong goal get the thing straightened out all of sudden why all the somatics come off everything goes back to battery it rocket reads and theyre away might be overlooked might be overlooked completely its mostly up to the pc thats brandnew look in auditing isnt it you get the idea the auditors supposed to sit there and drive this eighteen horse wagon and arrive someplace and so forth and as matter of fact its too complex drive there are just too many horses now pc can also be absolutely sold on something and the auditor go along with it and wind the pc up in the soup ive had it happen to be threequarters of the way through bank this is before i became very very wise if you can get five items down bank without turning the pcs rr off dont ever let anybody sell you on the idea that the goal is misworded wrongly worded or wrong goal the rr didnt go off in the first five items well thats the right goal man it isnt off one hair thats correct goal but when i was bit younger and greener on this particular process i let pc sell the idea of its the goal being wrong everything was going wrong nothing could be listed right nothing was coming up right the goals lists were all appetite over tin cup and everything was blowing up and so forth and the goal had already arrived down around the crossover area and the pc insisting it was wrong goal ive actually listed and found two new goals with the pc halfway through gpm until i woke up to the fact that it couldnt have been wrong goal its just that the pc had gotten into dramatization of one of the items and so despised this goal and so despised everything about this goal the pc wanted nothing to do with the goal and it was coming from the actual sense and impetus of the goal not from anything else but because the pc was having hard time running it then the auditor was willing to buy the fact that there was more wrong than there was wrong now therefore we get to one of the rules of this of which there are many and that is if it is running all right keep running dont make trouble till trouble happens and you would just be surprised at how horribly true that is its trouble that takes time thats one of the old maxims about these ot processes that session time is consumed by trouble well ill give you an idea i got in the last three hour session i gave on this i got out twothirds of gpm finished found goal and ran third of the next gpm in three hour session well there was trouble being made by anybody take up the trouble when you run into the trouble dont handle trouble you havent got and if you can learn that real well by george youre going to be in clover but dont handle trouble you havent got pc happy go on auditing pc unhappy stamp on brakes throw out clutch and find out what is wrong dont ever force the pc forward past an arc break or bad trouble find out what is wrong but dont try to find out what is wrong when there isnt anything wrong now the reason for this is is you can invalidate goals and items and make them read and behave like wrong items and the auditor can actually make trouble and an auditor who is bound and determined to make trouble in ot processes has ample field for his talent has tremendous areas of talent he just hardly has to try at all now the read the read which you get on an emeter is read you have ever seen anyplace else it is not an rr it is not fall it is not surge but is itself and it looks like this it springs up against rubber rubber buffer here if it goes tick and theres sharp tick there that just never will be the item never never will be the item but its hitting this rubber bumper and the real item will hit the rubber bumper and then go force its way through it see thats the way it will read and it goes through it looks like its actually ramming through stone wall of some kind or another and it starts and then accelerates and goes on through that wall and thats the way real item look and it only looks that way and it goes the whole dial and it brings about blowdown and everything else happens thats supposed to happen on the thing goals when there are real goals being found next up often read that way and they often merely rocket read nicely thats unimportant its the item the item finding thats important and the rule in item finding is this you let the pc list as long as the pc wants to list and then you find the item on the early part of the list that has variations to it sometimes the pc has put it on the early part of the list wrongly worded and you get wrongly worded item reading and then the pc will correct its wording which makes it then appear that its on the end of the list dont you see but the thing to do is these are very short lists item lists are short and goals lists are long that doesnt always hold good because my recent goals lists are one two and three items long well i put it on the list whats the use of going on forever there it is blowing up the meter rocket reading and so forth and thats it and heat blowing off and so on so why should we go on if you tried to go on after that point the pc would simply go into blackout well thats pc getting pretty educated man you see the thing there and you know what it is and it reads and so forth but even then you get fooled show you how little of scientology has come out of my bank which is quite interesting to it used to alarm every once in while ugh did i take this out of my own bank you see was this some type of aberrative action used to scare half to death i ran into to destroy the other day on the goals line see well now who or what would to destroy oppose for the next goal i know you could say it in chorus to create see obvious isnt it my bank isnt rigged that way and you know i had the awfulest time trying to get my wits wrapped around what the actual item was i gave goals list of about fourteen or fifteen items which was then extended out for about four pages because i myself couldnt cognite on what the next goal was the next goal was to worship to destroy opposes to worship and i trying to get that through my wits i was too well trained i knew what it should be to create and that appeared on the first first one on the list and i gave it so much credence its nothing but an implant gpm see theres lot of implant gpms to create and it would rocket read see that must be it and so forth and the auditor would say well is that an actual gpm is that an implant gpm it rocket reads that its an implant gpm well i know but everybody knows that to destroy opposes to create see well it still rocket reads but its an implant gpm well go on and null the rest of the list and finally she got the one halfway down the first page and so forth to worship she says well that rocket reads i said i know but that couldnt be it couldnt be and finally i squared it around if i were coming up the bank this way and i had to worship here then i would of course postulate destroy if i got up to here well it opposed that way but would it oppose this way and i finally creak creak managed to get the thing and of course it flew into line and after that read well but because the bank had become so upset by this time it stayed upset and was very hard to run the only thing it had done for was give somatic sometimes when i played the organ laughter actually had nothing to do with religion that was what was the matter with the bank at that stage because this was way back thetan track see it had nothing to do with religion and you try to list religious type objects like believing see belief so forth they werent in the bank see you were merely supposed to worship objects and places it was back then when youd dedicate yourself to believing absolutely that mountaintop was holy see only such word as holy you see that it merely should be worshipped good game you get up in the morning walk out of your cave and you say ah i worship thee mountaintop you know which is quite fascinating because there are ramifications of it now religion came along few umpteen brumpf trillions rumpf years later see and somebody started saying theres somebody named god and it started doing this and it started doing that and you should go to church and so forth and it sure raised hell with my organ playing anyhow laughter because nobody could bend the gpm around to what the gpm would normally be considered to be well the earlier you go on the track the earlier you go on the track the simpler and more direct the things are now late on the track late on the track you will find that these items have tendency to be dispersive youll have items like certainty and items like predictability and solved by unpredictability dont you see and then the very next ones to it in other words its less neat pattern thetan is thinking more complicatedly hes thinking more involvedly hes in more dispersed state dont you see he isnt really down to earth and down to the groove now you start getting back on the track bit and hes getting simpler i had goal to construct see and almost knocked myself out trying to find the bottom oppterm you know to construct you see economic hazards you see decadent societies trying to find the bottom oppterm of this thing you see old empires and so on and i had an awful time trying to find it because the bottom oppterm was lack of construction you know youve gotten so youre outsmarting yourself here you are at this end of the track you see in highly complex complicated state of mind frankly able to think very complicated thoughts dont you see and early on the track its awfully its not even early but on middle and backtrack it is getting very simple minded so the gpm and their wordings look little different and as you get back as you get back about middle track on most pcs youll find out that word like the goal is appearing in about 80 percent of the items well lets take lets take this gpm to construct see eighty percent of the time youll have constructing or not liking to construct or something like that will be appearing in the terminals and oppterms in other words there will be something about constructing or something like this appearing in those things or hoping to construct you see that will be the tenor of the items and about 20 percent of the time youll have something that is different like difficulties not difficulties in construction but difficulties see that isnt related to it now you understand im just talking about the wording of the items and you get earlier track and it is all almost 100 percent this way where word sense of the goal well lets take to be you see all right then wanting to be or having to be might be the top oppterm you see and then its to be to be to be to be to be everything is being or to be and all of the terminals have to do with beingness and being and to be dont you see so theres be in every one of those items one way or the other whether its beingness or to be or something of the sort well theres just be all over the place and only once in blue moon do you get rare item like time see there sits time in virginal purity not time to be you see but just time clunch you see its sitting there like an item and means it too well but very close to pt very close to pt you get tremendous variation in items and very seldom do you see the goal word repeating in the items which makes it actually much harder to list see what i mean lets say we and now closer to pt your goals are much more complex and therefore theyre harder to get oppositions to the hard end of the track is the present time end of the track the beginning of the case its much harder to get oppositions to something like to dance forever well thats more pt gpm see to dance forever or to be an aesthetic success see you got various types of gpms in other words they have more complex thing about this theres greater complexity in the thing to entice lovers now you can just see the dwindling spiral of the thetan as you look over these gpm things hes getting more complicated as he gets on and on and hes got less scope and hes getting less wide between these opposites and they are much more complicated and particularized and the dispersion that he is undergoing in terms of items is much greater and hes being nattery and picky and so forth but youll get types of items like to hope everything will be all right see now thats perfectly valid present time type gpm it doesnt say he wont have simple one in present time dont you see but the chances are far against it middle track why theyre starting they are simple by middle track but lets say you get two or three gpms back youre liable to start running into the simpler types of gpms and middle track you youll get such simplicities as to do see to think to postulate youre now getting very simple gpms and early track of course they just remain simple all the way on back but your hard part of the track is the beginning of the track and those gpms tend to be more complex as i say they have more items in them the word of the goal does not appear repetitively in each one of them and i suppose youve gone through implant areas youve gotten sick of these goals appearing youve gotten allergic to it you dont make the goal word appear every time doesnt mean your track is wrong dont you see when youre doing it on the pc then merely because you havent got the goal word appearing in every item well you couldnt have in the first place lets take an actual gpm to look on the bright side and you think this is going to be repeated as mouthful in every one of those items you see actually is practically nothing in that then youll be absolutely sure that on gpm like to desire that the second terminal from the bottom of course naturally would be desiring things or something like that you see obviously obviously itll be some verbal form of that and late on the track close to pt you see this is just as likely to be wanting something its skipped the rails that fast in other words you get changes these are more changeable the pattern itself doesnt change if anything the pattern is even more secure the top oppterm is definitely the goal the top terminal is definitely against the goal you see the crossover is there and so on now the hard things to list now lets get on to something else here the hard things to list are the top terminal and the bottom oppterm and thats shooting into the blue because theres real clue as to what theyll be anything about the top terminal is very often controlled by the next goal but you get fooled this way youll think the pattern is going to hold and the pattern doesnt hold lets have the goal to postulate and the top terminal of the gpm just before it of course would probably be like you know postulating things or something like that it might be preview of the goal youre about to get see as youre living up the track see and not so not so it can just be completely off it might be just sitting see it might be as far off as just sitting doesnt smack of the gpm that follows it you see on the other hand it might be quite similar to it like thinking that comes very close to postulate dont you see in other words you cant predict what that top terminal is going to be thats what im going to was talking about you cant really predict what its going to be except that its just going to be opposite to the goal it might or might not be foreshadow of the next gpm just coming up it might or might not be the bottom oppterm is the reason he done it of course the real reason he done it is the gpm hes just lived through but his particular penchant close to pt is usually expressed in the bottom oppterm corner that bottom oppterm sitting over there is opposite the goal as an ri and its going to say what hes mad at in your pt gpms you know like civilization you know or financial institutions or something or other you could just guess yourself silly and if your pc wasnt fairly educated and his sight into the bank wasnt good and your basic auditing wasnt good and so forth hed just miss it like mad just miss it like crazy its hard one to get in other words and that of course tells you that probably your two bottom oppterms and your two top terminals in any gpm forecast some difficulty the toughest ones are the bottom oppterm and the top terminal theyre going to give you some trouble but thats in terms of difference of wording and that sort of thing thats going to be rough now lets get into something little bit more like technique how do you really list one of these things and how do you find it all right well you do your pt goals list and you finally get goal by doing that and you try to count how many ris there are in it and plot it up accordingly you get your well you find out theres twelve ris twelve reliable items in it its not full gpm in other words and you know with twelve reliable items its one pair past the crossover so its just little bit against the goal the terminal is just little bit against the goal so you get the pc to list this but also theres another trick what terminal are you sitting in just now that gives him thats good thing to list now why dont you list the oppterm that would be so much easier wouldnt it yeah the oppterm why dont you list your bank thats the same question he doesnt know whats there but he is sitting in and is intimately connected with as himself this top terminal because thats the one hes living through life in now there can be several patterns at the top of the bank but the patterns that are mainly there are the most is that its just cut off at that point and there are two ris at the top of the bank and one is an oppterm and one is terminal thats right into pt here and here is terminal and here is an oppterm all right it is very difficult to list for the oppterm very easy to list for the terminal so you list for the terminal find out what the terminal is and then do two lists from that same terminal one is the top oppterm and the next is the second oppterm two lists from the same terminal you see because the charge will expire on the oppterm there wont be any charge left on the oppterm but youd have to do two lists from it you see these things always proceed from the oppterm oppterm over to the level terminal with it then kittycorner down to the next oppterm and then horizontally over to the next terminal and then kittycorner down to the next oppterm and then over here to the terminal now why if you get this higgledypiggledy in the first gpm you are going to be kittycorner from the oppterm down to the next terminal below it and that doesnt solve the bank doesnt run that way and doesnt solve that way and you just go skipping out into the blue youre in trouble right away quick so you get it level there you want to get two opposition terminals from the top terminal sometimes you almost wreck yourself you get them on the same list and theres two items firing on that first terminal list and one is the top oppterm and one is the second oppterm so you trace this thing back you do your who or what would solve get your terminal back again from it that takes all the charge off take it down to the second oppterm then solve it across and go on down the bank in that way now items always solve items always solve items solve goals always oppose goals always oppose never do goals solve list what goal would solve what goal youll wind yourself up and the pc in more soup than youve been in for some time goals oppose items solve and theres never any difference from that now youre going to run into little trouble on this because you realize that the goal as an ri sounds like goal and youll get twisted up here by not realizing that youre handling an item when you get down to the bottom terminal which is the goal as an ri but that is an item solve list to the next oppterm now remember what you do now you found the whole of your top bank youve got that now now youre going to do goal oppose list to get the goal of the second gpm you now by assessment by elimination get that goal youve got that goal now thats the end of all oppositions thats it but youve still got an unsolved ri which is the goal as an ri and your next list is and this is the most critical action in the whole kit and caboodle is you take the goal as an ri who or what would it solve and get the top oppterm of the next gpm you already find it you know its name so forth but you want the top oppterm of that so thats goal as an ri solve and you get nice beefy list and you have an educated pc hell give you this list very easily and very well but it still must be long list you have my permission to go kick yourself when you take one item top oppterm list for the next bank any time you do and get into trouble and intensives later are still sweating on it why you have my permission to give yourself good swift kick in the shins because you didnt hear what im going to tell you now which is just this just this that is the touchiest part of the bank and you get that top oppterm wrong youre going to be wrong from there on out youre not even going to be running the pc in that gpm the pc will skip and go into another gpm and youre going to get nothing but hogwash from there on you get wrong top oppterm youve had it all else in that bank youre about to run is going to be wrong and it is the easiest one there is to get wrong because it looks the simplest its the fooler what is it its the its the final achievement of the goal the top oppterm is the final achievement of the goal the pcs now against it final achievement of the goal final achievement oh on goal to sneeze it would be sneezing or sneezed or people who sneeze or sneezers or having to sneeze and not wanting to sneeze its something like this dont you see thats what its going to be now if we were running implant gpms all wed have to do is give the auditor pattern see and the pc pattern and they just fill in all the blank spots and everything is very happy only actual gpms dont run that that exactly they are quite similar one to the next but they dont run with that exactitude you get yourself slightly misworded top oppterm and youve had it for the rest of the bank theres the touchy spot so you do nice long top oppterm list items lists normally are short goals lists are long goals lists are normally underlisted and items lists are usually overlisted when you make mistakes but that top oppterm list has got to be nice long list you want twenty or so items in that thing you want twenty thirtyitem list up there i dont care if the pc is sitting there this is one time you dont promote his itsa pc will always tell you with what aplomb ive done it myself should know with what aplomb they say ah the next bank sneeze oh its sneezing haha thats it rocket reads blows down and so forth and you you knucklehead you take it whoa only trouble is sneezing is the third terminal from the bottom of the bank at which moment the whole bank goes upside down see youre handling actual mass here and the pc doesnt know where he is and even if you discard it and get the right one you now have the whole bank in tangle oh you can work through it and so forth but youll sort of wish you hadnt its all tough to do the time to do it is just to sit there meanly and viciously regardless of the pcs itsa thats the one point where the pcs itsa is totally disregarded theres another point is when the pc halfway through bank where his rr has not turned off said that its not his goal you disregard his itsa at that point too because it obviously is his goal now the upshot of this situation is youve got to have the right top oppterm the best way to get it is to get nice complete list for it and you now null this list nicely and you will get the right one firing now this has to be of course with the pcs cooperation to get anything to fire in this sort of bank you get the pc to put his attention on it and go over it do it by heat after youve listed it down the whole way say which one did you have heat on and the pc will say oh well it was it was the awful necessity to sneeze and you say thats fine thats fine you see just above it having to sneeze so theres possibility that the heat went on with having to sneeze dont you see and he didnt notice it till you get to the awful necessity to sneeze youre never quite sure about this type of thing so you go back and you cover that little area there and see if you cant get that to read and sure enough having to sneeze you read it and it springs and you read it and it springs and you read it and it goes rrrrrrrh and through she goes and she blows down and that is the pcs item and that is the top oppterm now you go ahead and check it out you say is that the top oppterm and pc yeah yeah and that rocket reads and thats all fine and everybody is copacetic now be very careful with the terminal dont necessarily do short terminals list be very very careful getting that top terminal because i already told you that is very critical point because the meaning of it is very hard to get it will simply be an opposite meaning to the bank at large of course he has some clue in the bank hes just left and so forth but he will normally get it itll leak through his skull what it is hell put it down on the list and youll get that read now check them both out now that youve got the two top ris check them out make sure go right through song and dance here just make awful confounded sure that both of them are absolutely correct before you go another foot now the reason for this is simple reason you can get this going in bank and when youve got this going in bank youve had it it just goes hours and hours of slug and upset and so on its sort of circular invalidation you find four items forward then find one item back of you is wrong three items back is wrong so you go back and get that and then you correct the next three items and go two forward and then you go back two and you find out one of those pair is wrong and then you move forward and youre always moving into messedup area dont you see youve always overshot with from listing from wrong items honest it just drives pc nuts because now hes listed all the items hes got are on lists someplace but what lists are they on dont you see and he cant quite see it and put it down youre always listing into messedup area mess up the area and then go back and correct something you see which automatically means the area you went into now probably hasnt got any right item in it when you find wrong item behind you you accept items you have found after that got that it isnt correcting this little item and then taking the rest of them nuh uh if any of the items you found after you found the wrong item if you find any of them are right just consider it coincidence its purely coincidental now the way you check up bank to find yourself wrong item is just go back to the top of the bank and start reading the items off with the rudiments of the session in and read them off session rudiments in not rudiments in on every item and you read those items off and the wrong item behind you will tick the item that ticks is wrong it does not mean that it has not been opposed it doesnt matter if it rocket reads when you read it it still doesnt mean its not been opposed it means the item that read is wrong and that is an absolutely inflexible rule ive gone through absolute hell to prove up that rule and that rule is proven if an item behind you reads it is wrong item i dont care if it rocket reads or anything else you could say to yourself and you will sooner or later youll hit one and youll be cheerful about it and youll say well i guess it just hasnt been opposed so of course theres still charge on it and pc says its right that its right so well accept it and of course youll run into the same culdesac that you just went into before youll go straight into the same culdesac you go back and try to get use that item again that read and youll go into the same culdesac it doesnt matter what happened the item should not be reading the item that reads behind you is wrong and it being wrong throws into question and throws out every item found after that and its only by accident that any of those items will be right so you pay attention to them at all you just go on listing the bank muddied up now as though you had never listed it before now you get back on to one of the items youve had before you of course have to use its oppose list but because youve got so much bypassed charge it probably wont be correct anyhow but you have to pay attention to it youve got mess on your hands and you have to take what you can get to get yourself out of this wicked lot now how do you correct this wrong item you take the list on which it appeared and look earlier and if it was the first or second item on the list look later of course look you dont continue to list you dont continue the list you got it off of you look elsewhere on the list now it could be the list is incomplete lets say were listing sneeze who or what would solve sneeze or who or what would solve sneezes or something see were listing that list weve listed it and we have found we have found drug preparations weve gone six more beyond it and were going to come back and checking out the bank because what happens is is we all of sudden cant find an item we run into list its blank i mean we cant get anything to read matter how long it lists where are we see were going into nowhere where are we and so forth and youll just deadend you wont make it and so youve got to go back because you cant get anything to read now youve got to go back and you find out drug preparations drug preparations clank see all right that means the list who or what would solve sneezes it means that you got the wrong item off that list doesnt mean the list is incomplete it means you got the wrong item off of that list so you look on that list for the right item two items reading on the same items list means nothing listing rules apply only and do apply ferociously to goals lists all the listing rules youve ever been given apply to goals lists but they only apply to goals lists you can have six items reading on an item solve list doesnt invalidate the list one of the six is right and you dont continue the list youll find that when you have wrong goal youll run into phenomenon at first everything you put down reads thats one of the gimmicks everything you write down reads everything you call back to the pc reads everything reads to the pc and that will continue for little while and then nothing reads the tone arm goes clank the needle goes absolutely stiff as poker you cant get anything to rocket read rr and all motion of the needle and the tone arm and everything else will turn off completely until such time as you continue the goals list now you start to correct it or can write goals list or something else it will come back on as soon as you find the goal for that area why bango your rr is on at once the only thing that shuts off the only thing that shuts off an rr is wrong goal wrong items will not do so you can however overrun gpm you can be running down they did it here when they were first running these things year ago or so theyd go on down the list pocketapocketapocketapocketa and thirty or forty or fifty items later the rr would shut off well of course they had long since ceased to run in the gpm for which they had goal and had long time now been running in gpms that they had goal so you can overrun the goal as an ri and it doesnt get on the list and shoot into the next gpm and the rr will go off but even then you see its not having the goal that shuts off the rr you start listing too many items for which you have goal and the rr will go off inevitably the way you lose somebodys rr needle motion surges and that sort of thing the only thing and this is marvelous thing to know when i finally found this out i mean i could heave huge sigh of relief because its the most marvelous proof in the world of gpm you get four or five items deep into gpm and the rr is still on why you knew it was the right gpm anybody try to shake your confidence in that zzut the right gpm man that rr would have been off long since if thered been the slightest comma wrong with it you say well it might have stayed on with to sneeze but maybe the goal is to be sneezed at and it could be slightly misworded slightly misworded off goes the rr you see it isnt even slightly misworded its deanon if the rrs if the rr if youve still got an rr youve got the right goal thats all there is to it so relax cruel thing to do to test goal by seeing if the rr goes off its not something an auditor would undertake with aplomb its very cruel thing to do to pc because it makes him feel like hell but nevertheless is last resort test and you make this test every gpm you find you never know if its gpm youre not going to sit there for hours pounding away because youre going to pull the goal as an ri up from the bottom of the bank up to the top of the bank youre not going to sit there for hours and prepcheck it and call it and so forth and yipyap at it endless youre not going to do that thats all youre going to make it rocket read and it rocket read rocket read instantly and the pc says its gpm and you got blowdown and that sort of thing thats it and after that youre not going to call it anymore youre not even going to say how does this item relate to to sneeze that wording is out its how does this item relate to this gpm you never call the goal again not until you get it down to the goal as an ri you even refer to it by the number of gpm it is on the track you refer to it as the sixth gpm sixth actual gpm how does this item relate to this gpm you know the pc runs much smoother the gpm is much less pulled up see why every time you repeat this thing youre pulling the goal as an ri up toward where you are and youre disarranging the bank to some degree so you just dont call it all that much you certainly never prepcheck it you never do anything to it thats saved for when you are straightening out the whole track if you ever do after you have run out all the gpms oh go back and prepcheck them by all means and if youve invalidated somebodys goal to point where its made him sick as pup or something like this well by all means youve got to prepcheck that goal but you say the goal as rarely as possible you say on to sneeze has anything been suppressed on this goal has anything been suppressed on this goal has anything been suppressed got the idea you dont keep saying to sneeze to sneeze to sneeze what are you trying to do youre trying to push the pc down to the bottom of that gpm or pull the gpm up to where the pc is got the idea use that with economy then all right in tearing on down the bank youll find there are many indicators many many indicators there is lots to know about this sort of thing but the rules are relatively simple and theyre deanon theyre deanon you always check these things out you always say is this an actual gpm after you have found the goal is this this is this that is this such and such so on and so on and so on and so on and youll find out after youve run five or six out of pc that you get response whatsoever none pc knows far more about it than the meter pc said yeah its an actual gpm oneandahalfdivision tone arm blowdown yes this is the top ri rocket read but you say is this the top is this the top oppterm see is this the top oppterm there it sits see is this the top oppterm there it sits is this the top oppterm pc will say well what do you want i want to know if its the top oppterm yeah its the top oppterm rocket read if its not the top oppterm and the pc says its the top oppterm it wont rocket read but youll find the subitsa line is moving up toward the pcs ability to itsa till they are almost at parity and then it reverses i dont know what you do then i think thats dangerous part of the track im not quite sure how you run the early part of the track when you cant get ahold of the pc and so forth well know all about that very soon basic auditing must be very very well in basic auditing must be well in on an auditor before he attempts to run this sort of thing and the pc must be easily auditable before he goes on this kind of thing because the littlest piece of basic auditing can make the pc desperate and very ill and youve got to be able to promote the pcs itsa youve got to be able to handle the pcs ptps youve got to promote the pcs confidence rather than distinctly different than his itsa hes got to get his confidence up youve got to nurture that confidence because in very few gpms youre going to run out of emeter and if his confidence and knowingness isnt high you have substitute for anything so the pc is moving on up the line and your basic auditing has to be very nearly flawless and youve got to be able to talk to pc the pcs got to be willing to talk to you as the auditor all these various things about basic auditing have got to be very well in line now the only thing that makes bad basic auditor is person who is afraid of becoming ot or sees great deal of harm or upset in being exteriorized or in being set adrift or alone without body or the idea of setting people adrift or alone without body restimulates all of those people theyve held down with one foot on their throat and stuck spears in their stomachs of thats exteriorization too murder in other words and you get somebody who is doing poor job of basic auditing down around level ii level iii level iv their basic auditing will start to fly out like one of these cape canaveral boomerangs theyre sending up into the sky and it will just start flying out further and further and further and further because theyre getting closer and closer to actually going exterior or being exterior or exteriorizing somebody and all of the perils and terrors associated with that go into restimulation its dont it goes into many many complications its dont deserve to be exterior dont deserve to be free dont deserve to be clear mustnt be clear it makes them desperately ill they get ris go into restimulation on the subject of just the thought of moving out of the body they go dzzzzzzz oh not for and of course they know thats so horrible for them they dont want to do it to somebody else and what you actually do is run into bunch of bank now it isnt the significance of the bank so dont look for it in significances this will be great shock to you if youre trying to straighten out an auditor so he can run this sort of thing and youre looking for goal to never help anybody see that isnt it its the pure mechanics of the situation it will just be gpms collided with gpms in such way that any thought of moving out of the body or moving into any exterior state throws energy masses into collision one with another which brings about feeling of bzzzzzzz see its mechanical situation not significance and it would be horrifying to you youll get dreadful loss someday youll find to never hurt anybody and you say well thats the reason this character cant audit you see and you run this gpm out you know like mad and you get all the items out and down to the bottom and they get down to the bottom and they give their next session and fall on their heads with basic auditing wasnt the significance see what it was was just terror of exteriorizing or becoming exterior which is brought upon simply by energy shifts now frankly you can set somebody up so they will audit and do absolute flawless basic auditing for one session and that is you run some ow on them and their basic auditing will be flawless well isnt it interesting that its ow that makes their basic auditing flawless see so obviously then they must consider auditing an overt otherwise it wouldnt be ow that remedies it its peculiarly ow this has been subjected to several tests by the way and this is very wellknown piece of technology now first trace of this technology was melbourne 1960 test of or 59 test of auditing staff auditor on ow and then having the staff auditor go audit pc and see that the staff auditor at that particular moment would turn in flawless session i think thats quite an interesting datum ive carried this along along the way and ive looked now very closely at basic auditing basic auditing is terribly important and actually basic auditing does not improve under training where ow is so much in the road that person is practically swamped by it you can stand and harangue you can point shotgun at them you can do everything to them you could possibly think of you could show them all the points in the world and so forth but if they consider its terrible terrible overt or that it would seem awfully painful to them or terrible loss to them or something else any one of number of these combinations all of which comes under the heading that exteriorizing somebody is an overt act their basic auditing will be terrible terrible now there is method of overcoming it give them fifteenminute session on ow just general ow not directed at auditing at all just fifteenminute assist before they give session and theyll turn in flawless session just like that its the most marvelous thing you ever saw in your life its absolute magic and this is very unusual because you would say well then naturally the person would have to have fifteen minute session before any session they gave well im not pointing out to you that its rough to do this im pointing out to you that its possible and it works because it is possible to give somebody fifteenminute session before any session they give see it is possible now there are arc breaky pcs there are only bad basic auditing auditors now an arc breaky pc can be very arc broke and so forth but in actual fact good basic auditing will bring them out of it every time you do good arc break assessment find the bypassed charge of the thing continue on with good basic auditing and that pc will not arc break the pc that is dangerous is the pc that doesnt arc break but goes into the sad effect and any pc by the way if audited beyond the point of an arc break will go into sad effect but the difficulty here is that the pc who goes into just propitiation by reason of an arc break is actually much harder to handle or improve than pc who simply screams pc who yells like hell and raises hell is actually in the final analysis really easier to handle than the pc who simply goes into propitiation dont you see slightly higher tone level but pc should never be pushed into either and if pc is going into such states as reason as result of running ot processes it is not that the pc is being run too high necessarily has basis on it given that the pc is perfectly capable of being audited at you know i mean he knows the technology at that level that the auditor knows the technology at that level yet the pc is arc breaking the fault is always basic auditing and the fault is remediable by short sessions of ow before the session is given by the auditor and youll find the arc breaks just go like that thats auditing the auditor of the arc breaky pc is what im talking about now and this is very remarkable so how much for your arc breaky pc you see now youve got then great deal of technology here and ive tried to give it to you just in basket load and i think if you ever listen to this tape and take all the notes off of this tape and so forth you would have yourself ball because ive given it to you in running river its practically all here and the one thing that isnt here is the exact patter and the exact patter used is on the demonstration tape of last wednesday and there are some sections there of exact patter and there is full tape and there are several tapes giving the exact patter we are about to make color movie of the exact formation of the bank and all gpms and so forth concerning it and the technology is all being packaged up but i did want to give you this lecture today so that you would have it as you might say in nutshell to be on the safe side thank you very much
