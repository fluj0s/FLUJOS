have ratified the agreement the drcafta was expected to take effect on january 1 2006 but none of the c ountries were able to make the necessary legal and regulatory changes in time since then all

commitments all this legislation is expected to be voted on by the national assembly in 2007 and if passed will be supported by president arias the drcafta however still faces some opposition in costa rica and the fi nal outcome cannot be predicted with certainty the drcafta is regional agreement to reduce barriers to trade in which all parties are subject to the same set of obligations and commitments although each country negotiated separate market access schedule it is comprehensive and reciprocal trade agreement which distinguishes it from and replaces us commitments made under unilatera l preferential trade arra ngements the caribbean basin initiative cbi the caribbean basin trade partnership act cbtpa and the generalized system of preferences gsp the drcafta covers market access tariff reductions and nontariff barriers to trade including government procurement intellectual property inves tment labor and envi ronment rules among other issues the drcafta was controversial s upporters saw it as part of policy foundation that can enhance intraregional trade which in turn is seen as contributing to longterm social political and economic development in an area of strategic importance to the united states opponent s were especially concerned over some of the countries poor labor standards the perception of inadequa labor laws and lax enforcement arguing that drcafta s labor provisions should have included some minimum labor standard s with noncompliance subject to suspension of trade benefits similar to provisions found in the cbi and gsp the investorstate and pharmaceutical data protection sections were also repeatedly criticized as inadequate with added concerns from select import sensitive industry groups eg sugar and textiles the politics of drcafta led to the very narrow margin of approval uspanama free trade agreement fta on november 16 2003 president bush formally notified congress of his intention to negotiate bilateral fta with panama negotia tions commenced in april 2004 and after an extended hiatus the tenth and final round conc luded on december 19 2006 the negotiations were delayed by two factors the first was difficulty in coming to an agreement on sensitive agriculture issues particularly sanitary and phytosantiary sps measures the second was the panamanian governments decision to put off negotiations for much of 2006 while it focused the nations attention on another controversial issue the national referendum on the panama canal expansion project the canal expansion referendum passed on october 22 2006 and so attention turned again to completing the fta negotiations with the encroaching july 1 2007 scheduled expiration of the trade promotion aut hority tpa in mind negotiators on both sides
