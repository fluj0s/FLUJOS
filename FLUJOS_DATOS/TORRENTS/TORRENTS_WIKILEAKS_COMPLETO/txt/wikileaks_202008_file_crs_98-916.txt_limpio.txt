congressional research service the library of congress foreign aid an introductory overview of us programs and policy summary foreign assistance is fundamental component of the international affairs budget and is viewed by many as an essential instrument of us foreign policy since the end of the cold war many have proposed significant changes in the size composition and purpose of the program several of which have been adopted the focus of us foreign aid policy has also been transformed since the terrorist attacks of sept 11 2001 this report provides an overview of the us foreign aid program by addressing number of the more frequently asked questions regarding the subject there are five major categories of foreign assistance bilateral development aid economic assistance supporting us political and security goals humanitarian aid multilateral economic contributions and military aid due largely to the implementation two new foreign aid initiatives the millennium challenge corporation and the global aids initiative bilateral development assistance has become the largest category of us aid in 2005 the united states is providing some form of foreign assistance to about 150 countries israel and egypt continue as they have since the late 1970s as the largest recipients although iraq receiving over 20 billion for reconstruction activities since mid2003 was the biggest recipient in fy2004 the importance of latin america counternarcotics efforts is also evident with bolivia peru and more recently colombia among the top us aid recipients the impact of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and the subsequent use of foreign aid to support the war on terrorism is clearly seen in the estimated countryaid levels for fy2005 afghanistan pakistan turkey jordan and indonesia are key partners in the war on terrorism some countries that are the focus of the fiveyear 15 billion hivaids initiative are also among the leading recipients by nearly all measures the amount of foreign aid provided by the united states declined for several decades but has grown in the past few years after hitting an all time low in the mid1990s total foreign assistance but excluding iraq reconstruction for fy20032005 in real terms has been larger than any threeyear period since the early 1990s the 016 of us gross national product represented by foreign aid obligations for fy2005 however is among the smallest amounts in the last halfcentury the united states is the largest international economic aid donor in dollar terms but is the smallest contributor among the major donor governments when calculated as percent of gross national income the us agency for international development usaid manages the bulk of bilateral economic assistance the treasury department handles most multilateral aid and the department of defense dod and the state department administer military and other securityrelated programs the millennium challenge corporation is new foreign aid

programs and policy us foreign aid is fundamental component of the international affairs budget and is viewed by many as an essential instrument of us foreign policy1 each year it is the subject of extensive congressional debate and legislative initiatives since the end of the cold war many have proposed significant changes in the size composition and purpose of the program several of which have been adopted the focus of us foreign aid policy has also been transformed since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 this report generally using questionandanswer format addresses number of the more frequently asked queries regarding the us foreign aid program its objectives costs organization the role of congress and how it compares to those of other aid donors in particular the discussion attempts to not only present current snapshot of american foreign assistance but also to illustrate the extent to which this instrument of us foreign policy has changed from past practices especially since the end of the cold war and during the period following september 11 2001 data presented in the report are the most current reliable figures available usually covering the period through fy2004 or where possible estimates for fy2005 dollar amounts are drawn from variety of sources including the office of management and budget omb us agency for international development usaid and from annual foreign operations and other appropriations acts as new data become obtainable or additional issues and questions arise the report will be modified and revised 1 other tools of us foreign policy are the us defense establishment the diplomatic corps public diplomacy and trade policy american defense capabilities even if not employed stand as potential stick that can be wielded to obtain specific objectives the state department diplomatic corps are the eyes ears and often the negotiating voice of us foreign policymakers public diplomacy programs such as exchanges like the fulbright program and radio free europe project an image of the united states that may influence foreign views positively us trade policy through free trade agreements and export import bank credits for example are viewed as carrots by participating nations that affect the presence of us business in those countries foreign aid is probably the most flexible tool it can act as both carrot and stick and is means of influencing events solving specific problems and projecting us values crs2 foreign aid goals and programs what are the goals and objectives of us foreign assistance foreign assistance supports great many objectives especially since the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states foreign aid has taken on more strategic sense of importance cast frequently in terms of contributing to the global war on terrorism in september 2002 president bush released his administrations national security strategy that established global development for the first time as the third pillar of us national security along with defense and diplomacy also in 2002 executive branch foreign assistance budget justifications began to underscore the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority highlighting amounts of us assistance to about 30 frontline states in the terrorism war the substantial reconstruction programs in afghanistan and iraq which totaled more in fy2004 than the combined budgets of all other aid programs are also part of the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism at roughly the same time that fighting terrorism became the leading concern of american foreign aid the bush administration announced other significant initiatives that have defined and strengthened two additional key foreign assistance goals promoting economic growth and reducing poverty and combating the global hivaids pandemic the millennium challenge corporation mcc is new aid delivery concept established in early 2004 that is intended to concentrate significantly higher amounts of us resources in few low and lowmiddle income countries that have demonstrated strong commitment to political economic and social reforms if fully funded 5 billion will be available by fy2006 to support these best development performers in order to accelerate economic growth and lower the number of people living in absolute poverty addressing global health problems has further become core us aid objective in recent years congress created separate appropriation account for child survival and health activities in the mid1990s and increased funding for international hivaids and other infectious disease programs president bushs announcement at his 2003 state of the union message of fiveyear 15 billion effort to combat aids malaria and tuberculosis has added greater emphasis to this primary foreign assistance objective beyond these recently emerging foreign aid goals other prominent objectives that have continued since the early 1990s have included supporting peace in the middle east through assistance to israel egypt jordan and the palestinians fostering democratization and stability for countries in crisis such as bosnia haiti rwanda kosovo and liberia facilitating democratization and free market economies in central europe and the former soviet union suppressing international narcotics production and trafficking through assistance to colombia and other andean drugproducing countries and alleviating famine and mitigating refugee situations in places throughout the world including tsunami victims in asia and east africa crs3 arguably from the end of world war ii until the early 1990s the underlying rationale for providing foreign aid was the same as that for all us foreign policy the defeat of communism us aid programs were designed to promote economic development and policy reforms in large part to create stability and reduce the attraction to communist ideology and to block soviet diplomatic links and military advances the programs also supported other us policy goals such as reducing high rates of population growth promoting wider access to health care and expanding the availability of basic education in the developing world advancing us trade interests and protecting the environment if these secondary goals were also achieved us aid programs could be promoted as delivering more bang for the buck with the end of the cold war consensus emerged over what should be the new overarching rationale for us aid programs consequently many of these secondary objectives of foreign assistance are more vulnerable to challenge some may ultimately be discarded while others are being incorporated into new initiatives representing some of the emerging foreign aid priorities noted above the clinton administration emphasized the promotion of sustainable development as the new postcold war main strategy of those parts of the foreign aid program under the aegis of the us agency for international development usaid economic assistance supported six interrelated goals achievement of broadbased economic growth development of democratic systems stabilization of world population and protection of human health sustainable management of the environment building human capacity through education and training and meeting humanitarian needs early in the bush administration these goals were modified around three strategic pillarsof 1 economic growth agriculture and trade 2 global health and 3 democracy conflict prevention and humanitarian assistance more recently usaid white paper on american foreign aid identified five core operational goals of us foreign assistance promoting transformational development especially in the areas of governance institutional capacity and economic restructuring strengthening fragile states providing humanitarian assistance supporting us geostrategic interests particularly in countries such as iraq afghanistan pakistan jordan egypt and israel and mitigating global and international ills including hivaids2 generally speaking different types of foreign aid support different objectives focusing on any single element of the aid program would produce different sense of the priority of any particular us objective but there is also considerable overlap between categories of aid multilateral aid serves many of the same objectives as bilateral development assistance although through different channels international financial institutions have become the predominant players in central europe and the former soviet union serving us economic and security objectives in those regions 2 us agency for international development us foreign aid meeting the challenges of the twentyfirst century january 2004 crs4 both military assistance and economic security assistance serve us objectives in the middle east and south asia drug interdiction activities backed in some cases with military assistance and alternative development programs are integrated elements of american counternarcotics efforts in the andean region and elsewhere iraq reconstruction funding the us assistance program to iraq the largest aid initiative since the 19481951 marshall plan supports the longterm reconstruction requirements of the country following the march 2003 us invasion and overthrow of the regime of saddam hussein funds have been mostly directed at improving the security capabilities of the iraqi police and armed forces at making rapid improvements in infrastructure including electricity oil water and sewage and telecommunications and promoting democratization efforts to date two emergency supplemental appropriations have provided funds for these purposes pl 10811 for fy2003 and pl 108106 for fy2004 the bulk of iraq assistance nearly 21 billion of the 237 billion that is expected to support the program is held in an iraq relief and reconstruction fund controlled by the office of the president and delegated to other executive branch agencies because of the size of the iraq reconstruction effort including funding figures in fy2003 and fy2004 totals tends to overshadow and obscure key trends in changing foreign aid budget and policy priorities therefore unless otherwise noted in the text and figures funding amounts noted in this report exclude figures for iraq reconstruction in many instances however notation is made stating what particular amount would equal if iraq assistance was included what are the different types of foreign aid although there are many ways to group foreign aid by types of assistance this report organizes programs into five major categories illustrated in figure 1 below bilateral development assistance development assistance programs are designed chiefly to foster sustainable broadbased economic progress and social stability in developing countries for fy2005 congress appropriated 735 billion in such assistance an amount accounting for nearly 35 of total foreign aid appropriations most of these funds are managed by the us agency for international development usaid and are used for longterm projects in the areas of economic reform and private sector development democracy promotion environmental protection population and human health development activities gaining more prominence in recent years have been debt relief for the poorest nations mostly in africa and support for treatment of hivaids and other diseases see question on sectoral priorities below other bilateral development assistance goes to distinct institutions such as the peace corps the interamerican development foundation the african development foundation the trade and development agency and the new millennium challenge corporation the latter is expected to provide significant levels of assistance to countries that meet specific standards of good governance and free market economic reform crs5 figure 1 aid program composition fy2005 economic aid supporting us political and security objectives in fy2005 congress appropriated 462 billion 22 of total assistance for five major programs whose primary purpose is to meet special us economic political or security interests the bulk of these funds 25 billion are provided through the economic support fund esf an aid category designed to advance american strategic goals with economic assistance since the 1979 camp david accords and especially since the end of the cold war most esf has gone to support the middle east peace process since 911 much esf has targeted countries of importance in the war on terrorism esf funds can be used for development projects about 57 of the total in fy2004 or in other ways such as cash transfers to help countries stabilize their economies and service foreign debt about 43 in fy2004 with the demise of the soviet empire the united states established two new aid programs which met particular strategic political interests the seed support for east european democracy act of 1989 and the freedom support act freedom for russia and emerging eurasian democracies and open markets support act of 1992 programs were designed to help central europe and the new independent states of the former soviet union nis achieve democratic systems and free market economies in fy2005 seed countries are allocated 393 million while the nis receives 556 million in appropriated funds several other global issues that are considered threats to us security and wellbeing terrorism narcotics crime and weapons proliferation have received special attention from the foreign assistance program especially since the war on crs6 terror began each of these programs provide range of law enforcement activities training and equipment in fy2005 the antinarcotics and crime program excluding alternative development activities accounts for about 800 million in foreign aid appropriations over half of which is for an andean antinarcotics initiative antiterrorism programs add another 132 million and weapons proliferationrelated activities are funded at 267 million humanitarian assistance in fy2005 congress appropriated 268 billion 126 of assistance for programs of humanitarian aid3 unlike development assistance programs which are often viewed as longterm efforts that may have the effect of preventing future crises from developing three programs are devoted largely to the immediate alleviation of humanitarian emergencies the bulk of humanitarian assistance goes to the refugee program administered by the state department it supports with about 819 million in fy2005 number of refugee relief organizations including the high commission for refugees and the international committee of the red cross the offices of foreign disaster assistance ofda and transition initiatives oti in usaid provide relief rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance to victims of manmade and natural disasters activities totaling 600 million in fy2005 supplementing both programs is food assistance about 12 billion in fy2005 the food aid program generically referred to as pl 480 or the food for peace program provides us agricultural commodities to developing countries usaid administered title ii grant food aid is mostly provided for humanitarian relief but may also be used for developmentoriented purposes by private voluntary organizations pvos or through multilateral organizations such as the world food program4 title ii funds are also used to support the farmertofarmer program which sends hundreds of us volunteers to provide technical advice and training to farm and foodrelated groups throughout the world new program begun in 2002 the mcgoverndole international food for education and child nutrition program provides commodities technical assistance and finance for school feeding and child nutrition programs 87 million in fy20055 multilateral assistance relatively small share of us foreign assistance 7 in fy2005 is combined with contributions from other donor nations to finance multilateral development projects for fy2005 congress appropriated 154 3 because of the unanticipated nature of many disasters humanitarian aid budget allocations often increase throughout the year as demands arise figures listed here are those appropriated as of january 19 2005 the administration is discussing with congress possible disaster relief supplemental for tsunami victims 4 because of the demands placed on emergency food aid resources in early fy2005 the administration has said that all food assistance this year will be allocated for emergency operations according to some development ngos this would leave 600 million short fall for nonemergency food aid requirements 5 until fy1998 food provided commercially under longterm low interest loan terms title i of pl 480 was also included in the foreign assistance account because of its increasing export focus it is longer considered foreign aid title i is administered by the agriculture department crs7 billion for such activities implemented by international organizations like the united nations childrens fund unicef and the united nations development program undp and by multilateral development banks mdbs such as the world bank on average us contributions represent about 20 of total donor transfers to the mdbs military assistance the united states provides military assistance to us friends and allies to help them acquire us military equipment and training congress appropriated 5 billion for military assistance in fy2005 236 of total us foreign aid there are three main programs foreign military financing fmf 475 billion in fy2005 is grant program that enables governments to receive equipment from the us government or to access equipment directly through us commercial channels like esf most fmf grants support the security needs of israel and egypt the international military education and training program imet 89 million offers military training on grant basis to foreign military officers and personnel peacekeeping funds 178 million in fy2004 are used to support voluntary nonun operations and training for an african crisis response force as figure 2 indicates there have been some gradual shifts in program emphasis during the past 15 years military assistance as share of total aid obligations continued declining through fy2005 trend that began after military aid peaked in fy1984 at 42 in fy199697 it rebounded from 248 to about 30 share not because military assistance grew in absolute terms but because other categories of foreign aid fell significantly while military grants especially for israel and egypt remained constant the proportion of aid represented by military programs declined further in fy1999 to roughly 23 mainly due to the graduation of greece and turkey as military aid recipients military assistance rose again in fy2000 to 30 largely because of onetime middle east peace supplemental for israel and jordan after falling back to about onefourth of total us foreign aid military assistance jumped to over 28 in fy2003 as the united states provided additional security support to many of the frontline states in the war on terrorism and other countries that might faces new external threats due to the pending conflict in iraq for fy2004 and fy2005 its share fell to an average of 234 the lowest proportion of the period largely due to the rise in prominence of the development assistance category economic strategic and political aid has remained fairly stable over the past 15 years spiking in fy1993 with the growth of programs in the former soviet union funding for middle east peace supplemental the andean counternarcotics initiative and economic support for countries assisting us efforts in the war on terrorism pushed strategicoriented economic aid above 30 share between fy2000 and fy2003 the proportion of foreign aid appropriated for this grouping dropped to 26 and 22 in fy2004 and fy2005 respectively reflecting somewhat the impact of continuing tenyear plan to reduce economic aid to israel and egypt and except in the case of afghanistan less robust aid for frontline states in the war on terrorism perhaps the most striking trend in this period has been the growth in developmentrelated assistance including humanitarian food aid and contributions to multilateral institutions developmentrelated aid rose steadily from 38 share crs8 in fy1990 to nearly 49 by fy1994 the growth of more politicallydriven economic programs in central europe and the former soviet union plus sizable cuts to development aid in fy19961997 and increased emphasis on security assistance following the september 11 terrorist attacks drove the share of its allocation down to an average of 42 during the late 1990s through fy2003 with the approval of significant amounts of funding for two new presidential aid priorities the millennium challenge corporation and the global aids initiative development assistance grew to represent over half of total foreign aid in fy2004 and fy2005 the highest levels during the past 15 years figure 2 shifts in program emphasis 19902005 what are the funding priorities of bilateral economic assistance the largest component of us foreign aid finances bilateral economic assistance programs managed directly by usaid or in some cases jointly by usaid and the state department this cluster of assistance roughly matches the combined two categories of bilateral development aid and economic politicalsecurity programs illustrated in figure 1 above that are managed by usaid and the department of crs9 state6 congress appropriates funds for these activities in seven accounts included in annual foreign operations appropriation measures development assistance da child survival and health csh the global aids initiative gai the economic support fund esf assistance for eastern europe and the baltic states assistance for the independent states of the former soviet union and alternative development programs implemented through the andean counternarcotics initiative aci collectively these programs total 81 billion or roughly 38 of total fy2005 foreign aid appropriations as noted above usaid organizes bilateral economic assistance around three functional strategic pillars allocating resources to each of 14 more specific program sectors within the three pillars changes in the amount of funds distributed to each of these sectors is one means of measuring the relative priority placed by the executive branch on any of these specific bilateral aid activities because congress closely examines the executives sector distribution of bilateral economic resources and in number of cases modifies the presidents proposed budget plan sector funding trends also characterize congressional aid priorities and areas of special concern7 global health one of the most striking changes in the distribution of economic aid resources in recent years has been the sharp growth in funding for global health especially in the area of hivaids programs the budget for global health in fy2005 will likely be more than double the amount in fy2001 while hivaids resources will have increased by about sevenfold8 in fy2004 the bush administration launched fiveyear 15 billion global aids initiative with the goals of 7 million new infections treating 2 million hivinfected individuals and caring for 10 million infected people and aids orphans 6 this grouping excludes however counternarcotics antiterrorism the millennium challenge corporation other nonusaidnonstate department programs and agency administrative costs included in the totals for the two categories in figure 1 in sense the category of aid discussed in this section represents what might be called core bilateral economic assistance programs managed by the major us foreign aid agencies 7 it is important to note that the amount of resources allocated to any single development sector is not necessarily good measure of the priority assigned to that sector different types of development activities require varying amounts of funding to have impact and achieve the desired goals democracy and governance programs for example are generally lowcost interventions that include extensive training sessions for government officials the media and other elements of civil society economic growth programs on the other hand might include infrastructure development government budget support or commodity import financing activities that require significantly higher resources what may be better indicator of changing sector priorities is to compare funding allocations over time to the same sector trends that are illustrated in table 1 8 sector allocations for fy2005 appropriations remain under discussion with announcements due most likely in february 2005 the total us government commitment to international hivaids programs is somewhat larger when the budgets for domestic nonforeign aid agencies are included for example the amount for fy2005 is estimated to be 29 billion when the budgets of the departments of health and human services and labor are included rather than 23 billion drawn exclusively from state department and usaid funding crs10 funding for two other health sectors are rising but far more modestly than hivaids programs child survival and maternal health projects aim to reduce infant mortality by among other interventions decreasing the incidence of acute respiratory infections diarrheal disease measles and other illnesses that occur in the first 28 days of life and combating malnutrition and to improve the quality of child delivery facilities and raise nutritional levels of mothers funding for these activities has grown by 27 in the past four years congress has placed special attention on other infectious disease activities mainly those addressing malaria and tuberculosis increasing spending by 43 since fy2001 table 1 bilateral economic assistance sector allocation fy2001fy2004 millions of dollars aid pillars sectors

february 2005 this other category is labeled as programs of special concern by usaid consisting of economic aid to israel and turkey and obligations pursuant to the south pacific tuna treaty the composition crs11 of these special concerns may change from yeartoyear but do not necessarily fit into any of the categories under the pillar of economic growth agriculture and trade includes funds for usaid programs the state departments global aids initiative office and the us contribution to the global fund to fight hivaids tuberculosis and malaria does not include funds provided by the centers for disease control the national institutes for health and other non foreign aid agencies this rapid rise in global health generally driven largely by hivaids funding increases however overshadows to some extent reductions for other sectors spending on family planning and reproductive health programs has been relatively flat during the past five years with the fy2005 level of 441 million slightly below that of fy2001 vulnerable children programs meaning those that focus on children affected by war street children and children with disabilities have also received flat levels of funding fy2005 amounts 30 million however are somewhat above those in fy2001 economic growth within the pillar with the largest level of funding economic growth agriculture and trade the patterns have also been mixed basic education programs which encourage countries to strengthen their educational institutions and policies and reduce barriers for girls to attend school with 400 million appropriation in fy2005 have received more than threefold increase in funding since fy2001 resources for higher education on the other hand have declined slightly over the same period usaid has placed revitalized emphasis in recent years on agriculture activities an area which had been the largest program sector two decades ago funding rose by 50 in fy20022003 before falling back to level in fy2004 that is onethird higher than fy2001 agriculture programs focus on science and technology advances that reduce poverty and hunger tradepromotion opportunities for farmers and sound environmental management practices for sustainable agriculture programs for managing natural resources and protecting the global environment have been the largest area of funding cuts since fy2001 these activities focus on conserving biological diversity improving the management of land water and forests promoting environmentallysound urban development encouraging clean and efficient energy production and use and reducing the threat of global climate change while strengthening sustainable economic growth funding levels are nearly 20 below amounts in fy2001 resource trends for economic growth activities are more difficult to assess this sector funds wide range of development activities focusing on trade capacity building improving the investment climate and promoting job creation with an overall goal of reducing poverty budget support and commodity import programs are also included in this sector funding for economic growth programs has been affected by terrorismrelated supplementals especially large aid packages for afghan reconstruction this makes it difficult to identify any specific trend much of the increase for fy2003 came from additional assistance for several frontline states in the war on terrorism immediately prior to the launch of military operations in iraq the reduced amount for fy2004 although still large compared with fy20012002 crs12 includes significant supplemental spending in afghanistan for road construction and other economic rehabilitation activities9 democracy overall funding for the democracy conflict and humanitarian pillar has risen by 20 since fy2001 with most increases coming in the area of democracy governance and conflict prevention program goals include strengthening the performance and accountability of government institutions combating corruption and addressing the causes and consequences of conflict human rights is relatively small sector supporting range of activities such as strengthening womens legal clinics and combating trafficking in persons funding levels have grown somewhat in recent years humanitarian assistance under this pillar has declined in funding by over 10 since fy2001 most of these programs are centered in colombia and former soviet states concentrating on addressing the needs of internally displaced persons and conflictaffected communities10 which countries receive us foreign aid in fy2005 the united states is providing some form of foreign assistance to about 150 countries figures 3 and 4 illustrate the top 15 recipients of us foreign assistance estimated for fy1995 and fy2005 respectively11 assistance although provided to many nations is concentrated heavily in certain countries reflecting the priorities and interests of united states foreign policy at the time as shown in the figures below there are both similarities and sharp differences between country aid recipients for the two periods the most consistent thread connecting the top aid recipients over the past decade has been continuing us support for peace in the middle east with large programs maintained for israel and egypt the importance of latin america counternarcotics efforts is also evident in both periods with bolivia peru and more recently colombia among the top us 9 trends for the other category in this pillar are also obscured by certain circumstances these special concerns as labeled by usaid fund cash transfer programs to turkey and israel two strategic partners of the united states and economic assistance to south pacific island states under the terms of fisheries treaty funding for these activities have been significantly influenced by supplemental appropriations related to the war on terrorism especially in fy2003 when turkey received onetime 1 billion economic aid package absent special supplementals this category is scheduled to decrease in future years as the united states phases out economic aid to israel over tenyear period 10 much larger amounts of humanitarian assistance are provided through the separate accounts of emergency food aid under pl 480 title ii usaids office of foreign disaster assistance and office of transition initiatives and the state departments refugee bureau while these programs offer significant amounts of humanitarian aid 268 billion in fy2005 they generally respond to emergency unanticipated situations and are not integrated into longterm development strategies managed by usaid 11 amounts for fy2005 are estimates based on administration requested levels as adjusted by congress in enacted fy2005 appropriation bills the figures include estimated allocations for selected countries under the presidents global aids initiative but do not include emergency relief spending for countries affected by the december 2004 tsunami disaster fy2005 figures are likely to change when the administration makes further adjustments to allocation levels crs13 aid recipients assisting countries emerging from conflict usually under more temporary circumstances is another characterization of us foreign aid the leading recipients of haiti and bosnia in fy1995 have been replaced currently by sudan but there are also significant contrasts in the leading aid recipients of the past decade the impact of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and the subsequent use of foreign aid to support other nations threatened by terrorism or helping the us combat the global threat is clearly seen in the countryaid allocations for fy2005 afghanistan pakistan jordan and indonesia are key partners in the war on terrorism moreover with an 184 billion relief and reconstruction appropriation in fy2004 iraq is currently the largest recipient of us foreign aid if measured over multiyear period another new feature of american assistance the emphasis on hivaids programs is evident in fy2005 aid figures with ethiopia uganda kenya nigeria zambia and south africa among the top recipients largely due to their selection as focus countries for the administrations

marketoriented economies in fy1995 ukraine and russia were among the top 15 us aid recipients by fy2005 none of the former soviet states are among the leading recipients and some are scheduled for

regarding adjustments for fy2005 on regional basis figures 5 and 6 the middle east has for many years received the bulk of us foreign assistance with economic aid to the regions top two recipients israel and egypt declining since the late 1990s and overall increases in other areas however the share of bilateral us assistance consumed by the middle east fell from 58 in fy1994 to 38 decade later12 since september 11 south asia has emerged as region of growing concentrated levels of us assistance rising from 4 share ten years ago to 17 in fy2004 latin america where renewed effort to counter narcotics production and trafficking is bolstered with large aid programs is region where the proportion of total us assistance has grown modestly similarly the share represented by african nations has increased from 13 to 18 largely due to the global aids initiative that concentrates resources on 15 12 in africa focus countries where the disease has had the most serious consequences with the graduation of several east european aid recipients in recent years and the phasing down of programs in russia ukraine and other former soviet states the europeeurasia regional share has fallen somewhat the proportion of assistance provided to east asia grew in the past decade but the region remains the smallest area of concentration accounting for 3 of us foreign aid in fy2004 12

aid fy1994 aid fy2004 sources usaid and the department of state foreign aid spending how large is the us foreign assistance budget and what have been the historical funding trends there are several methods commonly used for measuring the size of federal spending categories such as foreign assistance amounts can be expressed in terms of budget authority funds appropriated by congress outlays money actually spent as percent of the total federal budget as percent of discretionary budget authority funds that congress directly controls excluding mandatory and entitlement programs or as percent of the gross domestic product gdp an indication of the national wealth allocated to foreign aid by nearly all of these measures some of which are illustrated in figures 7 and 8 foreign aid resources fell steadily over several decades since the historical high levels of the late 1940s and early 1950s this downward trend was sporadically interrupted with spikes in the early 1960s and 1970s 1979 and the mid1980s largely due to major foreign policy initiatives such as the alliance for progress for latin america in 1961and the signing of the camp david middle east peace accords in 1979 the lowest point in us foreign aid spending came in the mid1990s when resources fell to about 15 billion in constant dollar terms and represented roughly onefourth of the total program size during the marshall plan period crs16 figure 7 us foreign aid fy1946 fy2005 figure 8 foreign aid as of gdp following the september 11 terrorist attacks foreign aid became key instrument in fighting the global war on terrorism and contributing to the reconstruction of afghanistan and iraq excluding economic and security aid for iraq total foreign assistance for fy20032004 was larger than any twoyear period since the mid1980s including iraq reconstruction costs an amount that nearly crs17 equals all other foreign aid combined for fy2004 the fy20032004 twoyear average represented the largest amount of foreign aid in thirty years and was comparable to other foreign aid surges over the past half century other than the marshall plan period the total for fy2005 21 billion is slightly less than the 232 billion annual average of the past two years note see figure 9 at the end of this section for more detailed snapshot of foreign aid funding trends and related foreign policy events as percent of gross national product prior to the mid1960s in most years foreign aid represented over 1 and exceeded 2 during the marshall plan period following the end of the vietnam war foreign assistance as percent of gdp ranged between 05 and 025 for the next 20 years the program size dropped further to its lowest level ever in fy19971998 and fy20012002 016 foreign aid as percent of gdp rose somewhat the past three years averaging about 02 but remains near the all time low figure 8 congress appropriates most foreign aid money through the annual foreign operations appropriations bill each year it represents the most direct congressional action on foreign assistance spending decisions although small amounts of foreign aid are funded in other legislation13 similar to the other measures of how much the united states spends on foreign assistance programs foreign operations appropriations declined in the mid1990s to slightly above 14 billion the lowest level during the past decade in real terms table 2 appropriated amounts rose beginning in fy1998 and averaged about 171 billion through the next four years the combination of additional funding for the war on terrorism afghanistan reconstruction and new foreign aid initiatives focused on hivaids and the millennium challenge corporation pushed average annual amounts excluding iraq reconstruction above 20 billion in fy20032004 including iraq funding makes fy2004 the largest foreign operations appropriations in real terms in at least 30 years appropriations for fy2005 fell back somewhat to under 20 billion14 13 most notably food aid is not appropriated in the foreign operations measure while the exportimport bank an activity not considered foreign aid is funded in the foreign operations annual bill 14 due to changes over time in appropriation scoring for various foreign aid programs calculating precise levels of annual foreign operations appropriations that are equivalent to the methodology used currently is virtually impossible this is especially true since congress altered beginning in fy1992 the methodology for scoring credit programs the 30 year estimate noted here compares the fy2004 level of 387 billion including iraq reconstruction with total foreign aid amounts of about 35 billion real terms in the early 1970s since total foreign aid has not exceeded 31 billion in constant fy2004 dollars except for period in the early 1960s and the years prior to fy1953 reasonable estimate is that the current foreign operations appropriation including iraq funding is larger than equivalent

compare with other federal programs foreign aid spending is relatively small component of the us federal budget as part of the total amount spent in fy2004 on all discretionary programs those controlled by congress through appropriations entitlements and other mandatory activities foreign aid outlays represent an estimated 09 excluding expenditures for iraq reconstruction this figure is in line with typical foreign aid outlay amounts which have generally equaled slightly less than 1 of total us spending with iraq funding fy2004 foreign aid outlays represent 12 of the entire budget figure 10 compares foreign aid outlays for fy2004 with those of other major us government spending categories figure 10 us budget outlays fy2004 how much of foreign aid dollars are spent on us goods most us foreign aid is used for procurement of us goods and services although amounts of aid coming back to the united states differ by program exact figure is available due to difficulties in tracking procurement item by item but some general estimates are possible for individual programs though these may differ year to year crs21 in fy2004 roughly 87 or 37 billion of military aid financing was used for procurement of us military equipment and training the remaining 13 were funds allocated to israel for procurement within that country food assistance commodities are purchased wholly in the united states and most expenditures for shipping those commodities to recipient countries go entirely to us freight companies under current legislation threefourths of all food aid must be shipped by us carriers on this basis rough estimate suggests that more than 90 at least 1 billion in fy2004 of food aid expenditures were spent in the united states because us contributions to multilateral institutions are mixed with funds from other nations and the bulk of the program is financed with borrowed funds rather than direct government contributions the us share of procurement financed by mdbs may exceed the amount of the us contribution for example the 188 billion in world bank procurement from american sources for investment and adjustment loans in fy2003 the most recent year for which data are available was more than twice the 8445 million us contribution to the ibrd and ida the banks two largest facilities the united states accounted for about 18 of all world bank foreign procurement in fy2003 the largest of any country germany 78 france 54 italy 51 and china 49 followed15 most bilateral development assistance and the esf nis and seed components of economic political and security assistance support programs in developing countries and the new european democracies respectively although small proportion of funding for these programs results in transfers of us dollars the services of experts and project management personnel and much of the required equipment is procured from the united states according to usaid 81 of total usaid procurement between october 2002 and september 2003 under these programs came from us sources16 although some might argue that greater proportion of us foreign aid than is currently the case should be used for procurement of us goods and services 100 level of reflows would be difficult if not impossible to achieve projects carried out in the developing world by their nature require degree of spending within the recipient country for local hire personnel local building materials and other operational expenses many argue that the foreign aid program brings significant indirect financial benefits to the united states in addition to the direct benefits derived from reflows of aid dollars first it is argued that provision of military equipment through the military assistance program and food commodities through pl480 helps to develop future strictly commercial markets for those products second as countries develop 15 world bank annual report 2003 volume 2 pages 132140 16 the usaid figures however do not take into account that the usbased contractor or grantee may spend some project funds in other countries because of this actual procurement of us goods and services may be much lower than indicated crs22 economically they are in position to purchase more goods from abroad and the united states benefits as trade partner how does the united states rank as donor of foreign aid for decades the united states ranked first among the developed countries in net disbursements of economic aid or official development assistance oda as defined by the international donor community in 1989 for the first time japan supplanted the united states as the largest donor the united states regained its leading position in 1990 only to lose it again in 1993 and fluctuated between second and third position until 2001 in that year it again became the largest contributor and remained in the position in 2003 with contribution of 1625 billion japan followed at 888 billion significantly higher than france and germany at 725 billion and 678 billion respectively as group the 22 members of the oecds development assistance committee dac representing the worlds leading providers of economic aid transferred 6903 billion in 2003 up 48 in real terms from the year before figure 11 economic aid in dollars from major donors 2003 even when it led in dollar amounts of aid flows to developing countries the united states was often among the last when aid transfers by developed country donors were calculated by percent of gross national product in 2003 as has been the case since 1993 the united states ranked last at 015 of gross national income gni norway ranked first at 092 of gni while japan dispensed 02 france 041 and germany 028 the average for all dac members was 025 crs23 figure 12 economic aid as of gni from major donors 2003 delivery of foreign assistance how and in what form assistance reaches an aid recipient can vary widely depending on the type of aid program the objective of the assistance and the agency responsible for providing the aid what executive branch agencies administer foreign aid programs for over 40 years the bulk of the us bilateral economic aid program has been administered by the us agency for international development usaid created by an executive branch reorganization in 1961 usaid became an independent agency in 1999 although its administrator reports to and serves under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state usaid is responsible for most bilateral development assistance including economic growth global health and democracy programs title ii of pl 480 food assistance and in conjunction with the state department esf east european and former soviet aid programs in fy2005 usaid manages foreign aid budget of 95 billion maintaining direct control over 61 billion of this amount usaids staff in 2004 totaled 8132 of which only about 2035 were us citizens hired directly by the agency the largest components of usaid staff were foreign nationals 3570 working in overseas missions and representational offices who oversee the implementation of hundreds of projects undertaken by thousands of contractors crs24 consultants and nongovernmental organizations ngos another 2652 personal service contractors performed other work for the agency17 in addition to these programs jointly managed with usaid the state department administers several other aid programs directly individual offices at the department of state oversee activities dealing with narcotics control and international law enforcement terrorism weapons proliferation nonun peacekeeping operations refugee relief and voluntary support for range of international organizations such as unicef in order to manage the presidents recent global aids initiative the state department created special coordinators office that administers in fy2005 137 billion for international hivaids tuberculosis and malaria programs the funds are channeled through usaid the centers for disease control the national institutes for health and other implementing agencies fy2005 appropriations for these state department administered aid programs totals about 394 billion most military assistance is administered by the department of defense dod in conjunction with the office of politicomilitary affairs in the state department the defense security cooperation agency is the primary dod body responsible for foreign military financing and training programs the defense department manages about 47 billion of total foreign aid spending in fy2005 the treasury department also administers three foreign aid programs us contributions to and participation in the world bank and other multilateral development institutions are managed by the under secretary for international affairs presidentially appointed us executive directors at each of the banks represent the united states point of view treasury also deals with foreign debt reduction issues and programs including us participation in the hipc initiative the treasury department further manages technical assistance program offering temporary financial advisors to countries implementing major economic reforms and combating terrorist finance activity for fy2004 funding for activities falling under the treasury departments jurisdiction total about 13 billion new foreign aid agency was created in february 2004 to administer the presidents recently approved millennium challenge account initiative the millennium challenge corporation mcc is charged with managing this results oriented competitive foreign aid delivery mechanism that will invest resources in countries that adopt progrowth strategies for meeting political social and economic challenges the mcc is us government corporation headed by chief executive officer who reports to board of directors chaired by the secretary of state the corporation plans to maintain relatively small staff of less than 200 while drawing on support from usaid the mcc manages budget of 15 billion in fy2005 total that is projected to grow to 5 billion by fy2006 under the presidents plan other government agencies which play role in implementation of foreign aid programs are the peace corps the trade and development agency tda and the 17 usaid congressional presentation fiscal year 2005 p 87 crs25 overseas private investment corporation opic the peace corps an autonomous agency with an fy2005 budget of 317 million supports more than 7800 volunteers in 73 countries peace corps volunteers work in wide range of educational health and community development projects tda finances trade missions and feasibility studies for private sector projects likely to generate us exports its budget in fy2005 is 51 million opic provides political risk insurance to us companies investing in developing countries and the new democracies and finances projects through loans and guarantees it also supports investment missions and provides other preinvestment information services its insurance activities have been selfsustaining but credit reform rules require relatively small appropriation to back up us guarantees two independent agencies the interamerican foundation and the african development foundation also administer us foreign aid both organizations emphasize grassroots development by providing financial support to local private organizations in developing countries for fy2005 congress appropriated 18 million and 19 million to the interamerican foundation and the african development foundation respectively departing from the practice of using traditional us aid agencies such as usaid and the departments of state and treasury iraq reconstruction activities had been overseen until june 30 2004 by new entity the coalition provisional authority cpa the cpa which received over 21 billion to undertake reconstruction projects in iraq was headed by civilian administrator based in baghdad but who reported to the president through the secretary of defense the white house dissolved the cpa on june 30 2004 when governing authority was turned over to iraqi interim government the state department together with usaid which had been providing supportive work for the cpa took over responsibility for future iraq reconstruction efforts what are the different forms in which assistance is provided most us assistance is now provided as grant gift rather than loan see the next question for further discussion but the forms grant may take on its way to the recipient country are diverse cash transfers although it is the exception rather than the rule some countries receive aid in the form of cash grant to the government dollars provided in this way support governments balanceofpayments situation enabling it to purchase more us goods service its debt or devote more domestic revenues to developmental or other purposes cash transfers have been made as reward to countries that have supported the united states in its war on terrorism turkey and jordan in fy2004 to provide political and strategic support both egypt and israel annually since 1979 and in exchange for undertaking difficult political and economic reforms multiple african countries since the 1980s including ghana mozambique and zambia in fy2004 of fy2004 appropriations about 855 million was provided as cash transfers crs26 commodity import programs cip the commodity import program managed by usaid allows indigenous private sector business in foreign country to gain access to us dollars in order to import eligible american goods in exchange for the dollars local currency paid by these businesses goes to host government account and is then programmed for development purposes by both the host country and the united states the program used widely in the past is currently administered solely in egypt and valued at 200 million in fy2005 equipment and commodities assistance may be provided in the form of food commodities weapons systems or equipment such as generators or computers food aid may be provided directly to meet humanitarian needs or to encourage attendance at maternalchild health care program weapons supplied under the military assistance program may include training in their use equipment and commodities provided under development assistance are usually integrated with other forms of aid to meet objectives in particular social or economic sector for instance textbooks have been provided in both afghanistan and iraq as part of broader effort to reform the educational sector and train teachers computers may be offered in conjunction with training and expertise to fledgling microcredit institutions training transfer of knowhow is significant part of most assistance programs the international military and educational training program imet provides training to officers of the military forces of allied and friendly nations tens of thousands of citizens of aid recipient countries receive shortterm technical training or longer term degree training annually under usaids participant training program more than onethird of peace corps volunteers are english math and science teachers other programs provide law enforcement personnel with anti narcotics or antiterrorism training expertise many assistance programs provide expert advice to government and private sector organizations the treasury department usaid and us funded multilateral banks all place specialists in host government ministries to make recommendations on policy reforms in wide variety of sectors usaid has often placed experts in private sector business and civic organizations to help strengthen them in their formative years or while indigenous staff are being trained while most of these experts are us nationals in russia usaid has funded the development of locallystaffed political and economic think tanks to offer policy options to that government small grants usaid the interamerican foundation and the african development foundation often provide aid in the form of grants that may then be used by us or indigenous organizations to further their varied developmental purposes for instance grants are sometimes provided to microcredit organizations which in turn provide loans to microentrepreneurs through the usaidfunded eurasia foundation grants are provided to help strengthen the role of former soviet union nongovernmental organizations ngos in democratization and private enterprise development crs27 how much aid is provided as loans and how much as grants what are some types of loans have loans been repaid why is repayment of some loans forgiven under the foreign assistance act of 1961 the president may determine the terms and conditions under which most forms of assistance are provided in general the financial condition of country its ability to meet repayment obligations has been an important criterion for the decision to provide loan or grant some programs such as humanitarian and disaster relief programs were designed from their beginnings to be entirely grant activities loangrant composition during the past decade nearly all foreign aid military as well as economic has been provided in grant form between 1962 and 1988 loans represented 32 of total military and economic assistance this figure declined substantially beginning in the mid1980s until by fy2001 loans represented less than 1 of total aid appropriations the deemphasis in the amounts of foreign aid loan programs came largely in response to the debt problems of developing countries both congress and the executive branch supported the view that foreign aid should not add to the already existing debt burden carried by these countries types of loans although small proportion of total aid there are several significant usaidmanaged programs that provide direct loans or guarantee loans under the israeli loan guarantee program the united states has guaranteed repayment of loans made by commercial sources to support the costs of immigrants settling in israel from other countries other guarantee programs support lowincome housing and community development programs of developing countries and microenterprise and small business credit programs development credit authority in which risk is shared with private sector bank can be used to support any development sector loan repayment between 1946 and 2002 the united states loaned about 108 billion under the foreign aid program of that amount 83 billion had been repaid as of the end of fy2002 leaving nearly 25 billion outstanding18 most recipients of us loans remain current or only slightly in arrears on debt payments for nearly three decades us foreign aid law the socalled brooke amendment has prohibited new assistance to any country that falls more than one year past due in servicing its debt obligations to the united states afghanistan liberia somalia sudan syria zimbabwe and argentina are examples of countries that have recently been more than one year in arrears the president may waive application of this prohibition if he determines it is in the national interest debt forgiveness the united states has also forgiven debts owed by foreign governments and encouraged with mixed success other foreign aid donors and international financial institutions to do likewise in total the united states 18 us agency for international development us overseas loans and grants july 1 1945september 30 2002 crs28 forgave or reduced about 1866 billion owed by 46 countries between 1990 and 200319 in some cases the decision to forgive foreign aid debts has been based largely on economic grounds as another means to support development efforts by heavily indebted but reformminded countries the united states has been one of the strongest supporters of the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative this initiative which began in the late 1990s and continues in 2005 included for the first time participation of the world bank the imf and other international financial institutions in comprehensive debt workout framework for the worlds poorest and most debtstrapped nations but the largest and most hotly debated debt forgiveness actions have been implemented for much broader foreign policy reasons with more strategic purpose poland during its transition from communist system and centrallyplanned economy 1990 246 billion egypt for making peace with israel and helping maintain the arab coalition during the persian gulf war 1990 7 billion and jordan after signing peace accord with israel 1994 700 million are examples what are the roles of government and private sector in development and humanitarian aid delivery most development and humanitarian assistance activities are not directly implemented by us government personnel but by private sector entities generally speaking government foreign service and civil servants determine the direction and priorities of the aid program allocate funds while keeping within congressional requirements ensure that appropriate projects are in place to meet aid objectives select implementors and monitor the implementation of those projects for effectiveness and financial accountability at one time usaid professionals played larger role in implementing aid programs but the affect of budget cuts on personnel and the emergence of private sector alternatives over the past thirty years has led to shift in responsibilities20 private sector aid implementors usually employed as contractors or grantees may be individual personal service contractors consulting firms nonprofit non government organizations ngos universities or charitable private voluntary organizations pvos these carry out the vast array of aid projects in all sectors 19 us department of the treasury and the office of management and budget us government foreign credit exposure as of december 31 2003 part 1 p 51 20 in 1962 there were about 8600 us direct hire personnel currently there are about 2000 crs29 congress and foreign aid what congressional committees oversee foreign aid programs numerous congressional authorization committees and appropriations subcommittees maintain primary responsibility for us foreign assistance several committees have responsibility for authorizing legislation establishing programs and policy and for conducting oversight of foreign aid programs in the senate the committee on foreign relations and in the house the committee on international relations have primary jurisdiction over bilateral development assistance esf and other economic security assistance military assistance and international organizations food aid primarily the responsibility of the agriculture committees in both bodies is shared with the international relations committee in the house us contributions to multilateral development banks are within the jurisdiction of the senate foreign relations committee and the house financial services committee foreign aid appropriations are provided entirely through subcommittees of the appropriations panels in both the house and senate nearly all foreign aid funds fall under the jurisdiction of the foreign operations subcommittees with food assistance appropriated by the agriculture subcommittees what are the major foreign aid legislative vehicles the most significant permanent foreign aid authorization laws are the foreign assistance act of 1961 covering most bilateral economic and security assistance programs pl 87195 22 usc 2151 the arms export control act 1976 authorizing military sales and financing pl 90629 22 usc 2751 the agricultural trade development and assistance act of 1954 pl 480 covering food aid pl 83480 7 usc 1691 and the bretton woods agreement act 1945 authorizing us participation in multilateral development banks pl 79171 22 usc 28621 in the past congress usually scheduled every two years debates on omnibus foreign aid bills that amended these permanent authorization measures although foreign aid authorizing bills have passed the house or senate or both on numerous occasions congress has not enacted into law major foreign assistance authorization measure since 1985 instead foreign aid bills have frequently stalled at some point in the debate because of controversial issues tight legislative calendar or executivelegislative foreign policy disputes22 21 separate permanent authorizations exist for other specific foreign aid programs such as the peace corps the interamerican foundation and the african development foundation 22 few foreign aid programs that are authorized in other legislation have received more regular legislative review authorizing legislation for voluntary contributions to international organizations and refugee programs for example are usually contained in omnibus foreign relations authorization measures that also address state department and us information agency issues food aid and amendments to pl480 are usually continued crs30 in lieu of approving broad authorization bill congress has on occasion authorized major foreign assistance initiatives for specific regions countries or aid sectors in standalone legislation or within an appropriation bill among these are the seed act of 1989 pl 101179 22 usc 5401 the freedom support act of 1992 pl 102511 22 usc 5801 and the united states leadership against hivaids tuberculosis and malaria act of 2003 pl 10825 22 usc 7601 in the absence of regular enactment of foreign aid authorization bills appropriation measures considered annually within the foreign operations spending bill has assumed greater significance for congress in influencing us foreign aid policy not only does the bill set spending levels each year for nearly every foreign assistance account foreign operations appropriations also incorporate new policy initiatives that would otherwise be debated and enacted as part of authorizing legislation the only foreign aid program not funded within the foreign operations measure is food aid which congress includes in the agriculture appropriations bill 22
