energy policy legislation with comprehe nsive scope often spurred by the price of oil and us dependence upon imported oil the price of crude oil began to rise in 2003 and briefly approached 60barrel bbl in the spring of 2005 setting the scene for renewed debate over omni bus energy legislation in the 109th congress national and world demand fo r oil continues to grow however domestic oil production in the united states continues to decline as consequence the gap between us production and consumption s had to be covered by increased oil imports these imports roughly 6 million barrels per day mbd after the arab oil embargo now exceed 10 mbd to satisfy us oil consumption of nearly 21 mbd1 addressing dependence on im ported oil raises number of issues touching on both demand and consumption of fossil fuel s chief among these are the production of additional fossil fuels developmen t of alternative energy sources and conservation and energy efficiency energy infrastructure has also been growing issue including the oil refining and dist ribution sector and ectricity transmission reliability and regulation increased use of domestic coal and reassessment of many issues associated with nuclear ergy have drawn attention as well developing comprehensive approach to energy policy that balances economic security and environmental issues as well as competing regional priorities in the united states is an enormous challenge for policymakers keeping clear eye on distinguishing between short and longter m policies is also difficult but important in keeping expectations realistic for wh at comprehensive legislation can achieve in the 109th congress the house approved an omnibus energy bill hr 6 on april 21 2005 that would open the arctic na tional wildlife refuge anwr to oil and gas leasing substantially change oversight of electric utilities increase the use of alternative motor fuels provide 81 b illion in energy tax incentives extend the

certain conditions use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe as domestic gasoline add itive would be banned by the end of 2014 but the president could void the ban and state could authorize continued use producers of mtbe and renewable fuels would be granted protection safe harbor from product liability lawsuits provision th at proved highly contentious in the 108th congress royalty reductions would be provided for marginal oil and gas wells on federal lands and the outer continental shelf provisions are also included to increase access by energy projects to federa l lands several new statutor efficiency standards would be established for consumer and commerc ial products and app liances and other standards could be set by the department of energy doe funding authorizations in the

would create an electric reliability organization ero that would enforce mandatory reliability standards for the bulk power system all ero standards woul d be approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc under this title the ero could impose penalties on user owner or operator of the bul kpower system that violates any ferc approved reliability standard this title also addresses transmission infrastructure issues the secretary of energy would be able to certify congestion on the transmission lines and issue permits to tr ansmission owners permit holders would be able to

would amend the clean air act to eliminate the requirement that reformulated gasoline rfg contain 2 oxygen to reduce automotive emissions requirement which prompted the widespread use of mtbe and to lesser degree ethanol instead the bill would establish new requirement that an increasing amount of gasoline contain renewable fuels such as ethanol the bill would require that 31 billion gallons of renewable fuel be used in 2005 increasing to 50 billion gallons by 2012 as compared to 34 billion gallons used in 2004 however concerns have been raised that this requirement could significantly raise the pump price for gasoline in some areas because of concerns over drinking wa ter contamination by mtbe major competitor with ethanol the bill would ban the use of mtbe in motor vehicle fuel except in states that speci fically authorize its use not later than december 31 2014 the ban has two possible exceptions first epa may allow mtbe in motor fuel up to 05 percent by volume in cases that the administrator determines to be appropriate and s econd the president may make termination not later than june 30 2014 that the restrictions on the use of mtbe shall not take place the bill would also authorize 20 billion to assi st the conversion of merchant mtbe production facilities to the produc tion of other fuel additives further the bill would preserve the reductions in emissions of toxic substances achieved by the rfg program one of the most controversial provisions in hr 6 is the establishment of safe harbor from product lia bility lawsuits for producer s of mtbe and renewable fuels the safe harbor provision would protect anyone in the product chain from manufacturers down to retaile rs from liability for cleanup of mtbe and renewable fuels or for personal injury or propert damage based on the product being deemed defective that legal approach has been used in california to require refiners to shoulder liability for mtbe cleanup the safe harbor would be retroactive to september 5 2003 prior to that date five lawsuits had been filed after that date at least 150 suits were filed on behalf of 210 communities in 15 different states for additional informa tion see crs

repackaged into the housepassed hr 6 in the 109th congress the bill would reduce energy taxes about 81 billion over 10 years as compared with 235 billion in hr 6 in the 108th congress president bushs fy2006 budget request was for 67 billion in energy tax incentives counting the tax provisions enacted in the 108th congress the housepassed version of hr 6 excludes roughly 9 billion in tax breaks from the hr 6 conference report in the 108th congress hr 6s tax cuts are weighted primarily toward energy oil gas and electricity production and supply partic ularly energy infrastructure the most notable provisions would accelerate depreciation deductions for natural gas gathering lines and distribution lines and significan tly reduce the depreciation period for transmission assets and for oil and gas production for more background see crs issue brief ib10054 energy tax policy nuclear energy reauthorization of the priceanderson act nuclear liability system is one of the top nuclear items on

liability is the same as for commercial reactors except when the limit for commercial reactors drops because of decline in the number of covered reactors hr 6 would provide 20year extensi on of priceanderson to the end of 2025 the nuclear industry contends that th system has worked well and should be continued but opponents charge that pr iceandersons liability limits provide an unwarranted subsidy to nuclear power the bill would also require the nuclear regulatory commission nrc to assess nuclear power plant security and require additional security measures the bill would authorize 13

whether to open anwr to energy development has c ontinued for more than 40 years hr 6 as passed by the house would authorize oil and gas exploration development and production in anwr with 2000acre limit on production and support facilities development advocates argue that anwr oil would reduce us energy markets exposure to crises in the middle east boost north slope oil production lower oil prices extend the economic life of the trans alaska pipeline system and create many jobs in alaska and elsewhere in the united states they maintain that anwr oil could be develope d with minimal environmental rm and that the footprint of development could be limited to total of 2000 acres opponents of development in anwr argu that intrusion on this ecosystem cannot be justified on any terms that economically recoverable oil found if any would provide little energy security nd could be replaced by costeffective alternatives including conser vation and that job claims are overstated they also maintain that the footprint of oil devel opment despite provision in the measure to limit certain facilities to 2000 acr would still be scattere d in many parcels across the landscape and would have greater impact than is implied by any limit on total acreage they also argue that past pr oposals to limit any footprint have not been worded so as to apply clearly to the extensive native lands in the refuge which could be developed if the arctic refuge were opened on april 20 2005 the house rejected the markeyjohnson amendment h amdt 73 to strike the anwr title eas 200 nays 231 roll call

authorize 4 billion for fy20062010 for hydrogen and fuel cell rd the bill would also establish goal of producing commercial fuel cell vehicles and developing hydrogen infrastructure by 2020 critics of the administration suggest that the hydrogen program is intended to forestall any attempts to significantly raise vehicle corporate average fuel economy cafe standards and that it re lieves the automotive industry of assuming more initiative in pursuing technologi cal innovations on the other hand some contend that it is ppropriate for government to beco involved in the development of

reservoir fluctuations to protect the reservoirs shoreline habitat once an agency issu such conditions ferc must include them in its license while these conditions ofte n generate environmen tal or recreational benefits they may also re quire construction expenditure s and may increase costs by reducing operational flexibility this provision in hr 6 would allow li cense applicants to propose

gas from underground formations water based fluids are typically used as fracturin g fluids however diesel fuel often is used instead of water and various chemi cals are added to fracturing fluids6 while hydraulic fracturing has been used in the recovery of conventi onal oil and gas since the 1950s this practice has been used fo r cbm recovery mainly since the 1990s growing concern is that in many cb mproducing regions the target coalbeds occur within underground sources of drinki ng water and the fracturing process injects fluids directly into the drinking water sources epa has determined that the use of diesel fuel as fracturing fluid introduces benzene and other toxic substances directly into underground s ources of drinking water7 also because the process fractures rock fracturing can create new pathways for natural gas primarily methane to enter drinking water aquifers as the number of coalbed methane cbm wells and the use of hydraulic fracturing have increased rapidly in

section was also in hr 6 as passed by the house in the 108th congress but not in the conference report policy context the priceanderson acts limits on liability were crucial in establishing the commercial nuclear power industry in th 1950s supporters of the priceanderson system contend that it has worked well since that time in ensuring that nuclear accident victims would have secure source of compensation at little cost to the taxpayer however opponent s contend that priceanderson subsidizes the nuclear power industry by protecting it from some or most of the financial consequences of the worst conceivable accidents because new us reactors are currently planned missing the deadline for extension has had little immediat effect on the nuclear power industry as existing reactors continue to be covered for the first time in more than 20 years however several us utilities ve announced that they are considering whether to build new reactors it is unlikely that any such projects

initially included in hr 6 to avoid point of order based on the budget resolution umra limits would not apply to dues collected from canadian utilitie s and it is unclear whether the 50000000 limit on the ero budget applies to fees co llected from us and canadian utilities or just the us utilities contributions13 this limit would restrict the cost of this mandate to less than the threshold at which umra subjects congressional consideration of legislati on containing intergovernment mandates to point of order the 2005 budget for nerc and all of its regional ent ities however is 51950000 of which

through 2015 for all activities under the amendment to the federal power act that creates the ero this is in addition to the dues paid by the ero members it is unclear whether ferc would be the sole recipient of the 50 million annual authorization since section 1211b specifically states that the ero and its regional entities are not departments agencies or instrumentalities of the united states

congress advocates of giving ferc authority over the ero contend that central jurisdiction would provide more accountability ferc would be ultimately responsible for reliability issues if th penalties employed by the ero were not successful then ferc would have the authority to enforce penalties for entities that did not comply with reliability standards establishing this new relationship between ferc and the ero would have the poten tial to improve coordination between market functions and reliab ility functions similar legi slation has been introduced during the past several sessions of cong

electricity prices and the safety and reliability of generation and transmission facilities19 doe issued its report to congress on april 30 2003 but did not include changes from fercs white paper in its analysis doe in part quantitatively analyzed the wholesale and retail price impacts of smd using two economic models general electrics mu ltiarea production simu lation maps and does policy office electricity modeling system poems some of the assumptions that doe uses are the annual increase in electricity demand is assumed to be approximate ly 18 per year from 2005 to 2020 most regions are assumed to have reserve margins of 15 curre nt environmental laws and regulations are assumed to apply generator efficiency for fossil steam plants is assumed to be 2 to 4 higher in ne w rto regions with smd in the nonsmd case the models were not able to take into account freezes on retail rates in states that are transitioning to competitive markets and increase in transmission capacity is assumed under the smd case 5 increase in transmission capability by 2005 is assumed by doe due to improved operational efficiency at regional seams in addition doe assumes that adopting the smd would result in some savings that are difficult to quantify but would be re sult of several factors including the consolidation of control areas from the cu rrently existing 150 the possible avoidance of capital cost and software expenditures that would have been needed at existing control centers improved regi onal planning and consistenc of market design doe assigns 10 savings due to these efficien cy improvements doe believes that the assumptions used in the models are cons ervative and result in an underestimation of the net economic bene fits of the smd doe calculates the median cost of fercs smd rule to be about 760 million per year or about 21 cents per megawatt hour the models range for uncertainties is estimated to be about 100 million the cost varies significantly by region ranging from 47 cents per megawatthour fo r gridflorida to 12 cents per megawatt hour for pjm20 regions with existing rtos have zero additional costs under the smd case the effects of smd on retail rates are influenced to significant extent by whether the states in question have costofservice regulation or competitive retail choice doe found that for some importing regions with costbased rates the net result could be increased costs associated with wholesale purchases which would be passed through to retail customers for so exporting regions with costbased rates additional utility revenues from

purpa was established in part to augment electric utility generation with more efficiently produ ced electricity and to provide equitable rates to electric consumers in addition to purpa the fuel us

utilities were able to take advantage of abundant na tural gas as well as new generating technology such as combinedcycle plants that use hot gases from combustion turbines to generate additiona l power these technologies lowered the financial threshold for entrance into the electricity generation business as well as shortened the lead time for constructing new plants fua was repealed in 1987 but by this time qfs and small power pr oducers had gained portion of the total electricity supply this influx of qf power challenged the costbased rates that previously guided wholesale transactions before imple mentation of purp ferc approved wholesale interstate electricity transactions based on the sellers costs to generate and transmit the power since nonutility generato rs typically do not have enough market power to influence the rates they charge ferc began approving certain wholesale transactions whose rates were result of competitive bidding process these rates are called marketbased rates this first incremental change to traditional electricity regulation started movement toward marketori ented approach to electricity supply following the enactment of purpa two basic issues stimulated calls for further change whether to encourage nonutility generation and whet her to permit utilities to diversify into nonregulated activities the energy policy act of 1992 epact removed several re gulatory barriers for entry into electricity generation to increase competition of electricity supply24 however epact does not permit ferc to mandate that utilities transmit exempt wholesale generator ewg power to re tail consumers commonly called retail wheeling or retail competition an ac tivity that remains under the jurisdiction of state public utility commissions purpa began to shift more regulatory responsib ilities to the federal government and epact continued that shift away from the states by creating new options for utilities and regulators to meet electricity demand proponents of purpa repe primarily investorowned utilities ious located in the northeast and in california argue that their state regulatorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32936crs57 misguided implementation of purpa in the early 1980s has forced them to pay contractually high prices for power they do not need they argue that given the current environment for costconscious competition purpa is outdated the purpa reform group which promotes iou in terests strongly supports repeal of 210 of purpa contending that the current laws mandatory purchase obligation is anticompetitive and anticonsumer opponents of mandatory purchase requi rement repeal independent power producers industrial power customers most segments of the natural gas industry the renewable energy industry and environmen tal groups have many reasons to support purpa as it stands mainly their argument is that purpa introduced competition in the electric generating s ector and at the same time helped promote wider use of cleaner alternative fuels to generate electricity since the electric generating sector is not yet fully competitive they argue repeal of purpa would decrease competition and impede the development of the renewable energy industry additionally opponents of purpa repeal argue that it would result in less competition and greater utility monopoly cont rol over the electric industry some state regulators have expressed concern that 210 repeal would prevent them from deciding matters currently under their jurisdiction section 1253 interconnection each state regulatory authority and

from puhca if its business operations and those of its subsid iaries occur within one state or within contiguous states historically electricity service was fined as natural monopoly meaning that the industry has 1 an inhere nt tendency toward declining longterm costs 2 high threshold investment and 3 technolog ical conditions that limit the number of potential entrants in addition many regula tors have considered unified control of generation transmission and distribution as the most efficient means of providing service as result most people about 75 are currently served by vertically integrated investorowned utility as the electric utility industry has evol ved however there has been growing belief that the historic classification of electric utilities as natural monopolies has been overtaken by events and that market forces can and should replace some of the traditional economic regulatory structure for example the existence of utilities that do not own all of their generating fac ilities primarily coope ratives and publicly owned utilities has provided evidence that ve rtical integration has not been necessary for providing efficient elect ric service moreover recent changes in electric utility regulation and improved tec hnologies have allowed dditional generating capacity to be provided by independent firms rather than utilities the public utility holding company act and the federal power act fpa of 1935 title i and title ii of the public utility act establis hed regime of regulating electric utilities that gave specific and separate powers to the states and the federal government regulatory bargain was made between the government and utilities in exchange for an exclusive franchise service territory utilities must provide electricity to all users at reasonable regulated rates state regulatory commissions address intrastate utility activities including wholesale and retail ratemaking state authority currently tends to be as broad and as varied as the states are diverse at the least state public utility commission will have authority over retail rates and often over investment and debt at the other nd of the spectrum the state regulatory body will oversee many facets of utility operati on despite this diversity the essential mission of the state regulator in states that have not restructured is the establishment of retail electric prices this is accomplished through an adversarial hearing process the central issues in such cases are the total amount of money the utility will be permitted to collect and how the burden of the revenue requirement will be distributed among the vari ous customer classes residential commercial and industrial under the fpa federal economic regula tion addresses wholesale transactions and

the electric utility industry has been in the process of transformation during the past two decades there has been major change in direction concerning generation first improved technologies have reduced the cost of generating electricity as well as the size of generating facilities prior preference for largescale often nuclear or coalfired powerplan ts has been supplanted by preference for smallscale production f acilities that can be brought on line more quickly and cheaply with fewer regulatory impediment s second this has lowered the entry barrier to electricity generation and pe rmitted nonutility entities to build profitable facilities one argument for additional puhca change has been made by electric utilities that want to further diversify their assets currently under puhca holding company can acquire securities or utility assets only if the sec finds that such purchase will improve the economic efficien cy and service of an integrated public utility system it has been argued that reform to allow diversification would improve the risk profile of electric utilities in much the same way as in other businesses the risk of any one investment is diluted by the risk associated with all investments utilities have also argued that diversification would lead to better use of underutilized resources due to the seasonal nature of electric demand utility holding companies that have been exempt from sec regulation argue that puhca discourages diversification because the sec could repeal exempt status if exemption would be detrimental to the public interest for number of years there has been significant bipartisan congressional support for repealing much of puhca since the 1980s the securities and exchange commission has testified befo re congress that many provisions of puhca are longer relevant and other provisions are redundant with state and other federal regulations25 however as result of enrons dealings and collapse some in congress have taken somewhat different view toward significantly amending or repealing puhca26 even though enron had claimed exemption from puhca on february 6 2003 securitie s and exchange commission chief

categories marginal moderate serious vere or extreme areas with higher concentrations of the pollutant were give n more time to reach attain ment in return for the additional time they were required to implement more stringent controls on emissions failure to reach attainment by the specified deadline was to result in reclassification of an area to the next higher category and the imposition of more stringent controls areas such as dallasfort worth for example classified as serious were required to reach attainment by 1999 if they did not do so the law required that they be reclassified or bumped up to the severe category with new deadline of 2005 and more stringent controls for variety of reasons epa has often not reclassified areas when they failed to reach attainment by the statutory dead lines as of april 2005 the agencys website listed 18 marginal areas 6 moderate areas and 9 serious areas most of the 33 should have been categorized as severe unde r the statutory requirements in several cases the agency granted additional time to reach attainment on the grounds that significant cause of the areas conti nued nonattainment was pollution generated outside the area and transported into it by prevailing winds epa has been sued over its failure to bump up five of these areas th agency lost the first three cases decided washington dc st louis nd beaumontport arthur

required to promulgate regulations for the generation and trading of credits between entities in this manner refiners and blenders who could not meet the requirement would be ab to purchase credits from those refiners or blenders who exceeded the requirement policy context the clean air act amendments of 1990 established the reformulated gasoline rfg program am ong its provisions is requirement that rfg contain oxygen the two main ways to meet the requirement are the use of mtbe and ethanol however mtbe met hyl tertiary butyl ether has been found to contaminate groundwater and there is interest in banning the substance see sec 1504 because some states have acted to limit the use of mtbe and because of the potential federal ban there is interest in eliminating the oxygen standard as well see sec 1506 the ethanol industry has be nefitted significantly from the oxygen requirement and some are concerned about the future of ethanol in the absence of the requirement further proponents of the fuel see et hanol use as way to limit petroleum consumption and dependence on foreign oil thus the interest in establishing renewable fuels standard however opponents of ethanol have raised

up leaking petroleum usts where owners fail to do so and to oversee lust cleanup activities while much progress has been made in the program several issues remain ma jor issue concerns the discovery of mtbe at thousands of lust sites across the country this gasoline additive used to reduce air pollution from auto emissions is very water soluble and leaks involving mtbe are more costly to remediate than c onventional gasoline leaks mtbe tends to separate from the gasoline and spread further and these leaks are more likely to reach water supplies another issue is that st ate resources

manageme nt act of 1972 czma as amended 16 usc 1465 section 319 had been added as an amendmen t in 1996 it established time line for appeals to the secretary of commerce on consistency determinations when state and federal agency are unable to reach agreement the consistency provisions set forth in section 307 of the czma require fe deral activities in or affecting the coastal zone to be consistent with the policies of federally approved and stateadministered coastal zone management plan federal activities include activities and development projects performed by federal agency or by contractor on behalf of federal agency and federal financial assistance proposal to modify the appeals time line with deadlines very similar to this legislation was included in pr oposed rule on federal consistency published in the june 11 2003 federal register final rule has not been issued the consistency provision creates an unus ual relationship where states can halt most federal actions that are incompatible with state interests when enacted the consistency requirement wa s viewed as main reason why states would pursue development and implementation of coastal plans since the other incentive to participate federal financial grants always has been modest this view appears to have some validity as 34 of the 35 ligible states and territories are now administering federally approved coastal ma nagement programs current law the consistency provisions in section 307 of the czma guides state consideration of whethe r proposed federal activity will be compatible with federally approved and state administered coastal zone management plan since the first state plan was approved in the mid 1970s there has been considerable friction between states and federal agencies over the reach of the consistency provisions states have sought broader pplication to have strong role in decisions about the largest possible array of proposed federal ac tivities while the fede ral government has sought narrower interpretations especially relating to offshore energy development determining an exact boundary separating ac tions on which the state is to have primary role in halting proposal from acti ons on which the state does not have such powers has been subject of federal appeal s and litigation including decisions by the us supreme court notably secretary of the interior v california 464 us 312 1984 in which the court dete rmined that the sale of oil and gas leases on the outer continental shelf was not an act affecting the coastal zone when state and federal agency cannot reach an agreement on consistency determination the law and regu lations lay out an elaborate process for resolving that disagreement most disagreements are resolved through this process but if agreement can be reached the final step is an appeal to the secretary of commerce to make decision appeals to the secr etary have not been common according tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32936crs86 citations of appeals posted on the website of the office of ocean and coastal resource management in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa viewed may 12 2005 38 consistency terminations were appealed to the secretary between 1984 and 1999 and 19 of th em involved proposed activities by oil companies the appeals process like all ot her aspects of consistency is currently covered under final rule issued by noaa in the december 8 2000 federal register section 319 in current law has less detail than the proposed amendment it states that the secretary will either issu final decision on the appeal or publish notice in the federal register stating why decision cannot be reached within 90 days after the record has closed if the secretary publishes notice that decision has not been made that decision must be issued within 45 days of the date of publication of that notice bill language hr 6 would replace the current section 319 of the czma with new set of provisions that would stipulate three sequential deadlines and thereby limit the overall length of this appeal s process to total of 270 days from the date when an appeal is filed the fi rst deadline would be for the secretary of commerce to publish an initial notice of an appeal in the federal register within 30 days of the appeals filing the second deadline would be that the administrative record would be open for more than 120 days during that time period the secretary could receive filings related to the appeal the final deadline would give the secretary up to 120 days to issue d ecision after the administrative record had been closed the second and third deadlines would also apply to all pending appeals not resolved prior to the date of enactment also any appeals in which the record is open on the date of enactment would have to be closed w ithin 120 days of that date policy context consistency appeals have been contentious and in some instances the appeals process has dra gged on for long time periods the 1996 amendments in section 319 were meant to ddress those delays by establishing some time limits this has proved unsatisfactory to some who seek additional statutory language that would remove decisions bout deadlines from the unpredictable rule making process by defining the length of component steps in law and therefore the overall process after an appeal to the secretary has been filed section 2014 reimbursement for costs of nepa analysis documentation and studies the mineral leasing act would be amended to provide reimbursement for costs of neparelated studies under

coastal destruction has received more attention in louisiana where many square miles of wetlands are being lost to the ocean each year federal program to address the impact s of coastal energy

state regulatory authority comments the language of subsection appears to answer the compatibility question and to eliminate the usual compatibility determination processes the extent of leasing
