current charitable choice law june 22 2001 vee burke specialist in social legislation domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress comparison of proposed charitable choice act of 2001 with current charitable choice law summary this report provides sidebyside comparison table 1 of the charitable choice provisions of hr 7 with those of the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 and of later laws that extended charitable choice rules to the community services block grant act pl 105285 and to substance abuse treatment and prevention services under the public health service act pl 106310 and pl 1065541 common provisions the charitable choice act title ii of hr 7 and the four existing charitable choice laws provide that participating religious organizations shall retain their independence from government including control over the definition development practice and expression of their religious beliefs all prohibit government from requiring religious organizations to alter their form of internal governance or to remove religious art icons scripture or other symbols all provide that the exemption of religious organizations under section 702 of the civil rights act regarding hiring and firing is not affected by their participation in or receipt of funds from programs covered by charitable choice with one exception community services block grant act all five measures provide that if beneficiary or applicant objects to the religious character of the organization providing help an alternate and accessible provider must be made available with the same exception all measures forbid religious organization from discriminating against beneficiary or applicant on the basis of religion or religious belief all charitable choice measures place limits on use of federal funds for sectarian activities in general they prohibit use of funds provided directly to faithbased organization by contract or grant for sectarian worship instruction or proselytization with one exception the 1996 welfare law all measures require religious organizations to segregate government funds into separate account and stipulate that the government may audit only the government funds differing provisions two of the laws the 1996 welfare law and one of the substance abuse measures prohibit discrimination by faithbased provider against beneficiary for refusal to actively participate in religious practice prohibiting denial of services for this refusal hr 7 does not contain this prohibition hr 7 alone explicitly allows faithbased provider notwithstanding any other law to require its employees to adhere to its religious practices hr 7 and the two substance abuse measures require the government to notify beneficiaries and applicants of their right to an alternate provider the 1996 welfare reform law is the only measure to state that its charitable choice provisions do not preempt any provision of state law that prohibits or restricts spending of state funds in or by religious organizations 1 the major substantive difference between pl 106310 and pl 106554 is that the latter requires states to accept training provided to personnel by religious organizations if the training is substantially equivalent to crediteligible training provided by nonreligious organizations and if the organization has record of successful drug treatment for the preceding 3 years contents background 1 major arguments of supporters 2 major arguments of opponents 2 title 3 short title 3 purposes 4 programs covered 5 inclusion

law 3 comparison of proposed charitable choice act of 2001 with current charitable choice law background charitable choice is set of provisions in law intended to allow religious organizations to provide federally funded services from specifically named programs on the same basis as any other nongovernmental provider without impairing the religious character of the organizations or the religious freedom of recipients charitable choice does not contain special funding for faithbased organizations and it applies only to programs designated by congress the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 put the first charitable choice language into federal law applying it to the block grant program of temporary assistance for needy families tanf2 in 1998 congress extended charitable choice rules to grants under the community services block grant act pl 105285 and in 2000 to grants for prevention and treatment of substance abuse under the public health service act pl 106310 and pl 106554 the 2000 republican platform proposed to apply charitable choice to all federal social service programs in their 2000 platform democrats said they believed that faithbased programs should augment not replace government programs hr 7 proposes to apply charitable choice rules somewhat modified from those of the tanf law to 11 program areas and activities tanfs charitable choice rules apply to wide range of activities some of which may overlap with activities listed in hr 7 sponsored by representative watts and introduced on march 29 as the community solutions act of 2001 hr 7 was referred to the committees on ways and means and the judiciary the measure embodies two major components of president bushs faithbased initiative namely tax incentives to expand private giving title i and expansion of charitable choice title iii proposes permanent program of individual development accounts financed with tax credits the hr 7 charitable choice proposal has resulted in several congressional hearings the first ever conducted on charitable choice and has aroused much controversy as of june 25 the charitable choice act had not been introduced in the senate 2 the 1996 law also applied charitable choice rules to food stamps medicaid and supplemental security income to the extent that they use contracts or vouchers crs2 major arguments of supporters to fund only secular programs discriminates against religious programs it is just as inappropriate for government to favor non religion as to promote one religion over another faithbased programs can attract large amounts of volunteer time staff have sense of mission that inspires those they serve these organizations often help in ways that government cannot providing love as well as services guidance and friendship as well as meal or training charitable choice has been carefully written to protect constitutional values charitable choice rules protect the religious character of faithbased providers they specify that religious organizations shall retain control over the definition development practice and expression of their religious beliefs charitable choice rules protect the religious liberty of beneficiaries they require that if recipient objects to the religious character of the provider the government must provide an alternate and accessible provider major arguments of opponents charitable choice may lead to unconstitutional use of government funds to promote specific religious practice or belief since money is interchangeable government funds given for secular purpose could indirectly help to fund the organizations religious purposes undermining governmental neutrality toward religion charitable choice rules would require government to decide what is legitimate religion and what is not what is preaching and what is not direct government grants to religious groups could make churches dependent on government eroding their mission and tending to secularize them charitable choice promotes governmentfunded discrimination by allowing religious organizations that receive federal dollars for their services to hire and fire on the basis of religious beliefs crs3 table 1 comparison
