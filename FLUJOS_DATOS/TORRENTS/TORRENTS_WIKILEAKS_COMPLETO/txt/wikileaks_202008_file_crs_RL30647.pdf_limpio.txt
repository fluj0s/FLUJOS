forest system roadless area initiatives summary roadless areas in the national forest system have received special attention for decades many want to protect their rela tively pristine condition to provide habitat for wildlife to protect water quality and aesthetics and to retain their value for dispersed recreation others want to us the areas in more developed ways to explore for and develop minerals including oil and gas to harvest timber and to provide opportunities for motorized recr eation or develope d recreation sites two different roadless area policies have been offered in the last decade on january 12 2001 the clinton administrati ons roadless area policy established nationwide approach to managing roadless areas in the national forest system to protect their pristine conditions the clinton rule as it will be called in this report generally prohibited road construction and reconstruction and timber harvesting in 585 million acres of inventoried roadless areas with significant exceptions the bush administration initially postpone d the effective date of the clinton rule then issued its own rule it as ked for public comment on key questions for managing roadless areas and issued new interim directives for managing roadless areas these efforts led to new rule on may 13 2005 the bush rule allowed governors to petition the secretary for special rule for managing the inventoried roadless areas in their state and to make recommendations for that management several states filed petitions those of virginia north carolina south carolina idaho and colorado were pproved the petitions of ne w mexico and california were halted when the bush rule was enjoined in 2001 the federal district cour t for idaho preliminarily enjoined implementation of the clinton rule but was reversed by the ninth circuit in 2003 the federal district court for wyoming permanently enjoined implementation of the clinton rule this holding was dismissed as moot by the tenth circuit in light of the 2005 bush rule on september 20 2006 th federal district court for northern california enjoined the bush rule until the administration had complied with the requirements of the nationa l environmental policy act nepa and the endangered species act the court directed the administration to apply the clinton rule until it had complied with these requirements instead the administration allowed governors to petition for roadless area ma nagement rule for their state under the administrative procedure act apa the idaho and colorado petitions were filed under this pr ocedure the idaho petition was approved in october 2008 in the meantime new lawsuit in wyoming led to second injunction of the clinton rule by that district court and the ninth circu it is considering an appeal of the california order requiring the clinton rule to be followed in may 2007 hr 2516 and s 1478 were introduced in the 110th congress to codify the clinton rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30647contents

alexandernational forest system roadless area initiatives1 introduction roadless areas within the national forest system nfs2 have long received special management beginning in 1924 th forest service fs began protecting areas administratively as wilderness wild and primitive areas in 1964 congress enacted the wilderness act creating the national wilderness preservation system with the administrativelydesignated fs wilderness areas and directing the fs and the national park service and fish and wildlife service to review the wilderness suitability of certain of their lands since 1964 the agencies have made numerous wilderness recommendations and congre ss acted on many of them but some recommendations remain pending president clinton proposed new rule to prohibit most road construction and timber harvesting in the remaining fs roadless areas3 implementation was delayed then enjoin ed the injunction was overturned and another injunction was set in place president bush then offered new roadless area rule but on september 20 2006 court set as ide the bush rule and reinstated the clinton rule until the bush administration had met certain legal requirements the fs announced it was accepting petitions from states to choose their roadless areas under the administrative procedure act apa in august 2008 different federal court ruled that the clinton rule was contrary to law legislation was introduced in both the house and the senate to establish nationwide policy of protecting the inventoried roadless areas4 the management of the roadless areas of the nfs

some of the legal and policy issues in connection with the roadless areas including the litigation related to the issue regulatory and statutory background roadless areas statutory background the principal forest management statutes relevant to analysis of the roadless rules are the organic act of 18975 the multipleuse sustainedyield act of 19606 and the national forest management act of 19767 the 1897 act directs that the national forests be manage d to improve and protect the forests or for the purpose of securing favorable conditi ons of water flows and to furnish continuous supply of timber for the use and necessities of citizens of the united states8 the 1897 act also authorizes the secretary to issue regulations to regulate their the forest reservations occupancy and use and to preserve the forests thereon from destruction9 over the years many uses of the national forests in addition to timber and watershed management have been allowed administratively what constitutes the most desirable combination of uses for forest has been hotly debated for decades statutorily the multipleuse sustaine dyield act of 1960 musya expressly recognizes and authorizes the multiple use of the forests defined as the management of all the various renewable surface resources of the national forests in the combination that will best meet the needs of the american people and recognizes that some land will be used for less than all of the resources without impairment of the productivity of the nd with consideration being given to the relative values of the various resources and not

maintenance of areas of wilderness are consistent with the purposes and provisions of this act12 this latter language which preceded enactment of the 1964 wilderness act13 recognized that the fs managed some forest areas as administrative wilderness or natural areas musya also requires sustained yield defined as the achievement and maintenance in perpetuity of highlevel annual or regular periodic output of the various renewable resources of the nati onal forests without impairment of the productivity of the land14 how much is highlevel annual or regular periodic output of forest resources that does not impair the productivity of the land has also been the subject of much debate the national forest management ac t of 1976 nfma set out additional provisions on the management of the nati onal forests that include direction for developing land and resource management plans nfma directs that regulations be adopted to guide forest planning and acco mplish specific goals set by the congress under the principles of musya this included insuring consideration of the economic and environmental aspects of various systems of renewable resource management including the re lated systems of silvicultu re and protection of forest resources to provide for outdoor recreati on including wilderness range timber watershed wildlife and fish and pr ovide for diversity of plant and

to take effect on march 13 200117 the clinton rule established nationwide policy for roadless areas nationallevel guidance was deemed advisable because of the importance of the roadless areas for various forest management purposes and to the american public and because addressing projects in roadless areas on forestby forest basis as part of the planning proce ss had resulted in contr oversy conflict and great deal of time and money spent on appeals and litigation18 the clinton rule 1 prohibited with significant exceptions new roads in inventoried roadless areas 2 prohibited most timber harvests in the roadless areas but allowed cutting under specified circ umstances and 3 applied the same prohibitions to the tongass national forest in alaska but allowed certain road and harvest activities already in the pipeline to go forward the fs identified approximately 585 million acres of inventoried roadless areas 30 of all nfs lands roads are so currently prohibited in an additional 349 million acres of congressionallydesigna ted wilderness areas 18 of nfs lands and is restricted in another 92 million acres 5 of nfs lands of other congressionallydesignated areas such as national recreation areas and wild and scenic river corridors the roughly 47 of nfs lands with roads contain about 300000 miles of fs and other roads19 the explanatory material in the final rulemaking states that roadless areas provide significant opportunities for disp ersed recreation are sources of public drinking water and are large undisturbe d landscapes that provide open space and natural settings serve as barrier against invasive plant and animal species are important habitat support th diversity of native speci and provide opportunities for monitoring and research20 in contrast the explanatory material continues installing roads can increase erosion and sediment yields disrupt normal water flow processes increase the likelihood of landslides and slope failure fragment ecosystems introduce nonnative species compromise habitat and increase air pollution21 the final roadless area rule was more restrictive in several respects than either the proposed rule or the prefe rred alternative in the final eis with some exceptionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30647crs5 22 see 66 fed reg 3272 36 cfr 29412b 23 36 cfr 29413b1 24 36 cfr 29413b24 25 36 cfr 29414a and c 26 36 cfr 29414dthe rule imposed immediate nationallevel servicewide limitations on new road construction and reconstruction in the inve ntoried roadless areas throughout the nfs and imposed nationwide prohibitions on timber harvesting in those areas with some exceptions the regulations were to apply immediately to the tongass national forest in alaska although certain activities already in the planning stages in that forest were allowed to go forward the final rule prohibited new road c onstruction and rec onstruction but with exceptions for health safety resource protec tion or other issues related to the public interest22 any classified roads those in the nfs transportation system or otherwise authorized by the fs could be main tained in inventoried roadless areas harvesting timber was expected to be infrequent under the rule cutting selling or removing timber from inventoried roadless areas was prohibited unless one of specified circumstances existed cutting smalldiameter trees was permissible to maintain or improve one or more of the roadless area characteristics and to improve threatened endangered or sensitive species habitat or to maintain or restore the characteristics of ecosystem composition and structure such as to reduce the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire effects23 other cutting could be permitted if incidental to implementing management activity that was not otherwise prohibited if needed and appropr iate for personal or administrative use in accordance with 36 c fr 223 the regulations on sale and disposal of timber or if roadless characteristics had been substantially altered in portion of an inventoried road less area due to the construction of classified road and subsequent timber harvest before january 12 2001 in this last instance timber could only be cut in the substantially altered portion of the roadless area24 the clinton rule expressly did not affect any permit contract or other legal instrument authorizing the occupancy and us of nfs lands issued before january 12 2001 nor did it alter any project or activ ity decision made prior to that date25 the rule did not apply to roads or harvest in the tongass national forest if notice of availability of draft eis for the activities had been published in the federal register before january 12 200126 otherwise the new rule applied to the tongass national forest immediately interim

reviewed the rules exceptions allowing roads in roadless areas but failed to mention that federal aid highways could be permitted in some instances p 1236 on the other hand the court noted that the roadless rule was more restrictive for constructing roads in roadless areas to combat problem conditions than was the wilderness act which allows necessary measures to control fire insects and diseases while the roadless rule only allows roads in the case of an immine nt flood fire or other catastr ophic event that wit hout intervention would cause the loss of life or property 33 wyoming v

district court for wyoming permanently enjoined the clinton rule for violating nepa and on the grounds that it was thinly veiled attempt to designate wilderness areas in violation of the clear and unambiguous process established by the wild erness act for such designation31 the court equated the roadless areas with facto wilderness characterizing the severity of the restrictions under the roadless rule as restri ctive or more so than for congressionally designated wilderness areas32 the court concluded that the rule was in violation of the clear and unambiguous process established by the wilderness act for such designation33 only congress can designate areas for inclusion in the national wilderness preservation system34 however musya enacted before the 1964 wilderness act expressly provides for the administr ative management of national forest lands for many purposes and states that the establishment and maintenance of wilderness areas is consistent with the purposes of the act nfma enacted after the wilderness act directs that forest plans assure coordination of outdoor recreation range timber wate rshed wildlife and fish and wilderness emphasis added therefore it appears that as general matter the roadless rule might be defended as appropriate management of nontimber resources for multiple use purposes such as outdoor recreation wate r quality protection mineral development and game and other wildlife bitat however it also is possible that severe and extensive restrictions might be seen as violating sustained yield under musya the explanatory material with the final clinton rule distinguished roadless areas from wilderness areas stating that other management is still allowed such as development of mineral claims livestock grazing offhighway vehicle use and fire management efforts35httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30647crs8 36 see compromise release language in w ilderness acts from the mid1980s through the mid1990s 37 wyoming v us department of agriculture 277 f supp 2d at 1239the wyoming court did not address the pr ovisions for using nfs as wilderness under either the musya or nfma congress repeatedly declined to direct that roadless areas not designated as part of the national wilderness preservation system be managed for only nonwilderness uses but instead permitted their management for uses that might retain their wilderness attributes36 the validity of the courts assertion that the roadless rule was i n violation of the clear and unamb iguous process established by the wilderness ac t for such wilderness designation37 would seem to depend on whether one agrees that management of the roadless areas under the roadless rule would be as restric tive as that under the wilderness act and on how one views the references to w ilderness in musya and nfma and the actions of congress in continuing to llow management of the roadless areas to maintain wilderness characteristics on national forest lands management of roadless areas after clinton rule was enjoined after the clinton rule was enjoined the bush administration issued series of interim directives governing roadless area protection and management until it could formulate its own rule however th interim directives were only to be in effect for 18 months and were apparently to cease to apply once forest plan was revised or amended december 2001 directive id 192020011 appeared to replace many of the previous interim directives both clinton and bush however the federal register notice did not clearly indicate which provisions were being replaced or the precise extent of the revisions the published explanatory material stated that affected material was shown and unaffected materi was not yet some of the earlier provisions were neither show n nor discussed and therefor might still have been in effect the final text of new fs ma nual 1925 did not show these undiscussed earlier provisions as though they were s uperseded thus it was not clear which of the previous materials were still in effect for example some of former fs manual 771216 that contained specific details on permi ssible road construction was expressly revised in the december directives and the explanatory materials stated that the revised provisions were m oved to the fs manual as new 1925 yet other provisions that were in 771216 were neither discussed as superseded or modified nor set out in the new 1925 t hus it was not clear exactly which of the previous interim directives were still in effect after the december directive took effect decisionmaking on timber harvesting in roadless areas t h december directives reserved authority to the chief of the forest service to approve certain proposed timber harvests in inventor ied roadless areas until forest plan was completed that has consid ered the protection and ma nagement of inventoried roadless areas pursuant to fsm 1920 they also provided that the chief couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30647crs9 38 66 fed reg 65801 39 69 fed reg 42648designate an associate chief deputy chief or associate deputy chief on case bycase basis to be th responsible official regional foresters were to screen timber harvest projects in inventoried roadless areas for possible referral to the chief the chief was to make decisions regarding harvests except for those that were 1 generally of smalldiameter material the removal of which is needed for habitat or ecosystem reasons i ncluding reducing fire risk 2 incidental to management activity not prohibited under the plan 3 needed for personal or administrative use or 4 in portion of an inventoried roadless area where harvests had previously taken place and the roadless characteristics had been substantially altered these exceptions conform to the timber harvest exceptions in the clinton rule decisions as to these harvests were to be made by forest officers normally delegated such authority the december 2001 directive stated that the chiefs authority with respect to timber harvests did not apply if record of decision for forest plan revision was issued as of july 27 2001 as was true of the tongass national forest and would otherwise terminate when plan re vision or amendment that has considered the protection and manageme nt of inventoried roadle ss areas was completed decisionmaking on road construction in roadless areas the chiefs authority for road construction in inventoried roadless areas was to remain in effect until forestscale roads analysis was completed and incorporated into each forest plan38 regional foresters were to make many decisions on road construction projects under the new fs manual 192504b there was express provision for terminating the authority of regional foresters but the general policy 192503 keyed termination of the special provisions to completion of roads analysis and its incorporation into the relevant forest plan the december directives apparently eliminated the clintonera requirement that there be compelling need for road sciencebased analysis and full eis in all cases the applicability of the interim dir ective to certain contiguous areas also was eliminated the responsible official could still do an eis and could protect contiguous areas and could find compelling need for road however roadless areas could have reduced protections because the directives did not contain the higher thresholds for approval of activities and more formalized documentation requirements previously required on july 16 2004 simultaneously with proposed new roadless rule the fs reinstated the december 2001 directiv id 192020011 which had expired on june 14 200339 it was renumbered as id 192020041 and modified in two respects this reestablished the provisi ons allowing the chief to make decisions affecting inventoried roadle ss areas involving 1 road construction until forest scale roads analysis is completed and incorporated into forest plan or determination is made that plan amendment is not needed and 2 timber harvests until forest plan had considered protecting and managing roadless

expanded the 2001 directive and arguably made it easier to approve projects in those areas fs manual 192504b also was changed to allow regional foresters to make decisions on road construction and rec onstruction in inventoried road less areas for lands associated with any mineral lease license permit or approval for mineral leasing operations dispute over tongass national forest roadless areas the clinton rule was scheduled to apply immediately to the tongass national forest in alaska the state of alaska sued arguing that the clinton rule abrogated the alaska national interest lands conservation act of 1980 anilca that provided there would be additional admin istrative withdrawals of federal lands in the state to settle the lawsuit the bush administration agreed it would publish proposed roadless rule that would exclude the tongass national forest40 proposed rule to exclude the tongass from the clinton rule and an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to exclude both the tongass and chugach national forests also in alaska were published on july 15 200341 final rule temporarily exempting the tongass from the roadless rule was published on december 30 200342 specifically the roadless area restrictions on road construction and reconstruction and on the cutting sale or removal of timber in inventoried roadless areas did not apply to the tongass nati onal forest the explanatory material indicated that the exempti on was in place only until an alaskawide roadless rule was finalized the exemption meant that areas protected under the revised tongass land management plan would remain protected but an additional 300000 acres of inventoried roadless areas would be av ailable for logging under that plan the forest service has taken the pos ition that the bush rule published on may 13 2005 discussed in 2005 roadless ar ea policy the bush rule below eliminated the need for further tongassspecific rulemaking and that timber harvest decisions that include an inventoried roadless area compone nt will be made in accordance with the forest plan unless changed through statespecific rulemaking43httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30647crs11 44 70 fed reg 25654 45 70

rule with the state but the secretary would make the final decision on any rule th rationale for imposing deadline on the roadless area petition process and the consequences of states failure to meet the deadline are unclear the rule does not indi cate what happens when there is change in governors this ambiguity became focused when the new governor of colorado disagreed with the designations made in the petition submitted by his predecessor shortly after losing reelection the rule does not include any standard s on the scope or balance required for public participation in devel oping states recommendations or for how state is to gather its information about an areas re sources and values there also are requirements or standards fo r the secretarys review nd approval of petition and statement as to the relative weight to be given to states recommendations versus the preferences of nonstate residents w ho may express an opinion on the desired management of th national lands the background materials accompanying the proposed and final rule refer to the importance of collaborating with partners including state governments stating strong state and federal c ooperation regarding

consider an adequate ra nge of alternatives since all but the action alternative included total prohib ition on road construction and the eis did not analyze whether other alternatives might have accomplished protection of the environmental integrity of the roadless ar eas in addition the court concluded that fs did not analyze possible mitigation of negative impacts of the alternatives it did study66 the bush administration asked the co urt to postpone putting the preliminary injunction into effect until the fs had reviewed the clinton rule arguing that an injunction was not necessary

agriculture 570 f supp 2d at 1352court is disturbed and frankly shocked at the fact that magistrate judge essentially reinstituted policy that was not properly before that court and especially in light of the fact that an article iii judge had already ruled that the reins tituted policy was promulgated in violation of law87 because the california court had not considered the merits of the clinton rule when acting but instead had followed general rule that invalidating one rule reinstates its precedent the wyoming court said its actions were consistent with th at order the clinton rule was enjoined again following the wyoming decision it app eared that the forest service was required to follow the clinton rule by the california order and forbidden to follow it by the wyoming order the forest service filed motions in both courts to suspend the injunctions so it would not be held in contempt however some noted that the forest service had not been following the c linton rule as directed by the california court but was allowing states to file statebystate petitions as was the goal of the bush rule under the apa instead conclusion roadless areas of the national forest system have received special attention for decades some argue that the areas should be available for appr opriate development mineral exploration and development timber harvesting motorized recreation developed recreation sites and more other believe th at the areas should remain roadless to preserve the special values that their condition provides clean water undeveloped wildlife habita ts dispersed recreation aesthetics and more both the bush administration and the clinton administration issued rules addressing inventoried roadle ss areas one rule in which the states would take the lead in management decisions and the other applying uniform national policy both were rejected by courts leading to conflicting decisions in two different district courts one reinstating the clinton rule and the other enjoining it the forest service has responded by allo wing governors to file petitions for statespecific rule for managing roadless areas under the apa in effect modifying the existing clinton rule by using the bush rules policy of the seven governors who filed petitions under the bush rule five sought to pres erve all of their roadless areas as would have happened under the c linton rule the two remaining states idaho and colorado f iled petitions under the apa after the bush rule was enjoined idahos roadless areas became final in oc tober 2008 and proposed rule was issued for colorados areas in july 2008 legislation introduced in the 110th congress hr 2516 and s 1478 has favored the nationwide approach as have most governors who have taken action on this issue
