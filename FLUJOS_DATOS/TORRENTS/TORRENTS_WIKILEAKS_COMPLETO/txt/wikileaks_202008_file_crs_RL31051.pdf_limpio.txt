constitution prohibits in the absence of congressional authorization over this period there has been continuing interest in knowing how much waste is being shipped across state lines for disposal and what states might be affected by proposed legislation this report provides data useful in addressing these questions total interstate waste shipments continue to rise due to the closure of older local landfills and the increasing consolidation of the waste management industry between our year 2000 survey reporting largely 1998 data and the current survey generally reporting 1999 or 2000 data reported interstate waste imports have increased by 36 million tons about 13 in the last seven years reported imports have more than doubled from 145 million tons in 1993 to 320 million tons in 2000 pennsylvania remains by far the largest waste importer the state received 98 million tons of municipal solid waste and 25 million tons of other nonhazardous waste from out of state in 2000 more than 30 of the national total for interstate shipments virginia the second largest importer received 60 less than the amount received by pennsylvania michigan the third largest importer imported 28 million tons of msw in fiscal year 2000 an increase of nearly one million tons over the previous year twenty states had increased imports in the current report the largest increases occurring in pennsylvania and michigan in all eight states reported imports that exceeded one million tons while waste imports increased overall several states including indiana kansas mississippi and new hampshire reported sharp declines in waste imports new york remains the largest exporter of waste with new jersey and illinois in second and third place exports from new york already nearly 7 million tons per year are expected to grow further because of the closure of new york citys fresh kills landfill in march 2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31051contents introduction 1 total shipments 6 states reporting increased

would have granted states authority to restrict new shipments of municipal solid waste from out of state if requested by an affected local government in the 103rd congress both the house and senate passed interstate waste legislation hr 4779 and s 2345 but lack of agreement on common language prevented enactment for discussion of the issues addressed in these bills see crs report rs20106

this report provides updated information on interstate shipment of municipal solid waste concerned about increased waste imports some states have attempted to regulate this commerce federal courts however have declared these state restrictions unconstitutional if states are to have such authority congressional action is required since the late 1980s congress has considered but not enacted numerous bills that would grant such authority1 over this period there has been continuing interest in knowing how much waste is being shipped across state lines for disposal and what states might be affected by proposed legislation this report provides data useful in addressing these questions it updates information provided in earlier crs reports2 not all states require reporting of waste imports and very few track exports so the available data are incomplete and in some cases represent estimates rather than actual measurements from what is known waste shipments appear to be concentrated among 2530 states in the northeast midwest southeast and pacific coast regions figures 1 and 2 this report presents information gathered through telephone contacts with solid waste officials in those states the district of columbia and the canadian province of ontario data obtained from these contacts are summarized in tables 1 2 and 3 and figures 1 and 2 table 4 presents

crs based on telephone interviews data subject to numerous qualifications see notes from tables 1 2 and 4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31051crs6 3 because many of the larger importers now differentiate msw from other nonhazardous waste imports we compared total msw imports to epas national estimate of msw generation 220 million tons in the latest available year 1998 statereported waste generation summarized in biocycle magazines annual survey is substantially higher 340 million tons in 1998 but is likely to include other nonhazardous waste provided it was disposed at msw facilities for statereported data see jim glenn the state of garbage in america biocycle april 1999 p 60total shipments the data show that total interstate waste shipments continue to rise imports in the current survey totaled 320 million tons 146 of the 220 million tons of municipal solid waste generated in the united states3 between our year 2000 report reporting largely 1998 data and the current survey reporting generally 1999 and 2000 data imports increased 36 million tons about 13 since 1993 reported imports have more than doubled from 145 million tons in 1993 to 320 million tons in the current survey states reporting increased imports twenty states had increased imports of municipal waste in 2000 with the largest increases occurring in pennsylvania and michigan the increases in these two states 26 million tons and 11 million tons respectively total more than the entire increase nationally the other 48 states added together show net decrease in waste imports of 01 million tons the preponderance of these two states in the 2000 waste statistics demonstrates another element of the emerging picture of interstate waste shipment 52 of total municipal waste imports are disposed in just three states pennsylvania virginia and michigan pennsylvania continues to be the largest waste importer by far disposal facilities in the state received 98 million tons of msw and 25 million tons of other nonhazardous waste from out of state in 2000 the amounts represented half of all solid waste disposed in the state and more than 30 of the national total for interstate shipments after pennsylvania virginia is the largest waste importer with 39 million tons of msw imports and 580226 tons of other nonhazardous waste despite predictions that virginia would receive increased imports as new yorks fresh kills landfill phased out operations waste imports to virginia remained roughly the same in the 19982000 period michigan the third largest waste importer in 2000 saw outofsta waste disposed in the state grow by more than 11 million tons that year substantial amounts of waste come to michigan from illinois indiana and other neighboring states but the biggest source accounting for about 45 of michigans outofstate waste is ontario canada ontarios waste shipments are growing as the toronto area awards new contracts for waste disposal and closes its two remaining landfillshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31051crs7 4 transfer stations receive waste from collection trucks compact it bale it and load it on larger trucks for disposal elsewhere 5 see for example garbage plan ignites border tensions new york times december 3 1998 p a27at the beginning of 1999 toronto area municipalities were managing about 28 million tons of waste annually of which about 350000 tons were shipped to michigan by early 2003 however there will be virtually local disposal capacity barring unforeseen developments most of this waste is expected to be sent to michigan for disposal in other highlights eight states reported imports exceeding one million tons per year in the latest year figure unchanged from our previous survey which reported 1998 data another 20 states had imports exceeding 100000 tons for the third year in row new jersey is on the list of major importers with 836154 tons of msw imports in 1999 2000 data were not yet available imports in 1999 grew by more than 250000 tons the state is still major exporter of waste as well according to new jersey msw exports totaled 25 million tons in 1999 and receiving states estimate the total exports at more than 4 million tons in 2000 but the absence of flow control local government requirements that waste within their jurisdiction be disposed at local facilities which were overturned by the courts in the mid1990s has led wasteto energy facilities in new jersey to search for waste to replace local waste now being disposed elsewhere as result large amounts of waste are entering new jersey from new york new york the nations largest waste exporter also saw rapid growth in waste imports in 2000 the state imported 539000 tons of waste in 2000 an increase from 130000 in our previous survey other states reporting major increases in imports were ohio georgia south carolina and kentucky ohio had nearly 700000 ton increase in msw imports between 1998 and 2000 georgia experienced nearly 300000 ton increase over the two years and south carolina and kentucky both had increases in the 150000 200000 ton range although there are comprehensive data imports to transfer stations4 have become political issue in some locations transfer stations are generally located in urban areas and are subject to less stringent regulation than disposal facilities heavy truck traffic and odors have aroused concerns in some neighboring communities both connecticut and the district of columbia report significant amounts of outofstate waste imported to transfer stations then exported to other states for disposal new york citys plan to export waste to transfer stations in new jersey has raised substantial controversy5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31051crs8 6 illinois like most states does not report waste exports this export estimate was derived from data provided by neighboring statesstates reporting decreased imports while waste imports increased overall 14 states reported declines in waste imports in half the cases the declines were small but seven others had declines exceeding 100000 tons most notable were indiana where waste imports have declined 742000 tons since 1998 kansas which declined 366000 tons and now imports about half the amount received in the mid1990s mississippi which declined about 350000 tons due to markedly lower shipments from new orleans and new hampshire where new permit conditions imposed on the states largest landfill contributed to statewide reduction in imports of almost 280000 tons major exporters eight states new york new jersey illinois missouri maryland california north carolina and ohio exported more than one million tons of waste to facilities in other states in the latest reporting period and six other states and the district of columbia exported more than half million tons the canadian province of ontario also exported substantial amount of municipal waste 1277000 tons to michigan new york new jersey and illinois remained the largest exporters together these three states accounted for 46 of waste exports nationally new york reported exports of 561 million tons of msw in 2000 an increase of 29 in the 19982000 period but receiving states report even higher totals 682 million tons in 2000 despite the already large amount waste exports from new york are expected to grow further because of the march 2001 closure of new york citys fresh kills landfill the citys last disposal facility new jerseys estimated exports 416 million tons have also grown dramatically in new jerseys case the cause of increased exports is the overturning of the states flow control law which until 1997 directed much of the states waste to highcost local facilities for disposal the state law was overturned and the state exhausted its appeals in october 1997 exports have since grown by nearly 2 million tons illinois exports at 315 million tons declined in 2000 after several years of rapid growth in 1998 they were about four times the amount reported for 19956 most of the exports originate in cook county chicago and its suburbs which has relative shortage of disposal capacity illinois as whole reported more than doubling of landfill capacity between 1995 and 2000 but chicago is located near the border of both indiana and wisconsin so increases in capacity elsewhere in illinois may not affect disposal decisions in the metropolitan area maryland california and north carolina all showed large increases in waste exports around 500000 tons each in the reporting period each of the three appears to be an example of the growing regionalization of waste disposal markets as waste flowed from them to large disposal facilities in adjoining stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31051crs9 7 the seventh annual waste age 100 waste age september 2000 pp 4251 8 the state of garbage in america biocycle april 1994 p 51 and april 2000 p 36net imports and exports table 3 combines import and export data to rank the states by net amounts imported or exported the table shows that 15 states pennsylvania virginia wisconsin ohio indiana georgia tennesse and iowa among the net importers and west virginia connecticut washington illinois missouri new jersey and new york among net exporters both export and import in excess of 100000 tons of municipal solid waste there are several factors at work here in the larger states there are sometimes differences in available disposal capacity in different regions within the state areas without capacity may be closer to landfills or may at least find cheaper disposal options in other states good example is illinois the chicago area which is close to two other states exports significant amounts of waste out of state despite illinois being large waste importer with available capacity in other parts of the state as noted earlier the movement of waste also represents the growing regionalization and consolidation of the waste industry in 1999 the three largest firms waste management allied waste and republic services accounted for 81 of total revenues of the industrys 100 largest firms7 these large firms offer integrated waste services from collection to transfer station to disposal site in many locations often they ship waste to their own disposal facility across border rather than dispose of it at an instate facility owned by rival as small landfills continue to close the number of us landfills declined 51 between 1993 and 19998 this trend toward regionalization and consolidation is likely to continue the amount of waste being shipped across state lines for disposal may rise in this process additional information the remainder of this report consists of table summarizing waste import and export data by state all 50 states and the district of
