passage would create the opportunity for returning salmon steelhead nd lamprey to occupy more than 300 miles of historic habita t above the dams8 because some environmental and tribal stakeholders see the klamath river dams as responsible for the decline of fish popula tions in the basin they are pushing for dam removal to improve habitat and river flows for fish even though pacificorp has not considered dam removal in its license renewal application9 in this case dam removal might cost half as much as installing fish ladders10 however in addition to pacificorp some members of the academic community are concerned that expected benefits of dam removal may be too high c iting poor water quality in th upper basin due to phosphorus in agricultural runoff as well as other pollution11 the issues at play in the region regarding natural resources such as endangered salmon tribal fishing rights and the human benefits from the power provided by the dams and the potentially high cost of modifying the dams should the preliminary prescriptions be adopted in the final license are typical of the complex problems to be weighed when considering river management choices in recent years dam removal has come to be seen as one of several choices that may be made about the river systems and is sometimes considered reasonable and costeffective choice12 in some cases dam removal may provide great er benefits than the maintenance modification andpacificorp removal of the condit dam although pacificorp did not address removal of its klamath river dams in its license renewal application for the projects the company has considered removing dams in the past it decided to remove its 147 megawatt condit dam on the white salmon river wa because the cost of environmental upgrades to the structure outweighed the value of the power in 1991 the company applied to renew the dams operating license ferc issued its final eis for the project in 1996 recommending fish passage facilities with an estima ted 30 to 50 million cost rather than continue with relicensing and invest that amount of money in the proj ect pacificorp agreed to consider dam removal since the estimated cost was 17 million the company r eached settlement agreement with interested parties and plans to begin removing the dam in 2008 sources httpwwwpacificorpcomarticlearticle 54814html

fishways and issues of material fact relating to adequate resour ce protection on federal lands these hearings are conducted by the agency responsible for the resour ce in question additionally whenever the relevant management agencies indicate specific conditions that are required for resource protection eg fishways license appli cants or other partie s involved may propose alternatives that cost less to implement or improve hy dropower production as long as proposed alternatives provide adequate resource protection such as providing benefits equal to fishways the management agencies must accept them the hearing process granted by 241 places significant demands on all parties the schedule requires the case to be concluded and decision issu ed within 90 days of case referral this

relicensing application the company issued press release on august 2 2006 stating that it16 continues to believe that the settlement pr ocess is the right place to work on and resolve the complex issues in the klam ath basin thus paci ficorp does not oppose settlement opportunities including dam removal as long as any settlement safeguards the economic interests of our customers nd respects the companys ownership rights in the project facilities tribal representatives reportedly have indi cated that this position is shift in the message that they have received from pacificorp17 the tribes are hopeful that the states of california and oregon will develop packag of grants and tax incentives to assist with dam removal costs because one of the issues of concern to pacificorp is its customers power rates if parties in the region agree on settlement terms that include removal of four dams on the klamath river it would be the larg est dam removal project undertaken in the united states to date18 in january 2007 the partments of commerce and the interior issued final mandatory term s and conditions for the relicensing of the pacificorp dams that require fish passage19 environmental interests see this action as paving the way for dam removal because the co sts of fish passage structures at the dams are estimated to be more expensive than removing them20 ferc licensing cannot be finalized until st ate water quality certif icates are issued for the project by both oregon and californi additionally consultation with both nmfs and fws is still pending on
