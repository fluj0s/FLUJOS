bills address appeals issues change medicares authority to contract for claims processing services establish that these contracts be competitively bid at least every 5 years in hr 1 and every 6 years in s 1 and place new requirements on the medicare claims processing contractors including an increased emphasis on provider education other program changes demonstration projects and mandated studies are also included in these titles many of the provisions of these titles codify initiatives underway within the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the agency that administers medicare under its current authority the proposed legislation authorizes increased funding but action by the appropriations committees would be required for cms to receive additional money the congressional budget office cbo has estimated that the added administrative costs to the government in implementing the regulatory reform provisions of s 1 and hr 1 would be 4 billion over the fy2004 through fy2013 period however these are administrative costs that are subject to the appropriations process rather than mandatory benefit spending as result the appropriations committees have discretion to determine the actual level at which any of the new requirements would actually be funded cbo also estimates that mandatory benefit spending would be increased in s 1 by almost 1 billion over the fy2004 through fy2013 period due to the change in procedures for appealing local coverage determinations and the inclusion of additional funding in the mandatory medicare integrity program funding for provider education those provisions are not in hr 1 and cbo estimated that there was increase in direct funding in that bill this report will be updated as events warrant contents introduction 1 overview 1

13 subtitle review recovery and enforcement review 16 subtitle f other improvements 19 regulatory reform provisions of s 1 as passed by the senate and hr 1 as passed by the house introduction overview for some time observers have expressed concern over the way in which medicare has been administered some believe that the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms formerly the health care financing administration or hcfa has not been provided with sufficient resources both staff and funding or management flexibility to enable it to carry out its ever increasing responsibilities others believe that organizational shortcomings are exacerbated by bureaucratic approach emphasizing regulatory controls that adversely affect program administration the general accounting office gao describes the agency as lightning rod attracting the criticism from those discontented with program policies because of the number and diverse interests of its stakeholders which run the gamut from providers including general and specialty physicians hospitals practitioners and medical suppliers to beneficiaries and taxpayers its responsibility to ensure fiscal prudence medicares market dominance and its very nature as public program moreover medicare because of its sheer size and fragmented decentralized operations is seen as highly vulnerable to fraud waste and abuse1 one of the central issues driving the debate over the effectiveness of medicares administration is the perception that the enforcement of medicares payment rules imposes too great burden on health care providers and confuses medicare beneficiaries essentially complaints about unreasonable demands for claims documentation contradictory billing instructions excessive paperwork and the sense that providers and physicians are being unfairly investigated if not prosecuted over purportedly innocent billing errors have prompted efforts to provide regulatory relief title v of s 1 and title ix hr 1 would modify how medicare regulations and guidance are communicated would modify the procedures used to resolve payment disputes and would establish various provider appeal processes particularly for those who face termination of medicare participation or denial of their application to participate in the program as well as attempting to minimize medicares administrative burden the bill would address appeals issues and would provide for 1 us general accounting office medicare successful reform requires meeting key management challenges gao011006 july 25 2001 and regulatory issues for medicare providers gao01802r june 11 2001 for additional information crs2 more competition in the way medicare claims processing contractors are chosen many of the provisions of the bill codify initiatives underway within the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the agency that administers medicare under its current authority the regulatory reform titles in these bills came from s 3018 introduced at the close of the 107th congress and hr 810 which was reported out of the house committee on ways and means and the committee on energy and commerce the provisions of both those bills comprise title v in s 1 and title ix of hr 1 number of bills were developed in the 107th congress the precursor of all the legislation was the medicare education and regulatory fairness act merfa or hr 868 merfa was criticized by the office of the inspector general oig in hhs as potentially encouraging fraud in part because it would have granted physicians immunity if they voluntarily returned overpayments when potentially facing investigation that provision was dropped in later legislation that passed the house december 4 2001 the medicare regulatory and contracting reform act of 2001hr 3391 which also incorporated changes suggested by the oig gao and the department of justice to ensure that the governments ability to address medicare fraud waste and abuse would not be significantly weakened selected provisions of hr 3391 were also incorporated into the medicare modernization and prescription drug act of 2002 hr 4954 which passed the house on june 28 2002 similar legislation was introduced in the senate s 452 the medicare education and regulatory fairness act of 2001 which was very similar to the original house bill s 1738 the medicare appeals regulatory and contracting improvement act of 2001 which incorporated similar concerns regarding the governments ability to address medicare program integrity issues and s 3018 the beneficiary access to care and medicare equity act of 2002 which contained selected provisions from s 1738 none of these bills came to vote by the senate hr 810 was introduced during the beginning of the 108th congress and was based on hr 4954 the house energy and commerce committee and the house ways and means committee reported out slightly different versions of medicare regulatory relief legislation on march 26 2003 and on april 11 2003 respectively major feature of both s 1 and hr 1 and one ardently supported by the secretary of hhs is contracting reform the contracting reform provisions would change medicares authority to contract for claims processing services another central issue seen to complicate effective program administration presently there are statutory limits on which entities may process medicare claims generally fiscal intermediaries process claims from institutional providers and carriers process part b claims including those submitted by physicians durable medical equipment suppliers laboratories and other practitioners the medicare statutes provider nomination provision allows professional associations of hospitals and certain other providers to choose claims processing intermediaries on behalf of their members the statute requires that cms choose only health insurance companies as carriers medicare regulations coupled with longstanding agency practices have limited the way that contracts for claims administration services can be established for example the contracts are costbased and lack incentives for quality performance both bills would generally allow for greater flexibility in contracting for medicare claims processing functions by permitting the secretary to enter into contracts with crs3 any qualified entity for any or all functions of medicare claims processing contractor2 the congressional budget office cbo has estimated that the added administrative costs to the government in implementing the regulatory reform provisions of s 1 and hr 1 would be 4 billion over the fy2004 through fy2013 period however these are administrative costs that are subject to the appropriations process rather than mandatory benefit spending as result the appropriations committees have discretion to determine the actual level at which any of the new requirements would actually be funded cbo also estimates that mandatory benefit spending would be increased in s 1 by
