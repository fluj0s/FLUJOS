agency determinations in trade remedy proceedings section 102 of the uraa domestic legal effect of wto decisions section 102 of the uraa and its legislativ history establish that domestic law supersedes any inconsistent provisions of the agreements approved and implemented in the statute and that congressional or administr ative action as the case may be is required to implement adverse decisions in wto dispute settlement proceedings federal law section 102a1 19 usc 3512a1 provides that provision of any of the uruguay round agr eements nor the application of any such provision to any

legislation4 this approach which cong ress has taken in addressing potential conflicts between domestic law and prior gatt and free trade agreements is considered to be consistent with the c ongressional view that necessary changes in federal statutes should be specifically enacted not preempted by international agreements5 the implementation of wto dispute settlement results is similarly treated uraa legislative history states th at since the uruguay round agreements as approved by the congress or any subsequent amendments to those agreements are nonselfexecuting any dispute settlement findings that us statute is inconsistent with an agreement also cannot be implemented except by legislati on approved by the cong ress unless consistent implementation is permissible unde r

declared invalid as to any person or circumstance on th ground that the provision or its application is inconsistent with any of the uruguay round agreements except in an action brought by the united states for the purposes of d eclaring such law or application invalid8 according to legislative history the pr ovision makes clear th at the uruguay round agreements do not automatically preempt st ate laws that do not conform to their provisions even if wto dispute settlement panel or the appellate body were to determine that particular state measure was inconsistent with one or more of the

remedies are prohibited under 102c1 of the uraa 19 usc 3512c1 which provides that person other than the united states shall have cause of action or defense under any of the uruguay round agreements or by virtue of congre ssional approval of such an agreements or may challenge in any action brought under any provision of law any action or inaction by any department agency or other instrumentality of the united states any state or any political subdivision of state on the ground th at such action or inaction is inconsistent with such agreement congress has additi onally stated in 102c2 of the uraa 19 usc 3512c2 that it intends throug h the prohibition on private remedies to occupy the field with respect to any cause of action or defense under or in connection with any of the uruguay round agreements including by precluding any person other than the united states from bringing any action agains t any state or political subdivision thereof or raising any defense to the application of state law under or in connection with any of the uruguay round agreements on the ba sis of judgment obtained by the united states in an action brought under any such agreement or b on any other basis the house ways and means committee report on the uraa discusses on the rationale and implications of 102c as follows for example private party cannot bring an action to require preclude or modify government exercise of discretionary or general public interest authorities under the other provisions of law these prohibitions are based on the premise that it is the responsibility of the federal government nd not private citizens to ensure that federal or state laws are consistent w ith us obligations under international agreements such as the uruguay round agreements12 the saa notes however that 102c doe s not preclude any agency of government from considering or entertaining argument on whether its action or proposed action is consistent with the uruguay round agreemen ts although any change in agency action would have to be author ized by domestic law13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22154crs5 14 eg snr roulements v united states 341 fsupp2d 1334 1341 ct intl trade 2004 timken v united
