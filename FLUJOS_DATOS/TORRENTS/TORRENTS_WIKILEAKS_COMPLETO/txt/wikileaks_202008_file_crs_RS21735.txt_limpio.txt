occurs the president traditionally consults senators of the home state where there is vacant judgeship especially if they are of the same political party as the president1 the president selects nominee and submits nomination to the senate judicial nominations are referred to the committee on the judiciary the committee sends committee questionnaire and financial disclosure forms to nominees and may at the discretion of the committee chair invite the american bar association to review nominees qualifications 1 in rare cases the president may select nominee that is not from the previous judges home state for example president george w bush nominated claude allen of virginia to replace francis d murnaghan jr of maryland on the fourth circuit court of appeals congressional research service the library of congress crs2 nominees homestate senators are consulted by the judiciary committee through the use of committee form called blue slip which asks whether the senators approve or disapprove of the nomination as matter of recent policy the committee does not wait indefinitely for the return of positive blue slips in practice committee action on judicial nomination is unlikely if the president failed to consult with the homestate senators2 the question of whether committee action will move forward with one or two negative blue slips depends on the chairs blueslip policy during congress when the questionnaire and financial disclosure forms are returned the chair determines whether to hold hearing3 following hearing the judiciary committee may vote on whether to report the nomination to the full senate in rare cases judiciary committee chair has forgone hearing on nomination and proceeded to committee vote4 if vote occurs the committee may choose to vote on motion to table the nomination to report the nomination favorably to report the nomination without recommendation or to report the nomination unfavorably if majority of the committee members present vote to report favorably without recommendation or unfavorably the nomination moves to the senate floor if majority votes either to table the nomination or in the negative on the other motions then the nomination remains in committee httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21735 once the nomination is reported out of committee the senate may consider and vote on it if the senate votes on the nomination it may vote to confirm reject table or recommit if the senate votes to confirm or reject nomination either resolution of confirmation or one of disapproval respectively will be transmitted by the secretary of the senate to the president in the case of vote to table the nomination is returned to the president vote to recommit sends the nomination back to committee the senates vote on confirmation of nomination can be delayed or prevented if senator or group of senators chooses to place hold on or filibuster the nomination either the judiciary committee or the senate can decide not to act on judicial nomination5 if final action is taken on nomination it ultimately will be withdrawn by the president or be returned to the president by the senate upon an adjournment or recess of more than 30 days6 2
