be found as early as 1917 not only were taxes applied to automobiles but also to auto trailers trucks trailers buses road tractors motorcycles tires tubes tread rubber as well as parts and accessories over the course of many years federal excise tax rates varied between 2 and 10 these taxes were instituted to increase general revenues it was argued that since federal expenditures for highways promoted development of the automobile as means of national transportation the industry and consumers should help in the support of the federal government through increased tax revenues several arguments were advanced against these taxes on autos the primary arguments against this tax were that there were already host of other taxes on autos federal state and sometimes local gasoline taxes as well as state and local property taxes sales taxes registration fees etc that the tax could be seen as regressive for those with lower incomes that it discriminated against those living in rural environment and that automobiles should longer be considered an item of luxury buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20314crs2 1 for discussion of the economic issues associated with luxury excise taxes see crs report rl30049 excise taxation of luxury goods history and economic assessment by louis alan talley 2 under the original law taxpayers were expected to pay the luxury tax on parts and accessories added at latter date to the vehicle current law provides that the tax attaches when the cost of accessories exceeds 1000 an exemption is provided for any part or accessory installed to enable or assist an individual with disability to operate the vehicle or to enter or exit the vehiclerather necessity of modern living the excise tax on passenger automobiles was repealed effective august 16 1971 history of the current luxury excise tax to increase revenues the current luxury excise tax on automobiles was reintroduced with the passage of the omnibus revenue reconciliation act of 1990 hr 5835 pl 101508 several other luxury excise taxes were revisited in this law with excise taxes imposed on boats aircraft jewelry and furs1 the excise tax on jewelry and furs was 10 of the sales price over 10000 10 excise tax was also imposed on the sales price of passenger automobile over 300002 the sales price of boat over 100000 and the sales price of an aircraft over 250000 the tax was not imposed if the vehicle was used in trade or business or if it was used by the federal government or state or local government for police fire fighting emergency medical services search and rescue public safety or public works activity the luxury taxes were set to expire on january 1 2000 under this tax law luxury excise taxes were expected to generate 1479 billion over the fy1991fy1995 period the luxury excise taxes enacted in 1990 were all based on sales prices exceeding statutory amounts suggesting congressional desire to shift some or part of the overall tax increase to upperincome individuals opponents argued however that the taxes depressed sales and employment in the affected industries and this actually burdened lowerincome workers congress accepted this argument in 1993 repealing all the taxes except that on automobiles in the omnibus budget reconcil iation act of 1993 hr 2264 pl 10366 while not repealing the tax on luxury automobiles congress did provide an inflation adjustment to the statutory sales price perhaps the reason why the tax on automobiles was retained was that it was the only one raising significant amounts of federal revenue with passage of the small business job protection act of 1996 hr 3448 pl 104188 the tax on expensive automobiles was extended but at reduced tax rates under that law the tax for sales after august 28 1996 was decreased from 10 to 9 thereafter the tax was to be reduced 1 per year through the year 2002 at which point it expires from federal tax law the rationale given for this change was that if the tax expired as scheduled on january 1 2000 it would create an unacceptable disruption of the automobile market congress believed more gradual phaseout of the tax would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20314crs3

it is appropriate to commence the phaseout in 19963 provision included in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 hr 2014 pl 10534 provides that the luxury tax on passenger vehicles does not extend to the subsequent installation of parts and accessories with an aggregate price that does not exceed 1000 this provision became effective as of january 1 1998 congress indicated that in the case of later installation the owner or operator of the vehicle is responsible for paying the tax attributable to the installation and the installer is secondarily liable increasing the minimis amount should significantly reduce the number of return filers and relieve many persons from the administrative burden of filing an excise tax return reporting very small amount of tax4 under current tax law luxury automobiles are taxed when the price exceeds 40000 cars that sell for less are not subject to the luxury tax the tax is applied only to the portion of the sales price that exceeds 400005 the tax rate fell to 3 for tax year 2002 the tax expires after this year revenues we have gathered information on revenue collections from the luxury excise tax on automobiles this excise tax first became effective on january 1 1991 as of the end of fiscal year 2000 over 394 billion has been collected table 1 provides breakdown of revenues by year as can be seen the high point in collections was in fiscal year 1996 with the tax rate declining by one percentage point each year and with the base amount inflation adjusted it can be expected that revenues will most likely fall this year from current collection amounts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20314crs4 table 1 luxury automobile excise tax collections in thousands of dollars fiscal year collections 1991 88000 1992 276100 1993 379530 1994 475177
