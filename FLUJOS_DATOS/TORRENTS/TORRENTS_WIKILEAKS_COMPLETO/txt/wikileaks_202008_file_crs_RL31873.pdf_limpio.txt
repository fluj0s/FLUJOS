critical infrastructure required for the nations minimum economic operations1 financial institutions accept funds from various sources and make them available as loans or investments to those who need them america has vulnerabilities because its financial records are on computers and paper financial institutions face two categories of emergencies that could impair their functioning the first is directly financial sudden drop in the value of financial assets whether originating domestically or elsewhere in the world that could cause national or even global financial crisis the second is operational the failure of the support structures that underlie the financial system either could disrupt the nations ability to supply goods they could reduce the pace of economic activity or at an extreme cause an actual contraction of economic activity collapse of one prominent entity could evoke contagion effect in which sound financial institutions become viewed as weak and panick ed customers withdraw funds from sound entities causing them to fail regulators generally address financial problems through deposit insurance and other sources of liquidity such as emergency loans for distressed institutions safety and soundness regulation and direct intervention they address operational risks thr ough corrective actions as with the y2k problem redundancy regulation auditing and other physical security under the worst case scenarios the federal reserve fed can limit economic damage by supplying liquidity to the financial system and employing monetary policy to expand domestic demand as it did following the 2001 terrorist attacks in the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 tria congress expanded the feds ability to act as lender of last resort to the financial and real economies 2 congress may also legislate direct federal assistance to protect the financial infrastructure as it did in the cases of chrysler the farm credit system and new york city to prevent them

systems by institutions outside the attack area allowed quick resumption of nearnormal operations regulators and industry groups made it known that financial firms would need new contingency plans and stress tests to protect against more extreme situations in the future many insurance compan ies stopped writing insurance covering terrorist related claims this led tria to encourage insurers to write terrorism risk insurance nevertheless some highprofile commercial properties lack terrorism insurance because of the high cost of such protection in spite of tria the government also provides insurance to domestic airlines under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act 14 g344g342g342g345g559g4g149g138g140g148g152g158g157g561 emergency response measures noted above helped
