the shippers warehouse or vice versa the access roads and in some cases rail lin to these terminals are referred to as intermodal connectors the connectors tie the intermodal transportation system together intermodal connectors are typically short segments of road or railtrack generally less than two miles in length access roads are usually local county or city streets many of the connectors especially roads leading to seaports are in older industrialized areas and have preponderance of atg rade rail crossings3 the freight community refers to these access rout as their front door because they are the pivotal link in the intermodal transportation system significance of intermodal connectors transportation efficiency intermodal connectors that are in poor condition may reduce service reliability and predictability two of the most important qualities shippers seek in their supply chains on industry representativ has described the nations intermodal system as network of conduits and pipe s that is only as efficient as its weakest link4 if intermodal connectors are weak link in the nations transportation system they may raise sh ipping costs limiting the productivity and competitiveness of us businesses poor intermodal connectors can also result in long lines of idling trucks reducing air quality and increasing energy consumption recent trends in business logistics demand higher levels of service from intermodal carriers retailers and manufacturers have been substituting more frequent shipments for large and costly inventories and outs ourcing production to overseas plants with cheaper labor in justintime delivery environment manufacturers essentially use their carri ers as rolling warehouses truck may deliver parts from overseas within hours or ev minutes before they are used in manufacturers assembly line the growth of intermodal containe r shipping was largely spurred by deregulation of the trucking and railroad indus tries in 1980 deregulation fostered new arrangements between these competing modes trucks and trains compete fiercely for intermodal traffic but in some cases trucking companies are partnering with the railroads to

firm that tracks the us cont ainer trade is forecasting 46 average annual growth rate in im port containers and 5 average annual growth rate in export containers through 20108 in certain gateways such as the ports of angeles and long beach the volume of trade is expected to triple it is not likely that many additional seaports or rail terminals will be built to handle this increase in freight traffic rather existing ports and terminals will need to become more productive key element for in creasing productivity will be improving the throughput of intermodal connectors military mobilization the performance of intermodal connectors also has national security implications as the depa rtment of defense dod increases its reliance on commercial freight systems in the late 1990s the dod relied on commercial carriers for 90 of its peace time movements and 85 of its wartime movements9 the military relies on commercial carriers through the voluntary intermodal sealift agreement visa under the visa program private ocean carriers can volunteer ship capacity to th military in timepha sed activation an important component of the visa program is that in addition to ship capacity participating

connectors report to congress july 2000 available at httpopsf hwadotgovfreightinfrastrnhspeaking behavior an important aspect of freight flow s on intermodal connectors is peaking behavior like commuter traffic contai ner drayage also experiences daily rush hours most warehouses prefer to recei ve their inbound shipments in the morning while outbound cargo is loaded in the afte rnoon harbor truckers respond to their customers needs by trying to be first at the port terminals gate in the morning rail ramps and seaports are predominately located in large urban areas where truck and commuter traffic often intermingle surges also occur on weekly and yearly basis the import container business largely follows the retail market the peak shipping season begins in august in anticipation of backtoschool sales and continues through th end of october in anticipation of holiday sales container lines also tend to bunch their ship calls at ports on certain days of the week in order to connect with rail timetables traffic volume is further consolidated by the larger container ships being deployed these larger ships are calling at fewer ports because standing still in port costs money the result is an increase of container traffic at hub ports the railroads are also rationalizing their intermodal hubs they are reducing the number of intermodal terminals and consolidating traffic on unit trains this also contributes to the concentration of freig ht activity at key hubs findings of dot studies the fhwa study recent national studies have highlight ed the poor condition of intermodal connectors11 the national highway system nhs designation act of 1995 pl 10459 required the dot to submit list of designated in termodal connectors dot submitted its list in may 1996 after c onsultation with state dots metropolitan planning organizations mpos and ter minal operators in tea21 section 1106 congress called on the fhwa to examine the condition of intermodal connectors the fhwa published its findings in january 200112 the criteria used to define an intermodal freight connector were based on the amount of truck traffic on one or more of the

august 2002 strategies for improving mobility to and from cargo hubs there are number of strategies that state and local governments and private industry have implemented or are developing to expedite the flow of cargo to and from terminals redesigning terminal infrastructure in recent years ports have redesigned their physical infrastructure to accommodate the growth in container traffic in the past 10 15 years ports have built ondock or near dock rail yards th facilities reduce the amount of bridge trucking of containers fro m port to rail terminal th downside of ondock rail is that it absorbs tremendous amount of scar ce surface area at the port the port of new york and new jersey has begun plan to tranship portion of its container traffic by barge to less congested ports such as

industry context and issues feb 1999 p 28container barges and feeder ships are common in asia and europe they are not widely used in the united states another redesign concept that some port logisticians are advocating is the inland intermodal center14 the idea is to move the container sorting facility which requires great amount of space to less congested inland area the sorting facility would be connected to the port by rail shuttle all c ontainers unloaded from ship would be moved to this inland facility where local traffic moving by truck would be separated from traffi c moving further inland by rail this concept has the potential to reduce truck traffic near the port however while there may be economic benefits from savi ng land on shore these benefits would have to be weighed against the cost of acquiring the right of way for rail shuttle operationally there would also be the cost of adding an additi onal link in container movements namely the cost of the rail shuttle movement and the cost of an additional container unload and load according to some ports have been more aggressive than railroads in investing in the access infrastructure to their facilities in the executive dialogue discussion of the fhwa study it was noted that railr oads continue to focus on using their existing yards which were originally veloped for box car traffic that did not require highway connections while highway access is crucial to intermodal rail service15 however this is not to say that railroads are not investing in their intermodal terminals there are many instances where rail carriers are consolidating their intermodal terminals andor moving terminals outside metropolitan areas where land area can be expanded and conn ections to highways improved improving port operations modifying port operations can also expedite the transfer of cargo between water and land modes although ra il terminals operate 24 hours day seven days week traditionally port terminal gates are open only on weekdays from 8 am to 5 pm expanding gate operations to evening hours is proposed as one solution to relieving congestion on port access roads some ports have begun extending their gate operations to offpeak hours the questi on however is if there will be enough shippers willing to extend the hours of thei r warehouse operations to generate enough cargo to make offpeak operations costeffective cargo flow to and from ports can also be expedited by reducing the number of days shippers are allowed to store their container shipments at the port large shippers are often granted more than the typi cal five days of free storage at ports to accommodate these shippers containers may be stacked six or seven high this practice slows the container pickup proce ss for the truckers as they wait for the containers to be unst acked and restackedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31887crs8 16 for further information on its see crs report rl31283 intelligent

intermodal connectors16 its is described as expanding the capacity of existing infrastructure by substituting information or infostructure for infrastructure the idea is to use existing infrastructure more efficiently with the help of information technology given the co mpeting land uses surrounding seaports and rail terminals limiting the amount of space av ailable for widening access roads its may be especially applicable to the problem of increasing freight mobility on intermodal connectors information exchange has been key element in the success of intermodal transportation the efficient exchange of shipment data between carriers at transfer points is as important as the handoff of the cargo itself the internet is evolving as popular tool for gathering and providi ng information on container shipments websites such as emodal and first can increase freight mobility on access roads to ports by sharing information with harbor truckers on congestion areas road closures and container availability for pickup17 providing this information to truckers can reduce the number of dry r uns they make to the port due to communication one port provides realtime surveillance video of its gate on its website so truck dispatchers can gauge the waiting time at the gate18 an axiom in the intermodal industry is that the commodity most frequently shipped is air19 substantial amount of truc k traffic to and from intermodal facilities is picking up and returning empty containers the internet can be used to directly connect an importer with an expor ter in need of an empty container trucker can deliver an empty container directly to the exporter after unloading its contents at the importers warehouse this eliminates the intermediary truck trip to the container depot to drop off and pick up an empty container20 its is also being deployed to track shipments on intermodal connectors while ports and railroads pr ovide container tracking inform ation black hole often exists when the

intermodal planning issues at issue for congress is how to plan for and develop an intermodal network that is largely national and even international in scope with transportation planning process that is largely local in scope as noted earlier the fhwa intermodal connector report contends that intermoda l connectors have not received the policy attention they deserve the report scribed intermodal fre ight connectors as orphans in the traditional planning process of state dots and metropolitan planning organizations mpos tea 21 and its precursor istea pl 102240 gave states and mpos primary responsibility for allocating funds for transportation projects istea and tea21 did not speci fy category of funds for intermodal freight projects rather it suggested and encouraged local decision makers to consider an intermodal approach when d eciding on projects for funding mpos may often be the appropriate body for determining funding for intermodal connectors because these routes largely lie in urban areas however some policy analysts suggest that this planning arrangement may be more logical for solving commuter concerns than it is in addressing interstate and international commerce concerns23 freight stakeholders contend that because mpos are largely staffed by elected officials they give priority to commuter projects while commuter trips likely begin and end within thei r geographic jurisdiction freight trips particularly intermodal are more likel to extend beyond their jurisdiction some mpos may perceive that while the cost of freight project is born locally the benefits of the project may flow to shippers located outside their region24 this may be especially true where the prepondera nce of freight traffic is passing through the terminal area from one region

conditions off terminal such as increasing pollution truck traffic and noise in some instances local officials may be reluctant to make significant landside investments in improved intermodal connectors when there are equally pressing infrastructure needs elsewhere on the other hand comp etition among local and regional economic development agencies to attract business to their area may encourage investments in freight facilities many mpos may view intermodal terminals as engines of economic growth freight information needs 1995 survey by the freight stakeholders national network found that 90 of mpos responding re ported that they lacked sufficient data to conduct ad equate freight planning25 lack of information on intermodal shipments has been mentioned as an existing gap in available freight data better information on freight flows at the local level such as shipment origin and destination type and valu of cargo seasonality nd peaking behavior and time delays could assist localitie s in making sound transporta tion investment decisions it could also assist them in evaluating the potential economic benefit of investing in freight projects it appears that mpos could benefit fro m better information on how local freight moves are connected to regional national and international markets the fhwas office of freight management and operations is developing costbenefit model for goods movement that is intended to assi st state dots and mpos in this regard26 this office along with the bureau of transportation statistics bts also recently released report on freight flows in each state that is intended to assist them in freight planning27 an issue of likely interest to congress is assessing whether current freight information s ources are adequate in addre ssing local needs and if not whether the federal government or st ate and local governments should be responsible for collecting and providing this information in useful format28 freight movement is largely controlled by the private sector so much of the information that would be useful for freight planning may not be readily available one of the barriers government agencies must overcome when enlisting assistance from the private sector is the private sectors fear of providing information that it considershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31887crs11 29 transportation research board

circular ec048 dec 2000proprietary companies may fear that providing information to the government will allow access to that information for their competitors in addition to providing more useful freight information policymakers may also consider resource issues for adding freight expertise to local planning staffs some mpos already have freight advisory committees that consist of freight specialists freight corridor planning common theme found in the literature on intermodal planning is for policymakers to focus on the trip or transportation corridor rather than focusing on the mode of travel to incorporate corridor perspective into the planning process some state officials have created multistate organizations so that states could work as team on end toend investments in corridors that cross state lines29 two examples are the i95 corridor coalition which includes the dots from five midatlantic states and th i35 trade corridorcomposed of seven states in the midwest in the reau thorization debate congress may consider formalizing multijurisdictional arrangements or allowing existing arrangements to continue or to expand terminal planning the issue of improving access to intermodal terminals raises the related issue of planning for the best location of the terminals themselves many large cities have multiple rail terminals for example in the greater chicago area there are 26 intermodal terminals in the metropolitan new york area there are 11 and in detroit there are seven these terminals largely deve loped as result of historical forces in which multiple class i railroads many of whom have now consolidated independently planned fo r additional space and facilities to meet growing demand for intermodal traffic in some cities the uncoordinated manner in which some of these facilities developed has generated fragmented freight activity for example repositioning freight containers between multiple facilities generates unnecessary truck trips which increases costs for shippers and creates more congestion on local highways30 with the projected increase in intermodal traffic over the next two decades many experts assert that we can longer afford to truck containers across cities to make rail connections these experts suggest that the solution is to build rail terminals in which two or more railroads jointly use single facility multiuser facility could concentrate in termodal activity at single location thereby reducing the amount of truck traffic between rail terminals in addition to improving goods movement they suggest it could have positive effect on community mobility economic development and ot her quality of life issues terminal location and access may therefore involve larger public interests state and local officials could partner with the railroads in developing common user facilities partnership approach offers the potential for more orderly and coordinated ter minal development strategy

provided to help finance their construction congress may evaluate whether this is an issue to be resolved between local government officials and the railroads or if given the volume of freight moving through these hubs it is matter of national significance federal intermodal planning many observers believe that major obstacle to achieving the goal of na tional intermodal transportation network as envisioned in istea is that the modes ar separately manage d and funded because each mode tends to jealously guard their independent source of infrastructure financing the infrastructure linking th modes may fall through the cracks of existing modal funding categories31 intermodal supporters argue the focus should be on improving the connectivity and in teroperability among modes in 1966 one of the principal reasons for creating the dot was to facilitate unified approach to transportation planning in 1991 istea created the office of intermodalism and the intermodal transportation advisory board to further facilitate intermodal connections dots recent initiative called onedot is an attempt to integrate the ten agencies in the department into an unified unit congress may wish to assess whether institutional arrangements for transportation policymaking are keeping pace with changing economic circumstances recent transportation research board trb conference on intermodal planning concluded that because the old modal boundaries are becoming increasingly blurred at critical nodes and along key corridors compartmentalized approach presents clear challenges to dot in advancing these important types of investments32 as in past reauthorization discussions policymakers may renew debate on whether to restructure federal transportation institutions for example one proposal is to divide dot and congressional transportation subco mmittees along two divisions passenger and freight rather than along modal divisions this view holds that these are more appropriate distinctions than modal distinctions in pursuing greater mobility through an integrated transportation system33 defenders of the current system argue that initiatives to restructure dot have already been attempted but failed in the past partly due to industry opposition they point to the unified transportation infra structure improvement program utiip in 1995 as one example some argue that while intermodals market share is increasing it still represents only minority of total freight movement in the united states carriers themselves tend to give greater priority to their mode specific needs than to intermodal

infrastructure needs of intermodal connectors and if not eval uating alternative proposals some advocate creating specific fundi ng category for intermodal connectors in the surface transportation program s tp in tea21 section 1108 setting aside funds specifically for intermodal connectors might help ensure that they are given greater priority in the state and local tran sportation planning process the downside is that setting aside funds for specifi c purpose could reduce local transportation planners ability to direct funds to where th ey may be needed most in some cases setaside program could resu lt in allocating funds to marginally important freight project while other more pre ssing nonfreight needs go unmet35 additionally local governments may be unwilling to provide match for projects unless the perceived public benefits are clear another proposal congress ma debate is creating an intermodal trust fund as suggested by one policymaker this fund coul d be financed through user fee charged per container shipment36 others have proposed pooling resources by taking portion from existing transportation trust funds the funds could be used to finance projects that improve the in termodal network establishi ng dedicated pool of funds for freight projects could overcome the hurdle that freight projects face in competing with passenger projects for funding howe ver it may be difficult to collect and distribute the funds in an equitable manne r that does not result in one port or cargo hub subsidizing another port or cargo hub policymakers could consider expanding the requirements of existing funding programs to specify that freight projects such as intermodal connectors be included for instance the language in the co rridors and borders corbor program in tea21 section 1118 and 1119 could specify that improving access roads to ports is eligible for funding corbor pr ovides funds for the development and construction of projects that serve border regions similarly policymakers could consider expanding the railroad rehabilitation and improvement financing rrif credit program in tea21 section 7203 to include access roads to intermodal rail yards the rrif program provides lowinte rest loans and loan guarantees for newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31887crs14 railroad facilities or improvements to exis ting facilities such as terminals
