opportunities act of 1998 most federa l agencies are required by law to grant preferences in federal hiring and retention t veterans with serviceconnected dis abilities and certain other veterans whose service encompassed specified periods of time the proportion of veterans as share of the federal workforce declined from 37 in 1984 to 28 in 1995 and some veterans advocates contended that the decline reflected the failure of existing preferences to give veterans the advantages that their preferenceeligible status should entail included among their concerns about existing law veterans were not able to apply for all open jobs some veterans claimed that they were improperly denied appointment some believed that veterans were targeted during reductionsinforce in cases where their rights may have been ignored any appeal was difficult certain agencies were excluded from preference requirements hr 240 which passed the hou during the 1 session would have expandedst the number of federal jobs open to applications from veterans with at least 3 year s active service provided more protections to veterans during reductionsinforce including increasing job transfer opportunities for veterans during rifs and requiring agencies to establish priority placement programs to help workers who lost jobs in rif and expanded preference requirements to some excluded positions in th white house nd in the legislative and judicial branches the bill included language to make violating veterans preferences prohibited and punishable personne l practice adding new redress procedures for

background veterans preferences in policy and practice underlying policy rationale compensation for disability beginnin g with the civil war and perhaps from the beginning of the republic n an informal basis disabilities sustained during us military service were regarded s creating an obligation upon the government to help the disabled veterans during their remaining years preferential treatment in federal hiring and retention reflects this obligation to disabled veterans and in som circumstances dependents of disabled or deceased veterans readjustment at the completion of service in the veterans preference act of 1944 c ongress gave the federal government lead role in addressing problem s arising from demobilization of large numbers of troops the act gave veteran s competitive advantages for federal openings and for retention as the governmen t began to scale back from its wartime employment levels subsequent amendment s to the act gave similar readjustment assistance to veterans of korea vietnam and the persian gulf inducement t enlistment reward for service preferences can also be seen as measure encouraging enlistment andor as reward for service especiall during period in which military service seems likely to lead to potential combat although evidence about the n umber of volunteers who enter military service largely because of enhanced federal employmen t opportunities would be difficult to develop it is likely that for many recruits preferences are one of several factors contributing to perception that period of enlistment will improve financial security once th service is completed eligibility1 veterans who sustained disability traceable to period of honorable military service are eligible for veterans preference other veterans eligible for veterans preferen ces must have received an honorable or general discharge and mus t generally meet other requirements about duration period of time or location f active duty military retirees at the

veterans who died of servicecon nected conditions or spouses of veterans who are unable to work because of serviceconnected disabilities and mothers of veterans who died i n service or who are totally and permanently disabled from serviceconnecte d condition qualify for certain preferences provisions in pl 10585 the defense authorization ct of 1998 give veterans preference status to veterans of

november 20 1995 in bosnia and nearby areas affected by that conflict veterans preferences in competitive civil service 2 the modern federal civil service originated with passage of the pendleton act in 1883 the act brought together two views about contemporary federal service concern that increasingly complex and essential federal positions were being filled without due regard for the qualifications of the applicants and belief that competitive civil service was necessary to staff federal jobs with professional com petent efficient and effective employees who would not be unduly influenced by partisan and personal political loyalties the meritbased civil service envisioned by the pendleton act requires n objective evaluation of applicatio ns from officeseekers and hiring decisions that can withstand close scrutiny as to their fairness and suitability for the position filled veterans preferences affect the objective criteria by giving competitive advantage to eligible veterans relative to nonpreference applicants who would otherwise b regarded as having at least equal qualifications when the competitive evaluation s result in numerical score preference points are

advance i n employment these vietnam era and disabled veterans the hist orical perspective the view of the bradley commissio n in 1956 the presidents commission on veterans pensions the bradle commission assessed the status of veterans preferences concluding that they have5 sound justification and major changes in the program seem desirable this conclusion was based on several observations on hiring the initial preference in competing for federal jobs is justifiable readjustmen t benefit if limited to reasonable period after discharge from the service as lifetime preference it is self defeating in terms of the readjustment of veterans just leaving service young veteran must compete mainly against the other older veterans who have the same five point preference plus greater experienc or seasoning on the job preference for more limited period such as 5 years after discharge would thus do more for the veteran who is most in need f special help on retention rights gained through preferences preference in retention during reductions in force for nondisabled veterans s real rel ation to readjustment needs and does violence to the basic principle s of the federal merit system the goals of open competition and equal treatment for all on the basis of their ability to serve the public as employees cannot b achieved if there is arbitrary discrimination in favor of one group based n factors having nothing to do with their efficiency or with their readjustmen t needs as veteranshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98493crs6 data is for veterans in the federal executive branch

the special appeals procedure for veterans tends to make traditional an d necessary function of management into an elaborate costly and timeconsuming quasijudicial procedure the readjustment needs of

of providing preferences to thos veterans who sustained injuries or lingering illnesses traceable to their service effect of veterans preferences on federal employment the proportion of federal executive branch jobs held by veterans6 trends in federal hiring policy in recent years the downsizing of the federal workforce has led to fewer employees newly hired from outside the government as employees shift and transfer within agencies to fill jobs vacated through norma l attrition from 1984 through 1992 the number of firsttime entrants into federa l professional and administrative job s declined by 40 as the government has gotten smaller it has also decentralized agency administrative authority such as hiring so that more direct link between agency needs and potential applicants

most qualified either developed by the office of personne l management opm from pool of all qualified applicants or at the agency level in its 1994 study the merit systems protection board mspb found that in 1984 onethird of new entrants to federal professional and administrative jobs in th federal executive branch were hired from certificates developed from the centra l opm register of qualified applicants by 1992 that percentage had fallen to 19 positions filled from certificates developed at the agency level declined from 20 in 1984 to 17 in 1992 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98493crs7 mspb

in effect hiring certificates have been increasingly replaced by other methods positions filled from within agencies rose from 12 in 1984 to 22 by 1992 entrants hired through direct hiring authority including authority that pertains t certain categories of veterans had increased from 22 to 29 over the same period aging of th veteran population veterans advocates point out that as proportion of the federal executive workforce the percentage of veterans s declined from 37 in 1984 to 28 in 1995 however because of the aging of the9 veteran population relative to t he rest of the population of united states decline in the proportion of veterans in both the federal and total civilian workforce can b expected between 1984 and 1996 the median age of all males in the us rose by 1 year while the medi an age for male veterans had risen by 5 years this difference illustrates the greater relative age of the veteran population and thus the departure of large numbers of veterans from the civilian workforce this is demons trated by data on labor force participation of veterans at various ages in the age groups of 2039 and 4054 labor force participation for mal veterans w as 90 and 94 respectively in fy1996 large numbers of veterans10 however trace their service to world war ii and that cohort of veterans had reached retirement age and largely left the workforce this demographic shift has bee n reflected in an overall decrease in the percentage of veterans in the workforce i n 1992 82 of nonveteran males over age 20 were in the c ivilian workforce compared to 65 for veter ans although in fy1996 nonveteran male workforce participation was largely unchanged 83 the percentage of male veterans in the civilia n workforce had declined to slightly under 60 thus as the median age of veterans rises the proportion of veterans in th workforce declines unless an increasing percentage of veterans in the workforce become employed by the federal government decreasing proportion of veteran s among federal employees should be expec ted maintaining the current proportion of veterans among federal w orkers would prove difficult and perhaps impossible in the future given the current rate of entry into the armed forces by 2010 half of l current veterans will be over age 62 the current average retirement age for th civilian work force11 veterans in federal jobs veterans make up much larger proportion of the federal workforce than they do of the civilian workforce as whole and to som extent that relative share probably reflects the impact of veterans preference

13 to 20 of the total number of veterans hire d during the period fy1990fy1995 this increase in the percentage f recent positions claimed by veterans accounts for the relatively stable percentage of veterans in the federal workforce since 199 2 and offsets the large number of vetera ns retiring each year between 1992 and 1995 veterans accounted for over 50 of all retirements from federal jobs bias against veterans at times veterans have asserted that some federal officials are biased agains t veterans according to testimony by opm officials before the house civil service subcommi ttee 28 of the federal workforce are veterans and 38 of federa l managers are veteran s which would suggest that bias against veterans is likely to be more episodic rather than systemic notably the annual

to the president and the17 congress of the united states by the us merit systems protection board december 1995 testimony before the subcommittee on civil service april 30 199618some veterans have contended that the percenta ge of hiring certificates returned without securing an appointme nt is unacceptably high when veteran is at the top of the register for consideration citing 1992 gao report that found that 71 f15 certificate s with veterans at the top were returned unused compared to 51 fo r certificates headed by nonv eterans some veterans advocates have suggested that the gao study confir ms the existence of bias against veterans during the appointment process the gao report does not draw that conclusion and suggests severa l reasons for th is disproportionate number of certificates that were returned unused16 subsequent detailed study of federal hiring procedures by the merit systems protection board mspb found similar disparate treatment the mspb study also examined the relationship between veterans preferences and officials hirin g decisions and concluded that current practices do not indicate that veterans ar discriminated against in federal hiring nor do they cause veterans to be hired when they are not qualified or not suited for the posting the mspb study also concluded that in spite of commonlyvoiced suspicion reported to researchers it did t appear as if more suitable applicants were being passed over simply because veteran had preference advantages after reviewing the methods used for selecting among available candidates and finding that veterans are not encountering systemic difficulties in the hiring process the mspb study concludes that the selection process could be made fairer to veterans and nonveterans alike the study recommends giving greater responsibility t managers to evaluate applicants because the current approach to veteran s preference too often produces result s that are not in the best interests of managers or job candidates including candidates with veterans preference the complexity f the standard hiring rules has ncouraged hiring officials to use alternative procedures available to them matter how cumbersome the steps that must be taken t exercise the hiring discretion that such alternatives provide17 in statements before the house sub committee on civil service some veterans18

veterans preferences hr 240 s 1021 and pl 105339 addressing perceived problems with veterans preference law proposals to amend veterans preference law arose because of perceptions b some veterans that at best federal officials were ignoring preference rights and t worst were acting to disadvantage veterans precisely because of their veteran s status as the issue unfolded these concerns prompted congress to examine th claims of veterans advocates that veterans preferences were not working as congress intended these advocates asserted that veterans did not have sufficient opportunities to apply for all open jobs veterans with preferences were often improp erly passed over for appointment veterans were often treated improperly during reductionsinforce in cases where veterans rights were ignored appeals were difficult certain agencies were unnecessarily excluded from preference requirements hr 240 and s 1021 originally companion bill but later amended wer develope d to address these

administrative burden on agencies the number of veterans actually hired because of advantages given to them by the bill wo uld probably not have been large the federal appointment proces s involves

rather than significantl more veterans within federal employment hr 240 would have added retention protection pl 105339 does t contain these provisions under hr 240 veterans would be given additiona l protections during rifs the provisions were eliminated by the senate committee and the enacted legislation does not contain these provisions the housepassed bill would have prohibited singleposition

be removed other more subjective factors ca n legally also be taken into consideration when retention orders are developed hrhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98493crs13 240 would not have eliminated these subjective factors even with passage of th proposed provisions rifs would pro bably still have exposed some veterans to loss of their fede ral jobs and in spite of efforts to find other suitable federal employment for these veterans some would still have been released both bills expanded appeal rights both bills hr 240 and s 1021 s reported contained the provisio ns for expanded appeal rights under the house bill the provisions would be extende d to the group of preferenceeligible veterans which the bill expands as explained above under the senate bill the rights would b extended only to those veterans currently eligible for preferences the bill s enacted contains the senate provisions pl 105339 expands appeal rights in the following ways expands the role of department of labor in

employment and training service vets at dol to investigat veterans complaints and enforce compliance where warranted the vets i s expected to resolve the complaint if possible but within 60 days the veteran could notify vets of an intention to appeal the agency action in question to the meri t systems protection board mspb adds additional appeal opportunities under prior law only employee s

reimbursed for attorneys fees possible effects of expan ding appeal rights error is possible whenever human judgement is required and some occasions will predictably arise in which veteran s rights are not properly considered new re dress procedures provided by the new law give veterans additio nal ways to challenge and appeal actions taken that they believe are improperly adverse to their in terests as veterans with earned rights to preferential treatment the chan ges may be of value to veterans but will not necessarily resolve every dispute to the satisfaction of veterans note that veterans are not appealin g decisions in large numbers at the current time the legislated added provisions to improve co mpliance in addition to being treated as right earned through military service preference rights were mad comparable to protected cla ss status rights that must be recognized throughout the personnel system new law blishes denial of veterans preference rights as prohibited

officials who ignored requirements to perform their hiring responsibilities according to federa l policy and regulations ho w much additional notice and penalties will alter officials behavior is difficult to gauge the legislation expands coverage to other agencies the new law expand s the application of veterans preferences to incl ude certain jobs in the white house the legislative branch and the judicial branch in addition the legislation extends th rif protections provided by existing veterans preferences to the federal aviatio n administration which under prior law was required to grant preference rights only with respect to hiring decisions the legislation requires these parts of th government to broadly comply with veterans preference requirements but provides exclusions for political appointments and special appointment requirements pl 105339 leaves interpretation applicat ion and compliance up to internal mechanisms for the legislative and judicial branches possible effects of expanding veterans preferences to other agencies positions exempted from veterans preference requirements often have special characteristic s that place additional responsibilities on hiring officials to select from amon g applicants according to those specific characteristics some veterans may be added as result of the legisla tion but in general these special characteristics will continue to govern when it would be appropriate to apply veterans preferences to ope n positions there is evidence that veterans were systematically excluded fro m these positions under existing law or that their numbers were disproportionatel lower than in other federal agencies pl 105339 expanded coverage to federal contractors under prior law special disabled veterans as defined in the section
