921 d riyadh 928 classified by cda ambassador richard erdman for reasons 14b and d summary and comment 1 c in the aftermath of the failed assassination attempt targeting assistant interior minister prince mohammed bin naif mbn ref king abdullah and other officials responded swiftly and decisively to reassure the public that the prince was well and reaffirm the kingdoms commitment to combating terrorism the press and the public universally condemned the attack characterizing it as direct assault against the saudi state and islam more measured reaction in the blogosphere hints at how this most recent incident might affect domestic debate on the proper approach to dealing with domestic terrorism with some calling for continued leniency and emphasis on reform and others arguing the saudi government is being too lax the attack seems to have strengthened the already positive public reputation of prince mohammed bin naif and many religiousminded saudis will see his miraculous survival almost unscathed as sign of divine protection and blessing for his efforts against alqaeda and other extremists for his part prince mohammed has told us the attack has only strengthened his resolve and convinced him that the kingdoms counterterrorism strategy combining firmness with understanding is effective and should continue end summary and comment official reaction swift and decisive 2 u official condemnation came from all quarters immediately following the attack the saudi press agency published photographs of king abdullah and mbn wearing bandage on his left middle finger meeting at the hospital in jeddah news channel alarabiya played tape of the visit throughout the day in which the visibly concerned king praised allah for the princes safety and described the attack as an attack against both islam and the country thanks be to god that you are safe and nothing has happened to you everything you might have suffered in the service of your religion and homeland will not be for nothing god willing mbn responded that this attack would only strengthen our resolve to root out the terrorists and admitted that he was at fault for failing to require full search of the bomber official reports note that the wouldbe assassin was on list of 85 wanted terrorists that mbn was aware of his planned attendance and that he had been expected to turn himself in at the event 3 u other prominent religious and political figures were widely quoted in the press the day after the incident the grand mufti of saudi arabia told okaz newspaper the attack was not unexpected and called the assailant deviant and corrupt to the core justice minister mohammed alissa thanked allah for keeping the prince safe interior ministry spokesman major general mansour alturki reaffirmed the ministrys commitment to fighting terrorism characterizing the attack as an isolated incident and adding those who think the war on terror is over in the kingdom are mistaken prince feted in papers public shocked by attack 4 u all major arabic and english dailies led with the story focusing prominently on mbn himself and his role in the kingdoms war on terror alsharq alawsat dedicated the first three pages of the august 29 edition solely to the attack on the prince and related subjects other papers included lengthy biographical profiles of the prince editorial cartoons dealing with the event and even poems in his honor 5 u the articles and editorials show broad support for mbn and more generally the fight against terrorism many depicted the event as an assault on the saudi state that called for patriotic response saudi journalist dawood alshiryan wrote in alhayat that the attack was terrorism as political rebellion attempting to undermine the authority of the state okaz called the attack an attack on the security of the nationthat should make everyone alert and ready to fight the august 29 editorial cartoon in alwatan depicted prone terrorist wearing an explosive belt and holding detonator in each hand dead and bleeding riyadh 00001121 002 of 003 from wound caused by the saudi flag planted in his back in the same paper caricature accompanying poem celebrating the prince as engineer of love and war shows him carrying shield resembling the saudi flag 6 u the publics reaction as portrayed in an arab news article was of shock disgust and dismay noting that the timing of the attack during the holy month of ramadan was particular source of ire one student in jeddah said yes there is frustration among section of people regarding our foreign policy but what happenedis deplorable and utterly unislamic riyadhbased professional questioned whether the kingdom should continue with its rehabilitation programs saying these efforts had been nullified by the attack and that the perpetrator had betrayed our leaders others called the attack evidence that the governments antiterror tactics have been largely successful and observed panic in the terror camp and frustration with the governments continued success of hitting terrorists hard diverse reaction in the blogosphere 7 u on his saudi jeans blog ahmed alomran expressed relief that the prince was not seriously injured and hope that the incident would not add fuel to the fire of the debate between liberals and conservatives he added this is time for solidarity and national unity let us not ruin it contributor to blog alsaha encouraged mbn to continue to demonstrate openness and patience with terrorists not revert to ironfisted policies an informal poll on the same website indicated strong support for the prince with 58 of voters suggesting mbn should replace his father as interior minister liberal blog altomaar said the attack was the result of spoiling terrorists and treating them leniently referring to the sags widelytouted terrorist rehabilitation scheme ref b contacts reserve comment 8 c post contacts were reluctant to comment substantively on the attack over the phone telling us that it was common for royals to welcome wellwishers during ramadan that they were relieved mbn was not injured and that they wondered why the man was not checked when the subject was broached at meeting between pas officers and deputy minister of higher education mohammed alohali on august 29 however he went somewhat beyond the fulsome praise of mbn as qahir erhaby conqueror of terrorism that is the stuff of most media commentary we know what were up against said alohali adding that dangerous extremists were still threat to the country this he said was the reason the sag was pushing educational reform so hard terror yemen already hot topics 9 u saudi soulsearching about the root causes and extent of domestic terrorism has been evident since 2003 and the august 20 announcement that 44 suspected alqaeda militants had been arrested in the kingdom injected it with new vigor on august 22 alsharq alawsat columnist husayn alshubakshi praised the saudi security forces for their preemptive focused professional and secret blows and credited mbn directly for the ministrys success 10 u in an august 27 piece in the same paper columnist mshari alzaydi also considered the arrests success while citing the need to confront terrorism as an ideological issue that this new batch of terrorists was predominantly saudi middleaged and welleducated challenged previous assumptions that economic deprivation and youthful religious zealotry were responsible for domestic terrorism and indicated that the government needed to rethink its approach saudi arabia is now confronting new virus that is constantly evolving he writes adding the ideological doctor who is holding on to the surgeons scalpelis yet to enter the operating theater 11 c although unvoiced in the gushing media paeans to mbn ordinary saudis are wondering how this assassination attempt came so close to fruition according to todays edition of okaz the suspect managed to make his way from yemen into saudi arabia some weeks ago and finally rented furnished apartment in jeddah we anticipate that such reports will inevitably spur some introspection into how well the security services are patrolling the asir region riyadh 00001121 003 of 003 erdman
