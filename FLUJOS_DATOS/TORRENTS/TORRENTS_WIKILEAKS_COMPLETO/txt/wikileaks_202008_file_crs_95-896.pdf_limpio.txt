the constitu tion in december 1865 the 13th amendment prohibits slavery in the united states and gives congress power to enforce this article the 39th congress sought to expand suffrage to citizens in the united states with passage of the first recons truction act of 1867 it required former confederate states to write new constitutions that guaranteed the right of all males to vote irrespective of race to insulate its efforts from par tisan politics and presid ential vetoes congress turned to constitutional amendments in june 1866 it proposed the 14th amendment to the state legislatures 14th amendment the 14th amendment contains five sections section 1 prohibits the states from denying citizens of the united states equality before the law section 2 was devised to prevent the southern states from using literacy and property tests to keep african americans from vo ting while retaining their full population based representation in the h ouse of representatives it provides that when the right to vote is denied to any 21year old male resident of state at any election for electors for president and vice president of the united states congressional representatives the executive and

the constitution 15th amendment the 40th congress proposed the 15th amendment to the state legislatures in 1869 the 15th amendment protects the right of male suffrage without regard to race color or prev ious condition of servitude and empowers congress to enforce this ar ticle in march 1870 the 15th amendment became part of the constitution from 1867 to 1875 congress passed election laws that guaranteed the right to vote in national and state elections and blished federal supervision of election and voter registration to protect the political legal and social equa lity of all americans congress passed civil rights legislation that contained provisions for the imposition of fines and criminal penaltie s on those convicted of cons piring to deprive citizens of their civil rights as consequence of these laws black participation in the political process rose dramatically for example during this nineyear period nearly 70 of the eligible black voters were registered 10 blacks were elected to the house and two to the us senate besides ecting blacks to office black voters heavily influenced the outcome of local state and national ections throughout the south1 most southern whites opposed the enfranc hisement of former slaves some resorted to number of tactics to discourage or stop blacks from participating in the political process such as fraud viol ence including murder and economic blackmail the compromise of 1877 essentially ended reconstruction as withdrawal of federal troops from the south allowed those who supported the disfranchisement of blacks to assume control of most state governments these legislatures used creative measures to make voting difficult they passed bills to reduce the numbers of black voters by requiring them to travel great distances to voting precincts and designed complex ballo ting procedures that amounted to literacy tests challenges to registration rulings were heard by local officials who were unlikely to be sympathetic2 south carolina law of 1882 for example required that special ballots and boxes be placed in every polling place for each office on the ballot and that voters put their ballots in the correct boxes one was

thrown out3 all of these tactics both legal and illegal combined to minimize the presence of blacks in the electoral process but some southern whites were uncomfortable with the resort to fraud murder bribery and theft to disfranchise most blacks they sought permanent legal way to limit black voting4 constitutional disfranchisement during the last decade of the 19th century number of southern states held constitutional conventions to permanently di sfranchise black americans although delegates at these conventions favored repeal of the 15th amendment they feared the reaction of the rest of the nation they need not have though for the political climate of the country both north and south seem ed to favor limiting bl ack participation in the political process though for different r easons federal enforcement of election laws and protection of citiz ens were being withdrawn the supreme court in 1883 narrowly interpreted provisions of civil ri ghts laws passed dur ing reconstruction or declared them unconstitutional congress repealed many sections of the enforcement act these rulings effectively removed the federal government from the business of protecting the civil rights of all americans for decades5 at its constitutional conve ntion of 1890 called for the express purpose of removing blacks from the voting booth mississi ppi devised system that effectively disfranchised most blacks nd was variously adopted by other southern states because delegates at the convention feared voters would reject the new constitution they did not submit it for popular approval instead the convention itself approved promulgated and declared the constitution to be in effect the mississippi constitution of 1890 differed from its predece ssor in that it replaced the six months residency requirement with twoyear one imposed literacy test for prospective voters as well as property requirement of threehundred dollars introduced an annual poll tax of two dollars and disqualified convicts6 virginias election code in 1894 requi red that registration and poll tax certificates be shown at the polls and that the names of candida tes be printed on the ballot by office not party this was an extrem ely confusing arrangement for barely literate and illiterate voters voters had maximum of twoandahalf minutes to vote if others were waiting in line as consequence of this code many black and white illiterate residents were disfranchised7 in 1898 louisiana introduced new device into its constitution the grandfather clause it required an additi on to the permanent registration

two southern states used literacy tests as voting limitation devices however none of the new cons titutional provisions mentioned race that is they were racially neutral but the impact of these laws was devastating for blacks for instance in mississippi in 1867 70 of elig ible blacks were registered to vote by 1889 only 9 in louisiana in 1896 130334 blacks were registered to vote by 1900 only 5320 alabama in 1900 had 181471 black males of voting age but after the new constitution was adopted only 3000 registered9 other disfranchisement tactics although the vast majority of african american voters were disfranchised by 1910 some continued to vote causing cern for some southern whites in an address on the right of ffrage before congress in 1927 senator cole blease of south carolina reflected the political climate for african americans in his state he boldly admitted that the purpose of th 1895 south carolina constitution was to disfranchise african ameri cans concerning the presidential election of 1922 he stated i think mr calvin coolidge received 1100 votes in my state i do not know where he got them i was astonished to know they were cast and shocked to know they were counted10 unfair examinations intimidation and delaying registration until the deadline had passed were other tactics employed to effectively remove african americans from the ballot box in florida payment of the poll tax automatically carried registration with it but other methods were used to keep african americans from voting in the 1920s an african american who attempted to vote mig ht discover that his name was not on the voters list that the name or address on his certificate di ffered from that on the voters list or that his name through oversight had been placed on the white

north carolina reported that when she attempted to register to vote she was told that her request to vote at three places had been reported and she was being watched by hostile observers and other such statements that implied she could become victim of violence13 early supreme court cases these laws stood for decades eleven southern states determined that the state political party nominating process was pr ivate action and therefore that party officials could legally restrict participation in the primary to whites only thus the name white primary since the winner of the primary in oneparty state was in essence elected to office african americans were eliminated from the electoral process14 suit was filed in texas smith v allwright 15 challenging the constitutionality of the white primary in 1944 the supreme court declared the white primary unconstitutional generally southern legislatures developed other means to minimize blacks access to the voting booth in july 1957 the alabama legislature with act 140 redrew the boundaries of the city of skegee to exclude tuskegee institute now tuskegee university and majority of the nearly 5400 black residents as consequence thousands of bl ack residents and nearly ll blacks who were registered to vote could longer participate in skegee municipal elec tions resident charles g gomillion in gomillion v lightfoot16 charged that the act violated both the 14th amendment the equal protection clause and the 15th amendment this was an important case because two issues were involved voting rights for blacks and redistricting by state legislatures17 in the past supreme court rulings appear ed to give state legislatures absolute control over setting municipal boundaries in 1957 as the court began to dismantle barriers to black political participation it c onsidered the redistricting issue inherent in gomillion v lightfoot although act 140 did not mention race it was clear that its intent was racially discriminatory yet on appeal the fifth circuit court of appeals by 32 vote upheld lower courts dismissal of the case on the grounds that it lacked authority or jurisdiction to declare the law void dissenting judge john brown wrote that the fact that act 140 did not discriminate on its face washttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95896crs6 18 ibid p 107 19 ibid pp 106109 20 pl 83315 71 stat 634insignificant the act effectively disfranchi sed all but four or five black voters18 brown also considered the fact that m acon county the county in which tuskegee was located had been without board of re gistrars for 18 months and that the state legislature was trying to abolish the county through constitutional amendment since most eligible whites were already registered they had real need for registrar but thousands of blacks were not registered and were unable to register in tuskegee for lack of board of registra rs therefore the traditional method of correcting political abuse at the polls was denied blacks consequently judge brown found the law unconstitutional he wrot that the business of judging in constitutional fields is one of searching for the spirit of the constitution in terms of the present as well as the past not the past alone on appeal the supreme court agreed with judge brown and ruled unanim ously that act 140 violated the 15th amendment19 civil rights acts of 1957 1960 and 1964 congress passed the civil rights act of 1957 to protect black voting rights through the judicial process by provisi ons of the act the attorney general was authorized to bring lawsuits to prot ect equal voting rights and persons who disobeyed court orders prohibiting discrimination in voting could be held in criminal contempt further the act authorized appointment of another assistant attorney general to head civil rights division in th department of justice it provided that special threejudge federal dist rict courts be c onvened with jurisdiction to hear civil rights cases taken out of state courts by the department of justice sixmember commission on civil rights was created to gather information on discrimination in voting and to issue annual reports20 the commission on civil rights held hearings throughout the nation and discovered that some registrars discriminated against blacks for racial reasons because of the length of legal hearings and the delaying but legal tactics employed during lawsuits the civil rights act of 1957 was mostly ineffec tive after three years only four cases were heard and decided it was felt that the law needed strengthening to prevent evasive measures by registrars and produce more timely rulings so in 1960 congress passed another civil rights law the civil rights act of 1960 sought to fill some of the loopholes in the 1957 act it provided that if registrar resigned after complaints had been filed the proceeding could be instituted against the st ate it authorized federal referees to investigate complaints of voting discrimination and to register qualified voters the act required voting records to be preser ved for 22 months following any primary special or general election at which there were candidates for fe

commission on civil rights concluded that this was role that the federal governme nt should assume federal efforts to ban racial discrimination relie d heavily on litigation the commission rejected this litigious approach because it was time consuming and did not increase black registration significantly22 most national political leaders remained committed to litigious lowprofile approach to registering blacks in the south until violence erupted in birmingham alabama in 1963 and philadelphia ssissippi in 1964 after the violence congress passed the civil rights act of 1964 which contains provisions that attempted to have threejudg federal district courts hear cases more quickly and allow for temporary voting registrars it fo rbids local officials to apply standards to some voter registrants eg black registra nts that had not been applied to others eg white registrants alr eady found qualified to vote the act also provides that in any voting rights court case there shall be presumption of literacy for all voter applicants who have completed the sixth grade in an accredited englishspeaking school these provisions proved ineffective as well sometimes after lengthy litigation caused an election law to be judicially invalidated as discriminatory the state or local jurisdiction would pass and enforce di fferent law or regulation designed to circumvent the court order the justice department called for new approach that would go b eyond the tort uous oftenineffective p ace of litigation23 in drafting another voting rights bill it sought to impose constraints on the use of literacy tests and other devices that denied blacks access to the ballot box and to establish an administrative presence of federal marshals in the southern states to assist blacks in

there was evidence that voting discrimination had occurred coverage formula was adopted to deter mine which states and political subdivisions of states would be covered by the act it was assumed that low registration and voting statistics in jurisdictions requiring literacy tests and devices resulted from the discriminatory application of those tests and devices therefore according to the formula established in section 4b27 any states or political subdivisions are covered if they used any test or device as c ondition for voter registration on november 1 1964 and if either less than 50 of

intended to prevent enforcement of any election law made after november 1 1964 with racia lly discriminatory effect31 the act prohibits covered state or po litical subdivision from putting into effect

change in election law for preclearance either to the justice department or to the us district court for the district of columbia in an action for declaratory judgment in or der for the department or the court to determine if such law would deny or ab ridge the right to vote on account of race or color32 in order to object to an election law change submitted for federal preclearance the justice department or the us district court for the district of columbia need not find that the jurisdiction intended to discriminate against minority voters it need only determine that imple mentation of the law would in fact result in denying or abridging voting rights if the justice department does not object to the proposed law within 60 days after jurisdiction submits it for review then the jurisdiction may put the law into effect laws affecting elections that require preclearance section 533 requires federal preclearance of every change in election laws not only laws affecting

process the justice department objected more times to three of these ways than to any others met hods of electi on urban annexations and electoral redistricting these methods were objectiona ble because they would have resulted in abridging or diluting the vo ting power of blacks hispanics or other protected minority voters altering methods of election changing from single member districts to atlarge voting one objectionable way of altering the method of election was changing from election by singlemember districts or precincts to atlarge voting for example in majority white city governed by veral commissioners if each commissioner were elected in different district and if bl acks as minority in the city as whole nevertheless comprised the majority in one or more di stricts then black voters would be in position to elect one or more candidates of their own choice but if commissioners were elected atlarge it would usually mean that all voters in the city as whole would vote for each commissioner positi on and consequently that the white majority in the city as whole could elect every one of the nine commissioners thus change in method of election from election by singlemember districts to atlarge elections could dissolve any black majorities in separate districts and allow the white citywide majority to decide the entire outcome of elections for the city commission it is this kind of dilution of black voting power to which the justice department often has objected it should be noted that atlarge elections in white majority jurisdictions are not necessarily discriminatory they may become so in certain circumstances however where racial antagonism and racial bloc voting characterize the jurisdiction or where soci oeconomic issues such as unemployment or poverty divide jurisd iction along racial lines urban annexations the justice department found that urban annexations also may abridge black voting power for instance if majorityblack city annexed largely white suburban area the enlarged city might change from majorityblack to majoritywhite if the city conducted elections for munici pal offices atlarge and if the addition of suburban white s gave whites citywide majority then black voters might lose the chance to elect their own candidates to any municipal office this development occurred with the annexation of suburban areas by petersburg virginia in 1971 the black percentage of the popul ation changed from 55 to 46 because petersburg conducted atlarge elections for the city c ouncil the justice department believed that the annexation would have diluted black vo ting power petersburg was allowed to annex suburban areas only on the condition that it change from atlarge elections to elections by singlemember districts34

demonstrate that sp ecial coverage is longer needed58 the commission on civil rights recommende d an additional 10year extension of the act until 1985 for several reasons b ecause black registration in the covered states was still below that of whites and the proportion of black elected officials in covered states was low in comparison to the black percentage of the votingage population in the covered states there was continuing need to foster black political participation another reason offered wa s that the justice department had only recently begun to enforce effectively section 5

standa rd of proof under section 2 in the 1980 case of city of mobile v bolden 93 the supreme court affirmed that the proper standard for courts to use in deciding cases under section 2 was demonstration of discriminator intention the court said that courts can find any law to be in violation of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment only if it is shown that the law was enacted with the purpose or intention of discriminating because it regarded section 2 of the voting rights act as statutory restatement of the fifteenth amendment the court held that the same judicial standard intent applies to cases brought under section 294 to make it easier to challenge discriminatory election laws congress amended section 295 to establish discriminatory effect or result as standard of proof in voting rights cases for example if elections for the city c ouncil in majoritywhite city were conducted atlarge with the result that black voter s were unable to elect even one councilman of their own choice blacks prior to 1982 could have prevailed in court suit seeking an injunction against the atlarge election law only if they could have proven that it was instituted for the deliberate purpose of preventing black candidates from being elected discriminatory motivation is often difficult to prove after the 1982 amendment to section 2 th ey might obtain such an injunction by showing that blacks are unable to elect any of their own candidates because of the discriminatory result of the atlarge system congress recognized danger in adoptin g results standard for section 2 namely that electoral outcomes in which black voters fail to elect their own candidates in numbers proportiona l to the percentage that blacks comprise of the total electorate might be adduced as evidence sufficient to eliminate any atlarge electoral systems through court suits in this way the results standard could have led to acceptance of right of raci or ethnicgroup proportional representation to avoid this conclusion congress provided that raci ally or ethnically unequal results of an electoral system may indicate violation of section 2 only if such results occur within wider context of discrimination ag ainst racial or ethnic minority where such official or societal discrimination is absent unequal results of an electoral system would not suffice to c onvict the electoral system

proponents of assistance proponents of bilingual language assistance argued that considerable numbers of recently naturalized immigrants were not sufficiently fluent in english to unders tand complicated election procedures and electoral issues some longtime citizens of the united states such as older hispanics who learned very little englis h in school because they grew up in communities where spanish was the principal language needed language assistance too as result of their limited english many of these citizens did not register and vote even though through the use of nonen glish news publications and radios they were informed on the issues those who recommended bilingual language assistance argued that historically this country ac knowledged and tolerate d linguistic pluralism and diversity in education and should do lik ewise in the political arena advocates of providing bilingual election materials rejected the charge that language assistance discourages people from learning english they maintained that people learn english for many reasons most importantly to s ecure good employment and to communicate with others in the community the provision of language assistance they argued did not diminish the motivations for learning english on the contrary it strengthened the ties that bound the people of the united states for it was inclusive in nature rather than exclusive and thereby ensure d that citizen was denied the fundamental right to vote because of lack of fluency in english98 opponents of assistance the extension of section 203 was opposed for several reasons opponents of the extension questioned whether it was needed they contended that evidence submitted when the 1975 amendments were added was feeble then and had become even less pers uasive some denied that there had been sufficient proof offered that bilingual ballots were effective in increasing voter registration voter particip ation or in changing the voter registration andor participation between white and minority voters pponents who considered the bilingual election requirement distortion of the intent of the voting rights act argued that congress passed the act in response to discrimination against racial minorities at the polling place according to them persons ability to understand english was not immutable in the way pe rsons race is thus applying the voting rights act in this way discouraged pe rsons from learning english and thereby perpetuated divisions in society so opponents were also concerned about problems involved in accurately translatin g complex legal language from english to another language the canadian problem with bilingualism often was cited as an example of what would occur in the united states if we supported bilingual election material some opposition to bilingual elec tion materials was based on the fear that it would corrupt the democratic process or would be expensive the argument was also made that bilingual ballots delayed the progress of certain ethnic groups because english is the language of this count ry and persons who do not speak it cannot advance99 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95896crs27 99 continued act of

speakers participated in the electoral process hispanics from 1980 to 1990 the hispanic ectorate increased greatly the hispanic electorate grew by over 50 while the national electorate increased by less than 10 yet hispanics remained far behind the general voting population in registering voting and electing hispanic officials several factors have been cited to explained this one was that 37 of all hispanics were noncitizens and thus were ineligible to vote third of hispan ics were too young to vote low education and income levels played role in reducing hispanic participation in the political process some argued that the bilingual provisions of the voting rights act needed to be broadened and extended they cited several million potential hispanic voters who were still unregistered in 1988 as an i ndication of the continued significant need for language assistance100 many voting populations that had limited glish language pr oficiency lived in major metropolitan areas where the surroundi ng population was so large that the limitedenglish population could not meet th 5 standard for instance the 69000 spanish monolinguals residing in angeles in 1984 did not total 5 of the population and consequently we re denied bilingual voting assistance in contrast city of 100000 residents with only 5000 nonenglish speakers could qualify for language assistance under the voting rights act as amended examples of counties that did not meet the 5 standard yet had sizeable limitedenglishspeaking populations included angeles county ca lifornia cook county illinois queens county new york philadelphia county pennsylvania and essex county new jersey101 some jurisdictions recognized the lack of federal voting protections for limited english speakers and accordingly passed state and municipal laws to provide multilingual ballots others chose to supplement the provisions of the voting rights act by passing laws requiring affidavits to be in spanish for spanish

city counties kings queens and new york although the asian american population had increased remarkably in the previous decade it was still not expected to meet the 5 trigger for bilingual assistance coverage because the total statecounty eligible asian american voting population was numerically small in large metropo litan areas two of the five counties previously covered by s ection 203 were

suggested that the covera ge formula include numerical threshold in addition to the 5 calculation feature native americans native americans comprised less than 1 of the total population of the united states since they did not exceed 5 of most counties the 5 threshold would not have protected thei r voting rights native american leaders argued that section 203s definition of political subdivision

and sometimes crossed state boundaries they believed their uni history and demography created an atypical situation for sec tion 203s definition of political subdivision and that because of this the reservation not the county or parish should have been the standard of comparison as result of the amendments of 1982 many counties with significant numbers of limitedenglish native american residents were longer required to provide language assistance for them for exampl in new mexico two counties were longer required to provide nguage assistance to native americans six out of eight counties in south dakota four out of five in north dakota 24 out of 25 counties in oklahoma and six out of seven counties in montana longer were required by federal law to provide language assistance to native americans109 there was evidence that on at least one reservation the availability of language assistance had been split along county lines as result indians residing on reservation in one county r eceived language assistance while others living on the same reservation but in another county did not110 another anomalous result of the 1982 amendments occurred when counties contained two tribes each speaking different language under provisions of section 203 the tribe that met the 5 sing language minority threshold received language assistance while the other did not therefore some native american representatives supported amending sec tion 203 to prohibit englishonly elections where limitedenglish indian speakers of voting age 1 lived on or near reservation or other identifiable indian community such as the pueblo communities in new mexico and 2 exceeded 5 of the american indian voting age population of that reservation or community cost of bilingual election assistance major objection to extension of secti on 203 was related to the costs for states of providing bilingual voting assistance to limitedenglish speakers information provided on the costs of bilingual election

of jurisdictions did not incu r costs for providing oral assistance for several reasons some did not hire dditional workers rather they found poll workers who were able to converse in the covered minority language usually jurisdictions paid bilingual and monolingual poll workers at the same rate in other cases rather than hiring bilingual wo rker for polling places they made someone available
