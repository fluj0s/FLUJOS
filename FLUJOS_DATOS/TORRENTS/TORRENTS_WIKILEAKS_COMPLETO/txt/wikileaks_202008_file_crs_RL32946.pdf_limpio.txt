in 2 or more separate criminal episodes in relation to the gang and d the gangs activities affect interest or foreign commerce where section 521 in its present form makes criminal street gang offenses punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years hr 1279 would make them punishable by imprisonment for life or any term years not less than 10 years by not less than 20 years if the offense results in serious bodily injury by not less than 30 years if the predicate offense is kidnaping aggravated sexual assault or maiming and by death or imprisonment for life if d eath results s 155 in contrast would make any violation of its version of 18 usc 521 punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 years by imprisonment for any term of years or for life if the predicate offense carries life sentence4 s 155 would call for neither mandatory minimums nor the death penalty upon conviction hr 1279 would require confiscation of an property derived from or used to facilitate criminal street gang offense proposed 18 usc 521b s 155 would permit confiscation under s imilar criminal forfeiture procedures or under civil procedures which can be used without requiring criminal prosecution proposed 18 usc 521d finally section 101 of hr 1279 would amend the principal federal money laundering statute 18 usc 1956 to make it crime to launder criminal street gang proceeds proposed 18 usc 1956c7d s 155 would not but unlike hr 1279 in section 205 it would authorize the use of wiretapping and other forms of electronic surveillance in cr iminal street gang cases proposed 18 usc 25161t the consequences of the forfeiture mone laundering and wire tapping amendments are less sweeping than they might initially appear since many of the criminal street gang predicates are already predicate offenses for forfeiture money laundering andor wiretapping purposes 18 u sc 981 982 1956c 25161 section 102 increased travel act penalties the travel act 18 usc 1952 outlaws inte rstate travel or the use of the mail or facilities of interstate or foreign commerce in order to distribute crimegenerated proceeds or to commit crime of violence or otherwise operate in furtherance of illegal gambling drug trafficking or vari ous other racketeering offenses hr 1279 would increase travel act penalties so that violation involving the distribution of racketeering proceeds or to promote rack eteering activities would be punishable by imprisonment for not less than 5 nor more than 20 years up from not more than five years violation involving crime of violence is punishable by imprisonment for not less than 10 nor more than 30 years up from not more than 20 years or if death results by death or imprisonment for any term of years or for life up from imprisonment for any term years or for life it would establish the same penaltieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32946crs5 5 subsection 103d of hr 1279 however would increase the penalty under the general conspiracy statute 18 usc 371 from impr isonment for not more than five years to imprisonment for not more than 20 years 6 subsection 103d of h r 1279 however increases the penalty under the general conspiracy statute 18 usc 371 from impr isonment for not more than five years to imprisonment for not more than 20 years for conspiracy to violate any of these provisions conspiracy is now punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years5 s 155 would increase the travel acts promotion and proceeds penalties to not more than 10 years and would authorize us of the death penalty where violation results in death proposed 18 usc 1952a it would also amend the travel act to prohibit interstate or foreign travel or use of the mails or facility of interstate or foreign commerce for the purpose of obstr ucting justice misconduct which it would make punishable by imprisonment for any term of years and if death results by death or imprisonment for any term of years or for life proposed 18 usc 1952b section 103 violen t crime amendments carjacking federal law outlaws carjacking if the crime is committed with intent to cause death or serious bodily harm subsecti on 103a would make the offense punishable regardless of whether it is committed with such an intent it would also increase the penalties for violations so that an ffense under 18 usc 2119 would be generally punishable by imprisonment for more than 20 years up from not more than 15 years if the offense results in serious bodily injury it would be punishable by imprisonment for not less than 10 nor more than 30 years up from not more than 25 years and it would make conspiracies subject to the same punishment as the underlying offense up from not more than five years6 the parallel provision in s 155 subsection 105e would rely eliminate the specific intent requirement and would leave the sentenci ng structure unchanged firearms used in crimes of violence as for subsection 103b 18 usc 924h now reads whoever knowingly transfers firearm knowing that such firearm will be used to commit crime of violence as defined in subsection c3 or drug trafficking crime as defined in subsection c2 shall be imprisoned not more than 10 years fined in accordance with this title or both there is some question whether the necessary crime of violence may be either state or federal crime of violence s ubsection 924c2 cited for the definition of qualifying drug trafficking crime refers to three specific federal statutes subsection 924c3 cited for the definiti on of crime of violence refers to specific federal law but instead speaks to the nature of the crimes which should behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32946crs6 7 2 for purposes of this subsection the term drug trafficking crime means any felony punishable under the controlled substances ac t 21 usc 801 et seq the controlled substances import and export act 21 usc 951 et seq or the maritime drug law enforcement act 46 usc app 1901 et seq 3 for purposes of this subsection the term crime of violence means an offense that is felony and has as an element the use attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of anothe r or b that by its nature involves substantial risk that physical force against th person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense 18 usc 924c23 8 the supreme court has concluded that neith er guns nor violence alone are sufficient to awaken congress legislative powers under the commerce clause united states v lopez 514 us 549 567 1995 united states v morrison 529 us 598 617 2000 9 ie the offense is prosecutable only when co mmitted in or affecting interstate or foreign commerceconsidered crimes of violence without indica ting whether they need be federal crimes or may be state crimes as well7 the few lower courts to consider the question have suggested that as matter lenity and perhaps constitu tional necessity the crimes of violence mentioned in subsection 924h can only be federal crimes of violence united states v mclemore 28 f3d 1160 1162165 11th cir 1994 united states v acosta 124 fsupp2d 631 63338 edwis 20008 the subsection as written provides that upon conviction an offender might be sentenced to either fine or term of imprisonment or both until recently the operation of the united states sentencing guidelines made it unlikely that defendant even first time offender would be sentenced simply to fine see ussg 2k21 this result is less certain now that it has become clear that the guidelines are simply advisory united states v booker 125 sct 738 75657 2005 as amended by hr 1279 subsection 924h would read whoever in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce knowingly transfers firearm knowing or intending that the firearm will be used to commit or possessed in furtherance of crime of violence or drug trafficking crime as defined in subsection c2 shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than five years nor more than 20 years changes made by hr 1279 noted in italics thus hr 1279 would amend 18 usc 924h to make it clear that those convicted of violating its provisions might be sentenced to term of imprisonment and fine in fact it would establish five year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment and would increase the maximum to imprisonment for not more than 20 years up from not more than 10 years as to the questi on of whether state as well as federal crimes may be considered crimes of violence fo r purposes of subsection 924h it would suggest that they might by supplying ju risdictional element that the jurisdictional foundation for predicate federal crime might otherwise have to provide9 moreover it would remove the cross reference to th definition of crime of violence found in 18 usc 924c3 by doing so the fault definition of crime of violence inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32946crs7 10 the court in imposing sentence to term of imprisonment upon defendant convicted of felony set forth in chapter 95 racketee ring or 96 racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations of this title or in the comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act of 1970 21 usc 801 et seq or at any time thereafter upon motion by the director of the bureau of prisons or united states attorney may include as part of the sentence an order that requires that the defendant not associat or communicate with specified person other than his attorney upon showing of proba ble cause to believe that association or communication with such person is for the pur pose of enabling the defendant to control manage direct finance or otherwise particip ate in an illegal enterprise 18 usc 3582d 11 28 cfr 5013 prevention of acts of viol ence and terrorism authorizes federal prison authorities to implement the use of special administrative measures which in some forms could be thought to intrude upon constitutiona l rights to the assistance of counsel access to the courts or due process cf united states v reid 214 fsupp2d 84 926 dmass 2002 12 felipe apparently was allowed to communicate only with prison employees his attorney and five approved family members but was not allowed visits from either his attorney or family see united states v elhage 213 f3d 74 81 2d cir 200018 usc 16 would become operable in subsequent section hr 1279 would amend 18 usc 16 to make it accommodating for use when both state and federal crimes of violence are contem plated in the substantive provision only time couldl tell whether these amendments would be found sufficient to overcome contrary implications of mclemore and acosta the amendments to 18 usc 924h in s 155 are more modest in subsection 105f the senate bill would simply add th possessed in furtherance of language so that as in the case of the hr 1279 amendments the prosecution would have need to show that the firearm was affirm ative used it would add jurisdictional element it would establish mandatory minimum and it would allow the 10 year maximum term of imprison to stand as ntencing alternative or supplement to fine under title 18 ie fine of not more than 250000 for individuals and not more than 500000 for organizations 18 usc 3571 prisoner contact sentences subsection 103c of hr 1279 would amend 18 usc 3582d to permit federal sentencing courts to restrict those with whom defendants convicted of racketeering drug or criminal street gang offenses may associate or communicate including their attorneys upon showing of probable cause that the association or communication is for the purpose of di recting or participating in criminal enterprise as subsection 3582d now st ands it exempts attorneys from the orders reach and does not include street gang offenses10 whether because it has been little used or because prison officials enjoy comparable regulatory authority11 there are few cases construing the authority grante d in subsection 3582d one of the few cases to address the subsecti on concluded that it authorized an order forbidding an inmate from communication with everyone but close family members united states v felipe 148 f3d 101 110 2d cir 199812 the comparable provision in s 155 subsection 105g would permit the authority of subsection 3582d to be used for defendants convicted of criminal streethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32946crs8 13 iannelli v united states 420 us 770 77778 1975 14 pinkerton v united states 328 us 640 64647 1946 15 for instance section 810 of the usa pa triot act 115 stat 380 2001 did this for various federal crimes of terrorism and hr 1279 does it for federal carjacking and criminal street gang offenses proposed 18 usc 2119 proposed 18 usc 521a gang violations but would leave in place the attorney exception to the association and communications bar conspiracy as 20 year felony subsection 103d of the hr 1279 woul d increase the penalty under 18 usc 371 for conspiracies to violat the laws of the united states or to defraud the united states from imprisonment for not more than five years to imprisonment for not more than 20 years under existing law conspirators are lia ble both for conspiracy and for the underlying crime that is th object of the conspiracy13 in fact they are each liable for any foreseeable crime committed by any of th conspirators in furtherance of the scheme14 in recent years congress has made conspiracy to violate many of the more seriously punished federal cr imes subject to the same penalties as the underlying offense thereby providing an alternative to the five year maximum found in general conspiracy provision of 18 usc 37115 there are scores and perhaps hundreds of fe deral felonies the majority of which carry maximum term of imprisonment of less than 20 years for these crimes subsection 103d would mean that pl anning to commit them would be punished more severely than committing them ther is comparable provision in s 155 section 104 murder and othe r violence for hire increased penalties for use of interstate commerce federal law now condemns inte rstate travel or the use of the mails or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce in furtherance of the commission of murder for hire 18 usc 1958 section 104 of hr 1279 would amend section 1958 to include crimes of violence other than mu rder within the proscription and would increase the sanctions for those violations that are not capital whoever travels in or causes another including the intended victim to travel in interstate or foreign commerce or uses or causes another including the intended victim to use the mail or any facility in in terstate or foreign commerce with intent that murder or other crime of violence punis hable by imprisonment for more than one year be committed in violation of the laws of any state or the united states as consideration for the receipt of or as cons ideration for promise or agreement to pay anything of pecuniary value or who conspires to do so shall in addition to being subject to fine under this title 1 if the crime of violence or conspira cy results in the death of any person be sentenced to death or life in imprisonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32946crs9 2 if the crime of violence is kidnapi ng aggravated sexual abuse as defined in section 521 or maiming or conspiracy to commit such crime of violence be imprisoned for life or any term of years not less than 30 3 if the crime of violence is an assau lt or conspiracy to assault that results in serious bodily injury as defined in section 1365 be imprisoned for life or any term of years not less than 20 and 4 in any other case be imprisoned for life or for any term of years not less than 10 the sentencing clause of section 1958 in its present form reads shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more th an ten years or bot h and if personal injury results shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than twenty years or both and if death results sha ll be punished by death or life imprisonment or shall be fined not more than 250000 or both the obvious difference is the introduction of life imprisonment as the uniform maximum term of imprisonment and of mandatory minimum terms of impri sonment at or above what were the previous maximums the comparable provision in s 155 section 106 would simply adjust the general maximum term of imprisonment from not more than 10 years to not more than 20 years the maximum in cases where bodily injury results from not more 20 years to not more than 30 years and the maximum in cases where death results from death or life imprisonment to death or impri sonment for life or any term of years section 105 violence in ai d of racketeering penalty increases federal law prohibits murder and other forms of violence committed on behalf of racketeering enterprise either for hire or when motivated by reasons of membership in the enterprise one of the principal differences between 18 usc 1958 murder for hire and 18 usc 1959 violence in aid of racketeering is jurisdictional section 1958 require s interstate or foreign trav or use of the facilities of interstate or foreign commerce section 1959 requires nexus with an enterprise engaged in or whose activities affect interstate or foreign commerce in whose aid the violence is committed given the similarities it is perhaps not surprising that the sentencing increases in section 105a for violence in aid of r acketeering mirror those in section 104 for murder or violence for hire imprisonment for life as standard maximum sanction with escalating mandatory minimums often set at what had been the previous maximum sanction repealed whoever shall be punished whoever shall in addition to being subject to fine under this title repealed 1 for murder by deat h or life imprisonment or fine

alternativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32946crs11 17 prosecution under 18 usc 1959 requires proof among other elements that the defendant acted as contractor murder in c onsideration of payment from racketeering enterprise or for status to gain or improv his position within racketeering enterprise hr 1279 supplies an alternative if the defendant acts in furtherance of the activities of such an

violence or drug trafficking nevertheless as passed by the house the new section appears somewhat circular since among other prohibitions it seems to proscribe drug trafficking crime of violence during and in relation to drug offense this may well be scriveners error attributable to the fact that when the section was initially drafted its authors had not decided to amend the definition of crime s of violence to include drug trafficking and after they did so the necessary edito rial adjustment was overlooked yet the controlled substances act f eatures number of crimes that do not fall within the crime of violence definition21 it may seem little like the dog wagging the tail in some instances but the drafters may have intended these often less serious offenses should be more severely punished when drug trafficking occurs during and in relation to their commission of course the same cannot be said of violations of the controlled substances import and export act or the maritime drug enforcement act since they are not included within the hr 1279 amended definition of crimes of violence as result they can only stand on one side of the equation they can only be the drug offense in relation to which crime of violence is committed s 155 has corresponding section sec tion 108 which would prohibit violent crimes committed during or in relation to drug trafficking22

that the trial of all crimes is not only to be by jury but to be held in the state where they are committed the object of th is clause is to secure the party accused from being dragged to trial in

21 usc 841b1a b c the corresponding section in s 155 s ection 202 presents duplication since it has provisions comparable to hr 1279s expansion of the definition of crime of violence and since in its rebuttable pr esumption subsection it refers to serious violent felonies as defined in 18 usc 3559c2f rather than crimes of violence s 155 also differs in that it would afford the government the right

saction occurred as we interpreted the laundering statutes at issue th ey did not proscribe the anteri or criminal conduct that yielded the funds allegedly laundered the existence of criminally generated proceeds was circumstance element of the offense but the proscribed conduct defendants money laundering activity occurred after the fact of an offense begun and completed by others here by

the c ourts decision at odds with the views it expressed earlier in united states v cabrales 524 us 1 1998 in cabrales the court held that the violation of statutes that prohibited laundering the pro ceeds of various predicate offenses might not be prosecuted where the predicate offenses occurred unless perhaps it could be shown that the defendant was participant in some larger conspiracy that involved both offenses or had been involved in transporting the money from the place wher the predicate offe nse occurred 524 us at 89 in the mind of the court the fact that the gun use and the kidnaping were the contemporaneous misconduct of the defendant made all the difference the predicate offense in cabrales was mere circumstance an instance of conduct completed by others before the pros cribed laundering began28 congress has implemented the constitutions commands in several rules and statutes the most basic of these rule 18 of the federal rules of criminal procedure states that

other 18 usc 3235 which dates virt ually in haec verba back to the first congress30 now provides that the trial of ffenses punishable with death shall be had in the county where the offense wa s

on its face this new version of section 3235 would do away with the presumption in favor of trial within th county in which the capital offense occurs found in the existing version of 3235 less clear is the status of section 3236 that assigns venue over murder to the district in which the harm resulting in death is inflicted the new section 3235 does not ntion murder but it might be said that there are few if any other crimes for which death is constitutionally permissible penalty32 the prospect of conflict however may be reduced if section 3236 does not apply to many of fe deral crimes commonly thought to be capital offenses33 yethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32946crs20 crime is capital offense because 924j1 provides that the death penalty may be imposed if the offense results in murder as defined in 18 usc 1111 while the defin ition of murder in 1111 applies to determine whethe r the crime is capital offense it does not define the crime barnette was charged with against the government prosecuted barnette for violation of 924c1 venue for whic h is proper in the place where the underlying crime of violence 18 usc 2261 relating to interstate domestic violence occurred

carolina to roanoke virginia united states v barnette 211 f3d 803 814 4th cir 2000 if the venue provisions of section 3235 prior to amendment and of section 3236 do not apply to murder comm itted in

section 3235 do not conflict 34 the cardinal rule is that repeals by implication are disfavored inferring repeal from legislative silence is hazardous at best cook county v united states ex rel chandler 538 us 119 132 2003 we have repeatedly stated however that absent clearly expressed congressional intention repeals by implication are not favored an implied repeal will only be found where provisions in two statutes are in irreconcilable conflict or where the latter act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as substitute branch v smith 538 us 254 273 2003internal citations omittedit seems more probable that the new vers ion is intended to supercede section 3236 as well even though repeals by implication are not favored34 of course there is conflict if section 3236 is r ead like the new version of section 3235 to permit rather than to require murder prosecution in the district in which the death causing harm is inflicted possible conflicts with section 3236 as ide the new version of section 3235 would appear to change or at least clarify the law in several ways it would declare that any offense punishable by death shall be held in the distri ct where the offense was committed or in any district in which the offense began continued or was completed other continuous or multidistrict crimes ma already be prosecuted in any district in which they are begun continued or completed 18 usc 3237a thus the new version of section 3235 w ould confirm that murders punishable by death when committed during the course of federal crimes consid ered continuous for venue purposes such kidnaping 18 usc 1201 may be prosecuted in any district in which the continuing offens might have been prosecuted in its new form section 3235 would decree that if the offense or related conduct under subsection acap ital offenses that may be prosecuted in any district in which they are committed begin continue or are completed involves the importation of an object or person into the united states such offense may be prosecuted in any district in which those activities occurred under existing law any other offense involving the impor

palliser 136 us 257 26668 1890 36 the government argues that venue also may permissibly be based upon the effects of defendants conduct in district other than the one in which the defendant performs

district in which those activities occurred the corresponding provision of ex isting law states that any offense involving the use of the mails or trans portation in interstate or foreign commerce is continuing offense and except as otherwise expressly provided by enactment of congress may be prosecuted in any district from through or into which such commerce or mail matter moves 18 usc 3237a the obvious intent is to scribe venue in capital cases at least as broadly as venue is described in noncapital cases when importation or transportation in interstate or foreign commerce including use of the mails are involved where existing law assigns venue for noncapital cases to any district where the related activities of movement from through nd into place have occurred the new section 3235 would assign venue for capital cas to any district in which importation or commerce affecting activities involving the offense or re lated conduc t be it movement or otherwise occur or so it might appear terms like related conduct and activities seem to have breadth and potential ambiguity that terms like importation and tra nsportation lack in the past it may have been thought th at general venue statutes like the new section 3235 could reach further than per mitted by the language that detailed the elements of the crime venue is where th crime occurs the cr ime occurs where any of its essential elements occur35 section 3235 however may reflect the view that the congress possesses the legislative authority to establish venue for particular offense on the basis of the effects of the particular crime either by the placing an effects element among the other elements within in the substantive proscriptive statute or placing the effects element within general venue statute that applies several proscriptive statutes of comm on stripe the approach of the courts heretofore by and large seem to precl ude such an option but the court may have signaled willingness to depart from that perception in rodriguezmoreno 36 section 111 statute of limita tions for crimes of violence federal capital offenses ma be tried at any time 18 usc 3281 most other federal crimes must be prosecuted within five ears of their commission 18 uschttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32946crs22 37 person shall be prosecuted tried or punished for any noncapital felony crime of violence including any racketeering activity or gang crime which involves any crime of violence unless the indictment is found or th information is instituted not later than 15 years after the date on which the alleged viol ation occurred or the continuing offense was completed proposed 18 usc 32983282 the statute of limitations for some federa l crimes however is longer than five years certain federal crimes of terrorism have an eight year statute of limitations and may be prosecuted at any time if they involve risk of death or serious bodily injury 18 usc 3286 few federal arson and explosives offenses have ten year statute of limitations 18 usc 3295 and fe deral crimes involving the kidnaping or abuse sexual or physical of child may be brought any time during the life of the child 18 usc 3283 hr 1279 would establish fifteen ear statute of limitations for noncapital crimes of violence proposed 18 usc 329837 by virtue of the amended definition of crimes of violence section 112 of hr 1279 the new period of limitations would also apply to drug trafficking propos ed 18 usc 16 th new section was undoubtedly intended to replace the general five year statutes of limitation in the case of crimes of violence and presumably th short periods applicable to arson and noninjury terrorism offenses yet an i ssue may develop over whether in cases of overlap the bill intends to supercede the longer statutes of limitation that would apply under sections 3283 crimes against childre n and 3286 terrorist crimes involving injury risks s 155 would establish ten year statut of limitations for crimes of violence or eight years after the crime is discovered if results in longer period of limitation unlike the hr 1279 in section 112 it woul d not enlarge the definition of crimes of violence it would begin with the enigmatic phrase except as otherwise expressly provided by law it is unclear wh ether this refers to the general five year statute of limitations provided by law or to the specific periods for terrorism offenses child abuse offenses arson offenses and the like or to all of them or to none of them section 112 defi nition of crim of violence federal law contains seve ral definitions of crime of violence the most commonly used is found in 18 usc 16 which the changes made by section 112 of hr 1279 would provide the term crime of violencemeans an offense that has as an element the use attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another or b any other offens that is felony an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year and that by its nature involves substantial risk that physical injury force against may result to the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense or is an offense punishable under subparagraph b or c of section 401b1 of the controlled substances act httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32946crs23 38 eg 2 usc 1961 capitol police may make arrests for crimes of violence 8 usc 1227 aliens are deportable who engage in domestic crimes of violence 15 usc 1245 possession of ballistic knife during the commission of federal crime of violence 18 usc 25 use of minors in crimes of violence 18 usc 842q2b teaching the use of destructive devices known to be intended for use in federal crime of violence 18 usclanguage identical to that in 18 usc 16 prior to changes proposed in hr 1279 appears in 18 usc 924c3 si nce section 924c3 does not have specific cross reference to section 16 it will not automatically carry forward any changes to section 16 such as those proposed in hr 1279 hr 1279 would make three changes in section 16 it would change the definition to include crimes punishable by imprisonment for more than one year rather than using the term felonies the change might at first seem purely grammatical since federal law usually fines felonies as crimes punishable by imprisonment for more than one year see eg 18 usc 3559 there are instances however where federal law uses the term crime of violence to encompass not only federal crimes or state crimes and sometimes crimes under the laws of foreign jurisdictions in such cases the distinction may be technically significant the second change involves including cr imes that risk physical injury rather than those that risk the use of physical fo rce the change would be more inclusive while there may be few instances where the use of physical force does not involve risk of injury to persons or property there are many instances in which physical injury may result from misconduct that does not involve physical force eg crying fire in crowded theater the third change would add drug traffi cking crimes to the definition of crimes of violence more precisely it would dd an offense punishable under subparagraph b or c of the section 401b1 of the controlled substances act 21 usc 841b1a b c those subparagra phs establish the penalties for trafficking in schedule i or ii controlled substances heroin cocaine large amounts of marijuana etc in violation of 21 usc 841a it remains to be seen whether the phrase is intended to include other offenses whose puni shment is determined in some instance by reference to those subparagraphs it is unclear for exampl whether the expanded definition covers violations of 21 u sc 846 any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense including in the appropriate case subparagraphs 841b1a b or c the commission of which

by rule or statute frevid 802 some time ago the supreme court recognized hearsay exception for the out of court statements of witness whom the defendant had cause d to be unavailable the constitution

imprisonment for any term of years or for life if the firearm is machine gun or equipped with silencer 18 usc 924o section 114 would repeal subsection 924o subsection 924o wa s probably considered unnecessary since section 114 would cover conspiracy with the same penalties that apply to the substantivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32946crs27 45 however juvenile who is alleged to have committed an act after his sixteenth birthday which if committed by an adult would be felony offense that has as an element thereof the use attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person of

united states for criminal pros ecution 18 usc 5032violations of subsection 924c and becau subsection 101c of the bill would establish an alternative general conspiracy offense with penalty of imprisonment for not more than 20 years proposed 18 usc 924c1a 371 moreover possession of machine gun or firearm equi pped with silencer in violation of subsection 924c as well as conspiracy to possess by virtue of section 114 would be punishable by imprisonment for not less than 30 years proposed 18 usc 924c1a bii section 209 of s 155 like section 114 of hr 1279 would increase the general mandatory minimum for violations of 18 u sc 924c from five to seven years would treat conspiracy the same as the underlying violations of subsection 924c and would repeal subsection it w ould not however increase the penalty for discharging firearm or that for wounding victim nor would it increase the penalty under the general conspiracy statute to not more than 20 years leaving it instead at not more than five years consequently the impact of re pealing subsectiono would be somewhat different section 115 federal tria l of juveniles as adults under existing law federal prosecution of juvenile for the commission of federal criminal offense is possible under one of three circumstances 1 state court has and is willing to exercise jurisdiction over the juvenile 2 state able and willing to assume juri sdiction has adequate available juvenile programs and services available or 3 there is substantial federal interest in the case and the juvenile is alleged to have committed felonious crime of violence b drug trafficking violation or c one of ries of firearms violations 18 usc 5032 if juvenile is not turned over to state authorities he is subject to federal delinquency proceedings unless he is transferred to district court for trial as an adult pursuant to either discretionary or mandatory transfer id under existing law mandatory transfers are only available for 16 and 17 year old repeat offenders alleged to have committed crime of violence or drug trafficking id45 section 115 would replace the mandatory transfer provisions of 18 usc 5032 with provisions that would allow for pr osecution as an adult at the attorneyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32946crs28 46 for instance section 115 permits discretiona ry prosecution in case involving 18 usc 924b c g h k l m or n while certification is possible in cases involving only 18 usc 924b g or h 47 ie murder manslaughter assault with in tent to commit murder sexual assault robbery carjacking with dangerous weapon extortion arson firearms use firearms possession during and in relation to crime of violence or drug trafficking driveby shooting kidnaping maiming assault resulting in serious bodily injury obstruction of justice or any felony punishable by death life imprisonment or imprisonment for twentyfive years or more proposed 18 usc 5032degenerals discretion would liminate the requirement that the juvenile be repeat offender and would adjust the profile of the crimes that require transfer the attorney general may prosecute as an adult juvenile who is alleged to have committed an act after that juveniles 16th birthday which if committed by an adult would be crime of violence that is felony an offense described in subsection d i j k p q u or x of section 922 relating to unlawful firearms acts or subsection b c g h k l m or n of section 924 relating to firearms penalties section 930 relating to possession of firearms and dangerous weapons in federal facilitiesor section 931 relating to purchase ownership or possession of body armor by violent felons proposed 18 usc 5032 the discretion afforded by section 115 can be triggered by crimes that apparently would not justify certification of federal interest in order to proceed against the juvenile as delinquent46 it would appear therefore that the drafters did not intend to limit the attorney generals exercise of his discretion to cases that he had previously certified to be of substantial federal interest s 155 would revise federa l juvenile more extensively than would hr 1279 it would preserve the mandatory transf er of 18 usc 5032 including its limitation to repeat offenders in subsequent s ubsection however it woul d permit trial of 16 and 17yearolds as adults in the case of more selective collection of violent crimes47 but would authorize transfer back to juvenile proceedings in such cases following hearing governed by the discre tionary transfer cons iderations at which the juvenile would bear the bur den proposed 18 usc 5032d section 116 law enforcem ent publicity campaign section 116 would explicitly authoriz the attorney general to conduct publicity campaign in areas of intense interstate gang

155 has similar provisions sections 117 and 119 illegal aliens in fbi database the federal bureau of investigations national crime information center maintains criminal records database hr 1279 would

havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32946crs29 overstayed their visas been ordered to be removed from the united states or have agreed to leave the united states they would authorize the fbi to include information on violation of the immigration laws within the ncic systems proposed 28 usc 534a4 s 155 has similar provisions section 118 crimes of violence by illegal aliens section 118 would establish an additi onal mandatory minimum sentence of five years 15 years in the case of alien prev iously removed for criminal misconduct or illegal aliens who commit attempt to commit or conspire to commit crime of violence as defined in section 16 or drug trafficking offense as defined in section 924 proposed 18 usc 1131 sentences imposed under the section would be served consecutive to the sentences imposed for the underlying crimes of violence or drug trafficking id again there woul d be some internal overlap within the new section because hr 1279 would encompass dr ug trafficking within its definition of crimes of violence the overlap would be less than complete duplication because the revised definition would covers drug trafficking but not the other violations of the controlled substance controlled substance import and export and the maritime drug enforcement acts that 18 usc 924 sweeps within its definition of drug trafficking s 155 has similar provisions section 120 study of any nexu s between illegal aliens and gangs section 120 would direct the attorney general and the secr etary of homeland security to study and report on the connection between illegal immigration and gang membership and activity s 155 has comparable provisions section 201 high intensity interstate gang activity areas section 201 would authorize the appr opriation of 60 million for each of the next five fiscal years to permit the formation of criminal street gang enforcement teams in high intensity interstate gang activity areas it would authorize the appropriation of 20 million for each of the next five fiscal years to allow the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives batfe to hire agents and inspectors to be assigned to high intensity interstate gang activity areas to ensure improved reporting of gang weapons use and it w ould authorize appropriations of 75 million to employ additional assistant united states attorneys to be assigned to high intensity interstate gang activity areas the high intensity interstate gang activity areas would be designated by the attorney general in consultation with local area officials and the governors of the appropriate states the attorney general s decision would be informed among other things by the level of gang activity and violent crime in particular area the extent to which state and local law enforcement agencies have attempted to address the problem and extent to which federa l assistance would be beneficial the section would command the attorney general to establish an fbi national gang intelligence center to provide clearin ghouse through which federal state andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32946crs30 local law enforcement officials can share gang activity information and analysis he would be directed to establish regional gang activity databases for each of the high intensity interstate gang activity areas section 110 in s 155 is comparable it would authorize appropriations of 50 million for this fiscal year and each of th next four fiscal years to fund criminal street gang enforcement teams althoug h it has specific matches for the batfe or federal prosecutor components of h r 1279 s 155 has
