capabilities 2 definition the term satcom includes satellite communications that are owned and operated by department of defense primarily in the government frequency bands military satellite communications milsatcom and commercial satellite communications used by the department of defense but provided by commercial entities using commercial frequencies the term satcom also includes allied satcom systems and civil satcom systems systems owned by or operated for nondod or intelligence agencies used by department of defense 3 use of satcom systems satcom is critical for all military operations in support of the national military security strategy from humanitarian relief to major theater wars and nuclear conflict military forces are dependent on spacebased communications to provide essential information services in the execution of land sea air and space operations b satcom systems are used primarily for establishing or augmenting telecommunications in areas lacking terrestrial infrastructure and for users requiring beyond lineofsight connectivity other users include those requiring communications links with low probability of intercept and detection and protection from scintillation and jamming mobile users and users requiring secure communications links under us control c satcom resources provide communications transport medium for variety of information services such as voice data video messaging and paging these services use broadcast pointtopoint and conference networks d satcom systems provide communications for variety of missions including command and control assured access for warfighters and other users and survivable communications for the nca strategic and nonstrategic nuclear forces satcom provides unique mobile networking and range extension capabilities for key networks such as the secure internet protocol router network siprnet the nonsecure internet protocol router network niprnet the defense messagingcjcsi 625001a 10 december 2001 a2 enclosure asystem dms the defense information systems network disn the defense red switch network drsn and national missile defense and shared early warning sew information from these networks and others require large amounts of data to be passed via satcom to mobile and deployed users satcom is essential to the intelligence and diplomatic communities to provide uscontrolled transmission means for small subset of communications to support sensitive operations or timecritical diplomatic traffic in support of national security objectives one of the chief advantages of satcom for combatant commands and other users is the ability to network with variety of users over large dispersed geographic areas 4 operational policies dod satcom management satisfies warfighter requirements by establishing the operational policies processes and organizational structures to ensure satcom resources are interoperable synchronized delivered in timely manner and fully integrated with the gigdisn specifically 1 constrained satcom resources must be provided to the highest priority users in prompt and effective manner 2 satcom policies and procedures must be in place to encourage efficient use of communications bandwidth 3 satcom system planning must leverage technological advances and ensure timely replenishment of the system onorbit assets and replacement of constellations in synchronization with user terminal fielding and system control segment development to ensure maximum benefit to the warfighter the combatant commands services and defense agencies must identify current and future satcom requirements ensure they are documented in the satcom data base sdb and incorporate satcom planning into their individual organizational planning systems to ensure future capabilities are synchronized and integrated with other related programs these current and future requirements must be based on valid oplans annex ks conops service doctrine and future architecture and force structure 4 satcom systems supporting joint allied and coalition operations must be interoperable especially between and among cinc and cjtf components and their coalition allies and partnerscjcsi 625001a 10 december 2001 a3 enclosure a5 satcom systems must be fully integrated into the gigdisn architecture 6 satcom systems must be capable of dynamic reconfiguration to meet changing needs as the situation demands users must have the necessary network and resource visibility common tasking procedures and planning tools cincs and the cjtf must have the capability to allocate their apportioned satcom resources in flexible and responsive manner b in summary the primary policy for operational management of satcom resources is to provide the right users satcom access when and where needed in accordance with designated operational priorities the department of defense needs to continually assess satcom system effectiveness in light of these policies enclosure satcom oversight and assessment process discusses the process and structure to oversee effective implementation of these operational policies 5 operational goals central to providing the right users satcom access when and where needed are the processes for submission of user connectivity requirements access to current systems systemofsystems operational management and highlevel oversight each of these processes was developed based upon key operational goals as follows satcom systems must be fully integrated into the gigdisn and should be developed to leverage existing and planned transmission paths in order to achieve this standard satcom operational policy and procedures at systemofsystems level must be implemented b communications planners must have visibility into satcom resources for planning implementing monitoring and sustaining communications support to forces within their aors c communications managers must have more efficient and responsive methods for managing the complexities of multiple satcom payloads operating in many different frequency bands while supporting diverse missions worldwide d new satcom capabilities and technologies must be effectively incorporated into warfighting doctrinecjcsi 625001a 10 december 2001 a4 enclosure aintentionally blankcjcsi 625001a 10 december 2001 b1 enclosure benclosure b satcom

are constrained resources that must be managed according to priorities established by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff therefore the joint staffj6 is responsible for ensuring the effective and efficient apportionment allocation and adjudication of onorbit satellite assets during all phases of conflict from peacetime to war for both dod and nondod users these processes address the needs of the nca combatant commands the national security community services defense agencies dod enterprisewide requirements and allied countries as necessary apportionment 1 apportionment refers to the deliberate and formal assignment of block of satcom resources to cincs and other users who then have the flexibility to allocate this block to subordinate users as required to support their daily operations 2 under the deliberate planning process the joint strategic capabilities plan jscp identifies satcom resources on global and theater basis to support cinc oplan development and evaluation however the actual apportionment of satcom capacity will be based on the current operational situation threat conditions and operational requirements 3 periodic apportionment plans will be published by the joint staffj6 to inform combatant commands and other users of the apportioned level of support during current and anticipated operations contingency and wartime allocation plans are developed by the combatant commands with support from the joint staffj6 disa and usspacecom to provide the greatest level of support possible for scenarios defined by oplans and other highlevel planning documents 4 apportionment plans are used for planning purposes and are subject to change based on realworld events although periodic apportionments provide macro level of anticipated support the dynamics of the current operational situation may require immediate reassignment of satcom resources as priorities dictate 5 combatant command or other user requiring support exceeding its apportionment should contact the joint staffj6z jointcjcsi 625001a 10 december 2001 d2 enclosure dcommunications satellite center jcsc via its chain of command the jcsc will determine reapportionment given the needs of the user the combatant command recommendation and the priorities of the world situation as dictated by the joint staffj3 b allocation 1 allocation refers to the realtime assignment of specific frequencies bandwidth power channels or other resource elements to satisfy specific validated requirement this allocation can be made from resources assigned to the combatant command or other users in the apportionment plan 2 in the case of unapportioned resources ie defense satellite communications system dscs allocation is performed by designated satcom support center responsible for assigning those resources in accordance with the approved sdb priority as identified in the appendix to this enclosure and in concert with the joint staffj6z disa and usspacecom will assist in the development of more detailed procedures for planning and implementation of the allocation process including procedures to rapidly respond to apportionment changes c adjudication 1 adjudication refers to the apportionment decision made between two or more users contending for the same resources 2 all requests for adjudication of apportioned or allocated resources will be made to the joint staffj6 via the jcsc who will staff the issue on behalf of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 3 the chairman will adjudicate apportionment and allocation issues for dod users the joint staff will forward nondod user adjudication issues to asdc3i for processing all adjudication actions must be coordinated with the joint staffj3 to ensure appropriate impact assessments are completed prior to final decision the joint staffj6z will forward adjudication results to the appropriate combatant commands usspacecom disa and users 2 user requirement categories current access requirements are grouped into the following two categoriescjcsi 625001a 10 december 2001 d3 enclosure d1 core warfighting requirements which support execution of unified commanders mission 2 national security enterprisewide requirements which support broad multiple user requirements eg gigdisn or nondod national securityrelated requirements eg presidential travel department of state negotiating efforts as well as service and defense agency nontactical requirements b apportionment between the two categories is scenario dependent but should remain relatively constant during peacetime the relative apportionment between core warfighting requirements and enterprise wide requirements may change over time because of greater leverage of the gigdisn or greater numbers of terminals available to deployed users consequently joint staffj6 will monitor the relative apportionment of core warfighting and enterprisewide requirements on continuing basis and discuss significant trends with disa and usspacecom deliberate decisionmaking processes must be developed to ensure the appropriate level of support is realized for both core warfighting and enterprisewide requirements 3 visibility visibility into the use of satcom resources in each theater is critical to the joint staff combatant commands usspacecom and disa to ensure effective and efficient use of constrained resources disa will maintain compilation of all commercial satcom systems supporting the department of defense with access to the information protected by appropriate security classification levels and restricted to those organizations with need to know for instance the joint staff and combatant commands must have knowledge of those commercial satcom resources in each geographic cincs aooaor regardless of type of service b all commercial satcom lease arrangements must be reported to disa upon initialization annually thereafter and upon termination disa will issue specific reporting procedures after
