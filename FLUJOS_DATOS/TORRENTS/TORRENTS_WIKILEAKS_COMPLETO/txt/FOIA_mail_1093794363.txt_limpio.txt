from martin munro mmunroltrrarizonaedu to itrdbforlistservarizonaedu subject calibration loose ends was re itrdbfor crossdating date sun 29 aug 2004 114603 0700 replyto grissinoutkuxutccutkedu this an attempt to tie up the loose ends from an earlier part of the discussion the idea that calibration of the radiocarbon timescale be considered invalid pending better understanding of crossdating some of the previous posts seem to imply that measurements of the c14 halflife depend on the calibration in fact it can be determined by presentday laboratory measurements without reference to any old material simply by observing the decay rate in known quantity of the isotope physicists seem happy that beta decay isnt affected by mundane external influences so the half life should be constant if the amount of c14 in sample depends only on its age and the constant half life calibration curve from collection of samples of known true age would be diagonal straight line but this would imply that each sample started with the same concentration of c14 there are many effects that could change this concentration through time variations in cosmic ray sources changing solar activity changes in the upper atmosphere atmospheric circulation uptake and release of carbon from large sinks and sources etc given enough correctly dated samples you can recover the sum of these variations from the form of the calibration curve in practice the most important variation appear to be on multimillennial scales with smaller fluctuations wiggles on centurymultidecadal scales superimposed on this wood from crossdated tree rings provided the knownage reference material used in the calibration curves and there were two main phases of work the first of which roughed out the general form of the curve and hinted at the shortperiod structure the second of which reconstructed the centuryscale variations in detail using higher precision measurements contamination of old samples with c14 of more recent origin is widely recognized problem addressed by physical and chemical pretreatment protocols for the material couple of complicating effects that are of more interest from tree physiological point of view isotopic fractionation occurs along the entire chain of processes between carbon in the environment and its incorporation in the specific components of the wood that end up in the calibration samples ring forming in particular year might continue to accumulate c14 in subsequent years but people who work with c14 are well aware of various corrections for isotopic fractionation and the migration of carbon across ring boundaries has been the subject of several empirical investigations notably using the stepwise change in c14 concentrations following atmospheric nuclear tests in the 1950s and 60s as tracer the more recent phase of calibration work was substantially complete around 15 years ago and was covered in an extensive series of journal articles and symposia lets suppose we have been provided with demonstration that crossdating is invalid what would be the consequences for c14 calibration one of the most alarming would be that we would have to come up with convincing explanation of how independent tree ring chronologies could be in error in precisely the same waythe knownage reference samples are not just from bristlecone pines and crossdating within the network of oak chronologies is completely independent of the bristlecones both are completely selfsupporting chains of inferences anchored in living trees and extending back into subfossil wood there are published comparisons of paired calibration curves with the absolute dates and c14 concentrations based on oaks in one case and on bristlecones in the other my understanding of tree physiology is rudimentary at best but surely when two such vastly different wood anatomies are involved there must be differences in the physiological constraints on wood formation if potentially unidentified missing rings are supposed to be the most serious problem with the bristlecone chronologies the oak chronologies should not be affected in any case since they almost never include missing rings in this sense although thats not to say they have anatomical ambiguities that can confound crossdating the crossdating error could not be merely shared systematic bias not only does the long term trend in the calibration curves derived from the two chronologies share common nonlinear trend but the shortterm fluctuations in c14 concentration wiggles match between the two curves there are small differences between calibrations derived from different geographical regions but these have themselves formed the basis for further research and geophysical modeling the strengths of the two sets of chronologies are complimentary oaks may have almost missing rings sensu stricto and provide larger volumes of wood for c14 analysis but the individual samples are only few hundred years long showing significant variations in growth with increasing pith age and particularly in the case of the subfossil wood there will be uncertainties about the environment in which the tree was growing bristlecone pines give much better chance of finding wood that has grown over periods of many centuries with marked agerelated trends and theres compelling continuity between the living trees and the remnant wood lying on the ground nearby an account of wood formation from physiological perspective would undoubtedly be beautiful thing in its own right even if it had little to contribute to dendrochronology moreover one of my pet peeves is seeing people manipulate data as mere collections of numbers divorced from any underlying modeland in the case of dendrochronolgy the model has to be biological but id number myself amongst those who cant see why our use of crossdating must await reasonably complete physiological model of wood formation by analogy if the doctors in some traditional society are using human physiology based on the balance or imbalance of the four humours but they have treatment for particular disease that results in an 80 survival rate as opposed to 40 survival rate if it goes untreated youre obviously better off slurping down their bitter potion first and working out the explanation in current western physiological terms afterwards if thats the only treatment option so even if at present our understanding of crossdating is largely limited to statistical phenomenology that may be good enough to live with until something better comes along thats not to imply that we should be credulous and automatically accept current practices simply because great authorities have taken the same route astronomers were at one time expected to work as astrological consultants casting horoscopes for rulers and interpreting signs in the sky in terms of current political affairs theres necessary reason to follow douglass crossdating methods any more than we should follow keplers example of casting horoscopesunless they work although the seeming effectiveness of crossdating could in principle be invalid it has been applied so widely that we would need presented with very strong critique before abandoning it im not really qualified to discuss crossdating and c14 calibration from point of view of someone active in current research but was fortunate to be sitting on the sidelines of the oak calibration work in the 80s and just the other day tom harlan dropped by with the oldest known absolutely dated bristlecone sample so will offer this as kind of correction by proxy until any of the people whove done the real work care to comment martin
