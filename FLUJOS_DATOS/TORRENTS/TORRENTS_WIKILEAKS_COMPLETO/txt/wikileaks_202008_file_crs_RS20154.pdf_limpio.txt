and macedonia lived in private homes nato and officials feared that some 6000 00 kosovars were without food and shelter or humanitarian aid in kosovo when hostilities ended but conditions in kosov were not as bad as expected the first activities of the humanitarian agencies were to rush food medical supplies and shelt er materials into kosovo and reopen the international aid offices mines and

briefly recapitulating the refugee admissions effort it was coordinated by us government officials with the assistance of the unhcr iom and other us nongovernmental organizations initially the administration had hoped to fully proces s all the refugees in macedonia for admission to the united states and place the m immediately with their relatives upon their entry here however in response to n extraordinary influx of refugees into macedonia 19500 in 3 days the secretary of state announced on april 30 1999 that the refugee admissions program would have two components the first was an emergency component in response to the refuge emergency in macedonia and the second was normal refugee processing as originall planned the emergency program was intended to move refugees out of macedonia s quickly as possible after preliminary review they were flown to fort dix nj for the completion of refuge processing including further medical and security screening even before the signing of the peace agreement this segment of t he refugee admissions program was being phased out the kosovar albanians coming here w ere determined to be refugees under the ina and to be otherwise admissible on medical and other grounds in conformance wit h internat ional law the ina defines refugee as person who is fleeing because f persecution or wellfounded fear of persec ution on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion 101a42 the annual refugee admission numbers and their allocation among refugee groups are determined at the start of each fiscal year by the president after consultation with the congress ina 207 the ina also includes provision for refugee eme rgencies that has been used only three times since the refugee provisions were adopted in 1 980 if the president determines after appropriate consultation with congress that an unforeseen emergency refuge situation exists and that the admission of the refugees is justified by grave humanitaria n concerns or is otherwise in the national interest he may specify an additional number of refugees to be admitted during the succeeding 12month period the administratio
