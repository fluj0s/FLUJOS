fy2005 budget summary the administration presented its proposed budget for fy2005 to congress on february 2 2004 requesting 315 billion for the department of housing and urban development hud an increase of about 1 above the 312 billion enacted for fy2004 on november 20 2004 the house and senate passed the consolidated appropriations act 2005 hrept 108792 hr 4818 that provided hud with 320 billion 838 million or 27 above the fy2004 enacted level the president signed the omnibus bill on december 8 2004 as pl108447 figures in this report do not include an acrosstheboard cut of 080 that will reduce hud appropriations by approximately 256 million with this reduction the increase from fy2004 to fy2005 would be about 582 million or 19 huds largest program the housing certificate fund contains the section 8 rental voucher program central to the administrations proposed fy2005 budget was controversial initiative the flexible voucher program fvp that would have significantly revised the section 8 voucher program public housing authorities phas would longer be reimbursed based on their number and cost of inuse vouchers but would be given lump sum of money block grant to assist any households with incomes up to 80 of the local area median lowincome housing advocates contended that this change and the level of proposed funding could require phas either to reduce the number of families assisted increase the average rent that voucher holders pay or shift assistance away from the poorest of the poor hud countered that the fvp proposal would provide an incentive for phas to control the rapidly rising costs of housing vouchers and phas that are good managers would be rewarded with performancebased incentives the administration requested almost 1 billion less for the fvp than provided in the previous year for vouchers congress did not adopt the fvp but continued with dollarbased funding practice first adopted in fy2004 that provides some constraint on spending however the final funding law provided 16 billion more for section 8 than the requested level to pay for this significant increase all other hud programs were reduced below their fy2004 appropriation levels for example community development block grants down 225 million home down 91 million housing for the elderly down 27 million homeless assistance grants down 9 million and housing opportunities for persons with aids down 11 million while the administration proposed funding for the hope vi public housing rehabilitation program pl 108447 appropriated 144 million 5 million less than for fy2004 the conferees provided 50 million for the administrations downpayment assistance initiative setaside within the home program which helps lower income families buy first home considerably less than the 200

hud an increase of 317 million compared to the 312 billion enacted for fy2004 introduction to the department of housing and urban development hud most of the appropriations for the department of housing and urban development hud are designed to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes for example the typical recipient of housing voucher has an income of about 12000 or other special housing needs these include programs of rental assistance for the poor elderly or disabled housing assistance for persons with aids and shelter for those who are homeless the two large hud block grant programs home and community development block grants also help communities finance variety of activities to address housing needs of disadvantaged populations in recent years hud has focused more attention on efforts to increase the homeownership rates for lowerincome and minority households at the end of crs2 the third quarter of 2004 the national homeownership rate stood at 690 while the rates for white black and hispanic households stood at 761 484 and 487 respectively huds federal housing administration fha insures mortgages made by lenders to lower income homebuyers

reduction in most discretionary accounts as called for in pl 108447 fy2004 appropriations the consolidated appropriations act pl 108199 that was signed into law by the president on january 23 2004 provided hud with 312 billion an increase of 192 million or 06 above fy2003 funding the housing certificate fund received nearly 193 billion substantial increase over fy2003 appropriations of crs3 173 billion the hope vi program was funded at 149 million sharp reduction from 570 million in fy2003 for more information see crs report rl31804 appropriations for fy2004 va hud and independent agencies fy2005 budget issues in brief budget level the administration proposed hud budget for fy2005 of 315 billion an increase of about 317 million or about 1 above the fy2004 enacted budget of 312 billion this follows an increase of about 192 million or 06 from fy2003 to fy2004 affordable housing advocates who argue for larger increases in the hud budget point to the 2004 report the state of the nations housing by harvard universitys joint center for housing studies which found that although the overwhelming majority of americans are well housed nearly third of all households spend 30 or more of their income on housing and 13 spend 50 or more in addition to widespread affordability problems crowding is on the increase some 2535 million people are homeless at some point in given year and nearly 2 million households still live in severely inadequate units hud deputy secretary roy bernardi acknowledged in recent interview that there is not enough money right now in the country to provide housing for all the people who need it but he cited current budget constraints caused by the demands of homeland security combating terrorism and national defense1 section 8 vouchers huds fy2005 budget proposed to eliminate the section 8 voucher program and replace it with new grant program called the flexible voucher program fvp the funding requested for this new program was about 1 billion less than the voucher program received last year and it was estimated to be more than 1 billion less than what would be needed to maintain the voucher program at its current level if the fvp proposal was not adopted2 according to hud the fvp proposal would provide an incentive for public housing authorities phas to control the rapidly rising costs of housing vouchers under fvp phas would receive fixed budget and would be subject to fewer regulations compared to the current program under which phas are reimbursed based on their estimated costs and are subject to number of federal rules and regulations low income housing advocates contend that this change could require phas to either reduce the number of families assisted increase the average rent that voucher holders pay or shift assistance away from the poorest of the poor similar initiative was rejected by congress in fy2004 neither hr 5041 s 2825 nor the final consolidated appropriations act pl108447 adopts the fvp proposal and all three increase funding for the section 8 program above the fy2004 level hope vi funding was proposed for hope vi public housing rehabilitation program that received 150 million in fy2004 the administration points to more than 2 billion of unspent funds in the pipeline that will keep the program going for years advocates for the program including many members of 1 interview with roy bernardi the poststandard syracuse ny june 20 2004 2 see barbara sard and will fischer administration seeks deep cuts in housing vouchers and conversion of program to block grant center on budget and policy priorities may 24 2004 crs4 congress contend that the program has been successful in replacing some of the most dilapidated housing projects with new mixedincome housing and that it needs to be continued the house recommended 143 million the senate recommended 150 million and the final consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 provides 144 million for hope vi in fy2005 homeownership initiatives the administrations downpayment assistance initiative program provides grants to participating jurisdictions to provide help to lowerincome families to purchase home the program received an 87 million setaside within the home program for fy2004 and the administrations fy2005 budget requested 200 million the conferees agreed to 50 million for fy2005 with the funds to remain available until september 30 2007 the house appropriations committee had recommended 85 million while the senate committee recommended 50 million the senate committee report s rept108 353 noted government accountability office gao review that found very slow 10 spendout rate for this program during fy2003 and 2004 second administration homeownership initiative the zero downpayment program hr 3755 was proposed to help an estimated 150000 firsttime homebuyers annually purchase with money down and finance all settlement costs on june 3 2004 the house financial services committee passed an amended hr 3755 the administration says that homeownership for lowerincome and minority families helps create stable living environment for children and allows these families to accumulate wealth critics contend that the administrations focus on homeownership is unbalanced and political that too many lowerincome families are being enticed to purchase home with little or savings or financial knowledge about budgets or home repair contracts and that they are especially vulnerable to layoffs and variety of financial and mortgage and housingrelated scams they point to very high fha mortgage delinquency rates currently above 12 while the administrations fy2005 budget projected cost for the zero downpayment program assuming higher insurance premiums would cover costs on june 21 2004 the congressional budget office cbo issued cost estimate of 562 million over the 20062009 period cbo estimates that defaults for the new program would average about 1 each year and that the cumulative default rate over 30year period would exceed 30 neither the house nor senate appropriations committees nor the conferees included funding for the zero downpayment proposal for fy2005 the samaritan and faithbased prisoner reentry initiatives the administrations fy2005 budget included 50 million for the samaritan initiative to address the presidents goal of ending chronic homelessness the goal of the new program would be to provide new housing options and aggressive outreach and services to homeless people the 25 million faithbased prisoner reentry program was also proposed in the presidents budget and would be an effort with the labor and justice departments to help 600000 people who leave prison each year make the transition to society these initiatives were not funded for fy2005 in either the

fy2005 16 billion request hr 5041 pl 108447 28 billion s 2825 crs8 highlights funding level the presidents fy2005 request for the housing certificate fund represented 790 million cut from the fy2004 program level the voucher program faced the largest cut over 1 billion from last years level the projectbased section 8 program would have received modest increase in funding the voucher program has experienced rapid cost increases over the past several years due to among other factors increasing housing costs increasing utilization rates congresss authorization of additional vouchers and programmatic and policy changes designed to increase utilization and deconcentrate poverty the fy2005 proposed budget cut coincides with the presidents initiative to reform the voucher program by converting it into new grant program called the flexible voucher program described below the house appropriations committee would have funded the combined section 8 program at almost 700 million above last years level and 16 billion above the presidents requested level the report language specified that the amount provided in the bill for the voucher program would be the total funding available and that the secretary would be prohibited from augmenting the program budget with funds from other sources the senate bill would have provided almost 2 billion more than the presidents requested level and given the secretary the discretion to use recaptured funds to augment the program if necessary the enacted funding bill pl 108447 provides over 20 billion to the program almost 18 billion more than the president requested budgetbased funding and splitting the hcf the change from unit based funding to dollarbased funding began in the fy2004 appropriations law and has caused some controversy among pha groups and lowincome housing advocates prior to fy2004 phas received budget based on fixed number of vouchers and they were funded based on the actual cost of those vouchers unit based funding in fy2004 agencies received budget based on fixed number of vouchers and fixed cost for those vouchers as spelled out in the appropriations law dollarbased or budgetbased funding voucher costs were fixed for fy2004 at the august 1 2003 level plus an adjustment for inflation for some agencies whose costs had increased significantly over the previous year this budget change provided them with less funding than they actually needed to maintain their programs at their previous levels as result many agencies had to make costsaving adjustments in their programs such as not reissuing vouchers when families leave the program andor cutting the rent paid to landlords the house bill directed the secretary to continue the practice of dollarbased funding for phas in fy2005 but unlike fy2004 the bill did not spell out formula for distributing the funds the house appropriations committee bill also proposed to split the housing certificate fund into two accounts tenantbased rental assistance and projectbased rental assistance s 2825 also proposed to continue the practice of budgetbased funding in the voucher program the bill directed the secretary to fund phas based on fixed cost which would be established using phas costs as reported on their most recent end of the year financial statements adjusted for any additional information submitted by the phas as of october 1 2004 plus an inflation factor the senate bills crs9 proposed inflation factor was more broadly defined than the one adopted in fy2004 the senate bill did not propose to split the hcf into two accounts the final fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 also continues the procedure of budgetbased funding of phas in the bill the secretary of hud is directed to fund phas based on their voucher costs and utilization rates as of mayjuly 2004 plus the hud published annual adjustment factor aaf if an agencys mayjuly data is not available hud is directed to fund phas based on februaryapril 2004 data or if that is not available the agencys most recently submitted yearend financial statement as of march 31 2004 according to the conference report hrept 108792 phas are expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for fy2005 regardless of their actual costs the act also states that hud shall provide agencies with flexibility to adjust payment standards and portability policies as necessary to manage within their 2005 budgets hud is directed to publish guidance implementing the new funding law within 30 days of its passage and notify phas of their budget levels within 45 days of passage like the house bill pl 108447 splits the hcf into two accounts the conference report states that the reason for the split is to provide better transparency and oversight of expenditures within the accounts housing certificate fund rescission each year portion of the cost of the housing certificate fund is offset by recapture of unobligated balances from previous years for fy2004 the presidents budget indicated that just under 14 billion would be available in such balances for rescission however congress rescinded double that amount in fy2004 over 28 billion the additional funds were estimated to be available as the result of savings from onetime accounting change enacted in the program in fy2005 the presidents budget indicated that over 15 billion would be available for rescission from prior years unobligated balances the house appropriations committee bill would have rescinded that amount s 2825 proposed to rescind over 25 billion and directed the comptroller general to audit and certify all funds available for rescission within the account the senate bill further directed that if sufficient funds to meet the rescission are not available within the hcf account the difference must be met through proportional rescission taken from each discretionary account funded in the va hud and independent agencies appropriations bill with the exception of the medical services account in va the consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 rescinds the amount proposed by the administration the flexible voucher program the presidents flexible voucher program fvp would amend statute to convert the existing voucher program into dollarbased formula grant the phas that administer the current voucher program receive from hud fixed number of vouchers that they can distribute to lowincome families under the fvp proposal phas would instead receive fixed number of dollars which they could use to serve as many families as they choose the proposal would make other significant changes to the program which are illustrated in the table below crs10 table 4 comparison of fvp proposal to existing program housing choice voucher program fvp proposal eligibility families are generally eligible if their families would be eligible if their gross adjusted gross incomes are 50 or incomes were 80 or below area below area median income 75 of all median income the fvp would have vouchers must be targeted to households targeting requirements income with adjusted gross incomes at 30 or would be reexamined every other year below area median income income and every three years for elderly or must be reexamined annually disabled households subsidy voucher is worth roughly the phas could provide whatever subsidy level difference between 90110 of the fair level they chose if the pha provided market rent minus 30 of households downpayment assistance the maximum adjusted gross income in fy2004 grant would be 10000 cbo estimates that the average voucher is worth 6483 per year housing units must be inspected prior to units would be required to be inspected quality familys occupancy to ensure that they within 60 days of familys occupancy standards meet federal hqs standards or if the to ensure that they meet the local state pha chooses state or local hqs or federal hqs standards as chosen by standards if they are stricter each unit the pha onequarter of all units under under contract must be reinspected contract with the pha would be annually required to be reinspected annually source prepared by the congressional research service the fvp proposal could help increase administrative flexibility for phas as well as contain the rapidly growing costs of the current voucher program pha groups and lowincome housing advocates have expressed concerns that adopting block grant funding structure could lead to large funding cuts for lowincome housing assistance in the future they are also concerned that this proposal with its accompanying funding cut could drastically change the character of the current program by forcing phas to choose between serving higherincome families forcing families to pay more for their housing or serving fewer families hud officials stated during hearing before the va hud and independent agencies appropriations subcommittee on march 4 2004 that they did not intend to introduce legislation to enact the fvp proposal rather they hoped that the appropriations committees would include the proposal in the fy2005 appropriations bill the house financial services committee in their views and estimates of the presidents fy2005 budget included position that was critical of the presidents fvp proposal the chairman of the senate va hud and independent agencies appropriations subcommittee stated in hearing on april 1 2004 that the flexible voucher proposal is poor substitute for flaws in the program and that the committee would not have the luxury of time to consider fully the proposal this year3 similar voucher reform initiative was proposed by the administration for fy2004 however congressional action was taken on the proposal 3 statement of senator kit bond va hud appropriations subcommittee fy2005 budget hearing apr 1 2004 crs11 the house appropriations committee bill did not adopt the fvp proposal and instead continued to fund the existing section 8 program in rejecting the fvp proposal the report language accompanying the bill stated the committee has taken this action without prejudice toward the merits of the individual proposal but strictly because such changes fall outside the committees jurisdiction however the committee strongly urges the authorization committees to take the actions necessary to reform the program the committee is concerned that absent such reform the viability of all hud programs including the section 8 program will be compromised the senate appropriations committee bill also did not adopt the fvp proposal the committee report expressed skepticism about the administrations proposal finally the committee does not agree with the administrations belief that the section 8 program is so flawed that it cannot be corrected without conversion of the program into block grant to the states or to public housing agencies without commitment of adequate funding the block grant approach will result in shrinking commitment to housing

may be necessary for section 23 lease adjustments crs13 highlights voluntary graduation bonuses this new administration proposal would provide bonus funds to phas who exceed baseline number of families who have exited public and assisted housing the stated goal is to move program participants away from dependency on public housing assistance programs the house appropriations committee did not adopt the presidents voluntary graduation bonus proposed setaside instead the committee in their report strongly encourages the authorization committee of jurisdiction to examine this proposal the senate appropriations committee bill proposed to set aside the full 15 million requested by the president for bonuses to be given by hud to phas that assist program participants in moving away from dependence on housing assistance programs pl 108447 sets aside 10 million for program to provide bonus funding for phas that assist families moving away from dependency on housing assistance programs the conferees state that they expect hud to allocate the funds through notice of funding availability nofa that provides clear eligibility criteria for the program freedom to house demonstration this demonstration according to the administration would test reforms that would allow phas to operate on an asset based model which they contend is more in line with market realities an experimental group of phas would be granted full fungibility between their operating and capital funds as well as the flexibility to test local rentsetting policies their reporting requirements would be streamlined and they would be required to operate under an assetbased management and accounting system the financial and physical outcomes of these experimental phas would be compared to similar phas who are not participating in the demonstration neither the house senate nor final versions of the fy2005 hud funding bill included the freedom to house demonstration accounting change in the operating fund the senate appropriations committee bill proposed providing almost 1 billion less than the president requested for the public housing operating fund however the report accompanying s 2825 srept 108353 directs the secretary to convert all phas administering public housing to single fiscal year start date according to the committee report this accounting maneuver adopted in fy2004 in the housing certificate fund would reduce the amount needed to fund the operating fund in fy2005 by over 1 billion the committee also set aside 30 million within the operating fund to be used to help phas transition to the new accounting system pl 108447 adopted the senates proposed accounting change and therefore realized the same savings however the final bill does not provide transition funds for phas hope vi funding fy2005 is the second year that the administration has proposed zerofunding level for the hope vi program for revitalizing public crs14 housing in fy2004 congress responded to the presidents request by funding the program at 149 million which was down from the over 570 million provided in fy2003 hud has stated in testimony before congress that the hope vi program has largely met its goal of eliminating the worst public housing in the nation furthermore they argue that the program is flawed because it has been plagued by slow development and high perunit costs in its place the administration has proposed that 30 million be provided within the capital fund for public housing demolition purposes the hope vi program has been popular with many members of congress for example the chairman of the senate appropriations committee vahud subcommittee stated at hearing on april 1 2004 that he continues to be troubled by the departments decision to eliminate all funding for the public housing hope vi program it largely has worked well and deserves to be funded or replaced with program that is better equipped to address the remaining stock of distressed public housing4 the house appropriations committee bill would have provided funding for hope vi at 143 million the senate committee bill proposed to fund the program at 150 million the final funding act pl

community development block grants cdbg to states and entitlement communities for the formula portion of the program which allocates grants to states and entitlement communities the house bill hr 5041 provided 26 million less than requested by the administration however the house bill provided 93 million more in total appropriations for community development fund programs cdbg and related setasides and earmarks than requested by the administration the senate measure s 2825 recommended 45477 billion for the formula portion of the cdbg program this is 2238 million more than requested by the administration overall the senate bill recommended an appropriation of 495 billion for cdf activities this is 3319 million more than requested by the administration with the majority of the funds allocated to the formula portion of the cdbg program the final consolidated appropriations measure hr 4818 which was signed by the president on december 8 2004 as pl 108447 provided 4709 billion for the community development fund this includes 4150 billion for the formula portion of the community development block grant cdbg program and 559 million in cdbgrelated setasides new entitlement communities the addition of 71 new cdbg entitlement communities in fy2004 coupled with the administrations budget request of 4618 billion for fy2005 down 2 then the fy2004 appropriation may result in reduction in the fy2005 allocation of individual entitlement communities and states on average entitlement communities and states experienced 4 reduction in cdbg funding from fy2003 to fy2004 due in part to an increase in the number of cdbg entitlement communities coupled with slight decrease in total cdbg funding from 43395 million to 43308 million in fy2004 although entitlement communities experienced reduction in funding state administered programs were the most significantly impacted by the 6 increase in the number of entitlement communities with alaska and nevada stateadministered cdbg programs experiencing funding reductions of 148 and 133 respectively crs20 the fy2005 appropriations of 4150 billion for cdbg entitlement communities and states will also result in small reduction of approximately 4 in the formula allocation to some states and entitlement communities the amount of reduction will depend on such factors as the number of new entitlement communities and changes in community or states formula factors including population poverty age of the housing stock and overcrowded housing conditions earmarks and setasides in addition to cdbg formula grants number of categorical programs are also funded in support of cdbg activities under the heading community development fund these include competitive grant programs such as youthbuild and the administrations proposed 5 million faithbased initiative setasides for insular areas and college and university partnerships and earmarks such as the economic development initiative edi and neighborhood initiative programs although the administration supports number of these categorical programs it has consistently opposed the earmarking of edi and funding the administrations fy2005 budget request included funding for edi and projects which is consistent with administration budget recommendations in previous years despite bush administration objections that these programs are noncompetitive and siphon funds from cdbg and other programs congress has traditionally provided funding for edi and designated projects in fy2004 congress awarded over 280 million to more than 900 congressionally designated edi projects it also provided 43 million for projects for fy2005 pl 108 447 includes 559 million in funding for various cdf setasides because of competing budget demands and desire to constrain spending neither the house or senate appropriations committee versions of the vahud independent agencies appropriation act for fy2005 or pl 108447 provided funding for two cdbgrelated initiatives proposed by the administration 5 million faithbased pilot program and 10 million community challenge grant further hr 5041 proposed reduction of 223 million in total funding for cdbg and related activities although much of the proposed reduction in funds would have been targeted to two earmarked funding accounts namely the economic development initiative and the neighborhood initiative the formula portion of the program would have also been reduced below the programs fy2004 appropriation level entitlement communities would have received 23 million less than the amount appropriated for fy2004 and the formula allocation to states and communities would have been reduced by almost 10 below the fy2004 appropriation level the senate appropriations committees bill s 2825 srept 108353 would have increased the cdbg formula program by 2169 million above the amount made available for fy2004 total funding for cdf programs under the senate bill would have increased by only 1627 million this is because the increase in funding for the cdbg formulabased program would have been offset by 2006 million decrease in funding for cdbgrelated setaside and earmark programs and activities the final version of the va hud and independent agencies appropriations act for fy2005 as incorporated in pl 108447 includes 44 million less in earmarks and setasides than the 603 million appropriated for such activities in fy2004 the edi program funding which earmarks funds for specific projects was reduced by 17 million to 262 million but the number of total edi projects crs21 increased to 1032 compared to more than 900 approved in fy2004 the program which earmarks funds to community development corporations also experienced small reduction in funding of approximately 17 million the act also shifts 7 million for insular areas previously included as setaside to the formula portion of the program and does not include 10 million in funding for an alaskan museum that was included in the fy2004 appropriations the act does include 31 million for the hudson river trail park and trust located in new york city but funding for this specific earmark activity is included as sec 424 of the

account under the housing programs section of the hud budget new initiatives were proposed for the home program congressional response the house appropriations committee recommended 85 million for the american dream downpayment initiative considerably less than the 200 million requested the committee noted that this reduction is taken without prejudice and is due to other significant funding pressures in this bill the senate appropriations committee recommended only 50 million for this initiative it noted its concern that the program may be helping families with excessive credit risk and who may not be the best candidates for homeownership the committee requested that by july 31 2005 hud submit report on default activity under the program the committee further noted recent gao review of the program which suggests that hud would be unlikely to be able crs23 to obligate more than 40 to 50 million for the initiative during fy2005 the conferees agreed to provide 50 million for the program the house and senate committees did not recommend creating separate account for housing counseling on another matter the house committee expressed its concern that recent changes to metropolitan statistical area msa boundaries could significantly lower area median incomes ami in some communities with high housing costs making ineligible many families and individuals who are

against loss from loan defaults by borrowers through fha insurance lenders make loans that otherwise may not be available and enable borrowers to obtain loans for home purchase and home improvement as well as for the purchase repair or construction of apartments hospitals and nursing homes the programs are administered through two program accounts the mutual mortgage insurancecooperative management housing insurance fund account mmi and the general insurancespecial risk insurance fund account gisri the mmi fund provides insurance for home mortgages the crs26 gisri fund provides insurance for more risky home mortgages for multifamily rental housing and for an assortment of special purpose loans such as hospitals and nursing homes as shown in table 16 below fha has negative appropriations which means that the income to the program from insurance premiums exceeds the program expenses this suggests that in fy2004 the fha program contributed about 2479 billion to the total hud budget another way to look at it is that because of the surplus generated by fha hud needed 2479 billion less in appropriations in fy2004 as requested the house and senate appropriations committees recommend an overall mortgage insurance commitment limitation of 220 billion in loan commitments the total includes 185 billion under the mmicmhi fund and 35 billion under the gisri fund direct loan limitation of 50 million is recommended for both the mmicmhi and gisri funds direct loans facilitate the purchase of hudowned properties acquired for resale to low and moderateincome families rescission of 30 million is proposed from the unobligated balance of credit subsidy funding appropriated in prior years for the gisri account for more information on fha loan insurance programs see crs report rs20530

budget proposed new fha payment incentives mortgage program or subprime loan product which would permit prospective homebuyers to qualify for fha insurance even though the borrowers would not meet existing underwriting crs27 standards due to poor credit ratings the borrowers would still be required to meet the fha standards regarding debt income and repayment ability the increased risk of default associated with these borrowers would be offset by requiring larger downpayments higher upfront insurance premiums and higher annual insurance premiums after 60 months the annual premiums would be reduced to 05 of the loan balance as would ordinarily be charged for fhainsured home loans the budget also proposed new zero downpayment initiative hr 3755 under which firsttime homebuyers would be able to purchase home with zero downpayment loans and finance the settlement costs such borrowers would also be charged higher insurance premiums to cover the increased risk involved in such loans the administration further would amend section 203c of the national housing act to restrict the payments of refunds of unearned upfront insurance premiums to borrowers who refinance with new fha loan current law provides that borrowers who prepay their loans may be due refund of the prepaid insurance which was not earned by fha under the proposal borrowers who refinance their fha loans with new fha loans would be eligible for refunds of unearned premiums but borrowers who obtain nonfha loans to refinance their fha loans would not be eligible for refunds of unearned premiums under present rules fha considers the upfront insurance premium as earned by fha when the loan has been outstanding for five years after that period none of the prepaid insurance is refundable the administration plans to shorten the period and provide that the insurance is considered as earned by fha when the loan has been outstanding for three years this would be an administrative change congressional response neither the house or senate committee included funding for the proposed zero downpayment initiative the senate committee believes the proposal would pose substantial financial risk by making homeowners of highrisk borrowers with stake in their houses and financial cushion to pay for unexpected repairs pl 108447 amends section 203c of the national housing act to provide that refunds of unearned insurance premiums would only be due to those borrowers who refinance their fhainsured home loans with new fhainsured loans office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo within hud
