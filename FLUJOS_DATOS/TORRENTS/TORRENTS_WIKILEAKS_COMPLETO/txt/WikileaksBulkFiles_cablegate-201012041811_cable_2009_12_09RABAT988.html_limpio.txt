classified by dcm robert p jackson for reasons 14b and d 1 s summary in separate meetings on december 16 with the moroccan foreign minister taieb fassi fihri and xxxxxxxxxxxx the mission learned that the health of wounded guinean junta leader captain moussa dadis camara has improved and that his release from the hospital may be imminent fassi fihri told the ambassador that the gom would keep dadis camara in morocco until the end of the month while xxxxxxxxxxxx outlined some of the reasons dadis should not resume role in guinean politics both described ethnic politics in guinea and the need for free and fair elections fassi fihri noted as well that elections would not solve the problems because the army is so factionalized and ethnic conflict in guinean society is so prevalent end summary 2 s in december 16 meeting with the ambassador moroccan foreign minister fassi fihri related that he had visited dadis camara on wednesday december 9 and that he had been conscious but not coherent dadis arrived in coma and doctors removed bullet fragments from his skull he continued to recover according to fassi fihri and was now able to speak he has reportedly asked the gom to help him tape fiveminute television appearance for guinean television fassi fihri stated that dadiss admission to morocco was humanitarian gesture and that the gom would keep him in morocco until the end of december the minister noted as well that libya would be willing to accept dadis camara 3 s fassi fihri also said that the guinean defense minister general sekouba konate had told the gom that he wished to visit morocco to meet with dadis presumably to evaluate his ability to govern the gom was likely to honor konates request but only after the december 18 release of the report on the september massacre however fassi fihri also expressed pessimism about konateled government calling the konate drunkard 4 snf also on december 16 xxxxxxxxxxxx told poloff that moroccan doctors are expected imminently to release dadis camara from the hospital but that there could be longterm health consequences from the failed december 3 shooting xxxxxxxxxxxx reported that moroccan officials have not allowed him guinean dignitaries or the guinean ambassador to visit dadis camara but that he received regular medical updates from an unnamed moroccan source who was providing care for the junta leader at the mohammed v military hospital in rabat xxxxxxxxxxxx said dadis was alert but was not expected to return fully to his previous state of health 5 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx described the ethnicization of guinea and the risk of conflict and violence like in rwanda he stated that dadis camara has recruited mercenaries from south africa and israel and assembled them along with some of his own men in forecariah in the ethnically sussu region in the west of the country while dadis was from the forest region to the east his militia numbered 20003000 and wss armed with weapons from ukraine the risk of conflict and destabilization threatened the entire region he said 6 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx handed handwritten document of unknown origin to poloff describing dadis as philandering mentally unstable heavy drinker and drug abuser given to delusions the document also outlined plan for the future of guinea proposing that guinean minister of national defense sekouba konate lead tenmember civilianmilitary committee to restore order in the country after which trade rabat 00000988 0022 of 002 unionist dr ibrahima fofana would serve as transitional president for six months until presidential elections were held 7 snf comment fassi fihris discussion of guinea contrasted sharply with his much more emotional less objective discussion of western sahara in any case with dadis camara evidently recovering and the gom agreeing to keep him in morocco only until the end of december the situation in guinea could become more complicated unless the international community can persuade konate and the economic community of west african states to act quickly end comment 8 u tripoli minimize considered visit embassy rabats classified website
