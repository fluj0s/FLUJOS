organizations and more modern criminal networks traditiona l groups have hierarchical structure that operates continuously or for an extended period ne wer networks in contrast are seen as having more decentralized often celllike structure some experts also distinguish groups by their relation to the state many conventional organiza tions have interests that are aligned with countries they depe nd

enhancing multilateral cooperation some experts propose expanding us efforts through large multilateral institutions such as the united nations some consider mu ltinational conventions to be valuable tool in improving globa l law enforcement standards others are more skeptical about such treaties adherence varies they point out and enforcement is frequently lacking some analysts believe us efforts are better spent working with small groups of more truste d partners some for example believe collective decisionmaking would be more effective through the group of eight g8 some argue that with more

following discoveries such as the nuclear smuggling activities of q khan others claim psi is ineffective and question whether its activities can receive adequate congressional oversight for many combating criminal activities requires utilizing diversity of institutions some more bureaucratic than others some experts believe that us efforts are better spent working with regional structures such as the european union eus europol or southeast asias aseanapol which may receive more po litical backing and funding than with interpol typically more familiar with each other nd frequently sharing similar crime problems participating nations may be more willing to share information harmonize laws and coopera in law enforcement some observers are concerned that forming agreements with institutions such as the european union could damage or water down existing bilateral agreements under the bush administration the departments of state justice homeland security the fbi the cia and other agencies have actively worked to enhance coordination with their eu law enfo rcement and intelligence counterparts administration treaties include two with the european union on extradition and

agenci propose greater development and use of biometric technology which id entifies people through unique physical characteristics the european union is working to include biometric indicators on its passports and the united states is ex panding biometric r ecognition requirements for foreigners entering the country56 focusing federal efforts against organized crime some experts propose easing certain laws to allow the government to concentrate its limited resources on the most pressing criminal activities for example some advocate decriminaliz ing the possession of small amounts of marijuana many foreign countries ve reduced legal pe nalties for marijuana possession approaches such as these can be controversial nd politically difficult critics believe they risk sending society an inappropriate message conclusion an improved understanding of interna tional organized cr imes dynamics might help congress as it coordinates funds and oversees anticrime policies and programs improved data coll ection and establishing clear picture of the relative threats posed by various criminal activities w ould clearly be helpful in addition closer scrutiny of the nexus between crime
