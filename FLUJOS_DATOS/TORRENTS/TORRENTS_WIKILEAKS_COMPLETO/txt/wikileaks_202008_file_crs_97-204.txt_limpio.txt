million less than the house bill but 128 million more than proposed by the senate pl 10565 provides 355 million in additional funds for cash benefits compared to fy1997 discretionary funds mostly medical care would be about 3 million less than the previous year however language in the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 means va can retain medical care cost recoveries rather than pass those revenues on to the general treasury as before the appropriations bill guarantees that at least 579 million of an estimated 604 million will be collected in fy1998 making effective spending authority for va medical care 17636 billion for fy1998 an increase of 623 million over the previous year and 98 million more than the administrations request after adding the guaranteed cost recovery to the

totallydisabled and poor wartime veterans and their eligible survivors readjustment benefits education and training special assistance for the disabled veterans insurance and indemnities and home loan guarantees are mandatory entitlement spending although required amounts are annually appropriated veterans entitlement benefits once increasing rapidly but now relatively stable federal obligation to declining population constitute 53 of total va spending the fy1998 budget estimates 215 billion will be necessary for va cash entitlement benefits and pl 10565 reflects that estimate program administration the remaining va expenditures primarily those associated with medical care facility construction and medical research are annual discretionary appropriations as are general administrative costs unlike the ratio of entitlement spending to discretionary spending in the rest of the federal budget the discretionary portion of va is increasing as percent of total va spending in fy1976 entitlements constituted 73 of vas budget with the remaining 27 discretionary appropriations by fy1996 va discretionary spending for health and va administrative costs had risen to 47 of vas total budget for the entire federal budget about onethird of spending is discretionary crs4 medical care va operates the largest health care system in the nation encompassing 173 hospitals 175 nursing home and longterm care facilities and 448 outpatient clinics the fy1998 caseload is expected to increase by 135000 veterans va will serve 31 million different patients va health care continues to place increasing emphasis on outpatient care the inpatient caseload in fy1998 will decline by nearly 19000 patients to 891000 while outpatient visits will increase by 25 million to 332 million according to vas budget documentation congress appropriated 170 billion for va medical care for fy1997 and the administration requested that same amount for fy1998 the house committee endorsed that request1 the budget also projected flat appropriations for va medical care through fy2002 with goal of increasing the va patient load by 20 over the period offset by per patient efficiency savings of 30 the administration also assumes that by fy2002 10 of the medical care budget could be funded by non appropriated funds collected as reimbursements for some of the costs that va sustains while providing services to veterans with medical insurance or who are otherwise obligated for some costs of their care the budget proposed that net receipts estimated at 604 million for fy1998 of the medical care cost recovery mccr fund remain available to va for veterans medical services rather than be transferred to the treasury as under current law the house accepted an administration proposal for va to retain mccr receipts in floor action the house added 48 million to the medical care account and guaranteed 579 million of the 604 million estimated to be collected by mccr2 the senate bill added 68 million to the medical care account request making the senate bill at 17027 billion 5 million higher than the house bill conferees approved 17057 reflecting the conferees intent that va compensation and pension medical exams continue to be funded through the medical care account rather than through the general operating expenses goe account as requested also conferees dropped language specifying that the mccr guarantee be transferred from the superfund but retained the guarantee of 579 million because the language causing the retention had been passed in pl 10533 general operating expenses conferees reduced the goe request by the 68 million for medical exams the administration assumed but added 8 million back to resolve year 2000 computer problems medical care resource allocations the veterans health administration will continue with its plan to improve the efficiency of va medical care programs while expanding access to more veterans in spite of increased caseload va predicted that medical care employment would drop by 6000 employees during fy1997 this 1 because of accounting changes net 55 million in obligations that was shown as medical care costs in fy1997 has been transferred to general operating expenses goe for fy1998 the administrations proposed freeze level reflects this change also 1996 legislation pl 104262 capped medical care spending for fy1998 at 179 billion 2 although the guaranteed 579 million falls within the amount estimated for collections cbo estimated an additional 15 million in costs to the medical care account because of the possibility that the estimate could overstate actual net receipts crs5 efficiency gain can be achieved only if patient care continues to shift more to outpatient facilities because inpatient capacity is more concentrated in the older population centers in the northeast and midwest and outpatient demands are increasing in the southeast and southwest efficiency gains have regional implications as resources shift in response to the changing patterns of care the house report to accompany hr 2158 h report 105175 expressed concern that resource shifts have endangered the quality of care received by patients with special needs that may require more inpatient services the report called for general accounting office gao review of the veterans equitable resource allocation vera methodology used by va to instruct resource shifts and 4 month delay in further shifts pending that review the senate report srept 10553 accompanying its version of hr 2158 endorsed vera stating that the committee opposes efforts to thwart this new more equitable system conferees dropped the delay in funding shifts and extended the gao report date to 9 months medical research on the house floor 25 million was added for additional research projects to study illnesses reported by persian gulf war veterans the senate had stricken that language after vas advice that only onehalf the amount could reasonable be spent on such research conferees dropped it to 125 million va construction construction appropriations for va major and minor construction projects over the 10year period fy19871996 averaged around 600 million per year during fy1997 construction appropriations totaled 426 million including 321 million for replacement hospital at travis ca that cannot be obligated until the end of the fiscal year the house bill recommended 337 million in major and minor construction projects 91 million more than the administration requested the senate proposed 259 million most of the added funds were for construction of outpatient facilities at asheville nc and lyons nj and for renovations of facilities in omaha ne and waco tx the senate bill included funds for renovation at the facility in pittsburgh pa the administration and both versions of hr 2158 provide funds for 31 million for additions to the va cemetery system to fund new national cemetery at cleveland and major expansions at ft sam houston tx and the national memorial cemetery of az conferees approved 353 million in construction funding adding funds for new outpatient facilities conferees redirected funds 32 million from fy1997

100 million request to fund additional zones the senate version of the bill would have provided 25 million under separate appropriation for empowerment zone activities the cdbg program provides the 50 states indian tribes and approximately 975 entitlement communities with flexible funding to rehabilitate homes improve infrastructure provide job training activities support energy conservation and historic preservation and promote neighborhood revitalization economic development and job creation activities of the amount remaining after proposed setasides for distribution to the programs core recipients 70 would be allocated to so called entitlement communities and 30 to states for distribution to small nonentitlement communities the net effect of an increase in the amount of setasides recommended by the conferees will be modest decrease of about 27 in the programs funds available for allocation to its core recipients for additional information on cdbg see crs report 96503 community development block grants an overview expanding affordable housing for persons with special needs included in this section are the presidents requests for funding for three programs housing opportunities for persons with aids hopwa homeless assistance grants and housing for special populations the elderly and disabled crs12 housing opportunities for persons with aids for fy1998 the president requested that the hopwa program be funded with an appropriation of 204 million an 19 increase over the fy1997 appropriation of 171 million as passed by the house and senate hr 2158 appropriates 204 million for hopwa in fy1998 the bill further provides that the secretary of hud may designate grants to one or more nonprofit organizations that provide meals to homebound persons with aids these grants are to be given on competitive basis but are not to exceed 250000 per grant while in conference on hr 2158 the house and senate agreed that there are problems with the existing formula for funding the hopwa program which can result in loss of funds to state when the incidence of aids in large city or metropolitan area increases in this final version of the bill administrative provisions recommend improvements to the hopwa program homeless assistance grants the president requested and both the house and senate bills recommended 823 million for homeless assistance grants in fy1998 the same level funded by congress in fy1996 and fy1997 the senate had requested that all unobligated balances from programs designed to assist the homeless be merged into one consolidated account but this provision was not adopted in conference it is believed that the issue will be addressed when consolidated homeless assistance program is authorized and enacted hr 2158 also rescinds 6 million of funds recaptured in fy1998 for the supportive housing demonstration program and 4 million recaptured in fy1998 for shelter plus care program housing for special

was 44 below the fy1997 funding level of 839 million 645 for elderly and 194 million for disabled persons both the house and senate bills restored funding for housing the elderly and disabled to their fy1997 levels also in conference the house and senate agreed that supportive services should be provided to tenants receiving section 202 or section 811 assistance and that funds appropriated for the section 202 and section 811 programs should be used in providing these services the bill in its final version also states that the secretary of hud may designate up to 25 of the funding for housing the disabled to be used for vouchers and certificates native american housing block grants the native american housing block grant program was created by the native american housing assistance and

supportive services tenant opportunities home investment partnership and section 8 programs the budget also proposed that all balances from the annual contributions development of additional new subsidized housing preserving existing housing investment home investment partnerships program emergency shelter grants and homeless assistance funds accounts be transferred to and merged with the native american housing block grant program the administration estimated that the categorical programs received about 485 million in fy1997 and requested that amount for the new block grant program in

fy1998 these programs are funded through the housing certificate fund and from transfers from remaining reserves b reflects cancellation of 2 projects 1 million by presidential line item veto environmental protection agency the budget for the environmental protection agency epa has remained fairly constant in recent years requiring the agency to prioritize and optimize its resources to address problems posing the greatest risk to human health and the environment two prominent fy1998 appropriations issues were whether to significantly expand superfund and whether the level of assistance to states and localities is adequate on february 6 1997 the president requested 76 billion for the epa in fy1998 on july 16 the house approved 72 billion about 440 million less than requested and on july 17 the senate recommended 70 billion about 665 million less than requested the conferees approved 736 billion significant increase over the fy1997 funding level of 68 billion and an increase over both the house and senate versions of the bill while house and senate totals would have increased funding over current year funding for the agency both actions disapproved the administrations requested 50 expansion of superfund and increased funds for state assistance above the requested level however in response to belated veto threat conferees agreed to provide epa with the requested additional 650 million for superfund in fy1999 but only if the superfund program is reauthorized by may 15 1998 another key issue for conferees was to come to agreement on the roughly 225 million difference between the house and senate versions of hr 2158 the full fy1998 epa justification of appropriation estimates is available on line at httpwwwepagovocfopage for more in depth discussion see crs issue brief 97019 environmental protection agency fy1998 budget beginning in fy1996 the appropriations committees established new account structure for epa for the science and technology account the fy1998 budget requested 614 million as well as 40 million transfer from the superfund program the house committee recommended 656 million 42 million more than requested but proposed lowering the transfer from the superfund to 35 million on the floor an amendment was approved reducing the committee recommendation by 27 million to 629 million the senate committee on appropriations recommended and the senate approved 600 million and the 35 million transfer from superfund increases in both the house and senate would be directed to new health effects research related to particulate matter pm and ozone there has been significant controversy and congressional interest in epas promulgation of new ozone and pm air quality standards promulgated july 18 the conferees recommended 631 million for the science and technology account including 496 million for pm research program and health effects research plan for further information on the new epa regulation please see crs issue brief 95034 clean air issues regulatory and standard setting activities funded through the environmental programs and management account are the core of the agencys activities the administrations budget sought 19 billion about 8 more than current year crs18 funding the house passed 18 billion and the senate roughly the same the conferees approved 18 billion of the media air water etc programs funded through that account all but the radiation program would receive increases under the presidents budget the exact amounts of the house and senate recommendations for specific media programs are not available because major discretionary reductions are to be decided later by the epa administrator both actions include numerous recommendations for remixing the allocations within this account the budget requested 313 million for air quality programs 60 million or 24 more than current year funding the water quality program and the pesticide program would increase marginally the budget requested 10 increase in the drinking water program directed to new responsibilities under the 1996 safe drinking water act amendments the budget requested 497 million for epas management and support of these programs an increase of 3 because epas programs have been increasingly viewed as crossing many media the administration requested 307 million for multimedia programs an increase of 12 how the agency is pursuing alternative strategies for implementing and managing its many regulatory programs is of major interest the agency has embarked on numerous regulatory reinvention activities as well as innovative alternatives to its traditional ways of doing things these include special partnerships with businesses states and communities and special focus on small businesses the agencys progress in cleaning up toxic waste sites and its efficiency in managing the superfund program remains prime appropriation issue the fy1998 proposal sought 50 increase to accelerate cleanup while congressional authorization committees are considering reform legislation the gao has continued to place the superfund program as high risk for fraud waste and abuse many members are reluctant to grant significant increases in the absence of program reforms please see crs issue brief 97025 superfund reauthorization issues to clean up toxic waste sites under the superfund program the budget proposal sought 20 billion 706 million or 52 more than current year funding the house did not approve the request recommending 15 billion 589 million less than requested the request had reflected the programs increased emphasis on actual cleanup work at sites the senate also did not approve the superfund request it recommended 14 billion however as noted conferees agreed to provide epa with the requested additional 650 million for superfund in fy1999 contingent on reauthorization of the superfund program by may 15 1998 the house senate and conferees approved the administrations 85 million request for the brownfields program to clean up low level toxic waste sites with economic development potential but prohibited the use of brownfields monies for revolving loan funds unless specifically authorized in subsequent legislation for the leaking underground stor age tank fund the budget sought 71 million the house recommended 60 million the senate 65 million conferees recommended 65 million crs19 another issue is how to meet the significant capital requirements of states and localities needing to build and maintain wastewater and drinking water facilities to assist states and tribal governments the budget sought 28 billion 4 less than current year funding the house recommended 30 billion about 226 million more than requested the senate approved 31 billion and the conferees increased the assistance to states and tribes to 32 billion the request included about 11 billion for clean water state revolving funds cwsrfs 725 million for the

differed in proposed funding for buildings and facilities the house proposed 182 million the senate roughly 19 million declining to provide 122 million for continued funding of the construction of consolidated research facility in research triangle park north carolina the conferees approved 109 million for this account including 90 million for the new facility conferees also included bill language which raises the authorized construction cost ceiling for this project to 273 million but directed epa to provide costbenefit analysis justifying the inclusion of certain facilities in the original construction plan prior to expenditure of funds for those facilities the house passed an amendment to hr 2158 which would prohibit epa from allowing the import of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs from canada and mexico for treatment and destruction in the united states the senate did not include such an amendment in july 1997 the us ninth circuit court of appeals overturned an epa rule permitting the import of pcbs for disposal epa responded by prohibiting pcb imports and the conferees took further action on this issue the senate adopted an amendment to fund the chemical safety board an independent board for investigating chemical accidents authorized under the 1990 clean air act amendments similar amendment was withdrawn in the house the conferees agreed to fund the board

property the response phase and to rebuild communities recovery concern with the cost of federal disaster assistance and the absence of affordable private insurance in certain regions has led some to reexamine current policies and consider alternatives one policy option is to expand the availability of propertycasualty insurance policies through legislative action in the 105th congress such as hr 219 bill to provide federal reinsurance for state programs that provide insurance for property in peril to natural hazards or hr 230 bill to expand the availability of natural disaster insurance also pursuant to investigations conducted by leadership task forces in the house and the senate during the 103rd congress policy options have been considered to reduce federal expenditures to this end the 104th congress required that fema report to the 105th congress on possible ways to reduce federal costs legislation s 1007 has been introduced by request pursuant to this mandate the senate had proposed eliminating funding for the replacement of natural features including trees on public property or the restoration of damaged facilities that derive revenue from admission fees conferees rejected the senate proposal for fy1998 the administration proposed the establishment of contingency fund to be appropriated to the president for disaster relief activities carried out by fema and other federal agencies as proposed congress would designate funding as emergency spending under the deficit control act of 1985 the funds would only be available however when 1 the president designates part or all of the funding as an emergency requirement and 2 15 days elapse from the time the president notifies congress of such designation congress has not acted on this request one issue related to the proposal to establish contingency fund is whether congressional control would be ceded to the president it may be argued that funds as needed should be requested from the congress through supplemental appropriations the process followed to date see crs report 97159 fema and disaster relief for historical information on such supplementals others may contend that rather than relying on supplementals the president should have the flexibility to make already appropriated funds available for obligation when needed following the floods in north and south dakota in 1997

prospect for future declines in nasas budget although not set in law congress and the white house had agreed to cap space station funding at 21 billion annually and 174 billion total from fy1994 to completion of assembly this was done to add stability to the program and limit the amount of funds that went to iss versus other nasa programs concerns about russias ability to fulfill its commitment to the program and the recent cost overruns have caused congress and the white house to abandon the cost caps the concern of many in congress is that in declining budget environment shifting additional funding to the space station would come at the expense of other nasa programs this concern is amplified by prospects for lower agency budgets in the outyears the fy1998 request had an outyear fy1999 level of 132 billion press reports indicate that the agencys budget request in fy1999 might be as low as 126 billion many agency observers question whether nasa in declining budget atmosphere can continue to fund new programs and initiatives let alone fund all ongoing programs space station cost overruns and reports of lower than expected outyear budgets adds further credence to those concerns nasa asserts that its budget does fund balanced program and that efforts to undertake its missions faster cheaper and better have allowed the agency to increase the number of science
