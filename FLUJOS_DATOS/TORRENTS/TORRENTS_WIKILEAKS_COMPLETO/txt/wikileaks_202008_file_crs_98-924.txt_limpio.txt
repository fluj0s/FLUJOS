library of congress abstract the trade and development agency tda is one of several government agencies involved in aid for trade programs combining development assistance and export promotion for tdas fy1999 funding the administration had requested 50 million up 20 from the fy1998 level of 415 million but down 23 from its peak funding level of 65 million in fy1994 congress enacted 44 million for fy1999 in the omnibus appropriations bill hr 4238 pl 105277 this report provides tdas background budget history and ranks sector and statebystate gains from tda this report will be updated as events affecting tda occur the trade and development agency summary congressional interest in linking foreign aid more directly with commercial interests has waxed and waned throughout the 1990s as increasing demands have been placed on the us budget constituent support for more traditional foreign aid has dwindled and us industries have increasingly sought federal assistance in garnering foreign sales the trade and development agency tda operating since 1982 is one of several government agencies involved in aid for trade programs that combine development assistance and export promotion the agency provides grants directly to foreign countries enabling them to hire us companies to conduct feasibility studies for incountry capital projects since several other countries provide this type of assistance many believe the united states should also in order for us businesses to remain competitive with foreign businesses in host countries the trade and development agency has been viewed quite favorably by many policymakers as relatively inexpensive tool to promote us exports and employment while keeping the united states relevant to the economic development of middleincome developing countries however the program has also encountered criticism from members who view it as form of corporate welfare and by those who oppose foreign aid generally tdas primary activities include funding feasibility studies overseas and definitional missions to assess the merits of funding feasibility study project other activities include technical assistance grants orientation visits technical symposia training grants to multilateral development banks to hire us consultants as well as grants to state and local entities like the national association of state development agencies nasda although funding increased nearly tenfold from fy1982 to its peak in fy1994 when congress appropriated 65 million tdas budget remained modest when compared to most other agencies even at the time of its peak funding many tda proponents believed the request was still inadequate to fully utilize the agency and support its many potential projects others concerned with budget reduction overlap and duplication among government agencies believed that aid for trade agencies and offices could be consolidated or better coordinated additionally there were other matters associated with tda such as whether there was large company bias in the agencys activities and whether us tax dollars should assist corporations with ample resources of their own for export development despite the controversy congress appropriated 65 million for tda in fy1994 for comparison on october 20 1999 congress passed the omnibus appropriations bill hr 4238 pl 105277 which included 44 million for tdas fy1999 funding level 6 above the previous years appropriation the administrations request for fy1999 had been 50 million the fy1999 appropriation is 32 below the peak fy1994 level at the same time that tda is expanding activities in new countries along with reduction in funding since fy1994 congressional debate over the appropriateness of providing federal funds to

the trade and development agency introduction the trade and development agency tda created as the trade and development program tdp in 1982 has been viewed quite favorably by many policymakers as relatively inexpensive tool to promote us exports and employment while offering aid to middleincome developing countries others opposed the concept as form of cooperate welfare and raised specific issues about tdas cost and effectiveness as members addressed appropriations for foreign aid and export promotion agencies and programs in the late 1990s however arguments against the aid for trade concept tda and its mission have tended to decline tda acquired increased attention after the end of the cold war as security and political arguments for supporting us foreign assistance weakened debate over setting new foreign aid agenda emerged which included the argument that american foreign assistance in addition to promoting development overseas could also be used as tool that would benefit us businesses interest in tda intensified in the early 1990s as the us budget became increasingly strained constituent support for foreign aid dwindled and us industries sought help to sustain their international competitiveness some in congress and in the export community advocated strengthening of tda and other aid for trade activities of the us government tda provides grants directly to foreign countries that hire us companies to conduct feasibility studies1 for incountry projects such as dam construction energy production and telecommunications development middleincome developing countries are among the worlds fastestgrowing markets for us exports and many foreign competitor governments fund aid for trade programs some believe that the united states in order to help its industry be more competitive in those markets should continue currentlevel or modestly increased support for tda activities others argue that too many agencies are conducting export promotion activities critics of tda contend that the office of capital projects at the agency for international development usaid2 the overseas private investment corporation opic the exportimport bank eximbank and tda carry out similar if not duplicative functions they assert that elimination of 1 feasibility study is an assessment of potential project to determine whether the project is economically financially and technically possible 2 the office of capital projects was first established by usaid in 1991 under the bush administrations partnership for business and development program it was authorized by congress in the jobs through exports act of 1992 but has been minimally funded by usaid it is currently operating primarily through funding from usaid field mission offices crs2 some of these functions or consolidation into one agency would improve effectiveness while reducing budgetary costs in the past particularly in the early 1990s some members supported merging other aid for trade agencies into tda and greatly expanding its funding levels proponents argued that eliminating aid for trade activities in less active offices such as usaids office of capital projects would result in greater budgetary savings without loss in policy effectiveness others contended that tda was efficient effective and flexible they feared that consolidating these agencies into single entity would create inefficiencies that did not exist in tda political support for tda peaked about 1994 since then congress generally has been less enthusiastic about aid for trade programs tdas fy1998 core budget is similar to that prevailing in the early 1990s despite tdas expanding activities in new countries tda has increased the number of its programs from 307 in 1993 to 390 in 1997 tda also conducted more activities in latin america asia and africa in 1997 than in previous years the fy1999 administration request for 50 million took into account tdas crucial involvement in number of middle income developing country infrastructure projects congress enacted 44 million rather than the requested 50 million because of limited budgetary resources3 this report provides background information on the trade and development agency including how it evolved its budget staff size and activities it also compares tda with similar programs in other countries and discusses current congressional issues and views background tda provides grants to foreign governments enabling them to hire us companies to conduct feasibility studies and other planning services for major industrial and infrastructure projects viewed as development priorities by the host country through these planning services tda activities subsequently assist us businesses in exporting goods and services for major capital projects in developing and middleincome countries tdas stated mission is to help position us companies to compete successfully as suppliers of goods and services for major capital projects in developing countries assist economic growth in the developing and middleincome world by increasing access to us private sector expertise serve as front line agency for implementing us trade and foreign assistance objectives by rapidly and effectively mobilizing us technical expertise 3 foreign operations appropriations house of representatives report 105719 pp6 7 crs3 maximize the reciprocal benefits of us foreign assistance4 tda specific mission for fy1999 is to assist in the creation of jobs for americans by helping us companies pursue overseas business opportunities5 according to the director of tda in 1998 j joseph grandmaison the total volume of us exports associated with tda activities since its inception in 1982 has grown to about 10 billion to 115 billion in march 1998 congressional testimony he claimed that every dollar tda invests in 1998 on behalf of american exporters results in 33 in us exports up from 30 in exports per dollar invested in 19976 he also pointed out that during 1997 tda funded 390 activities in 65 countries which helped american companies establish themselves in variety of projects in emerging markets7 similar capital project activities conducted by usaid on the other hand may generate less than one dollar for every dollar invested since usaid selects capital projects to meet the host countrys development needs rather than projects with the greatest potential return for us businesses8 origin and evolution of the program the idea of reimbursable government services to foreign countries9 linking the us private sector with development activities dates back to the mutual security act of 1954 later the policy was reauthorized in section 607a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 in 1974 congress added section 661 to the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended it provided authority to promote the use of us government reimbursable services that would be paid for by foreign countries the foreign assistance act designated usaid as the agency responsible for implementing both section 607aputting foreign governments in touch with us government agencies for reimbursable servicesand section 661funding planning studies which would lead to the use of such services the two activities were housed in usaids office of reimbursable development programs directly under the administrator according to usaid because of congressional initiative in the early 1970s that shifted aid program emphasis to basic human needs and small scale poverty projects and away from promotion of the private sector usaids 4 united states

necessarily provided by the us government crs4 expenditures for activities linking us businesses to development in 1976 and 1977 fell to only about 1 million annually by the end of the 1970s however there was growing sense in congress that the us private sector should be more active in development programs in 1978 congress directed usaid to increase emphasis on us private sector involvement in development assistance by march 1979 usaid issued new guidelines facilitating the involvement of the us private sector in development from the earliest planning stages of the projects through implementation in july 1980 to further underscore the link between private sector and us development activities usaids office of reimbursable development programs was made part of the international development cooperation agency idca newly created umbrella agency tasked with coordinating us development assistance programs and was renamed the trade and development program tdp independent from usaid by delegation of authority tdp received separate line item authorization and appropriation in 1982 pursuant to section 661 of the foreign assistance act congress further strengthened tdps autonomy with passage of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl100418 which made tdp an independent agency and required the tdp director to be appointed by the president it established tdp as the primary federal agency providing information to the private sector regarding trade and development and export promotion the 1988 act further transferred to tdp the usaid tied aid10 responsibilities directed by the trade expansion act of 1983 it also expanded tdp activities to include education and training programs and required that tdp be represented and vote at meetings of the national advisory council on international monetary and financial policies whenever tied aid issues were discussed additionally the omnibus trade act required the director of tdp to establish an advisory board which must include representatives from the private sector to make recommendations to the director regarding tdp activities in december 1992 congress enacted the jobs through export act that renamed tdp the trade and development agency tda lawmakers supported the name change to clarify and emphasize that tda is an independent agency and increase its visibility as the primary federal agency promoting private sector trade development in middleincome developing countries in addition the act required annual independent audits of tdas financial statements and increased tdas spending authority to 65 million annually beginning in fy1994 funding history although tda funding has increased dramatically since 1982 it remains one of the smaller foreign aid programs despite growing foreign aid budget constraints beginning in 1985 however tda appropriations have grown steadily the administration requested 60 million for fy1994a 50 percent increase over the 10 tied aid is foreign assistance that is linked with requirement that the recipient country purchase us goods and services with the assistance crs5 fy1993 level and the largest increase since 1983and congress appropriated 65 million while this seemed like sizeable percentage increase tda stated that it would not be able to fund all project requests received even with the additional resources11 for fy1999 tda requested an increase to 50 million but received 44 million 25 million above the previous years level of 415 million and well below the fy1994 peak of 65 million the agency points out that since 1993 the number of projects has expanded by 27 while the agencys core budget has declined by 32 table 1 provides history of tdas budget authority since 1982 table 1 the trade and development agency budget authority

staffingstructure the structure of tda is shown in figure 1 while staff size has been increasing somewhat over the years tda is small agency when compared to most others the office of management and budget omb sets staff ceiling for tda each year tda staff numbers usually are maintained at the ceiling as recently as 11 meeting with jonathan raymond director of congressional affairs tda february 8 1993 crs6 1987 the trade and development program ceiling was 15 full time employees in 1988 the staff ceiling increased to 17 in 1992 it was 32 and by 1998 it was 41 full time employees by comparison other aid and export promotion agencies have much larger staffs and also manage much larger programs in fy1998 opics full time staff which extended 4 billion in insurance to us firms was 198 eximbanks full time staff managing programs worth more than 122 billion was 371 figure 1 trade and development agency organizational chart source tda 1997 current tda activities and frequently asked questions tda program tda funds wide range of activities the largest category being feasibility studies feasibility study is an assessment made by us firm hired by the host country with tda grant to determine whether potential project is economically financially and technically possible in fy 1997 69 percent of the tda budget was devoted to financing 105 feasibility studies another important tda activity is definitional missionsdesk studies tda uses technical consultants to develop reports which are used to assist in the agencys crs7 decisions on funding requests for feasibility studies and other assistance these reports are categorized into two types definitional missions dm and desk studies ds definitional missions involve shortterm visit to host country to gather additional information and evaluate the project desk studies involve information gathering but do not require overseas travel based on the recommendations contained in the dm or ds analysis report the advice of the us embassy and tdas internal analysis and budget capabilities the agency makes investment decisions on funding requests for feasibility studies all definitional missions and desk studies at tda are contracted exclusively with small and minorityowned businesses tda contracted for 168 definitional missions and desk studies during 199712 other tda activities include technical assistance grants orientation visits technical symposia training grants to multilateral development banks to hire us consultants as well as grants to state and local entities like the national association of state development agencies nasda tda conducts projects involving agriculture energy and natural resources human resources manufacturing multisector services telecommunications transportation and waterenvironment in recent years the largest number of projects 85 in fy1997 and the largest amount of funds 96 million in fy1997 have been in the transportation category the smallest have been in the agribusiness and human resources categories 14 and 12 projects and about 11 million and 14 in fy1997 respectively see figure 2 tdas project selection criteria are as follows13 development priority tda projects must be development priorities of the host country and likely to be implemented tda must receive formal request from the host country government and the us embassy must endorse tdas involvement in the proposed project us export potential projects must present an opportunity for substantial sales of us goods or services relative to the cost of the requested assistance financing availability there must be likelihood that project implementation financing which is not tied to award to particular foreign country will be available and that procurement will be open to us firms competition there must be likelihood that us companies will face strong competition from foreign companies that receive various kinds of subsidies and support from their governments 12 us trade and development agency 1997

actively involved in tdafinanced activities around the world companies range in size and include very small firms minorityowned businesses and large corporations such as att general electric comsat and westinghouse14 businesses in majority of states benefit from tda projects according to data compiled by tda in fy1997 district of columbiabased companies 83 were the most from any one state to benefit from tda projects followed by virginia 69 california 39 maryland 29 new jersey 19 illinois 16 colorado 13 new york 13 texas 10 and massachusetts 10 for complete ranking of states see the appendixes on pages 15 and 16 how can us companies participate one concern among policymakers as well as tda administrators has been how to inform us businesses about tda and explain how they can participate in its programs for that tda began to interact with the national association of state development agencies nasda to inform businesses of export opportunities at the local level generally what tda has shared with nasda is the following activity path 1host government contacts tda with prospective project or us company operating in region becomes aware of potential project in foreign country and notifies tda 2regional tda officer evaluates worth of project puts together an assessment of the scope of work completes definitional missionthe consultant that does this can not be one that could benefit from the project at this stage tda coordinates with the trade policy coordination committee tpcc aid opic eximbank 3if the project assessment is favorable in meeting tdas criteria regional tda director presents the project to the project review board consisting of tdas director deputy and general counsel if the review committee does not approve the process ends here 4if the review committee approves the project the host country signs an agreement for tda to provide grant which requires the host country to hire us company to do feasibility study 14 the number of companies involved in tda activities at any given time can not be accurately counted according to tda many times after company wins one contract the country may continue to employ that company years after the initial project because of familiarity with the company name staff and quality of work also often large companies win the contracts but then subcontract the work to number of smaller ones making an accurate count difficult crs11 5the feasibility study project is announced in the commerce business daily cbd and us firms are invited to bid to learn of the announcements companies must subscribe to the newsletter 6us companies can offer bid within specified time period 7the bids are reviewed by the host country 9the host country selects us company to do the study where have tda projects concentrated in 1997 65 countries received tda grants african latin american eastern european and asian countries were heavily represented among the list of countries specific countries with the largest number of tda projects in 1997 were russia 38 brazil 23 south africa 19 indonesia 19 thailand 16 and bosnia herzegovina 15 additionally five tda projects which were regional or worldwide in scope were categorized as latin america regional asia regional africa regional europe regional and worldwide the number of tda activities in latin america asia and africa has increased from 46 of the total activities in fy1993 to 636 in fy1997 the funding level has also increased from 522 of the totals in fy1993 to 573 in fy199715 prior to chinas tianamen square incident tda provided about onethird of its grants to beijing tda officials defend this heavy concentration on one country by saying that all these grants were based on specific criteria as well as potential for us benefit and export potential after tianamen square tda voluntarily suspended activities in china and later was prohibited from conducting projects there by legislation currently china along with vietnam north korea and burma is ineligible for tda assistance16 similar programs in other industrialized countries according to the coalition for employment through exports the united kingdom annually spends over 35 million for various agencies that fund feasibility studies bid on major overseas projects and fund privatization studies and technical advisors the canadian international development agency annually provides an industrial cooperation program of approximately 46 million for feasibility studies and technical assistance the japan international cooperation agency annually spends 229 million

july 1 1998 crs12 figure 3 according to tda compares the size of aid programs of several donor countries figure 3 tdas budget compared with competitors 1997 source tda issues for congress over the years policymakers attitudes on us foreign aid have changed in the 1960s and 1970s many supported us foreign assistance for security and foreign policy reasons with the continuation of the cold war throughout the 1980s the reagan administration shifted the focus of foreign assistance away from governmenttogovernment assistance and toward fostering growth of the private sector in developing countries in the 1990s foreign aid advocates have been looking for new rationale and purpose of us foreign assistance in the absence of the threat of communism foreign aid activity that promotes us businesses in development programs is one of several new purposes that has received support and is under consideration tdas role in an expanded us government export promotion initiative is also under review by the clinton administration in recent years some members of congress supported the aid for trade concept as conducted by tda and other agencies congressional debate has focused not on whether to conduct aid for trade projects but rather how much should be appropriated and under what agencies congress has focused on two overriding issues concerning the trade and development agency 1 the optimal funding level and 2 the designated responsibilities of the agency and the related issue of possible overlap of responsibilities with other agencies additionally policymakers have examined other matters associated with tda and its activities such as whether tda was an aid or export promotion agency whether there was companysize bias in tda activities and whether us tax dollars should assist large corporations crs13 should the us government intervene in the markets currently some members question whether the us government should even intervene in the markets at all they feel that the us government should abstain from assisting the business community in meeting the demands of the global marketplace on grounds that such intervention skews the marketplace if the overseas activity were worth doing they say the businesses should take it upon themselves to do it if it is not worth doing the us government should not be involved in it the us business community on the other hand points out that it faces highly competitive markets where foreign competitors such as european and japanese companies enjoy the full backing and support of their respective governments many members of congress maintain that the competitiveness of great number of international businesses and thus the us economy depends on the quality of project financing and therefore that the role played by tda is essential18 is there bias involving company size some have claimed that tda has largecompany bias since tda provides grants directly to foreign governments it is the host country that selects us companies to conduct feasibility studies as result us companies do not receive any taxpayer dollars directly from tda thus there is direct us government action showing bias toward larger companies involved in tda activities however there may be some bias in favor of larger betterknown companies on the part of the host country because they may be more comfortable with large or wellknown company also the larger companies can afford the money staff and paper work involved in marketing themselves to the host country and are more able to have staff in washington dc who are familiar with procedures and potential projects large firms also are better equipped with staff and resources to be more competitive in bidding especially on engineering and large construction projects small businesses can benefit whenever they have particular expertise specialty skill knowledge of region or culture in the world or have developed particular niche in the market in many cases large businesses that win contracts subcontract some of the work to smaller businesses furthermore small and minorityowned businesses do all definitional missions according to tda officials large number of feasibility studies have been conducted by small firms as well according to agency data onethird of tdas program budget has gone to small firms tda has also sponsored conferences and orientation visits which have been beneficial to small business19 18 source telephone conversation with monique roske legislative representative coalition for employment through exports july 31 1998 19 source telephone conversation with ned cabot congressional relations us trade and development agency september 2 1998 and us trade and development agency 1997 annual report p 8 crs14 should us tax dollars assist large corporations some have questioned whether it is really necessary to provide american tax dollars to multibillion dollar corporations to develop foreign markets they maintain that if the foreign market were profitable the companies would be conducting these activities on their own american companies should be just as competitive as their foreign counterparts they argue without government assistance on the other hand supporters argue that at least until recently many us companies have not had as much experience and history in bidding on foreign capital projects since they traditionally have concentrated their business in the us market other competitor country governments moreover have funded feasibility studies as normal way of obtaining foreign contracts for their national firms supporters of tda argue that us companies would be at disadvantage if the united states were to withdraw from this activity some trade experts believe that if the united states wants to remain competitive in the world and in these fastgrowing middleincome markets it must offer similar grants to host countries moreover they say us taxpayers would benefit with subsequent increase in domestic employment and economic activity as tda projects would promote us exports however critics of us government activities linking us businesses to development assistance programs assert that large and small companies alike seem to want to be spoon fed it has been observed that often once government funds dry up the companies seem to drop their promotional activities in particular country this suggests to critics that tda funds are supporting projects that are not really commercially viable furthermore critics of tda contend that the agency lacks technical development and engineering expertise saying that often projects are approved without adequate technical review as result businesses might be able to overprice estimates for feasibility studies or might recommend project when it may not be sound technically developmentally or economically tda needs to have the technical expertise to know ifwhen overpricing occurs or unsound projects are considered critics claim if taxpayer dollars are to be spent to promote us business activity overseas another idea raised by some is that private enterprises benefitting from governmentfunded tda activities should return some of the tda grant if the company wins followon contracts according to those who espouse this concept such rebates to tda could be placed in revolving fund to reduce the size of future tda appropriations and to deflect criticism that large businesses are receiving subsidy from american taxpayers crs15 appendix 1 trade and development agency program activities number of participating companies state by state
