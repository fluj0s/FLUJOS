process government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988voting and quorum procedures in the house of representatives summary the constitution requires that quorum or simple majority of the members is to be present on the floor when the house of representatives transacts business however the house conduct s much of its legislative business in committee of the whole where this constitutional requirement does not apply also the house always presumes that quorum is present unless and until its absence is demonstrated conclusively the rules of the house severely limit the occasions on which representative may make point of order that quorum is not present either in the house or in committee of the whole in current practice members usually make such point of order only when vote is taking place if majority of the members fail to respond to quorum call or participate in an electronically recorded vote conducte d in the house the house must adjourn or take steps necessary to secure the attendance of enough members to constitute quorum each question to be decided on the floor is first put to voice vote before the final result of that vote is announced any member may demand division vote or seek an electronically recorded vote during division vote the members favoring the question and then those opposing it stand and are counted during vote using the houses electronic voting system members have at least 15 minutes to come to the floor and cast their votes in the house if the speaker sustains point of order against voice or division vote on the grounds that quorum was not present an electronic vote takes place autom atically to decide the question and establish the presence of quorum if quorum is present 15 of those members can secure an electronic vote in the house by invoking their constitutional right to demand the yeas and nays in committee of the whole 25 members can secure an electronic vote on the pend ing amendment or motion if quorum is not present in committee of the whole member first can require that quorum call take place before the chair counts to determine if there is sufficient support to order an electronically

17httpwikileaksorgwikicrs989881references in this report to members do not include delegates and the resident commi ssioner during the 103rd congress the houses rules permitted them to vote in committee of the whole subject to immediate reconsideration in the house of questions resolved in the committee of the whole by margin within which the votes of delegates and the resident commissioner were decisive that rule was repealed at the beginning of the 105th congress voting and quorum procedures in the house of representatives introduction the rules and practices of the house of representatives governing quorums and voting on the floor are closely intertwined and derive from two provisions of article i of the constitution regarding quorums clause 1 of section 5 states in part that majority of each house shall constitute quorum to do business but smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each house may provide regarding voting clause 3 of the same section provides in part that the yeas and nays of the members of either house on any question shall at the desire of one fifth of those present be entered on the journal this report discusses how the house now interprets and implements these two constitutional provisions it focuses on the most important rules and the most common practices it does not attempt to cover all the precedents the house has established or all the procedures that may be invokedfor example the procedures for calling the roll instead of using the electronic voting system to decide question or establish the presence of quorum this report also assumes familiarity with some other aspects of the houses floor procedures the quorum requirement in theory and practice the constitutions quorum requirement quoted above seems to make it necessar for simple majority of the houses members or minimum of 218 representatives if there are vacancies in the house to be present on the floor whenever the house conducts business as any observer of the house soon notices however sometimes only handful of members are present during house debates1 in fact it is rather unusual for as many as 218 members to be present on the floor at the same time unless vote or quorum call is being conducted using the houses electronic voting system there appears to be an inconsistency therefore betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs2 2this rule first was adopted in 1890 before then the quorum requirement in committee of the whole was the same as in the house 3as the houses parliamentarian has observed business is term of art which does not encompass all parliamentary proceedings deschlers precedents of the us house of representatives hdoc 94661 94th congress 2nd session hereafter deschlers continuedan apparently unambiguous constitutional requirement and the wellestablished and wellaccepted practices of the house how is this inconsistency to be explained first the house transacts much of its busin ess on the floor by resolving itself into the committee of the wholeformally the committee of the whole house on the state of the union the primary reason for doing so is that the rules governing debate and amendments in committee of the whole are more flexible than those that apply when the house is meeting in the house resolving into committee of the whole also is convenient for another reason the committee of the whole is committee that the house has created in its rules just as the house has created various standing committees although the committee of the whole differs from other house committees in that all representatives are members of it and it meets on the house floor it still remains committee of the house therefore meeting of the committee of the whole is not meeting of the house itself so the constitutional quorum requirement for the house does not apply in committee of the whole instead the house is free to set in its rules whatever quorum requirement it chooses for meetings of the committee of the whole clause 6a of house rule xviii provides that quorum of committee of the whole house on the state of the union is 100 mem bers not the 218 members who constitute quorum of the house2 second whether the house is meeting as the house or in committee of the whole quorum always is presumed to be present unless and until its absence is demonstrated reasonably enough the house presumes that it is complying with the constitution or its own rules as the case may be furthermore neither the speaker nor the chairman of the committee of the whole is empowered to take the initiative to ensure that this presumption is correct at time may the speaker or the chairman interrupt the proceedings on the floor because he or she observes that the necessary quorum is not present or because he or she decides to count those present to determine whether the applicable quorum requirement is being met instead the speaker or chairman responds to an assertion that member makes from the floor that quorum is not present or less often when member is recognized to move call of the house quorum always is presumed to be presen t unless member challenges this presumption from the floor and the houses standing rules severely limit when he or she may do so many of the details of these rules are discussed later in this report to summarize them here there is critical linkage between the houses quorum and voting procedures about the only times that member has right to make point of order that quorum is not present is when vote is taking place in sense the house in its rules has adopted definition of business for purposes of the constitutional quorum requirement that is limited to voting3 if majority of allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs3 3continued precedents v 5 p 544 4for the early parliamentary law on which many of the houses voting procedures continue to rest see sec

gavel to the adjournment of each daily session it woul d become practically impossible for members to satisfy all their various responsibilities and for the house to do its work in timely fashion conducting voice and division votes either the constitution or the houses rules require that certain kinds of questions be decided by record votes that are almost always conducted by use of the houses electronic voting system first the constitution mandates that any vote to override presidential veto shall be determined by yeas and nays article i section 7 clause 2 second under clause 10 of rule xx adopted in 1995 at the beginning of the 104th congress the yeas and nays shall be considered as ordered when the speaker puts the question on passage of bill or joint resolution or on adoption of conference report making general appropriations or increasing federal income tax rates within the meaning of clause 5 of rule xxi or on final adoption of concurrent resolution on the budget or conference report thereon and third clause 12a2 of rule xxii provides for record vote on any motion to authorize house managers to close the meetings of any conference committee in all other cases the basic procedures for voting in the house are laid out in house rules i and xx the manner in which questions are put to vote is governed by clause 6 of rule i on the duties of the speaker4 the speaker shall rise to put question but may state it sitting the speaker shall put question in this form those in favor of the question say aye and after the affirmative voice is expressed those opposed say after vote by voice under this clause the speaker may use such voting procedures as may be invoked under rule xx clause 1 of rule xx then lays out the basic procedures for securing division and record votes the house shall divide after the speaker has put question to vote by voice as provided in clause 6 of rule i if the speaker is in doubt or division is demand ed those in favor of the question shall first rise from their seats to be counted and then those opposedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs4 5clause 12 of rule xviii states that the rules of the house are the rules of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union so far as applicable so the basic voting procedures of the house are followed in committee of the whole except where the houses rules provide otherwise 6this presumption is reflected in clause 4b of rule xx which states that on the demand of member or at the suggestion of the speaker the names of members sufficient to make quorum in the hall of the house who do not vote shall be noted by the clerk entered on the journal reported to the speaker with the names of the members voting and be counted and announced in determining the presence of quorum to do business this clause derives from the socalled reed rules of 1890 named after speaker thomas brackett reed r who was responding to the dilatory tactic of the disappearing quorum by which members who were present on the floor would decline to vote and so prevent the house from continuing to conduct business in dramatic and highly contentious development reed named members who were present but who had not voted on the pending question and he directed the clerk to record their names for purposes of establishing the presence of quorum although reeds opponents at the time decried his action as revolutionary it eventually was embodied permanently in the houses standing rules 7deschlers precedents v 5 p 319b if member delegate or resident comm issioner requests recorded vote and that request is supported by at least onefifth of quorum the vote shall be taken by electroni c device unless the speaker invokes another procedure for recording votes provided in this rule recorded vote taken in the house under this paragraph shall be considered vote by the yeas and nays c in case of tie vote question shall be lost whether in the house or in committee of the whole every question except the few noted above is first put to voice vote5 the chair instructs those who favor the question to call out aye and then those who oppose it to call out the chair then is expected to state that in his or her opinion the ayes or the noes appear to have it and to pause before banging the gavel and announcing that the ayes or noes do have it and the bill is or is not passed or the motion is agreed to or whatever the case may be if one challenges the chairs statement before the gavel comes down his or her announcement is conclusive and the question is decided furthermore the vote is considered valid even if only few members actually voted quorum is presumed to have been present regardless of how many actually may have participated in the voice vote6 for example the fact that quorum does not vote on an amendment does not necessarily indicate that quorum is not present7 after the chair announces his or her opinion as to the outcome of voice vote any member has right to demand division vote in addition the chair may call for division vote when voice vote leaves him or her in doubt though the chair rarely does so in practice when division vote is demanded the chair directs all those in favor of the question to stand and to remain standing until he or she counts them then in like manner the chair counts those who stand in opposition to the questionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs5 8wheneve r the chair countsto determine the outcome of division vote to ascertain whether quorum is present or to discover if there is sufficient support to order an electronic votemembers may not challenge the accuracy of the count one of the suppositions on which parliamentary law is founded is that the speaker will not betray his duty to make an honest count on division and the integrity of the chair in counting vote should not be questioned in the house and the chairs count of members demanding recorded vote is not appealable citations omitted house rules and manual notes accompanying clause 1 of rule xx 9in his notes following clause 1b of rule xx the parliamentarian observes that vote by division takes cognizance of members present but not voting and consequently the number of votes counted by division has tendency to establish lack of quorum house rules and manual 10even after the final result is announced the chair often will allow member to seek an electronic vote if that member was on his or her feet and trying to get the chairs attention for that purpose before the final result is announced 11procedure in the us house of representatives 4th edition 97th congress washington us government printing office 1982 hereafter procedure in the house p 689the chair then announces the result and the question is decided8 as is true of voice vote the positions of individual members in division vote are not recorded and division vote is valid even if less than quorum was present to participate in it unless the vote is challenged for that reason again the presumption is that quorum is present on the floor when the vote takes place even if not all of those members choose to take part in the vote9 both voice votes and division votes involve only the members who happen to be on or very near the floor at the time vote takes place time is provided for members to come to the floor from their offices or committee rooms as result small number of members can determine the outcome of either kind of vote and that outcome may not be the same as it would be if most or all members participated before the final result of either voice vote or division vote is announced therefore any member may request record vote using the houses electronic voting system10 during this kind of vote members usually have 15 minutes or more typically 17 minutes in current practice to come to the floor and record their votes and the vote of each member is recorded individually and printed in the congressional record seeking an electronic vote the house uses its electronic voting system for taking what actually are several different kinds of votes they are indistinguishable from each other in how they are conducted but not in how they are ordered in the house there are three ways to secure an electronic vote in the house according to the parliamentarian11httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs6 12the house rules and manual contains additional rules and precedents governing votes and quorum calls conducted by tellers especially in clause 4a of rule xx these procedures are not discussed in this report because they are used very rarely in the contemporary house 13in the earlier practice of the house it was held that less than quorum might not order the yeas and nays but for many years the decisions have been uniformly the other way house rules and manual notes accompanying article i section 5 clause 3 of the constitution the change in practice can be traced back at least to 1863on any vote in the house 1 the vote may be objected to for lack of quorum under rule xv clause 4 now clause 6 of rule xx thereby precipitating an automatic ordering of the yeasandnays 2 recorded vote may be ordered by onefifth of quorum or 3 the yeas and nays may be ordered by onefifth of those present recall that the constitution provides that the yeas and nays of the members of either house on any question shall at the desire of one fifth of those present be entered on the journal vote by the yeas and nays is what traditionally has been called rollcall vote though today it is also know n as kind of record vote and is taken by use of the houses electronic voting system unless that system were to break down in that case the clerk of the house actually would call the roll of members following clause 3 of rule xx as was done before the electronic system was installed to implement the legislative reorganization act of 1970 clause 2a of rule xx now provides that all record votes and quorum calls in the house are to be conducted electronically unless the speaker exercises his discretion to have the clerk call the names of members instead in practice the electronic voting system always is used unless it is temporarily inoperative12 for this reason all references in this report to rollcall and record votes should be understood to be references to votes taken by electronic device as noted earlier there is an important linkage between the houses quorum requirements and its procedures for ordering electronic votes in the house yea andnay vote can be ordered as matter of constituti onal right by 15 of the members present but this number need not constitute quorum13 onefifth of however many members happen to be present may order the yeas and nays however there is an alternative that is even less demanding any member usually can compel an electro nic vote on any question on which the house is voting by invoking clause 6a of rule xx which provides for an electronic vote that also establishes the presence of quorum that rule states in part when quorum fails to vote on question quorum is not present and objection is made for that cause unless the house shall adjourn 1 there shall be call of the house 2 the sergeantatarms shall proceed forthwith to bring in absent members and 3 the yeas and nays on the pending question shall at the same time be considered as ordered emphasis addedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs7 14an objection to vote on the ground that quorum is not present under rule xv clause 4 now clause 6a of rule xx may not be made until after the question has been put by the speaker then member must be on his feet and actively seeking recognition when the chair announces the result of vote in order to object to the vote on the grounds that quorum is not presentthe mere fact that member is on his feet does not constitute notice to the chair that he is seeking recognition to make such an objection citations omitted procedure in the house p 297 15requesting one form of electronic vote in the house does not preclude reque st for the other demand for recorded vote may be made following demand for the yeas and nays providing the latter demand is first withdrawn or does not receive sufficient second procedure in the house p 685clause 6b goes on to provide in part that if those voting on the question and those who are present and decline to vote together make majority of the house the speaker shall declare that quorum is constituted and the pending question shall be decided as the requisite majority of those voting shall have determined thereupon further proceedings under the call shall be considered as dispensed with when the speaker announces the result of voice vote or division vote in the house member may take advantage of the rules just quoted by rising and saying14 mr speaker i object to the vote on the ground that quorum is not present and i make point of order that quorum is not present the member making this statement is invoking the constitutional quorum requirement and challenging the validity of the voice or division vote by asserting that it does not comply with the constitution because quorum of the house was not present at the time in response the speaker counts to determine whether in fact 218 members are present on the floor if quorum is present he overrules the point of order if the representative still wants an electronically recorded vote he or she may ask for the yeas and nays and hope that 15 of the members present rise to indicate their support for the request alternatively the member may ask for recorded vote invoking clause 1b of rule xx which states that if member delegate or resident commissioner requests recorded vote and that request is supported by at least one fifth of quorum the vote shall be taken by electronic device unless the speaker orders otherwise notice that it takes 44 members 15 of quorum to order recorded vote under this rule compared to 15 of those present to order the yeasandnays when quorum is present on the floor it may be easier to obtain sufficient support for recorded vote than for yeaandnay vote because the number of members present probably will exceed the minimal quorum of 218 in which case 15 of the number present will exceed 44 in either event the vote will be taken by using the electronic voting system regardless of whether it is technically yeaandnay vote or record vote ordered under clause 1b of rule xx15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs8 if the speaker discovers that quorum is not presentwhich is more often the casehe announces that fact and also states that under clause 6a of rule xx an electronic vote is ordered on the question before the house this vote accomplishes two purposes at once first it decides the questionfor example will bill pass and second at the same time it demonstrates the presence of quorum as members use the 15 or more minutes given them to come to the floor and vote if quorum participates in the vote that establishes the presence of quorum and the house can continue to transact business it is rarely necessary for the sergeantatarms to bring in absent members because they usually want to be recorded on all electronic votes more often than not there are fewer than 218 members present on the house floor it usually is possible therefore for single representative to use the procedure just described to require an automatic record vote using the electronic voting system which is equivalent in effect to yeaandnay vote by invoking the constitutions quorum requirement only when quorum actually is present at the time of voice or division votefor example when memb ers have just come to the floor to cast another votemust member have the support of at least 15 of the members present or 15 of that quorum to secure record vote on the same question in committee of the whole the constitutional right to demand the yeas and nays applies to both the house and the senate but it does not extend to the committee of the whole there is constitutional right for 15 of the members present to insist on vote in committee of the whole by call of the roll or by use of the electronic voting system in fact before 1970 the votes of individual members never were recorded on any question that was decided in committee of the whole including all the votes on amendments to bills as part of the same 1970 legislative reorganization act that authorized the electronic voting system the house amended its rules to provide for recorded votes in committee of the whole especially with the installation of the new voting system these votes became the functional equivalent of yeaandnay votes in the house however the requirements and procedures for securing record vote in committee of the whole are somewhat different from those used to obtain comparable votes in the house even though all these votes almost always are conducted by use of the same electronic system under clause 6e of house rule xviii in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union the chairman shall order recorded vote on request supported by at least 25 members so before the final result of voice or division vote is announced all member need do is rise and request recorded vote if he or she is confident that at least 24 other members will rise to support the request if not the member may say mr chairman i request recorded vote and pending that i make point of order that quorum is not present when the member requests recorded vote and at the same time makes point of order that the house rule governing quorums in committee of the whole is beinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs9 violated the chairman is required to act first on the point of order that quorum is not present sometimes called point of quorum he or she counts to ascertain the presence of quorum which is 100 members in committee of the whole if quorum is present recorded vote is ordered only if 25 members have risen to support the request if quorum is not present on the other hand the chairman orders an immediate quorum call members then come to the floor to record their presence giving the representative who is seeking recorded vote the chance to convince 24 or more allies to remain on the floor when the quorum call is concluded and the presence of quorum has been established the chairman returns to the pending request for recorded vote now presumably there are at least 25 members standing to support this request if so recorded vote is ordered in other words member who requests recorded vote in committee of the whole can insist on quorum call if quorum is not actually present in order to increase the chances that 24 others will be on the floor to support the request if the member does make the twopart statement quoted above and then observes that even without quorum being present there are at least 24 other members standing to support the request he or she simply may withdraw the point of order before the chair states that quorum is not present because quorum call is not necessary to achieve the members objective of securing recorded vote once the chair announces the absence of quorum however the point of order may not be withdrawn even by unanimous consent the key difference is that in the house the quorum call and the electronically recorded vote are combined the outcome of the automatic record vote demonstrates the presence of quorum in committee of the whole on the other hand there may be quorum call that is soon followed by recorded vote on the amendment or motion in question the two are not combined first member may insist on quorum call solely for the purpose of increasing his or her chances of obtaining recorde d vote after the quorum call the chairman ascertains if there is sufficient support for ordering recorded vote if there is the vote takes place immediately so only moments may intervene between the end of the quorum call and the beginning of the recorded vote time allowed for electronic votes and quorum calls not less than fifteen minutes when an electronic vote or quorum call is ordered either in the house or in committee of the whole representatives usually have at least 15 minutes to reach the floor and vote or record their presence clause 2a of rule xx so provides the minimum time for record vote or quorum call by electronic device shall be 15 minutes note that 15 minutes is the minimum time it is not fixed or maximum time in practice the time allowed often is extended to allow as many members as possible to be recorded although the speaker or chairman may close vote at any time afterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs10 16procedure in the house p 678679the 15 minutes have elapsed he or she usually will allow at least several more minutes for any members who are route to reach the floor for this reason electronic votes frequently have consumed 20 minutes or longer to try to expedite the houses work members presiding now sometimes state that an electronic vote that is about to begin will be 17 minute vote meaning that members will be allowed only two minutes in addition to the 15 minutes provided by clause 2a the discretion of the chair in deciding how long to leave vote open after the 15minute period has ended could be used to the advantage of the majority party in the case of very close vote the speaker or chairman may close the vote after 15 minute s as soon as his or her side enjoys onevote majority especially when the outcome might be reversed if the vote were left open long enough for other members to reach the floor however speakers have announced that they would not close electronic votes when members are in the chamber seeking to be recorded alternatively the chair could leave vote open for much more than 15 minutes if his or her side is losing close vote and more time is needed to reverse that outcome by persuading members to change their votes or by waiting for more members to arrive and vote during an electronic vote or quorum call members may change their votes or record their presence at any time before the chair announces the result however members vote or presence may not be recorded thereafter the house parliamentarian states that requests to correct the congressional record and the journal on votes taken by electronic device are not entertained it being the responsibility of each member to utilize the safeguards of electronic system and to verify the proper recording of his vote also following the announcement of the result of call of the house conducted by electronic device the speaker declined to entertain requests by members to record their presence16 citations omitted if representative misses an electronic vote he or she may annou nce from the floor how he or she would have voted and by unanimous consent have that statement inserted in the record in proximity to the vote tally reducing the time to five minutes members may be allowed less than 15 minutes to vote by electronic device when one such vote follows immediately after another or when an electronically recorded vote immediately follows quorum call in such circumstances members do not need 15 minutes to participate in the second or subsequent vote because they already are on the floor clause 9 of rule xx identifies three situations in which the speaker has the discretion to reduce the time for an electronic vote in the house from not less than 15 minutes to not less than five minutes 1 if the vote on some matter immediately follows without intervening business record vote on ordering the previous question on that matterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs11 2 if the vote on an amendment reported from committee of the whole immediately follows record vote on another such amendment and 3 if the vote on passing or adopting measure or conference report immediately follows without intervening business record vote on motion to recommit the measure or conference report in addition the speaker can reduce to less than 5 minutes the time for voting on certain questions that he has postponed as discussed in the next sectio n of this report the speaker announces in advance his intention to exercise this discretion in any of these circumstances for example he or she may announce that the vote on adopting resolution will be fiveminute vote if the house agrees by record vote to order the previous question on the resolution the speaker states that the first electronic vote will be 15minute vote and the second one if ordered will be five minute vote in this way members coming to the floor for the first vote are alerted to remain for the second there also are three circumstances in which the time for completing an electronic vote in committee of the whole may be reduced to minimum of five minutes all involve vote occurring immediately after another vote or after quorum call first as discussed above member may request recorded vote in committee of the whole on an amendment and pending that request make point of order that quorum is not present if the chair determines that quorum is not present and orders quorum call he or she also may announce at that time that if recorded vote on the amendment is ordered after the completion of the 15minute quorum call the time for the vote itself will be reduced to five minutes clause 6b3 of rule xviii second if there are going to be votes in committee of the whole on two or more amendments the chairman may announce that there will be at least 15 minutes for the first vote but at least five minutes for each of the succeeding votes so long as business or debate intervenes between each vote clause 6f of rule xviii suppose for example that substitute for first degree amendment has been offered the committee of the whole first will vote on the substitute and then on the first degree amendment as it may have been amended by the substitute the chairman may state that there will be 15minute vote on the substitute to be followed by five minute vote on the first degree amendment if debate occurs and other motions or amendments are offered between the two votes third clause 6g of rule xviii empowers the chairman of the committee of the whole to postpone record votes on separate amendments to bill until later during consideration of the bill and also to cluster the votes on those amendmentsin other words for the committee to vote on the amendments one right after the otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs12 17for several congresses the rules committee frequently included this authority in the special rules it reported for considering individual bills the authority became part of the houses standing rules when the house adopted hres 5 on january 3 2001 the first day of the 107th congressin such cases the chairman may reduce the time for the second and each subsequent vote to less than five minutes17 as noted above clause 2a of rule xx also provides not less than 15 minutes for members to respond to quorum calls in the house but this time may be reduced for quorum calls ordered in committee of the whole the device is what is known informally as notice quorum clause 6c of rule xviii gives the chairman the discretion to announce before quorum call begins that he or she will declare that quorum is constituted as soon as 100 members have recorded their presence when ordering quorum call in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union the chairman may announce an intention to declare that quorum is constituted at any time during the quorum call when he determines that quorum has appeared if the chairman interrupts the quorum call by declaring that quorum is constituted proceeding s under the quorum call shall be considered as vacated and the committee of the whole shall continue its sitting and resume its business however notice quorum cannot be followed by fiveminute recorded vote on an amendment for this reason notice quorums now are relatively uncommon because quorum call in committee of the whole usually takes place in order to secure sufficient support for recorded vote on an amendment if the chairman designates the quorum call as notice quorum the time for voting on the amendment cannot be reduced from at least 15 minutes except by unanimous consent postponing and clustering votes finally the time for members to reach the floor and cast electronic votes in the house may be reduced to not less than five minutes when the speaker exercises his authority under clause 8 of rule xx to postpone and cluster certain votes this authority is in addition to the authority discussed above that rule xviii gives chairmen in committee of the whole to postpone and cluster votes on amendments clause 8 of rule xx gives the speaker the discretion to defer votes on some questions when an electronic vote has been ordered or when point of order has been made against voice or division vote on the ground that quorum was not present the speakers authority applies to votes on 1 adopting resolution or passing bill 2 agreeing to conference report or motion to instruct conferees after they have been appointed 3 agreeing to motion to recommit bill considered on call of the corrections calendarhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs13 18the speaker may redesignate the time for voting so long as the vote takes place within the permi ssible period if vote was postponed after point of order was sustained against voice or division vote because quorum was not present the vote then is taken novo that is the question again is put to voice vote which may be followed by division or electronic vote depending on the will of the house at that time4 ordering the previous question on any of the questions described in 1 3 5 agreeing to an amendment to bill considered on call of the corrections calendar 6 agreeing to the speakers approval of the journal and 7 agreeing to motion to suspend the rules when an electronic vote is ordered on any one of these questions the speaker may announce that he or she is postponing the vote to time he or she designates later on the same legislative day in case of journal vote or within two legislative days in case of any of the other votes the vote or votes are postponed to certain point in the legislative schedule for example after disposition of another bill that is scheduled for consideration when the house reaches that point members vote on the questions in the order in which the votes on them had been postponed18 the first of these votes must be regular 15minute vote before it begins however the speaker may announce that each of the succeeding votes will be fiveminute votes if business intervenes this authority is invoked most often when the house considers on the same day series of motions to suspend the rules if the speaker were not able to postpone and cluster votes on these motions there might be series of electronic votes at more than 40minute intervals the time allowed for debating each motion on monday when many members are in the proce ss of returning to washington from their districts the speakers authority under clause 8 allows him to schedule any such votes for later on monday or to roll them over until tuesday or wednesday when they take place backtoback with only the first vote in the series consuming at least 15 minutes in similar fashion the speaker can postpone and cluster electronic votes that are ordered on suspension motions on tuesdays securing quorum calls and calls of the house the key rule governing attempts to secure the presence of majority of representatives on the floor during meeting of the house is clause 7 of rule xx which states the speaker may not entertain point of order that quorum is not present unless question has been put to vote b subject to subparagraph c the speaker may recog nize member delegate or resident commissioner to move call of the house at any timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs14 19the adoption of this rule which dates from 1977 effectively mooted earlier precedents supporting the right of the speaker to decline to entertain motion for call of the house under the authority of rule xvi clause 1 that dilatory motion may not be entertained by the speaker the adoption of this and related rules changes in the 1970s effectively ended the practice of members repeatedly requiring quorum calls in order to delay transaction of business on the floor for examples of such tactics see deschlers precedents v 5 ch 20 passim 20clause 7c of rule xx quoted above is an exception to this generalization 21the rule also provides that if fewer than 100 members respond to quorum call the committee must rise and the chairman shall report the names of absentees to the house this is very unlikely to happen in the modern housewhen quorum is established pursuant to call of the house further proceedings under the call shall be considered as dispensed with unless the speaker recognizes for motion to compel attendance of members under clause 5b c call of the house shall not be in order after the previous question is ordered unless the speaker determines by actual count that quorum is not present under subparagraph member only has the right to invoke the constitutional quorum requirem ent when vote is taking place at that time any representative may object to the vote on the ground that quorum is not present and make point of order that quorum is not present at any other time the equivalent of quorum call may take place only at the discretion of the speaker when he or she recognizes member to move call of the house19 in the former case the speaker responds to the point of order by counting to determine whether quorum is present if it is he overrules the point of order and quorum call ensues if it is not he sustains the point of order and orders an automatic rollcall vote taken by electronic device in the latter case subparagraph b member makes motion for call of the house prompting what is in effect quorum call to secure the presence of members regardless of whether or not quorum actually was present when it began20 note that the purpose of quorum call under subparagraph or call of the house under subparagraph b is to secure the presence of quorum not to require the attendance of all the members of the house subparagraph b provides that once quorum responds to call of the house further proceedings under the callwhich would be efforts by the sergeantatarms to secure the attendance of all the remaining membersshall be considered as dispensed with unless the speaker decides to entertain motion either for that purpose similarly clause 6b of rule xx quoted earlier provides for the same further proceedings to be dispensed with after quorum call pursuant to subparagraph the corresponding rule governing quorums and quorum calls in committee of the whole is clause 6 of rule xviii it is this rule that 1 sets the quorum in committee of the whole at 100 members 2 authorizes notice quorum calls at the discretion of the chairman and 3 provides for fiveminute votes on amendments following regular quorum calls again at the chairmans discretion21httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs15 22the house may resolve into committee of the whole more than once on the same day each time to consider different measure if so the provisions of this rule apply separately to the consideration of each measure the chairman of the committee of the whole must entertain point of order of quorum during the fivem inute rule if quorum has not yet been established in the committee on the bill then pending and the fact that quorum of the committee has previously been established on another bill on that day is irrelevant during consideration house rules and manual notes accompanying clause 6 of rule xviii 23procedure in the house p 296 24although it is not the duty of the chair to take cognizance of the absence of quorum unless disclosed by vote or questioned by point of quorum failure of quorum to vote on roll call cannot be ignored the chair must announce that fact although it was not objected to from the floor deschlers precedents v 5 p 295in addition the same rule controls when member may make point of order in committee of the whole that quorum is not present calls of the house are not permitted in committee of the whole in brief the rule states that the chairman need not permit point of order of quorum to be made during general debate and once quorum in committee of the whole has been established on any day point of order of quorum may be made only when the chairman has put the pending proposition to vote in other words member has right to insist on the presence of quorum during general debate there is right to make one point of order of quorum if it is made during the amending process that follows general debate but only 1 if there was quorum call during general debate and 2 if this point of order is made before there has been recorded vote on an amendment or motion during that days sitting once quorum call or recorded vote has taken place in committee of the whole on any day memb er has the right to make point of order that quorum is not present only when the committee is in the process of voting22 the parliamentarian has summarized the effect of rule xviii clause 623 to permit point of quorum in committee of the whole other than when the chair is putting the pending question only once on legislative day on each bill considered thereinunder this rule where quorum has been once established in the com mittee of the whole the chair may not entertain point of order of quorum on that day during the consideration of the same bill unless the chair has put the pending motion or proposition to vote citations omitted in the absence of quorum in the unlikely event that majority of the house fails either to respond to quorum call or to participate in an electronic vote the houses failure to comply with the constitutional quorum requirement is demonstrated24 consequently the house cannot resume legislative business until the presence of quorum is recorded the house has only two options one is to adjourn the other is to take steps necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs16 25procedure in the house p 273 26house rules and manual notes accompanying clause 1 of rule iii 27ibidto secure the attendance of quorum in most cases the house can be expected to adopt the second of these options by invoking clause 5 of rule xx this clause provides in part that in the absence of quorum majority comprising at least 15 members which may include the speaker may compel the attendance of absent members in this instance the house can act without quorum being present because the constitutional provision quoted at the beginning of this report authorizes it to do so that provision states that in the absence of quorum smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each house may provide the situation and options in committee of the whole are comparable where the chair has announced the absence of quorum in committee of the whole further business may be conducted until quorum is established or the committee rises25 for much the same reason that the constitution authorizes the house to adjourn without quorum being present clause 6d of house rule xviii states that quorum is not required in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for adoption of motion that the committee rise however quorum is necessary to adopt motion that the committee rise and report measure for final passage in the house individual votes and extraordinary majorities the right and responsibility to vote in general every representative is expected to vote on every question but house rules make an exception for the speaker under clause 7 of rule i the speaker is not required to vote in ordinary legislative proceedings except when his vote would be decisive or when the house is engaged in voting by ballot although this rule does not prevent speakers from voting they usually do not every other member shall vote on each question put unless he has direct personal or pecuniary interest in the event of such question rule iii clause 1 each representative is expected to apply this clause to himself or herself the house parliamentarian observes that it has been found impracticable to enforce the provision requiring every member to vote26 also in recent practice the speaker has held that the member himself and not the chair should determine whether representative has direct personal or pecuniary interest in the outcome of vote the speaker has denied his own power to deprive member of the constitutional right to vote27 furthermore the speaker will not rule on point of order challenging the personal or pecuniary interests of members in pending question buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98988crs17 28procedure in the house p 680will defer to the judgment of each member as to the directness of his interest28 in the same vein clause 10 of rule xxiv the code of official conduct states that member who has been convicted of crime for which he or she may be sentenced to two years or more in prison should refrain from voting in the house or in committee of the whole voting is an individual right and responsibility that cannot be delegated or exercised by anyone else in response to concerns about the possibility of ghost voting in which member would be recorded as having voted even when there was evidence that he or she could not have done so the house voted in 1981 to add what is now clause 2 of rule iii member may not authorize any other person to cast his vote or record his presence in the house or the committee of the whole house on the state of the union b other person may cast members vote or record members presence in the house or the committee of the whole house on the state of the union simple and extraordinary majorities all questions are to be decided on the house floor by simple majority vote unless some constitutional provision or house rule provides otherwise simple majority vote is defined as at least onehalfplusone of the members voting provided that quorum is present clause 1c of rule xx provides that in case of tie vote question shall be lost the constitution requires twothirds vote of the members present and voting for various purposes to expel member to override presidential veto to propose constitutional amendment to remove political disabilities now obsolete to determine that president remains disabled in addition for other purposes house rules require the support of either two thirds or threefifths of the members voting 23 to agree to motion to suspend the rules clause 1a of rule xv 23 to agree to motion to dispense with the call of the private calendar clause 5a
