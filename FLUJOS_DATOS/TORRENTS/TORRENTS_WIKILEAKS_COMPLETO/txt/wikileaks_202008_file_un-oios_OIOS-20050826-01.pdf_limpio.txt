expenditure us 07 million and myanmar red cross s ociety mrcs expenditure us 06 million we also reviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of us 07 million 9 during the audit

office yangon was found excessive although baj administered an annual budget of less than half million us dollars it employed programme manager and one deputy one fi nance officer and two accountants in our opinion the administration and finance func tion could be combined as long as there are assistants for accounting administration and logis tics activities oios recommended that the representation in conjunction with baj complete the review of project staff job descriptions with view to combining responsibilities and hence eliminating redundant posts which could eventually result in achieving cost savings the representation confirmed that after reviewing this matter with baj an agreement had been reached to either abolish the post of programme manager or reduce unhcrs

cumentary evidence from the dealers our review confirmed that two exchange rates the gover nment and the market one should be used and that for government and quasigovernmental partner agencies direct payments in foreign exchange certificates fec whenever possi ble accompanied by proper invoices would provide better internal controls unhcr myanmar indicated that although under the present circumstances only an unofficial policy on foreign exchange transaction could be adopted by the system in myanmar and two differe nt exchange rates would continue to be used the representation would maintain the practic of requesting documentary evidence on the exchange rate used by implementing partners in their transactions it would also encourage partners to use fec as recommended for xample
