crisis introduction for over six years algeria has been plagued by intensely violent conflict resulting from contest for power between islamist political upstarts and an entrenched militarycivilian elite the algiers government has tried both military force and political and economic reforms to end the crisis with little success background1 in october 1988 algerians protested food shortages resulting from years of government mismanagement nd corruption the political system had been dominated since independence in 1962 by single politi cal party the secular national liberation front fln that had become entrenched and viewed as corrupt after the riots then president chadli bendjedid instituted reforms including the legalization of political parties in 1989 in the first multiparty local elections the fundamentalist islamic salvation front fis which sought state governed by islamic law was victorious httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98219crs2 2 there was some islamist violence before 1992 but it cannot be compared to that which followed the cancellation of the election fis then won about 25 of the vote and 188 out of 430 seats contested in the first round of voting for parliament in december 1991 it was expected to win over majority of the seats in the legislature in sec ond round before that round could be held however the army intervened in january 1992 forced bendjedid to resign and canceled the election an extraconstitutional high state council took over with army officers clearly in charge despite civilian figureheads fis was banned and its leaders imprisoned as the political path was closed militant islamists resorted to violence2 which was countered by that of the state thousands of innocent algerians have been caught in the middle estimates of the number of

failure for which he said the fis leaders reluctance to disavow violence was responsible powerful group of socalled eradicators in the army intent on eliminating islamism in algeria also may have blocked political accommodation after appearing to tack between eradicationist and accommodationist views zeroual vowed to struggle against terro rism until final eradication islamists algerian islamists vary fis operated as political party with politicalreligious goals when it was banned in 1992 its two main leaders abassi madani and ali belhadj were imprisoned the younger fiery belhad j

permitted by the government the 1998 ramadan approximate ly january massacres intensif ied internationa l attention on algeria the united nations many g overnments and human rights groups called for an inquiry into the situation because solid information was lacking they argued that the governments credibility would benefit if an i nquiry eliminated suspicions of its complicity algiers responded that an inqui ry would be an unacceptable interference in its domestic affairs and propaganda vehicle to blame security forces and legitimize terrorists the european union eu europ ean parliament some european governments and canada sent factfinders but algiers controlled their visits by selecting domestic interlocutors extracting promises that the visitors would not meet fis representatives and preventing visits to massacre sites algeria demanded that the europeans control terrorist networks operating in their countries the europeans promised to comply but made demands on the algerians in retu rn the human rights commission annual meeting in marchap ril was silent on the situation in algeria to the dismay of the human rights community the algerian government resisted calls for an inquiry but it took preemptive actions to show it was in control arre sting few local officials and over 100 militia members in april for complicity in massacres and other human rights abuses after the g8 group of world economic powers urged it to be more open in may however algiers may have become concerned about the impact its stonewalling policy might have on needed foreign investment for whatever reason secretary general kofi annan surprisingly announced on july 2 that ve ry highlevel factfinding mission led by former portuguese prime mini ster mario soares and including former jordanian prime minister abdelkarim kabariti former indian prime minister ik gujral former french secretary of state and president of the european parliament simone weil former us ambassador to the

delegation met with president zeroual government ministers political party leaders editors directors of human rights groups and other government critics and lawyers for fis but not with outlawed fis leaders the delegation visite d sites of two massacres and prison where an infamous slaughter of islamists had ccurred in 1994 the soares group will report its findings to the secretary general but will not make any recommendations the cannot interfere unbidden in the domes tic affairs of member state the entire inquiry issue may disguise di sinclination in the international community to act and to hold the algerian government accountable while concerned about the violence western governments believe that they have little policy leverage and are unwilling to exercise what leverage they have with algiers the eu has the greatest potential influence because it has the biggest carrot algeria wants an association or preferential agreement with the eu from which it would gain trade aid and other benefits negotiations are underway but the eu has not made an accord conditional on noneconomic concessions by algiers in hum an rights transpar ency or accountab ility some european governments
