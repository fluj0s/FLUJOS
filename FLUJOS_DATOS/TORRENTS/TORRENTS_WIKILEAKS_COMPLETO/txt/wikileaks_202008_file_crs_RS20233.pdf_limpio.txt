legislative process government and finance division the rules of the house include rule that lays out the daily order of business on the house floor in practice however the house never follows this rule as it decides what legislative business it will transact and whe n all of the legislative business that the house conducts is brought to the floor in ways that interrupt the da ily order of business as defined by clause 1 of rule xiv for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml this rule provides that each daily session of the house is to begin with prayer followed by the reading and approval of the journal which documents the previous days proceedings and the pledge of allegiance th rule then lists six other kinds of business and the order in which the house is to tran sact them each day however other house rules and certain precedents allow members to interrupt these six kinds of business so that the house can act on specific kinds of meas ures and motions measure or motion is called privileged if it can interrupt the regular order of business as defined in rule xiv in practice all the legislative matters that the house considers during its floor sessions are brought up as privileged interruptions of the regular order of business certain matters are privileged for floor consideration at any time others are privileged only after prior notification to the house or after they have been available in writing to members for certain periods of time still others are privileged on certain days of the week or on certain days of each month or after certain date of each year in addition the house always can agree to nimous consent request that it act on some matter usually noncontrove rsial one that otherwise would not be privileged for floor consideration at that time for example clause 5a of rule xiii grants certain co mmittees leave to report at any time on certain kinds of measures within their jurisdictions once one of these measures is reported from committee it becomes privileged for floor consideration immediately or eventually under this rule for instance special rule reported by the rules committee becomes privileged on the day after the committee reports it under the same rule general appropriations bill becomes privileged three days after being reported but continuing appr opriations resolution is priv ileged only after september 15 of each year other rules nd precedents grant privilege to such matters as conference reports resolutions assigning members to house committees and resolutions raising ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20233crs2 question of the privileges of the house unde r rule ix once any such matter becomes eligible for consideration th appropriate member or in some cases any member can call it up for floor action when th ere is other matter pending rule xv designates certain days of each week or month on which special procedures take precedence over the regular order of business for example motions to suspend the rules are privileged on every monday tues day and wednesday whereas motions to discharge committees must be listed on their calendar for at least seven days and then are privileged on the second and four th mondays of each month the same rule also grants privilege on certain days to measures on the private calendar to bills that committees call up on calendar wednesday and to district of columbia bills that the committee on oversight and government reform has reported because of the houses reliance on this sy stem of privileged business there really is such thing as typical day on the house floor except for the nonlegislative proceedings that take place at the beginning nd end of the day each daily session begins with the prayer the approval of the journal and the pledge of allegiance these opening proceedings usually are followed by some oneminute speeches th at allow members to comment on current legislative or other matters however the speaker can control how many oneminute speeches are permitted on each day or decline to allow any at all after completion of legislative business on each da there usually is period of time for specialorder speeches arranged by unanimous consent during which members who have requested to do so can speak for as much as an hour each on subjects of their choice between oneminute speeches and speci alorder speeches the houses floor schedule of legislative busine ss depends on what kinds of pr ivileged matters are in order on that day and what specific privileged matters are ready for consideration as well as on the sequence in which the majority partys l eaders propose that the house consider them with few exceptions the majority party acting through the speaker or its majority on the rules committee retains the ability to control the daily floor schedule by determining the sequence in which the house takes up various items of privileged business the flow of business on the house floor also depends on the day of the week and the time of the year the house tends to be in session more often and for longer hours during the middle of the week than on mondays and fridays also the house tends to meet more often and for longer hour s later during the year than during the first months of each session when much of the houses legislativ work is being done in committee as the end of each session of congress approaches the house sometimes meets in extended floor sessions finally the house typically c onducts certain kinds of legislative business during certain months of the year for exam ple the house is exp ected to act on budget resolution during the spring and the floor sc hedule during the months of june and july often is dominated by the houses initia l consideration of the annual general appropriations bills by the same token durin g the last weeks of september the house frequently has been preoccupied with the ne ed to complete the appropriations process before the new fiscal year begins on october 1
