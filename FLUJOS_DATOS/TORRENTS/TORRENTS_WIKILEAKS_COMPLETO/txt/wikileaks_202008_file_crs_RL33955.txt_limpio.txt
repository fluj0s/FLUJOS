orourke specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division navy force structure alternative force structure studies of 2005 background for congress summary this crs report summarizes three studies submitted to congress in 2005 on potential future navy ship force structures and is intended as lasting reference source on these three studies two of the three studies were conducted in response to section 216 of the conference report hrept 108354 of november 7 2003 on the fy2004 defense authorization act hr 1588pl 108136 of november 24 2003 the two studies were conducted by the center for naval analyses cna and the office of force transformation oft which was then part of the office of the secretary of defense they were submitted to the congressional defense committees in february 2005 the third study was conducted by the center for strategic and budgetary assessments csba an independent defensepolicy research organization on its own initiative the study was made available to congressional and other audiences in march 2005 the cna study presents fairly traditional approach to naval force planning in which capability requirements for warfighting and for maintaining daytoday naval forward deployments are calculated and then integrated the cnarecommended force parallels fairly closely navy thinking at the time on the size and composition of the fleet this is perhaps not surprising given that much of cnas analytical work is done at the navys request the oft study fundamentally challenges current navy thinking on the size and composition of the fleet and presents an essentially cleansheet proposal for future navy that would be radically different from the currently planned fleet this is perhaps not surprising given both ofts institutional role within dod as leading promoter of military transformation and the views of retired navy admiral arthur cebrowski the director of oft until january 31 2005 regarding network centric warfare and distributed force architectures oft was disestablished on october 1 2006 and its activities were transferred to other dod offices the csba study challenges current navy thinking on the size and composition of the fleet more dramatically than the cna report and less dramatically than the oft report compared to the cna and oft reports the csba report contains more detailed

force structure studies of 2005 background for congress introduction this crs report summarizes three studies submitted to congress in 2005 on potential future navy ship force structures and is intended as lasting reference source on these three studies the contents of this crs report previously appeared as an appendix to another crs report1 two of the three studies were conducted in response to section 216 of the conference report hrept 108354 of november 7 2003 on the fy2004 defense authorization act hr 1588pl 108136 of november 24 2003 which required the secretary of defense to provide for two independently performed studies on potential future fleet platform architectures ie potential force structure plans for the navy2 the two studies were conducted by the center for naval analyses cna and the office of force transformation oft which was then part of the office of the secretary of defense and were submitted to the congressional defense committees in february 2005 oft

those planned by the navy the report recommends navy force structure range of 256 to 380 ships the low end of the range assumed greater use of crew rotation and overseas homeporting of navy ships than the high end table 1 below compares the cnarecommended force range to the navys 375ship fleet proposal of 20022004 and the notional 260 and 325ship fleets for fy2035 presented in march 2005 navy

report to congress regarding naval force architecture center for naval analyses crm d0011303a21rev jan 2005 crs3 oft report4 the oft report employs eight new ship designs that differ substantially from the designs of most ships currently in the fleet under construction or planned for procurement among the eight new ship designs were four types of large surface ships that would be built from common relatively inexpensive merchantlike hull design developed in 2004 for the navys maritime prepositioning force future analysis of alternatives these four types of ships which would all displace 57000 tons include an aircraft carrier that would embark notional air wing of 30 joint strike fighters jsfs 6 mv22 osprey tiltrotor aircraft and 15 unmanned air vehicles uavs the total of 36 manned aircraft is about half as many as in todays carrier air wings and the oft architecture envisaged substituting two of these new carriers for each of todays carriers this new carrier would also have support spaces for unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs unmanned surface vehicles usvs and mission modules for the 1000ton surface combatant described below missileandrocket ship that would be equipped with 360 vertical launch system vls missile tubes and 4 trainable rocket launchers additional spaces on this ship could be used to support uuvs usvs and mission modules for the 1000ton surface combatant alternatively these spaces could be used to provide limited stowage and working space for the 100ton surface combatant described below and mission modules for these 100ton ships an amphibious assault ship that would embark notional air wing of either 30 ch46 equivalents or 6 jsfs 18 mv22s and 3 gyrocopter heavylift helicopters it would also have spaces for marine corps equipment unmanned vehicles and mission modules for the 1000ton surface combatant mother ship for small combatants that would contain stowage and support spaces for the 100ton surface combatant described below the four other newdesign ships in the oft architecture are 13500ton aircraft carrier based on conceptual surface effect ship sescatamaran hull design developed in 2001 by team at the naval postgraduate school this ship would embark notional air wing of 8 jsfs 2 mv22s and 8 uavs the total of 10 manned 4 us department of defense office of the secretary of defense alternative fleet

crs4 aircraft is roughly oneeighth as many as in todays carrier air wings and the oft architecture envisages substituting eight of these new carriers for each of todays carriers this new ship would have maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots 1000ton surface combatant with maximum speed of 40 to 50 knots and standard interfaces for accepting various modular mission packages these ships would selfdeploy to the theater and would be supported in theater by one or more of the 57000ton ships described above 100ton surface combatant with maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for accepting various modular mission packages these ships would be transported to the theater by the 57000ton mother ship and would be supported in theater by that ship and possibly also the 57000ton missileandrocket ship nonnuclearpowered submarine equipped with an air independent propulsion aip system these aip submarines would be lowercost supplements to the navys nuclearpowered submarines ssns and would be transported from home port to the theater of operations by transport ships the oft architecture envisaged substituting four of these submarines for the ssn in each carrier strike group5 the 1000 and 100ton surface combatants would be built as relatively inexpensive sea frames like the littoral combat ship lcs the oft report combines these eight types of ships plus the navys currently planned taoeclass resupply ship into fleet that would include much larger total number of ships than planned by the navy about the same number of carrierbased aircraft as planned by the navy and large numbers of unmanned systems the oft report presents three alternative versions of this fleet which the report called alternatives b and c the report calculates that each of these alternatives would be equal in cost to the equivalent parts of the navys 375ship proposal each of these alternative force structures like the equivalent parts of the navys 375ship proposal would be organized into 12 carrier strike groups csgs 12 expeditionary strike groups esgs and 9 surface strike groups ssgs the three alternative force structures are shown in table 2 below 5 the report states that alternatives to the ssns in formations were diesel air independent propulsion aip submarines and unmanned undersea vehicles uuvs the aip submarines were substituted for virginia class ssns on cost basis of roughly four to one these submarines could be nuclearpowered if they are designed and built based upon competitive cost suppressing business model page 60 the strategy of transporting the aip submarines to the theater using transport ships is not mentioned in the report but was explained at february 18 2005 meeting between crs and analysts who contributed to the oft report crs5 table 2 alternative fleet

case due to an error in those copies in calculating the numbers of ships in the 12 carrier strike groups the totals shown in the table do not include ssns cruise missile submarines ssgns and ballistic missile submarines ssbns operating independently of the 12 csgs 12 esgs and 9 ssgs the totals also do not include combat logistics ships other than the taoes eg oilers ammunition ships and general stores ships and fleet support ships the navys 375ship proposal by comparison included all these kinds of ships as also can be seen from the table the difference between alternatives and b is that the former uses 1000ton surface combatants while the latter uses 100ton surface combatants that are transported into the theater by mother ships and the difference between alternatives b and c is that the former uses 57000ton aircraft carriers while the latter substituted 13500ton carriers csba report6 the csba report uses many of the same ship designs currently planned by the navy but also proposes some new ship designs the csba report also proposed ship formations that in some cases are different than those planned by the navy table 3 below compares the csbarecommended force structure to cnas

the army and air force and 91 large medium and fastresponse ie small cutters planned for procurement under the coast guard deepwater acquisition program crs7 the csba report makes numerous specific recommendations for ship force structure and ship acquisition including the following aircraft carriers when the george hw bush cvn77 enters service in 2008 or 2009 retire the two remaining conventional carriers the kitty hawk cv63 and the kennedy cv67 convert the enterprise cvn65 into an afloat forward staging base afsb with mixed activereservecivilian crew to be used in peacetime for aviation testing and in crises for embarking special operations forces army or marine corps forces or joint air wings begin replacing the 10 nimitz cvn68 class carriers on onefor one basis with cvn21class carriers procured once every five years using incremental funding redesignate the lhar as medium sized carrier cve and procure one every three years starting in fy2007 using incremental funding7 submarines maintain virginiaclass ssn procurement at one per year for the next several years producing an eventual total of perhaps 20 virginiaclass boats begin immediately to design new undersea superiority system with procurement cost 50 to 67 that of the virginiaclass design with the goal of achieving procurement rate of two or three of these boats per year later than fy2019 study options for extending the service lives of the three seawolf ssns and the 31 final angelesclass ssns to mitigate the projected drop in ssn force levels during the 2020s reduce the ssbn force from 14 ships to 12 ships and convert an additional two ssbns into ssgns for total of six ssgns study the option of reducing the ssbn force further to 10 ships which would permit another two ssbns to be converted into ssgns for total of eight ssgns8 destroyers and cruisers procure single ddg1000 in fy2007 using research and development funding as the first of three surface combatant technology demonstrators start design competition for next generation modular surface combatant or family of combatants with capabilities equal to or greater than the ddg1000cgx but with substantially lower procurement cost 7 csba report slides 154158 8 csba report slides 276 284 289 297 299 crs8 build two additional surface combatant technology demonstrators to compete against the ddg1000 design use the results of this competition to inform the design of new surface combatant called scx with procurement cost perhaps one third to onehalf that of the ddg1000 begin procuring this new design in fy2015 as replacement for the ddg1000cgx program consider modifying the lpd17 design into lowcost naval surface fire support ship carrying the advanced gun system ags that was to be carried by the ddg1000 consider procuring two additional ddg51s to help support the surface combatant industrial base in the nearterm9 littoral combat ships and coast guard deepwater cutters procure six lcss per year for total of 84 lcss 42 of the lockheed design and 42 of the general dynamics design organize these 84 ships into 42 divisions each consisting of one lockheed ship and one general dynamics ship so that each division can benefit from the complementary strengths of the two designs ensure that mission packages for the lcs and mission packages for the coast guards large and medium deepwater cutters are as mutually compatible as possible include the coast guards deepwater cutters when counting ships that contribute to the countrys total fleet battle network begin research and development and experimentation program aimed at building several competing stealth surface combatant technology demonstrators for operations in contested or denied access waters10 amphibious ships complete lhd8 to create force of eight lhds rather than stopping procurement of lpd17s after the ninth ship in fy2007 as now planned by the navy increase the lpd17 procurement rate to two ships per year and use multiyear procurement myp to procure total of 24 lpd17s retire the 12 existing lsd4149 class ships leaving 32ship amphibious fleet consisting of eight lhds and 24 lpd17s 9 csba report slides 246 249 and 251253 slide 249 states that possibilities for reducedcost alternative to the ddg1000 include surface combatant based on the lpd17 design semisubmersible ship built to commercial standards like ship called the stryker that was proposed several years ago and large or medium carrier of large objects perhaps built to relaxed commercial standards 10 csba report slides 275 277 and 283 crs9 form eight distributed expeditionary strike bases each of which would include one lhd three lpd17s one aegis cruiser three aegis destroyers two lcss and one ssgn11 mpf and other ships retain the three existing mpf squadrons over the near to midterm reconfigure two of the squadrons for irregular warfare use the third squadron as swing asset to either reinforce the two irregularwarfare squadrons or to provide lift for assault followon echelon amphibious landing forces develop highspeed intratheater and shiptoshore surface connectors design an attack cargo ship taka to help support sustained joint operations ashore with target unit procurement cost of 500 million or less and begin procuring this ship in fy2014 replace the two existing hospital ships the four existing command ships and existing support tenders with new ships based on the lpd17 design initiate joint experimental program for future seabasing platforms and technologies12 the csba report raises several questions about the navys emerging sea basing concept for conducting expeditionary operations ashore the report states the work done thus far on sea basing is intriguing but neither the concept nor the supporting technologies appear sufficiently mature to justify any nearterm decisions such as canceling lpd17 procurement in favor of mpff ships or removing the well deck from the big deck amphibious assault platforms both of which would severely curtail the fleets ability to launch surface assaults over the longer term given these large uncertainties major moves toward the sea basing vision should be made without further exploring the sea basing concept itself and experimenting with different numbers and types of sea base platforms connectors and capabilities13 observations observations about the cna oft and csba reports can be made on several points including the following organizations and authors analytical approach 11 csba report slides 227 and 236 12 csba report slides 228232 and 307 13 csba report slide 212 crs10 use of prospective shipprocurement funding levels as force planning consideration fleet size and structure whether the recommended force qualifies as an alternative fleet architecture fleet capability transition risks and implications for the industrial base each of these is discussed below organizations and authors cna report cna is federally funded research and development center ffrdc that does much of its analytical at the navys request the cna reports discussion of how crew rotation may alter forcelevel requirements for maintaining daytoday forward deployments is somewhat detailed and may have been adapted from other work that cna has done on the topic for the navy oft report the oft report was prepared under the direction of retired navy admiral arthur cebrowski who was the director of oft from october 29 2001 until january 31 2005 and the president of the naval war college nwc from july 24 1998 to august 22 2001 during his time at nwc and oft cebrowski was leading proponent of networkcentric warfare and distributed force architectures csba report the csba report was prepared by robert work csbas analyst for maritime issues csba describes itself as an independent policy research institute established to promote innovative thinking about defense planning and investment strategies for the 21st century csbas analyticbased research makes clear the inextricable link between defense strategies and budgets in fostering more effective and efficient defense and the need to transform the us military in light of an emerging military revolution14 csbas executive director is dr andrew f krepinevich jr whose previous experience includes work in dods office of net assessment the office directed by andrew marshall krepinevich is generally considered major writer on defense transformation analytical approach cna report the cna report grounds its analysis in traditional dod force planning considerations and campaign modeling the report cites past dod force planning studies that reflect similar approaches the implicit argument in the cna report is that its findings have weight in part because they reflect wellestablished and systematic approach to the problem 14 see csbas website httpwwwcsbaonlineorg crs11 oft report in contrast to the cna report the oft report calls into question the viability of the longstanding logic of naval force building15 the oft report grounds its analysis in four major forcedesign principles that the report identifies as responsive to future strategic challenges and technological opportunities16 the report then seeks to design fleet that it is consistent with these principles and assesses that fleet using new set of metrics that the report believes to be consistent with these principles the implicit argument in the oft report is that its findings have weight in part because they reflect major forcedesign principles that respond to future strategic challenges and technological opportunities csba report the csba report employs an extensive historical analysis of the missions and structure of the us navy and other navies the report argues that the structure of the us navy has shifted over time in response to changes in technology and us security challenges and that us military forces have entered new security era which the report calls the joint expeditionary era during which the us navy will need to do three things17 to do these three things the report argues the navy should be structured to include four different force elements18 the report constructs these four force elements and then combines them to arrive at an overall recommended navy force structure the implicit argument in the csba report is that its findings have weight in part because they reflect insights about future missions and force requirements gained through careful historical analysis of the missions and structure of the us navy and other navies prospective shipprocurement funding levels as consideration cna report the cna report aimed at designing costeffective fleet it also mentions cost estimates relating to the option of homeporting additional attack submarines at guam19 prospective shipprocurement funding levels however are not prominently featured in the cna report as forceplanning consideration oft report prospective shipprocurement funding levels are significant forceplanning consideration in the oft report the report argues that an important metric for assessing proposed fleet architecture is the ease or difficulty with which it can be scaled up or down to adapt to changes in shipprocurement funding levels 15 oft report p 1 16 the principles are complexity smaller ships and improved payload fraction networkcentric warfare and modularity 17 these three things are 1 contribute to the global war on terrorism gwot 2 prepare for possible nucleararmed regional competitors and 3 hedge against the possibility of disruptive maritime competition with china 18 these four force elements are 1 seabased powerprojection and regional deterrence force 2 global patrol gwot and homeland defense force 3 force for prevailing over enemy antiaccessareadenial forces and 4 strategic deterrence and dissuasion force 19 cna report p 36 crs12 the oft report contains fairly detailed discussion of the navys budget situation that calls into question on several grounds the navys prospective ability to afford its 375ship proposal the report concludes that funding for navy ship procurement in future years may fall as much as 40 short of what would be needed to achieve the navys 375ship fleet proposal if the shortfall is 40 the report estimates the navy could maintain force of 270 to 315 ships which is comparable in number to todays force of 282 ships except that the future force would include substantial number of relatively inexpensive lcss if proportionate reductions are applied to the oft fleets shown in table 2 alternative would include 402 to 469 ships alternative b would include 557 to 650 ships and alternative c would include 609 to 711 ships again these totals would not include certain kinds of ships independently operating ssns etc that are included in the total of 270 to 315 ships associated with the navys currently planned architecture csba report as with the oft report prospective shipprocurement funding levels are significant forceplanning consideration in the csba report the csba report estimates that in future years the navy may have an average of about 10 billion per year in shipacquisition funding the report then aims at designing force whose ships could be acquired for this average annual amount of funding fleet size and structure cna report the 380ship fleet at the high end of the cna range is similar in size and composition to the navys 375ship fleet proposal the 256ship fleet at the low end of the cna range is similar in size and composition to the navys 260 ship fleet for fy2035 except that the 260ship fleet has more lcss and fewer ships in the other ships category20 oft report the oftrecommended fleet would have much larger total number of ships than the navys planned fleet the oft fleet would also feature much larger share of small combatants of the ships shown in table 2 the small combatants account for about 75 in alternative about 79 in alternative b and about 72 in alternative c adding into the mix ssns and other kinds of ships not shown in table 2 would reduce these percentages somewhat in the navys notional 260 and 325ship fleets by contrast lcss account for about 25 of the total number of ships the oft architecture is similar in certain ways to fleet architecture proposed by the naval surface warfare center nswc between 1989 and 1992 and sometimes referred to as the carrier of large objects clo proposal the nswc architecture like the oft architecture employed common hull design for large 20 additional points of comparison the cna range of 256 to 380 ships overlaps with potential ranges of 290 to 375 ships 260 to 325 ships and 243 to 302 ships presented in the navys february 2005 testimony to congress the midpoint of the cnarecommended range 318 ships is similar in terms of total numbers of ships to the 310ship fleet from the 2001 quadrennial defense review qdr unlike the 2001 qdr fleet however the cnarecommended force includes several dozen littoral combat ships lcss and smaller numbers of other kinds of ships crs13 ship that could be built in several variants for various missions including aviation missile launching and fire support amphibious warfare logistics support and mothership support of small fast surface combatants the small fast surface combatants in the nswc architecture were called scout fighters and were in the same general size range as the 100 and 1000ton surface combatants in the oft architecture21 csba report the csba force would have about the same total number of ships as the navys 375ship fleet proposal csbas subtotals for some ship categories are similar to subtotals in one or more of the other fleet proposals shown in table 1 significant differences between the csba proposal and the other fleet proposals shown in table 3 include the four mediumsized aircraft carriers cves the conversion of carrier into an afloat forward staging base the composition of the cruiserdestroyer force which would include scxs rather than ddg1000s and cgxs the composition of the amphibious fleet which would have additional lpd17s in lieu of todays lsd4149s and the composition of the maritime prepositioning force which would continue to include for time at least todays mpf ships rather than the navys planned mpff ships does it qualify as an alternative force architecture cna report as mentioned earlier the cna report uses essentially the same kinds of ships and naval formations as those planned by the navy if an alternative fleet platform architecture is defined as one that uses ship types or naval formations that differ in some significant way from those currently used or planned then the cnarecommended force arguably would not qualify as an alternative fleet platform architecture oft report since the oft report proposes building ships that are substantially different from those currently planned and combines them ships into formations which although similar in name to currently planned formations ie csgs esgs and ssgs might be viewed by some observers as substantially different in composition from the currently planned versions of these formations the 21 for more on this proposed fleet architecture see norman polmar carrying large objects us naval institute proceedings december 1990 pp 121122 michael l bosworth et multimission ship

arguably would qualify as an alternative fleet platform architecture though less dramatically so than the oftrecommended force new ship designs cna report the cna report does not propose any ship designs other than those already planned by the navy oft report the 57000ton aircraft carrier in the oft report would be roughly the same size as the united kingdoms new aircraft carrier design and somewhat larger than the us navys 40000ton lhalhdtype amphibious assault ships compared to the us navys aircraft carriers which displace 81000 to 102000 tons this ship could be considered mediumsize carrier the 57000ton missileandrocket ship in the oft report could be considered similar in some respects to the navydarpa arsenal ship concept of 19961997 which would have been large relatively simple surface ship equipped with about 500 vls tubes22 the 13500ton aircraft carrier in the oft report would be slightly larger than thailands aircraft carrier which was commissioned in 1997 and somewhat smaller than spains aircraft carrier which was based on us design and was commissioned in 1988 due to its sescatamaran hull design this 13500ton ship would be much faster than the thai and spanish carriers or any other aircraft carrier now in operation and might have larger flight deck this ship could be considered small highspeed aircraft carrier the 1000 and 100ton surface combatants in the oft report could be viewed as similar to but smaller than the 2500 to 3000ton littoral combat ship lcs compared to the lcs they would be closer in size to the streetfighter concept precursor to the lcs that was proposed by retired admiral cebrowski during his time at the naval war college the aip submarine in the oft report could be similar to aip submarines currently being developed and acquired by some foreign navies 22 for more on the arsenal ship see crs report 97455 navydarpa arsenal ship program issues and options for congress by ronald orourke and crs report 971044 navydarpa

the proposal in the csba report for an afloat forward staging base afsb is similar to other proposals for afsbs that have been reported in recent years though other proposals have suggested using commercial ships or military sealift ships rather than converted aircraft carriers as the basis for the afsb23 the cve in the csba report like the 57000ton carrier in the oft report can be viewed as mediumsized carrier with full load displacement of perhaps about 40000 tons the cve would be somewhat smaller than the 57000ton carrier and consequently might embark smaller air wing the cve however would be based on the lhar amphibious ship design rather than merchantlike hull and consequently could incorporate more survivability features than the 57000ton carrier fleet capability cna report the cna report uses essentially the same kinds of ships and formations as planned by the navy and recommends generally the same numbers of ships as function of forceplanning variables such as use of crew rotation as consequence the cnarecommended force range would be roughly similar in overall capability to the navys planned architecture oft report the oft architecture differs so significantly from the navys planned architecture that assessing its capability relative to the navys planned architecture is not easy as general matter the oft report stresses overall fleet survivability more than individualship survivability and argues that fleet effectiveness can be enhanced by presenting the enemy with complex task of having to detect track and target large numbers of enemy ships the oft report argues that in addition to warfighting capability fleet can be judged in terms of its capability for adapting to changes in strategic demands and funding levels24 23 see for example stephen m

argues that its recommended fleet architecture would provide quantum leap ahead in capabilities against spectrum of enemies ranging from large highly developed competitors to small but determined asymmetric adversaries page 6 and be adaptable in dynamic and lesspredictable security environment to changing strategic or operational challenges be capable of both participating in joint expeditionary operations and maintaining the strategic advantage the navy has developed in the global continued crs16 readers who agree with most or all of these propositions might conclude that the oftrecommended architecture would be more capable than the navys planned architecture readers who disagree with most or all of these propositions might conclude that the oftrecommended architecture would be less capable than the navys planned architecture readers who agree with some of these propositions but not others or who agree with these propositions up to certain point but less fervently than oft might conclude that the oftrecommended architecture might be roughly equal in total capability to the navys planned architecture in addressing the question of fleet capability the oft report states alternative fleet formations consisting of small fast and relatively inexpensive craft combining knowledge and attaining flexibility through networking appear superior to the programmed fleet for nontraditional warfare in variety of settings this is due to increasing the complexity the enemy faces and increasing us fleet options that in turn reduce enemy options the speed and complexity of the alternative fleets can provide them with the capability to complicate and possibly defeat the attempts of nontraditional adversaries to elude surveillance the enemy could have difficulty determining what to expect and how to defeat them all the superior speed and more numerous participants than in the programmed fleet provide stronger intelligence base and more numerous platforms from which to conduct strikes and interceptions this appears to be true even if the smaller craft are individually somewhat less capable and less able to sustain hit than the larger ships in the programmed fleet if these circumstances are not achieved and the enemy can continue to elude and deceive the navys programmed fleet often is as good as the oft alternatives sometimes even better it is not necessarily better in cases in which 24 continued commons avoiding need to choose between optimizing the fleet for performance against asymmetric challenges at the expense of its ability to confront potential adversary capable of traditional high intensity conflictsuch as china pages 1 and 2 pose significant challenges to adversaries seeking to counter us naval forces due to the large numbers of combat entities that the enemy must deal with great variety of platforms with which the enemy must contend speed different combinations of forces distribution of forces across large areas and adversary uncertainty as to the mission and capabilities of given platform page i permit more constant experimentation with new operational concepts and thereby achieve higher rates of learning about how to evolve the fleet over time and recognize potential future constraints on navy budgets and make the navy more smoothly scalable to various potential future resource levels by shifting from fleet composed of limited numbers of relatively expensive ships to one composed of larger numbers of less expensive ships crs17 individual ship survivability dominates perhaps counterintuitive result until we realize that fleet survivability not individual ship survivability is what dominates an area in which programmed fleets might have an advantage would be when the long loiter time or deep reach of ctol conventional takeoff and landing aircraft on programmed bigdeck cvns nuclearpowered aircraft carriers is needed that said there need be great sacrifice with airborne tanking the vstol very short takeoff and landing aircraft in the alternatives could meet the deep strike and long loiter demands also as mentioned earlier combination of advances in emals electromagnetic aircraft launch system and modifications to the jsf will make it possible to launch the jsf with only marginal rangepayload capability penalty moreover trends in technology are providing unmanned aircraft greater capability including greater loiter time and sensor capability25 csba report the csba report argues that its architecture would provide total capability equal to that of the navys planned architecture but at lower total cost because the csba architecture would employ new ship designs such the new undersea superiority system and the scx that because of their newer technologies would cost less than but be equal in capability to current designs such as the virginiaclass ssn and ddg1000 destroyer and make more use of the lpd17 hull design whose basic design costs have already been paid and which can be produced efficiently in large numbers and adapted economically to meet various mission requirements it is plausible that using newer technologies would permit new reducedcost ship designs to be more capable than such designs would have been in the past whether the increases in capability would always be enough to permit these ships to be equal in capability to more expensive current designs is less clear the navy may be able to achieve this with new ssn design because several new submarine technologies have emerged since the virginiaclass design was developed in the 1990s but achieving this with new large surface combatant design could be more challenging because the ddg1000 design was developed within the last few years and few new surface combatant technologies may have emerged since that time if one or more of the reducedcost designs turn out to be less capable than current designs then the csba architecture would not generate as much total capability as the report projects the csba report also argues that its architecture would produce force with mix of capabilities that would better fit future strategic demands to achieve this the report recommends among other things reducing currently planned nearterm procurement of new destroyers and mpff ships increasing currently planned procurement of new amphibious ships and changing the currently planned investment mix for aircraft carriers 25 oft report pp 7576 italics as in the original crs18 readers who agree with csbas description of future strategic demands and who agree that csbas recommended investment changes respond to those demands might conclude that the csbarecommended architecture would be better optimized than the navys planned architecture to meet future needs readers who disagree with one or both of these propositions might conclude that the navys planned architecture might be better optimized or that neither architecture offers clear advantages in this regard implementation risks cna report implementation risks associated with the force recommended in the cna report include developing and designing the various types of ships included in the plan including in particular the ddg1000 destroyer which is to incorporate number of new technologies and the issue of whether navy funding levels in coming years would be adequate to build and maintain the recommended fleet oft report the oft report does not include detailed plan for transitioning from todays fleet architecture to its proposed architecture26 but such plan could be developed as followon analysis the plan could involve replacing existing ship designs and associated formations as they retire with ofts recommended new ship designs and associated formations implementation risks associated with the force recommended in the oft report include developing and designing the eight new types of ships included in the plan including the four types of large ships based on the 57000ton commerciallike hull the 13500ton sescatamaran aircraft carrier since it would be much larger than other sescatamaran ships the aip submarine since the aip technology is relatively new and nonnuclearpowered submarine has not been designed and built for the us navy since the 1950s and the 1000 and 100ton surface combatants since new technologies are needed to achieve the increased payload fraction that these ships are to have the oftrecommended 26 on the topic of transitioning to the proposed fleet architecture the report states implementation of the alternative fleet architecture should start now and should target option generation short construction time and technology insertion the alternative further provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the shipbuilding industrial base the many smaller ships manned and unmanned in the alternative fleet architecture could be built in more shipyards and would be relevant to overseas markets the potential longevity of the existing fleet will sustain existing shipyards as they move into building smaller ships more rapidly in this broader market and more competitive environment the shipyards would develop competence broad relevance and operate in an environment driven by market imperatives instead of framework of laws that frustrates market forces as the new ships enter service and the fleet has the opportunity to experiment with new operational concepts expanded networkcentric warfare in particular existing ships can be retired sooner to capture operations savings at this point the sooner the existing fleet is retired the sooner the benefits of the alternative fleet architecture design will accrue page 3 additional general discussion of implementation is found on pp 7677 of the report crs19 force could pose implementation risks due to the new kinds of naval formations that would be used which could require development of new doctrine concepts of operations and tactics csba report stated goal of the csba report is to provide detailed practical transition road map for shifting from todays fleet structure to the reports recommended fleet structure the many specific recommendations made in the report could be viewed as forming such road map implementation risks associated with the force recommended in the csba report include developing and designing the reducedcost ssn and the reducedcost scx surface combatant particularly since these two new ship designs are to be equal in capability to the more expensive designs they would replace implications for industrial base cna report since the cna report uses essentially the same kinds of ships and naval formations as those in use today or planned by the navy and recommends similar numbers of ships the industrialbase implications of the cnarecommended force would appear to be similar to those of the navys current plans oft report the oft report seeks to reduce unit shipbuilding costs and thereby permit an increase in total ship numbers by shifting the fleet away from complex highly integrated ship designs that are inherently expensive to build and toward lesscomplex merchantlike hulls and small sea frames that are inherently less expensive to build similarly the oft report seeks to increase shipbuilding options for the navy by shifting the fleet away from complex highly integrated ship designs that can be built only by limited number of us shipyards and toward lesscomplex merchantlike hulls and small sea frames that can be built by broader array of shipyards the oft report also aims to make it easier and less expensive to modernize ships over their long lives and thereby take better advantage of rapid developments in technology by shifting from highly integrated ship designs to merchantlike hulls and sea frames as consequence of these objectives the oft report poses significant potential business challenge to the six shipyards that have built the navys major warships in recent years the reports discussion on implementing its proposed architecture states in part the shipbuilding industrial base would also need to start to retool to build different types of ships more rapidly smaller shipyards which presently do little or work for the navy could compete to build the smaller ships thereby broadening the capabilities base of ship design and construction available to the navy the change to smaller lower unit cost ships would also open up overseas markets with more shipyards able to build the ships and potential for broader overall market the us shipbuilding industry would have the chance to expand its competence innovation and relevance taken together this would sharpen the industrys ability to compete and provide alternatives to ship procurement crs20 system that is beset by laws and regulations that frustrate even pervert market forces27 the reports concluding section lists five dangers that risk the navys losing the way one of these the report states is shielding the shipbuilding industrial base from global competition which the report states guarantees high cost limited innovation and long cycle times for building ships28 csba report the csba report similarly raised significant potential issues for the six shipyards that have built the navys major warships in recent years the report states that rationalizing the defense industrial base is critical part of dons the department of the navys maritime competition strategy and should be the subject of immediate consideration and deliberation by the congress dod and the don29 the report states numerous studies have indicated that the six tier i yards ie the six yards that have built the navys major warships in recent years have exorbitant excess capacities which contribute to the rising costs of navy warships primarily because of high industrial overhead costs these capacities are the result of cabotage laws and fluctuating national security acquisition policies that force shipbuilders of combatants to retain capacities to address required surges in coming years this last point is especially important the don contributes greatly to the problem of exorbitant capacities by its consistent tendency to portray overly optimistic ramp ups in ship production in budget out years30 the report recommends the following as part of its overall transition strategy minimize production costs for more expensive warships defined in the report as ships costing more than 14 billion each by consolidating production of each kind of such ship in single shipyard pursuing learning curve efficiencies and requesting use of multiyear procurement myp whenever possible minimize production costs for warships and auxiliaries costing less than 14 billion each by emphasizing competition shifting production to smaller tier ii yards using large production runs and enforcing ruthless cost control31 27 oft report p 76 28 oft report p 80 29 csba report slide 314 30 csba report slide 315 31 csba report slide 316 other steps recommended as part of the reports overall transition strategy see slides 124 and 125 include the following plan to fiscally prudent steadystate shipbuilding budget of 10 billion per year maximize current capabilities and minimize nonrecurring engineering continued crs21 the report states that the strategy developed in this report suggests that navy planners might wish to maintain production of aircraft carriers at ngnn consolidate production of large surface combatants and amphibious ships at ngingalls and consolidate submarine building gdeb or with new single submarine production company32 the report states that the second of these possibilities is guided by the building sequence of lpd17s and scxs recommended in the report ngingalls ability to build wider variety of ships than gdbiw ngingalls surge capacity and the availability of space for expanding ngingalls if needed33 the report states that the third of these possibilities is guided by the low probability that procurement of virginiaclass submarines will increase to two per year the cost savings associated with consolidating submarine production at one yard gdebs past experience in building ssbns and ssns gdebs surge capacity and the fact that building submarines at gdeb would maintain two shipyards gdeb and ngnn capable of designing and building nuclearpowered combatants of some kind34 the report acknowledges that yard consolidation would reduce the possibilities for using competition in shipbuilding in the near term and increase risks associated with an attack on the shipbuilding infrastructure but notes that dod consolidated construction of nuclearpowered carriers in single yard years ago and argues that 31 continued costs for new platforms by maintaining and pursuing hulls in service in production or near production that can meet near to midterm gwot requirements and that are capable of operating in defendedaccess scenarios against nucleararmed regional adversaries identify and retain or build large numbers of common hulls that have large amount of internal reconfigurable volume or that can carry variety of modular payloads or that can be easily modified or adapted over time to new missions pursue increased integration of navy and marine warfighting capabilities and emphasize common systems to increase operational effectiveness and reduce operation and support costs focus research and development efforts on meeting future disruptive maritime challenges particularly antiaccessareadenial networks composed of longrange systems and possibly weapons of mass destruction 32 csba report slides 317318 33 csba report slide 318 34 csba report slide 318 see also slide 298 crs22 competition might be possible in the longer run if future aircraftcarrying ships the scx and the new undersea superiority system could be built in tier ii yards35 the report states given their current small yearly build numbers consolidating construction of aircraft carriers surface combatants and submarines in one yard for each type makes sense however the same logic does not hold true for auxiliaries and smaller combatants these ships can normally be built at variety of tier i and tier ii yards competition can thus be maintained in reasonable and cost effective way for example competing auxiliaries and sea lift and maneuver sea base ships between nassco avondale and tier ii yards may help to keep the costs of these ships down building multiple classes of single ship type is another prudent way to enforce costs since the don can divert production of any ship class that exceeds its cost target to another companyclass that does not simultaneously building both the lockheed and general dynamics versions of the lcs and the northrop grumman national security cutter medium ie the mediumsized deepwater cutter gives the don enduring capability to shift production to whatever ship stays within its cost target of course congress and the don may elect to retain industrial capacity and to pay the additional insurance premium associated with having excess shipbuilding capacity for example congress and the don might wish to retain two submarine yards until the undersea superiority system design is clear and wait to rationalize the submarine building base after potential undersea superiority system yearly production rates are clear in similar vein congress and the don might wish to retain two surface combatant yards until the design of the scx is clear and wait to rationalize the surface combatant building base after potential scx yearly production rates are clear in this regard congress could consider authorizing modest additional number of aegis destroyers to keep both biw and ingalls hot until the scx is designed the key point is that the us shipbuilding infrastructure must be rationally sized for expected future austere shipbuilding budgets and whatever fiscally prudent navy transition plan is finally developed by don planners36 35 csba report slides
