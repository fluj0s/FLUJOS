6504c06 shspec57 the org board and livingness reference hcopl 3apr65 not available in oec volumes hcopl 3apr65 gives basic organization in detail the present org board is an old galactic civilization board with couple of departments missing the org board is philosophical machine command chart covers only one aspect of organizational functioning true org board must take care of what happens if function is not expressed on the org board it will be worn by everybody unknowingly when you put box on an org board it will be filled men cannot work as team without policy even bad policy will at least make team if it is followed policy is the extant agreement of the group without this agreement you only get individual action if an organization is better organized than other organizations it wouldnt have to do anything spectacular about the other organizations by way of competing with them or battling with them every war traces back to wild outpolicy if we come up the line as people as individuals and also as part of the team we wont get into all the trouble we got into as roarin screamin individuals way back on the track we will be able to make it all the way because we will be able to keep order all the way case stability depends upon the smooth organization of individuals without an organization the tech would drop out in time the organization must be close to flawless once you have put the organization in concrete and started it rolling if it is almost right you have had it because it will become an alldevouring monster and it will fail by the germs of its own destruction and what destroys almost any organization is its own germs its the things it laid in its the things you did not the things that were done to you the only way you can come down is for having made mistake yourself there must always be that prior mistake sometimes it is very slight and unpredictable apparently when curve goes down there are lots of errors there is one major error you must have understandings not understanding there are 265 x 6 separate dynamic urges in man and 265 x 6 x 18 separate causations there was an effort to make them so numerous that one could embrace them actual gpms organizational policy must be comprehensible the org board must express 1 function 2 duties 3 sequences of actions 4 authorities the org board gives the cycle of raw meat to ot the cycles of actions that person would undertake from the public it became public org board too the public enters from the left and proceeds to the right in life 1 you must have an impulse into channel 2 the edges of channel must be held firm 3 the barriers in the channel must be removed 4 the noncompliance of forwardings in the channel must be taken care of 5 the distractions must be removed from the borders of the channel 6 there must be some place for something going down the channel to arrive at this is the definition of life life without that channel wont exist that is livingness going along certain course impelled by purpose with some place to arrive this also gives us all the levels of the gradation program clear is baby ot his next bank is the physical universe the first point on the org board is the office of lrh this used to be hasi this deals with 1 authority 2 lrhs material 3 lrhs signature the main thing about this department is the issuance of conditions the first cog is that there is condition hence this is the entrance point for raw meat he thinks others will take care of him however he must recognize his condition or he will die others tell him that his condition is that he will die scientology says you dont have to die or get sick etc all processes from that point on contain condition after you have condition you had better communicate with it hence the next department is the department of communications and the name of the level iscommunication the next level is perception the department of inspections and reports communication must precede perception the next point is orientation the individual finds out that he has been living in nightmare this is the department of compilation after you have accumulated notes you can put them together and hand them to people so that they can get oriented cf these briefing course notes perceptions get compiled into understandings so the next department is understandings ie the department of publications this department publishes what is to be understood or what is understood understanding is just telling yourself what is understood the next department the department of promotion is under purposes the only thing the promreg ever handles is purposes the pc at this level on the gradation chart has arrived at purposes ie r6 he has gotten rid of false purposes he has achieved the state of clear in its new 1964 definition see tape 6409c03 shspec38 clearing what it is pp 664667 above the above is all under hco hco is doublebarreled division it comprises the following hco div 1 communication sec hco also comprises dissemination div 2 understanding hco dissem sec compilations publications promotion orientation understanding purpose if you cross two divisions on hat from that point on you have jammed the ability of an organization to expand dont have one person on hats in two different divisions therefore six people are necessary in order to have an org one for each division when an organization gets fairly big you cross departmental hats at your peril org div 3 energy org sec dept of organization dept of finance dept of materiel direction energy body personnel feeding personnel housing division 3 has to hold things together eg the physical plant it is also involved in financial planning tech div 4 activity tech sec tech services dept of training dept of processing estimation activity production later prediction here you get result not product division 4 has to do with what you do the doingness there has been neglected factor on the galactic confederation org board the product an organization has to qualify the product it must find out what made the product fall down ie there is need for lost battles division you must not let the person who trains students examine them qual div 5 enhancement qual sec the last two departments above were originally in reverse sequence scientology is the ability to change conditions but we have to decide what conditions we want to change you have to convince people that the product of scientology is valuable the alternative is sitting on an island out of communication it is the product that is distributed distribution div 6 clearing distribution sec dept of clearing starts the org board all over again product you can take your life and find out which division is missing note that there are six divisions and sixteen departments to expand the org board each department would have primarily six sections with sixteen subsections each one of these subsections in turn may have six divisions with sixteen departments each divisional head knows all the department hats in his division and something about all other departmental hats this gives you basically six hats and staff member hat there should be two admin personnel for every tech person if any hats below you on the org board are empty you are responsible for them
