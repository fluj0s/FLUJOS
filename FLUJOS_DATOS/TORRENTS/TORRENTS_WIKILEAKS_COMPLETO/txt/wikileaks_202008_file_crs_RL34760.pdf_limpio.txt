other transaction ot is special vehicle used by federal agencies for obtaining or advancing res earch and development rd or prototypes an ot is not contract grant or cooperative agreemen t and there is statutory or regulatory definition of other transaction only those agencies that have been provided ot authority may engage in other transactions ot authority originated with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa when the nationa l aeronautics and space act of 1958 was enacted subsequently seven other specific agencies have been given ot authority the department of defense dod fe deral aviation admin istration faa department of transportation dot partment of homeland security dhs transportation security admin istration departme nt of health and human services and department of energy other federal agencies may use ot authority under certain circumstances and if authorized by the director of the office of management and budget omb generally the reason for creating ot authority is that the government needs to obtain leadingedge rd and prototyp from commercial sources but some companies and other entities are unwilling or unable to comply with the governments procurement re gulations the government s procurement regulations and certain procurement statutes do not apply to ots and accordingly other transaction authority gives agencies the flexibility necessary to develop agreements tailored to particular transaction th competition in contracting act cica contract disputes act and procurement integrity act are examples of three statues that do not apply to ots evaluating ots and the use of ot authority is challenging undertaking because the federal acquisition regulation far and certain procurement statutes do not apply to ots means that the methods or mechanisms used to track contractor performance and results also do not apply additionally the types of activities functions and outcomes associated with ot her transactions cannot be easily measured for the purpose of evaluation it does not appear that anyone has yet devised reliable method for conducting an evaluation that would yield quantifiable objective data evidence of

position of being just another customer of technology and often not the largest customer at that more and more the government is relying on commercial offtheshelf technologies and leveraging the investment in technology that is being made privately by commercial industry the situation has changed so much that many corporations are refusing to do business with the gove rnment because its regulatory rules are too onerous the government is finding that not only can it not acquire many of the technologies it needs but also ma ny corporations will not even accept government dollars to help develop new technologies10 despite the governments ongoing need to take advantage of the commercial sectors leadingedge technol ogy and research statutory and regulatory procurement requirements have served as deterrent to working with the federal government while the name of the game now in corporate hightech research is speed and stealth the federal govern ment responds poorly to both largely because of the myriad of regulatory and statutory requirements the agency must satisfy before the actual award and durin g its administration11 although the governments regulatory and statutory requirements provide for among other things consistency some would argue as the author of the following passage does that st andardization is not necessarily conducive to rd while in theory consistency ensures fairness and equal treatment it does not necessarily allow for different needs and situations in the rd arena every technology area has its own special pecu liarities and problems that may require multiple solutions the commercial world largely recognizes this and negotiates unique contracts and agreements to speci fically address each situation the government is usually unable to do that because of the regulatory framework under which it works the statutes and regulations are largely unchangeable leaving the contracting officer only minimal amount of discretion the discretion that does exist is rarely used because innovation in contracting is highly suspect in many government orga nizations this inability to be flexible and negotiate alternative solutions has rned off many companies particularly the hightech ones these corporations tend to employ innovative thinkers who are unimpressed by the cookiecutter approach of the governments system when confronted by such system they often will refuse the governments arrangement and find other methods of financing under more compatible terms12 aside from the issues raised above complying with government statutes and regulations constitutes for some compan ies an unacceptable administrative burden the following passage focuses exclusiv ely on department of defense dod contracting but nevertheless it captures the scope of the task facing companies that compete for government contracts depending on such factors as the contract type and dollar value dod contract could incorporate more than 100

ensure proper compliance with government regulati ons was uncovered by gao in its study of government contractors and government acquisition requirements gaos review of eight companies operations revealed that four companies have separate administrative structure for government sales and two other companies have added employees to their administration to handle their government contracts in order to ensure compliance with the acquisition requirements the remaining two companies have subsidiaries that they reportedly keep separated to avoid being burdened with requirements especially cost accounting standards and cost and pricing data requirements14 government requirements concerning intellectual property rights and cost accounting standards in pa rticular are often cited as barriers to companies that otherwise might compete for government contracts although an extensive discussion of intellectual pr operty rights is beyond the scope of this report the following passage summarizes the governments intellectual property rights in general the government obtains unlimited rights when technical data were developed or created exclusively with government funds government purpose rights when the data were created with mixed funding nd limited rights when the data were created exclusively at private expense15 after noting that intellectual property concerns have affected the willingness of at least some companies to enter into government contracts gao identified several specific concerns perceived poor definitions of what technical data is needed by the government issues with the governments ability to protect proprietary data adequately and unwillingness on the part of government officials to exercise the flexibilities available to them concerning intellectual

gao05136 dec 2004 pp 2425 one reason companies have reportedly declined to c ontract with the government is to protect their intellectual property rights alternatively insufficient intellectual property rights could hinder the governments ability to adapt devel oped technology for use outside of the initial scope of the project limiting the government s intellectual property rights may

passage describes some problems darpa encountered in usin g government contracts for rd it became apparent in the late 1980s that the standard government contract and standard dod grant were inadequate for darpa to carry out its advanced research mission for example darpa missed out on opportunities to contract with some of the most innovative compan ies including small startups and large commercial companies that developed some of the most promising new technologies many of these companies lacked either the desire or the governmentrequired systems to perform contract under the government procurement regulations in addition wh darpa used standard government procurement contract to form consor tium it created an awkward contractual relationship32 darpa needed contractual vehicle that would allow it to set up multiparty agreement where consortium members would be equal in 1988 darpa concluded that it needed additi onal flexibility in its approaches to support advanced rd darpa turned toward the national aeronautics and space administration nasa for inspir ation in obtaining new statutory authority to fill the void discussed above33 additionally darpa realized that

include nontraditional contractor app lies only to prototype ots although statutory defin ition of nontraditional defense contractor does exist it is unclear whether and how agencies with ot authority verify that company is nontraditional contractor108 gao reported in 2005 that dhs relies on contractors to selfcertify their status as nontraditional gove rnment contractors during agreement negotiation109 it is unclear whether dod also permits self certification or verifies the status of participants in ot prototypes in response to gaos statement that 84 of 97 agreements for prototype ots went to traditional defense contractors dod officials not ed that the large number of traditional defense contractors at the prime contract level reflects the fact that section 845 agreements are to be used on weapon or weapon systemsrelated projects110 another possible explanation for the lower than expected number of nontraditional contractors some might suggest is that group of trad itional contractors would need to recruit only single nontrad itional contractor for their project in order for them to be eligible to participate in an other transaction in their study of dod prototype ots smith drezner and lachow encountered the same phenomenon few nontraditional c ontractors were par ticipating in ots their research revealed however that major part of the new activity that is companies new to working with dod cam from segments of large firms where the firm is traditional supplier names like 3m lucent motorola eastman kodak oracle and others but major segments of those firms using corporate funds to develop products for the co mmercial market had previ ously been unwilling to work for dod under the traditiona l contracting process111 in other words company that is traditional contractor ma have segment or divisi on that would be considered nontraditional contractor but the division s status as nontraditional contractor is masked because it carries the name of company that is known to be traditional contractor authors of the rand study dvised that demonstrating that new companies are working with dod cannot be done by simply counting new names on list of contracts and instead requires series of individual company studies112crs31 113 ibid p 6 114 ibid pp 910other assessments of ots in 2001 rand published the results of study that assessed dods use of ot authority for prototype projects the ove rarching question of the study which had been requested by dod was have the re sults justified the authority to perform projects without being required to comply with the historical accumulation of laws and procedures113 in the following passage the authors described the challenges they encountered in their effort to measure the outcomes of ots one important element of our research was to develop set of metrics that would measure the relative effects of ot on pr ogram outcomes and ots broader policy goals while attempting to accomplish this we were unable to develop any practical quantifiable metrics that ot hers would find credible the few quantifiable metrics we uncovered are either misleading eg the number of nontraditional contractors or unverifiable eg cost avoidance this result affects both the kind of information we can present and the kind of conclusions that can be drawn the reasons we did not find practical approach to such metrics are classic in the field of acquisition policy analys is we cannot perform statistical comparison of group of ot programs versus group of conventional programs because there are too many variables nd too few programs furthermore the traditional metrics for such comparis on and where we have good historical database are elements such as cost growth and schedule slip those are inappropriate for prototype progra ms that are inherently risky it is not practical to compare single ot program with counterpart conducted under traditional contracting methods because we never have an analog program that is remotely comparable we do not have data on what the program would have been like under traditional methods and finally most of the programs in our rather small sample are still under way so we do not have true outcomes thus we rely largely on qualitative information in this analysis the judgments and opinions of experienced managers who have run both kinds of programs we are unable to analytically prove the validity of those judgments and opinions for all the reasons noted here for those same reasons critics are unable to disprove the claimed benefits of ot agreements or to quantitatively demonstrate the superiority of another policy or process114 having catalogued the methodological challenges inherent in conducting quantitative research of ots the author s of the rand study opted for qualitative approach relying on the judgments and opi nions of experienced managers their assessment resulted in the following general conclusions important new industrial resou rces are now participating in dod prototype projects because of the freedoms inherent in the ot process the important new industrial capab ility is drawn from segments of major firms that had been focusing exclusively oncrs32 115 ibid pp viiiix boldface and italics in original 116 ibid pp 9 and 31commercial projects but are now willing to apply their skills and products to military prototypes the benefits of ot are broader than just the addition of new industrial resources the flexibility of the ot process has been used to achieve better use of industry resources through innovative business arrangements nd project designs b improve management of risks and uncerta inties through freedom to modify the program as it evolves and c achieve better value through cost sharing and reduction of transaction costs overall more effort is being devoted to product and less to process some risks to the government are incurred but we believe the immediate rewards substantially outweigh the risks risks arise mainly through relaxing dod demands for access to the firms financial records and ownership of intellectual property patents and data however such relaxation of dod rights applies to only few of the ot prototype projects ma inly those involving products with strong commercial market potential and where the firm contributes significant portion of the devel opment resources even in those few projects we believe the risks to dod are limited verification of cost records becomes relatively unimportant when firm is contributing large share of project costs lessthancomplete government ownership of inte llectual property might lead to increased costs in future phases of the project but those risks are limited this is in part because the possible future costs should be discounted to some degree as they are in the future and in part because they typically apply in ar eas where the technology is moving fast and where the value of speci fic kinds of knowledge can rapidly decay furthermore if the flexibility in negotiating intellectual property and financial audit clauses is removed from the ot authority most if not all of the new industrial resources would again become unavailable to dod 115 noting that these benefits of ots are impossible to quantify in an analytically rigorous manner and that their conclusions are mostly subjective and interpretive the authors added that the conclusions do however represent the views of broad cross section of dod and industry project managers and agreement officers who have been managing ot prototype projects th rewards of creating and managing more efficient and effective program structure and management pro cess have led those participants to be uniformly enthusiastic about the ot process and also advocate for its further use116 while the results of the rand study ar encouraging regarding the use of ot authority some would suggest that the conclusions are not robust and cannot be generalized to other ots the authors of the study did not attempt to generalizecrs33 117 us general accounting office acquiring research by nontraditional means pp 34 118 us general

is metrics but instead used qualitative data the sources were program managers and agreement fficers in both government and industry who probably are the most knowledgeable personnel about ots but who also are stakeholders in the use of ot authority finally the study focused on one federal agency and included only prototype ots other reports that comment on the use of ot authority are similar to the rand report in that they do not include quantitative data and they present generally favorable assessment of other transactions in 1996 gao offered generally positive assessment of dods use of ot her transactions and cooperative agreements cooperative agreements and other transactions appear to have provided dod tool to leverage the private sectors technological knowhow and financial investment the instruments have attr acted firms that traditionally did not perform research fo r dod by enab ling more flexible terms and conditions than the standard financial management and intellectual property provisions typically found in dod contracts and grants thus the instruments have contributed to reducing some of the barriers between the defense and civilian industrial bases these instruments also appear to be c ontributing to fostering new relationships and practices within the defense industry especially under projects being undertaken by consortia by sharing the costs of projects dod has partially offset its own costs while generally abling recipients to expand the scope of the projects undertaken117 another gao report noted that dod re ported to congress that section 845 agreements provided numerous benefits though dod generally offered quantified measures of the reported benefits or the ex tent that such benef its were derived from individual agreements118 gao also mentioned that its own work and work conducted by the dod ig had found that section 845 agreements have achieved mixed results in attracting commercial firms at either the prime or subcontract level119 consistent with the reports on dod s use of ot authority dhss chief procurement officer testified that his partment has favorab view of ots but interjected that it is too soon

estimates that at least some of these agreements have resulted in time and cost savings according to an st contracting representative ll of its current agreements are for development of prototypes but

combat systems fcs program is an example of project in which initially the use of ot authority was considered appropriate but as the project progressed questions arose and ultimately the ot was replaced by contract the project began in may 2003 when the army and boeing entered into an other transaction agreement for the system development and demonstrati on phase of the fcs program the armys rationale for using such an agreement was to encourage innovation and to use its wide latitude in tailoring business organizational and technical relationships to achieve the program goals127 concerned about the continued use of an ot for the fcs program senator john mccain then chairman of the subco mmittee on airland sena armed services committee expressed his views at hearing in 2005 since the passage of the national fense authorization act for 1994 which extended ot authority to prototype projects dod officials and industry have repeatedly requested that we extend ther transaction authority to production contracts congress has consistently refused to do so because we have taken the view that with hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars at stake the taxpayer needs the protections built into the traditional procurement system while we recognize that there may be need to continue doing business with nontraditional contractors in the produc tion phase of program we have preferred to address this issue through targeted waivers that are limited to those companies who need them now the ar my has put forward program that uses other transaction authority for 20 billion contract figure much greater than the congress intended and it is unprecedented128 initially the army continued to defend its use of ot authority but eventually concurred with the senator mccain as reported by federal contracts report the assistant secretary of the army for acqui sition logistics and technology defended the armys use of ota for fcs explaining that darpa initially used ota to define an fcs concept for the army and that the army had continued to use ota because it allows us to attract the best nd brightest of our nati ons industry and their

contract with boeing for the remainder of fcs development all of the work performed from may 2003 through septembe r 2005 is accounted for under the prior other transaction agreement and all work after september 2005 is included under the new contract131 it is unclear whether other ots if any have been used when contract or cooperative agreement or grant should have been used the visibility of the fcs program may have aided in identifying the possible misuse of ot authority policy options evidence of congressional interest in the use of other transaction authority includes congressional hearing in 2008 on dhss use of ot authority and since the 104th congress the enactment of legislation that has provided ot authority to six specific agencies additionally under pl 108136 most if not all federal agencies may use ot authority under certain circumstances the inapplicability of the far govern ment cost accounting standards and certain procurement statutes to other tr ansactions may contribute in part to congressional interest in ot authority some might view the inapplicability of requirements and procedures designed to safeguard the governments interests and provide for transparency as cause for concern although individual ots might incorporate measures designed to protect the government132 the challenges involvedcrs38 132 continued program risks because the costs are fixed at the time the agreements are established another example from dhs is the departments guidance on when to include financial audit provisions in ots ibid pp 3 and 11 133 the following excerpt from 2002 texas intellectual property law journal article summarizes one argument for ot authority the need for new weapon systems has increased modern generation of enemies like qaeda requires different military responses and the speed of t echnological innovation has meant that legacy systems become obsolete at an increasingly rapid pace in addition the department of defense in recent years has suffered from declining budget and thus has financial incentives to outsource as much work as possible this means that there are more outside contractors performing functions once performed by the government thus while the defense community is growing smaller the department of defense has become increasingly reliant on contractors and the commercial sector in general to fulf ill its needs within the world of defense research and development these same forces are at work the need for new weapons systems has required more governmentsponsored research and development at the same time as the number of government laboratories is reduced there are fewer and fewer internal sources to which the department of defense can turn for advanced weapons systems it is for this reason that the depa rtment of defense is increasingly interested in attracting new commercial partners simply put the federal government can longer rely on traditional government contractors to perform all of the functions that it requires in order to cope with this new scenario th department of defense has actively recruited new contractors to produce its weapons systems to f ill the void left by the vanishing traditional contractors david s bloch and james g mcewen other transactions with uncle sam solution to the hightech government contracting crisis pp 208209in developing and implemen ting methodologically rigorous evaluation program for ots which was discussed bove might also contribute to congressional interest in addition to maintaining the status quo ot her policy options include the following eliminate ot authority for some or all agencies that now have the authority while the elimination of this authority would address some critics concerns proponents might argue that the termination of ot authority could affect the ability of agencies to obtain or advance needed research t echnologies and prototypes133 depending upon whether an agencys statutory authority for using ots includes sunset provisi on add or continue sunset provision inclusion of sunset provision could trigger periodic review of each applicable agencys use of ot authority and the associated benefits and challeng on the other hand agencies whose statutory authority does not include sunset provision might argue that the possibility of not having their ot authority renewed via subsequent sunset provision could affect the willingness of private sector partners to engage in ots identify other agencies that might benefit from engaging in other transactions and provide ot author ity to them this option could involve establishing pilot progra m for one or more agencies ifcrs39 134 although some agencies with ot author ity might already incorporate accounting standards or ip rights provisions in their other transactions this policy option might if implemented ensure that all ots include cost accounting standards and ip rights provisions 135 see commercial activities panel improving the

improvements could further enhance ability to acquire innovative technologies using othe r transaction authority p 3feasible the pilot program could be designed to facilitate the evaluation of the use of ot authority require all ots to include at l east one nontraditional contractor part of the argument for ot authority is that the government needs to be able to work with companie s or organizations that are unable or unwilling to comply with the far and certain procurement statutes which suggests that the inclusion of at least one nontraditional contractor in each ot might be reasonable requirement however it is possibl that this requirement could preclude the government from engaging in ots that do not attract any nontraditional contractors develop accounting standards and intellectual property rights regulations specifically for other tr ansactions ideally otspecific accounting standards would be ss burdensome than the existing cost accounting standards while helping to ensure that there is greater degree of accountab ility and transparency than might currently exist ip regulations developed specifically for ots would address the concerns of ot participants while helping to protect the governments interests134 similar to the preceding option velop hybrid procurement vehicle that would incorporate some of the safeguards found in the far and certain procurement st atutes modified to be less burdensome than current requirement s and procedures yet would retain the desirable featur of other transactions similar to the commercial activities

where agencies post information about contract actions137 related option would be to modify fedbizopps and fpds to accommodate information regarding other transactions require agencies to submit reports on regular basis to appropriate congressional committees regarding their use of ot authority including benefits and challenges while this option might ensure that congress is provided regula rly with information regarding agencies use of ots this re quirement might impose burden on agencies similar to requirement found in 10 usc 2371 note link the level of approval authority for ots within an agency to the expected cost of the other transaction in 2002 dods deputy inspector general ffered series of recommendations which are as follows if civilian agencies receive ot au thority the legislation should be tailored so that the other transacti ons vehicle is only used to attract companies which have not trad itionally done business with the government and for technologies research capabilities or other processes which are needed by the federal agency and are not available through traditi onal acquisition vehicles for research other transactions the agency head should be required to make determination that an other transaction is necessary to induce nontrad itional contractor to provide technologies research capabilities or other processes which are needed by the agency other transactions for prototyp should be limited to developing items which are ripe for development as the result of research conducted pursuant to res earch other transaction audit access rights should be given to the government to include the comptroller general the agency inspectors general and departmental contract audit agencies such as the defense contract audit agency if enacted other transaction aut hority for civilian agencies should be provided as pilot program of limited duration to ascertain whether it actually attracts signif icant numbers of nontraditional government contractors whethe r it results in the acquisition ofcrs41 138 lieberman the services acquisiti on reform act sara of 2002 p 12 needed technologies and services and whether additional safeguards should be enacted138 conclusion other transaction authority originated in 1958 but it has been expanded greatly in recent years as seven specific agencies were also given statutory authority to engage in ots although little if any in formation is publicly available regarding some agencies use of ot authority artic and reports that comment on dods and dhss use of ots indicate that both of these agencies consider ot authority to be valuable useful tool the authors of rand study appear to have reached the same conclusion yet at the same time they acknow ledge and describe the methodological challenges involved in eval uating the use of ot authority thus while some embrace ots as useful to the federal government it does not appear that anyone has yet devised re liable method for conducting an evaluation that would yield quantifiable objective data
