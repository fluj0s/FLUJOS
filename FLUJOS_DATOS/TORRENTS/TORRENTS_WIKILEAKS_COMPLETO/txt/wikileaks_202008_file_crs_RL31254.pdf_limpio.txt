and universities has come under increased scrutiny with particul ar attention being pa id to the rates at which graduates of these programs pa ss states initial teacher licensure or certification examinations the higher education amendments of 1998 brought federal legislation to bear on this issue under title ii of the higher education act hea higher education institutions must report the pass rates on certification exams of their teacher education graduates and states must establish procedures for identifying lowperforming teacher education schools state reports filed with the us depar tment of education ed in october 2001 october 2002 and october 2003 provide data on certifica tion exam pass rates and the extent to which states are using pa ss rates as teacher education accountability measure in 2003 28 states reported that they had in place procedures assessing their teacher education programs that are based at least in part on the pass rates of program graduates on state teacher licensure exams given that these procedures differ substantially from one state to another interstate comparisons of pass rates are at best problematic one states passing ra is not another states further an education school deemed lowperforming by one state might not be so labeled by another there are number of issues relevant to federal policymaking that may be important for the 108th congress as it reauthorizes the hea such as the current reporting of pass rate s to ed has come under serious criticism states and institutions that require passage of initial certification exams for program completion report 100 pass rates raising concern about the utility of such information critics are likely to contend that pass ratebased standards fail toidentify all truly lowperforming programs at the same time states may find it difficult politically to classify substantial portion of their programs as substandard do pass ratebased standards necessarily lead to substantialimprovement of teacher educati on schools and the quality of their graduates licensing exams are generally viewed as not rigorous screening out only candidates l acking basic skills and knowledge pass ratebased standards may di sproportionately affect schools training minority teacher candidates the use of pass ratebased standard s is relatively new making it premature at this juncture to dr aw firm conclusions about their merits as gauges of teacher education quality the house has passed legislation reauthorizing hea title ii among its provisions this legislation would require institutions and states to report the pass rates of test takers who complete at least 50 of the requirements of teacher preparation programs not just t hose who complete the full

education programs introduction policymakers at all levels have expr essed concern about the quality of the teaching force in public elementary and s econdary education many view the success of state and local efforts to improve k12 academic performance as dependent upon the knowledge and skills of classroom teacher s as consequence the caliber of teacher education programs in college s and universities has come under increased scrutiny with particular attention being paid to the rates at which graduates of these programs pass states initial teacher certification examinations1 the higher education amendments of 1998 brought federa l legislation to bear on this issue by requiring under title ii of the higher educa tion act hea that among other things higher education institutions report the pa ss rates on licensing exams of their teacher education graduates and that states blish procedures for identifying low performing teacher education schools the 108th congress is considering the hea for reauthorization and is likely to delib erate over modification and continuation of these accountability provisions during this process on july 9 2003 the h ouse passed hr 2211 ready to t each act of 2003 which reauthorizes title ii of the hea this legislation includes amendments affecting the reporting of pass rates these are discussed later in this report2 this report

states were to make preliminary reports to the secretary of education including basic descriptive information on certification assessments and requirements pass rates and waivers of certification

professional knowledge assessments as well 13 as noted by the national research council in its report testing teacher candidates the role of licensure tests in improving teacher quality 2001 among states that use tests the type and number of required tests run the gamut from one test of basic skills to four different types of tests including basic skills subject matter knowledge pedagogical content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge tests within types more than one test may be required p 44 nationally available exam s include the educational testing services praxis i measuring basic academic skills and ii measuring specific subject knowledge and knowledge about teaching those subjects assessments as well as assessments designed by the national evaluation systems states also develop their own assessmentsfrom review of the information submitted by the states and included in eds annual reports see below it is clear that the performance on certification assessment that is acceptable in one state is not in another the specific minimum score considered to be passing score on specific licensure exam the socalled cut score varies markedly from state to state12 what constitutes an acceptable pass rate for t eacher preparation programs differs across the states in mississippi for example 80 of teacher education programs graduates have to pass the relevant licensing exams for the program not to be designated as lowperforming while in florida the minimum pass rate to avoid being designated as lowperforming is 90 not only are the specific thresholds for pa ss rates different from one state to the next but the particular examin ations used are not the same13 in mississippi for instance the pass rate measure is based on graduates performance on the praxis ii in both subject area and pedagogy test s for continued approval of teacher preparation programs florida measures pass rates on the prof essional education subtest subject matter subtest and general knowledge test of the florida teacher certification examination ftce how states determine pass rates can so vary for example the number of years of data used in the calculation differs in mississippi three years of data are used in determining the rates while in arizona two years are used states also impose differe nt sanctions on teacher pr eparation programs failing to meet the pass

based on the data submitted by each state describi ng the quality of teacher preparation in the state including pass rates on teacher certification assessments waivers of certification requirements and the identifi cation of lowperforming teacher education programs ed concluded that the data reported under hea t itle ii describe nationwide teacher preparation system with serious limitations pa

coupled with low threshold scores for passing ed found that nationwide 93 percent of prospective teachers passed various state examinati ons necessary for initial certification19 ed noted that one possible response to th prospect that more institutions and states will define program completer as someone who passes the certification assessments would be to also require th reporting of the pass

ability for teacher education programs there are number of issues relevant to federal policymaking that are likely to be important for the 108th congress as it considers the hea for reauthorization some of these are identified in this sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31254crs12 34 see for example the education trust not good enough content analysis of teacher licensing examinations thinking k16 vol 3 issue 1 spring 1999the current reporting of pass rate s to ed has come under serious criticism as the ed nnual reports have stre ssed many states set the scores needed to pass the certification assessments at very low levels thereby ensuring high pass rates in some states teacher candidates must pass initial licensing exams before they can enter into or before they can graduate from the program as result pass rates of graduates in those states will be 100 the ed and gao reports highlight that some ins titutions and states have defined program completer for purposes of hea title ii reporting in such way as to achieve 100 pass rates currently standards ba sed on pass rates identif few schools as low performing or in need of improveme nt critics of teacher education programs are likely to contend that these standards are failing to identify the full array of programs that should be classified as low performing but it may be asked to what degree states will be able politically to establish standards that classify substantial portion of their teacher education programs as substandard directly related to the issue of relatively few schools falling afoul of the pass ratebased standards is the question of whether such standards will actually lead to imp rovement of teacher education schools and the quality of their gra duates there is growing body of research concluding that curre nt licensing examinations used by most states are not rigorous screening out only those teacher candidates lacking basi c skills and knowledge34 as consequence even if pass rate levels are raised they still gauge performance against minimal standard not one measuring high or even moderate levels of sk ills and knowledge this may not mean that such standard should be aba ndoned rather pass ratebased standard could be viewed as blishing the basic threshold that teacher education programs must cross as the first in an array of additional steps necessary to improve program quality pass ratebased standards according to some critics disproportionately affect sc hools training minority teacher candidates review of the char acteristics of the student bodies at higher education institutions whose t eacher education programs have failed to meet current state standards suggests this may be real concern for example in texas the teacher education programs designated as lowperforming under the criteria for hea title ii are both at historically black colleges both programs identified by north carolina as lowperforming are at historically black colleges and four of the six new york institutions with teacher preparation programs designated as at risk of being designated as lowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31254crs13 35 the determination of minority enrollment for the new york institutions is for institutions as whole not specifically thei r teacher preparation programs 36 possibly the reporting of raw data on the assessment performances of teacher education graduates would permit ed or an independent entity to compare those states that use the same examination or parts of those examinations the 107th congress wrestled with similar issue for k12 education when it delib erated on the child left behind act of 2001 and the setting of student performan ce standards the legislative res ponse to potentially inconsistent state standards was to require states to also participate in nationally based assessment program offering consistent national standard against which the state standards might be compared 37 as was noted previously on june 2 2004 the house passed hr 4409 teacher training enhancement act nearly identical bill amendi ng title ii the provisions described for hr 2211 are also found in hr 4409performing have institutional enrollments that are over 50 minority35 the use of pass ratebased standards is relatively new the data recently reported to ed suggest that such standards are not being applied in all states and further that the gathering and reporting of these data has proven difficult for ma ny states as result it would be premature at this juncture to draw firm conclusions about the merits of pass rates as gaug of teacher education quality licensing exam pass rates are at present state specific as delineated earlier available data do not allow for interstate comparisons pass ratebased sta ndards are determin ed and applied differently across the states to the extent that federal sanctions are imposed based on these state sta ndards they will be applied inconsistently nationwide36 reauthorization action this concluding section highlights rele vant provisions in legislation on which there has been action during the 108th congress hr 2211 on july 9 2003 th house passed hr 2211 ready to t each act of 2003 the bill had been reported by the house education and the workforce committee on june 26 2003 this bill would ame nd and extend title ii of the hea37 among its provisions the bill seeks to address concerns bout 100 pass rates being reported by those states and teacher preparation programs requiring passage of initial certification exams as condition of program completion to do so the bill would require reporting by states and institutions on the pass rates of test takers who complete at least 50 of the requirements of teacher preparation programs further each institution would have to compare the average raw score on teacher certificationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31254crs14 exams of its students those completing at least 50 of the teacher preparation programs requirements with the average raw scores for other institutions in the state state report cards would also have to include average raw score data for teacher preparation programs the bill so would require states to include among their criteria for assessing the performance of teacher preparation programs evidence of student achievement gains finally each states governor or the entity responsible for teacher certification and preparation woul d have to attest as to the quality eg accuracy of the data being reported by the state to the secretary of education
