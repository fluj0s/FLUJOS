issues this report describes the president s proposal for fy2006 appropriations for lhhsed programs as submitted to congress on february 7 2005 and the congressional response to that proposal it compares the presidents fy2006 request to the fy2005 lhhsed amounts it track s legislative acti on and congressional issues related to the lhhsed appropriations bill with particular attention paid to discretionary programs in addition the report summarizes activ ities related to the annual budget process such as the c ongressional budget resolution continuing resolutions and supplemental appropriations see related legislation page 45 however the report does not follow specifi c funding issues related to mandatory lhhsed programs such as medicare or social security nor will it follow any authorizing legislation that may be needed prior to funding some of the presidents budget initiatives for glossa ry of budget terms nd relevant websites see appendix terminology and we b resources page 51 for funding resources for lhhsed agencies see appendix b context of lhhsed appropriations page 53 the lhhsed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the regular appropriations bills not only because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs but also because of the continuing importance of various related issues such as restrictions on the use of federa l funds for abortion stem cell research or human cloning this bill provides discreti onary funds for three federal departments and 14 related agencies including the social security administration ssa among the various appropriations bills lhhsed is the largest single source of discretionary funds for dom estic federal programs the defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs according to the budget of the united states government fiscal year 2006 table s4 the fy2005 lhhsed bill accounted for 1424 billion 173 and the defense bill accounted for 3904 billion

the lhhsed appropriations for fy2006 including both discretionary and mandatory appropriations the table shows various aggregate measures of lhhsed appropriations enacted for fy2005 and proposed for fy2006 including discretionary program level current year and advance appropriations as well as scorekeeping adjustments program level appropriations reflect the total discretionary appropriations in given bill regardless of the year in which they will be spent and therefore include advance funding for future years unless otherwise specified appropriati ons levels in this report refer to program level amounts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32952crs4 current year appropriations represent discretionary appropriations in given bill for the current year plus discretionary appropriations for the current year that were enacted in prior years current year discretionary appropriations are similar to the amount counted for the 302b allocations ceilings discussed later page 13 advance appropriations are funds that will not become available until after the fiscal year for which the appropriations are enacted for example funds included in th fy2005 act that cannot be spent before fy2006 at the earliest discussed later page 14 scorekeeping adjustments are made to account for special funding situations as monitored by th congressional budget office cbo because appropriations may consist of mixtures of budget authority enacted in various years two summary measures are frequently used program level appropriations and current year appropriations how are thes measures related for an operational

projects in appropria tions bills has become topic of contention for congress and the administration and the issue extends to lhhsed projects in the case of lhhsed appropriations earmarks may be defined as funds set aside within an acc ount for specific organization or location either in the appropriation act or its conference report typically the authorizing statute gives the general purpose for use of appropriations such as projects for the improvement of postsecondary education but an earma rk designates specific amount for specific recipient such designati ons bypass the usual competitive distribution of awards by federal agency but otherwise require recipients to follow standard federal fina ncial and other administrative procedures the president has urged the elimination of c ongressional earmarks in appr opriations in recent years but with the exception of fy2006 lhhsed appropriations congress has continued the practice earmarks in lhhsed appropriations ge nerally have increased during the past decade along with the total appropriation for lhhsed programs however major change in direction occurred in fy2006 virtually all earmarks werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32952crs13 eliminated from the fy2006 lhhsed bill in general the funding previously associated with lhhsed earmarks was eliminated as well in particular there were

determined through twostage congressiona l budget process in the first stage congress establishes the 302a allocations the maximum spending totals for congress for given fiscal year this task is sometimes accomplished through the concurrent resolution on the budget where sp ending totals are specified through the statement of managers in the conference report in years when the house and senate do not reach budget agreement these totals may be set through leadership arrangements in each chambe r the spending amounts are allotted among the various committees and for the house and senate appropriations committees the amounts include the total discretionary budg et authority available for enactment in annual appropriations for fy2006 the concurrent resoluti on on the budget was hconres 95 to which the house and senate agreed on april 28 2005 the conference report established 8430 billion as the 302a allo cation ceiling for the total discretionary budget authority for fy2006

details pl ease see relat ed legislation page 45 in the second stage of the annual cong ressional budget process the house and senate appropriations committees separately establish the 302b allocations the maximum discretionary budget authority available to each subcommittee for each annual appropriations b ill the total of these allocations must not exceed the 302a discretionary total this process creates the basis for enforcing discretionary budget discipline since any appropriations bill reported with total above the ceiling is subject to point of order the 302b allocations can and often do get adjusted during the year as the various appropriations bills progress toward final enactment table 4 shows the 302b discretionary allocations for the fy2006 lhhsed appropriations for

appropriations however involves how they are counted in budget ceilings advance appropriations avoi d the 302a and 302b llocation ceilings for the current year but must be counted in the year in which they first become available for obligation this procedure uses up ahead of time part of what will be counted against the allocation ceiling in future years in fy2002 the presidents budget proposed the

response embryonic stem cell resear ch funding restrictions on august 9 2001 president bush announced decision to use federal funds for research on human embryonic stem cells for the first time but limited the funding to existing stem cell lines embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into virtually any cell in the body and have the potential to treat medical conditions such as diabetes and parkinsons disease in response to the presidents announcement the nih developed registry of 78 embryonic stem cell lines eligible for use in federally funded research however many of these lines were found to be unavailable or unsuitable for research only 22 of the 78 eligible stem cell lines are currently available for general research purposes some scientists are concerned about the quality longevity and availability of eligible stem cell lines many believe that the advancement of research requires new stem cell lines possibly including stem cells derived from cloned embryos the use of stem cells however raises ethical issues regarding embryo and fetal tissue research because the embryos are destroyed in order to obtain the cells given its potential volatility the issue may be revisited at any time during the annual consider ation of lhhsed appropriations an fy1996 appropriations continuing re solution p l 10499 128 prohibited nih funds from being used for the creati on of

the enactment of the child left behind act of 2001 nclba pl 107110 which amended the esea among other programs there has been continuing discussion regarding the appropriations promised and the resulting shortfall when the enacted appropriations are compared to authorization levels some would contend that the esea authorizations of appropriations as amended by nclba represent funding

needed for implementing the new requirements and that the differences between promised and actual funding levels repr esent shortfall of billions of dollars the fy2005 appropr iation was 91 billion less than the amount authorized for the five esea programs for which fy2005 authorization is specified for fy2006 these five progra ms were funded at level 120 billion below the authorized level after adjustme nt for the 1 rescission others would contend that the authorized funding leve ls represent more than appropriations ceilings and as such are different from authorizations for most education programs that is when the authorizati on amount is specified it represents only maximum amount with the actual funding leve l to be determined during the regular annual appropriations pr ocess in the

individuals with disabilities education act idea current funding trends pell grants the funding level for pell grants has been continuing issue the program provides assistance to ligible undergraduate students based on financial need aggregate program cost s depend largely on the maximum award and the number of eligible recipients the maximum award is currently set when appropriations are enacted whic h is usually before the star t of the program year the exact number and total amount of the pell grant awards cannot be determined until all students have cla imed an award generally the number of recipients and the amount of the awards are not reconciled until the end of the program year which occurs after the following years appropr iations have been acted appropriations for pell grants make funds available for two full fiscal years to provide administrative flexibility regarding potential shortfalls and surpluses if the cost of the pell grant program exceeds the current fi scal years appropriation the shortfall is covered by using appropriated monies from the next fiscal year similarly surplus can be carried forward and used in the following year as of january 4 2006 the ed budget service has estimated th at the fy2005 shortfall will be 43 billion for fy2006 the administration proposed legi slation that would recall the federal share of the perkins loan program and use 43 billion of the proceeds to eliminate the current pell grant shortfall pl 109149 continued funding for the perkins loan program and 305 of pl 109149 appr opriated 43 billion to eliminate the shortfall for additional info rmation please see crs report rl31668 federal pell grant program of the higher educati on act background and reauthorization forward funding and advance appropriations most appropriations are available for obligation during the federal fiscal year of the appropriations bill for example most fy2006 appropriations w ill be available for obligation from october 1 2005 through ptember 30 2006 several lhhsed programs including some of the larger ed progra ms have authoriza tion or appropriations provisions that allow funding flexibility for program years that differ from the federal fiscal year for example many of the elementary and seconda ry education formula grant programs receive appropriations that become available for obligation to the states on july 1 of the same year as th appropriations and re main available for 15 months through the end of the following fiscal year that is fy2006 appropriations for some programs will became available fo r obligation to the states on july 1 2006 and will remain availabl until september 30 2007 this budgetary procedure is popularly known as forward or multiy ear funding and is accomplished through funding provisions in the lhhsed appropriations bill forward funding in the case of elementary nd secondary education programs was designed to allow additional time fo r school officials to develop budget s in advance of the beginning of the school year for pell grants for undergraduates however aggregate program costs for indi vidual students applying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ah ead of time appropriations from one fiscal year primarily support pell grants during the following academic year that is the fy2006 appropriations will be used primarily to support grants forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32952crs36 the 20062007 academic year unlike elementa ry and secondary ducation programs however the funds for pell grants remain available for obligation for two full fiscal years as discussed above an advance appropriation occurs when the appropriation is provided for fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for wh ich the appropriation was enacted in the case of fy2006 appropriations funds normally would ve become available october 1 2005 under regular funding provi sions but will not become available until july 1 2006 under the forward funding provisions discusse d above however if the july 1 2006 forward funding date were to be postponed for obligation by three months until october 1 2006 the appropr iation would be reclassified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in subsequent fiscal year fy2007 for example the fy2006 budget request for t itle i part grants to leas for the education fo r the disadvantaged was 133 billion this amount includes not only forward funding of 59 billion to become available july 1 2006 but also an advance appropriation of 74 billion to become available october 1 2006 like forward funding pr ovisions these advance appropriations are specified through provisions in the annual appr opriations bill what is the impact of these changes in funding provisions at the appropriations level ther is difference between forward funded and advance appropriations except for the period availa ble for obligation at the program or service level relatively little is changed by the threemonth delay in the availability of funds since most expenditures for st andard school year occur after october 1 at the scorekeeping level however sign ificant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year and is therefore fully included in the current 302b allocation for discretionary ppropriations under federal budget scorekeeping rules an adva nce appropriation is not counted in the 302b allocation until the following year in essence threemonth change from forward funding to an advance appropria tion for given program allows onetime shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discretionary appropriations for additional info rmation please see crs report rs20441 advance appropriations forward funding and
