teague v lane case 489 us 288 1989 whose ruling was applied to capital cases by penry v lynaugh 492 us 302 1989 the court sharply reduced the scope of federal habeas corpus relief unless case falls within one of two exceptions the court will not announce or apply new constitutiona l rules during habeas review the doctrine of abuse of the writ of beas corpus was also expanded unless the case

rudence with the justices divided over the appropriate scope of fe deral review and the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the sixth amendment right to jury trial also received further elaboration in the capital punishment context background the eighth amendments prohibition ag ainst cruel and unusual punishments has been interpreted in the light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of maturing society trop v dulles 356 us 86 10001 1958 plurality opinion originally the court was inclined to an historical style of interpretation and looked to whether or not punishment was cruel and unusual by the standards and practices in 1789 wilkerson v utah 99 us 130 1878 in re kemmler 136 us 436 1890 then in weems v united states 217 us 349 1910 the court concluded that the fram ers had not merely intended to bar the cruel and unusual punishment techniques and practices condemned in 1789 but had intended to prevent new forms of unusual punishment the eighth amendment was of an expansive and vital character id at 37677 before 1972 the states generally allowe d the jury as the conscience of the community or sometimes the judge discretion whether or not to impose the death penalty in furman v georgia 408 us 238 1972 while upholding the power of the states to impose the death penalty the c ourt held that statute allowing unbridled discretion in jury or judge to dete rmine whether to impose the death penalty amounted to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment the effect of furman was to invalidate most of the existing state and federal death penalty provisions within few short years approximate ly 37 states responded by enacting new death penalty statutes new york reinstat ed the death penalty in 1994 increasing the

sentencing procedures to overcome constitutional infirmities and added substantially to the list of federal crimes subject to the death penalty1 of the two approaches taken by the states in an effort to comply with the furman decision the court rejected one appr oach mandatory death sentences for specified crimes woodson v north carolina 428 us 280 1976 and roberts v louisiana 428 us 325 1976 and validated the second statu tes guiding the sentencing authority by requiring finding of one or more aggrav ating factors if the death penalty is imposed see gregg v georgia 428 us 153 1976 proffitt v florida 428 us 153 1976 and jurek v texas 428 us 262 1976 from the gregg proffitt and jurek cases emerged the princi ple that although the death penalty is constitutional sentencing procedures must be structured to reduce arbitrariness and capriciousness as much as possible for example in proffitt v florida the court found death penalty statut valid even though the trial judge rather than the jury was directed to weigh statutory aggravating factors against statutory mitigating factors in jurek v texas the court construed the statute before it as narrowing the deatheligible cla ss and taking account of mitigating factors in considering future dangerousness the plurality in these cases approved procedures requiring l that the sentencing authority jury or judge be given standards to govern its exercise of discretion and be given the opportunity to evaluate both the circumstances of the offense and the character and propensities of the accu sed that is individualized capital sentencing and 2 that special forms of appellate review be provided not only of the conviction but also of the sentence to as certain that the sentence was in fact fairly imposed the desired result is principled way to distinguish cases in which the death penalty is deemed warranted from other cases in which it is not in lockett v ohio 438 us 586 1978 death pena lty statute was held invalid because it failed to permit c onsideration in capital case of any aspects of the defendants character or record or the circumstances of the offense as mitigating factors the plurality opinion in lockett was later endorsed by majority opinion in eddings v oklahoma 455 us 104 1982 within 10 years after the furman decision the court having rejected mandatory imposition of the death penalty which would result in its consistent application placed once again in the sentencing authority large measure of discretion th legislature however must prescribe the aggravating factors and the appellate courts must be able to review capital sentences in light of the statutory factors for measur ed consistent application of the death penalty the groundwork for the furman decision was prepared in the early 1960s changes in the composition of the suprem court the creation of the warren court the impact of the civil rights movement and opposition to the death penalty from civil liberties organizations coalesced in the facto suspension of the death penalty during most of the 1960s and 1970s in those states that seek to impose thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96116crs3 2 between 1973 and 1992 total of 4704 persons were sentenced to death but only 188 were executed between 1977 the first post furman execution and 1984 only 11 executions took place during this period the revised state capital sentencing schemes were subjected to intensive litigation nearly 40 of the death sentences were later reduced to lesser penalty by judicial review or ex ecutive clemency nearly 10 of the prisoners had their underlying convictions overturned on appeal those executed in 1992 were on deathrow an average of nine and half years stewart dealing with death 80 aba jour 50 1994 the total number of exec utions from 19771994

background and issues crs report 93935a oct 22 1993death penalty protracted appeals and pursu it of collateral remedies by deathrow inmates have become commonplace2 only within the last six years has majority formed on the court to restrict federal beas corpus review of capital convictions and sentences which has been the primary vehicle for federal review of state death penalty cases federal habeas corpus at common law the writ of habeas co rpus applied to secure release from prison of persons held without trial w ithout bail or confined by order of court without subject matter jurisdiction3 persons convicted by court with jurisdiction did not have recourse to the writ initially in the united states the writ was used to obtain the release of federal fficials held by the states without trial or bail the federal writ was not otherwise available for prisoners held under state authority rather than federal authority ex parte dorr 44 us 3 how 103 1845 congress substantially increased the jurisdiction of the federal courts to issue the writ in 1867 by authorizing its issuance in all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liber ty in violation of the constitu tion or of any treaty or law of the united states 14 stat 385 1867 this expanded jurisdiction however had only slight effect on access to federal beas relief until the 1950s and 1960s as judge friendly of the second circuit note d the great expansion in federal habeas relief occurred as consequence of two re lated developments first series of supreme court decisions imposing for the first time on state cr iminal process the rules of the fourth fifth sixth and eighth amendments by the due process clause of the 14th amendment and second the tendenc to construe these bill of rights rules with an ever increasing breadth as limitations on the power of states to convict and punish criminal offenders friendly is innocence irrelevant collateral attack on criminal judgments 38 u chi l rev 142 15556 1970 the bill of rights has become detailed code of criminal procedures to which new chapter is added every year idat 155 the current majority on the supreme court seems committed to drastic limitations on the use of federal habeas relief to create and apply new rules of criminal procedure and punishment httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96116crs4 beginning with noncapital case teague v lane 489 us 288 1989 the court held that novel in terpretation of the cons titution new rule generally cannot be applied retroactively against the states during fede ral habeas review of state convictions since state courts could only be expected to defer to those rules in existence when their consider ation became final plura lity of the court also held that it therefore would not announce any ne w rules on habeas review unless the case falls within one of two exceptions the new interpretation places certain kinds of primary private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe 489 us at 307 or places certain category of punishment for class of defendants because of their st atus or offense beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe penry v lynaugh 492 us 302 329 1989 or the new interpreta tion significantly implicates the fundamental fairness of the trial with the result that without app lication of the new rule the likelihood that only the guilty are convicted is seriously diminished teague v lane 489 us 288 3l2l3 in penry v lynaugh the court extended the application of the teague new rule principle to capital punishment cases pe nry argued that as mentally retarded person application of the death penalty amounted to cruel and unusual punishment the plurality examined the merits of this claim under the first exception to creation of new rules during habeas review and held that the eighth amendment does not categorically prohibit execution of mildly to moderately mentally retarded person who has been found competent to stand tr ial and whose insanity defense has been rejected by the jury different plurality remanded the case on different point in light of the prosecutors argument on the jurys role and the inadequate instructions the jury may not have considered and gi ven effect to mental retardation as mitigating factor in deciding to impose the death penalty 492 us at 328 case announces new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendants conviction became final teague v lane 489 us 288 301 1989 decision may involve new rule for purposes of teague even if the court states its decision is dictated by precedent as long as split in the lower courts or some other source of aut hority provides ground upon which different outcome might reasonably ve been anticipated butler v mckellar 494 us 407 415 1990 this is because the teague rule serves to validate reasonable good faith interpretations of existing precedents ma by state courts even though they are shown to be contrary to later decisions 494 us at 414 see also sawyer v smith 497 us 227 234 1990 at 432 abuse of the habeas corpus writ in addition to placing procedural limitations on announcement and application of new rules during habeas review the court denied habeas relief by applying the abuse of the writ doctrine in mcclesky v zant 499 us 467 1991 the court clarified the standards for denying relief on the ground of abuse the doctrine is not confined to instances of deliberate abandonm ent of claims not asserted abuse occurs by failing to raise claim through inexcusable neglect and only in the extraordinary instance when constitutional violation probably has caused thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96116crs5 conviction of an innocent pe rson should an exception be made to the cause and prejudice standard that g overns inexcusable neglect federal habeas review of fe deral claims is also ordinarily barred if the state court decision rests on an independent nd adequate state law ground whether that ground is substantive or procedural coleman v thompson 111 s ct 2546 1991 one year after the mcclesky and coleman decisions the cour t further restricted habeas review by narrowing the funda mental miscarriage of justiceactual innocence exception to the causeandpr ejudice standard under the holding of sawyer v whitley 112 s ct 2514 1992 petiti oner who claims actual innocence of the crime which occasioned the death ntence must show by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the deat h penalty under the applicable state law the clear and convincing evidentiary standard replaced the former probable cause evidentiary standard for invoking the exception to th causeandprejudice standard the court subsequently restricted sawyer to review of death sentences it held in schlup v delo 115 s ct 851 1995 that the less onerous more likely innocent than not standard of murray v carrier 477 us 478 1986 applies to claims of innocence of the crime accompanied by claim of constitutional error unless the case falls within the miscarriage of justice exception or the showing required by the causeandprejudice standard can be made court may not reach the merits of 1 successive claims which ra ise grounds identical to grounds heard and decided on the merits in an earlier habeas petition 2 new claims not previously raised which constitute an abuse of the writ or 3 procedurally defaulted claims in which the petitioner failed to follow applicable state procedural rules in raising the claims individualized capital sentencing during the last 10 years the suprem court has devoted more attention to individualized sentencing of capital defenda nts than any other death penalty issue the justices remains divided over the proper scope of federal review majorities shift from case to case but there is neverthe less clear trend to uphold the death penalty in greater number of cases the death penalty must be adminis tered through guided individualized sentencing procedures which must be structured to reduce arbitrariness and capriciousness as much as possible the legislature prescribes standards to govern the sentencers discretion in evaluating both the circumstances of the offense and the character and propensities of th accused ie the aggravating factors that narrow the deatheligible class of murderers appellate review must be provided not only of the conviction but also of the sentence to ascertain that the death sentence was fairly imposed gregg v georgia 428 us 153 1976 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96116crs6 the sentencing authority must consider any relevant mitigating circumstances offered by the defendant nd supported by evidence in justification of lesser sentence than the death penalty lockett v ohio 438 us 586 1978 walton v arizona 497 us 639 649 1990 in payne v tennessee 111 s ct 2597 1991 the court held the eighth amendment does not bar eith er the introduction of vic tim impact statements or prosecutorial argument about the vic tims personal characteristics during the sentencing phase payne overruled the earlier decisions in booth v maryland 482 us 496 1987 victim impact statement vi olates the eighth amendment since it creates constitutionally unacceptable risk that the jury would impose the death penalty in an arbitrary and capricious manner and south carolina v gathers 490 us 805 1989 prosecutorial argument about victims pers onal characteristics irrelevant to proper senten cing determination and viol ates eighth amendment state appellate courts narrowed c onstruction of an otherwise vague aggravating circumstance can satisfy constitutional requirements by giving consistency to the appli cation of the standard lewis v jeffers 497 us 764 1990 arave v creech 113 s ct 1534 1993 unless cured by narrowing state ppellate interpreta tion the phrase especially heinous atrocious and crue l is an unconstitutionally vague standard for applying the death penalty maynard v cartwright 486 us 356 1988 those state appellate courts that engage in reweighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors however can cure an invalid aggravating circumstance like the especially heinous standard clemons v mississippi 494 us 738 1009 walton v arizona 497 us 639 1990 if the sentencer makes an eighth amendment error by considering an invalid aggravating ci rcumstance eg the coldness of the capital offender in committing the crime the state appellate court can either reweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances without the invalid factor or can determine that consideration of the invalid factor was harmless error sochor v florida 112 s ct 2114 1992 the constitution does not require that jury find the aggravating circumstances trial judge may make that finding and impose the death sentence even if the jury participates in the sentencing phase capital sentencing is not trial within the meaning of the sixth amendment hildwin v florida 490 us 638 1989 the general principle that the sentencing authority must consider and give effect to any relevant mitigating evidence has been tempered by the current majority on the court in blystone v pennsylvania 494 us 299 1990 the court upheld state statute that required impositi on of the death penalty if the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances or if there are mitigating circumstances the court now applies reasonable like lihood standard to determine whether or not the jurors thought they were preclude d from consideration of relevant mitigating evidence boyde v california 494 us 379 1990 in lieu of the single hypothetical reasonable ju ror standard the walton case also established that state statute can constitutionally place on the defenda nt the burden of establishing by the preponderance of the evidence the existen ce of mitigating circumstances sufficient to call for leniency 497 us at 649httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96116crs7 the court has not however applied the mitigating circumstances doctrine consistently there are many fivefour decisions in pre boyde case mills v maryland 486 us 367 1988 the court remanded for resentencing because single reasonable juror might have inco rrectly thought that maryland statute required juror unanimity on particular mitigating circumstances in mckoy v north carolina 494 us 433 1990 decided the same day as the boyde case the court applied mills to invalidate north carolina statut even though the jury could opt for life imprisonment where it lacked unanimity on the mitigating evidence because one holdout juror could prevent the others from giving effect to the mitigating evidence the constitution however does not requi re jury instruction on mitigating circumstances in the absence of any supporting evidence delo v lashley 113 s ct 1222 1993 juror who will automatically vote for the death penalty upon conviction of capital crime should not be impaneled becau he or she will fail in good faith to consider the evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances if one such juror is impaneled the death penalty cannot be carried out because the defendant has been deprived of due process morgan v illinois 112 s ct 2222 1992 proportionality in the context of capital punishment pr oportionality analysis raises the question of the constitutionality of the death penalty in relation to the offense committed the death penalty cannot be imposed on ra pist who does not kill his victim coker v georgia 433 us 584 1977 initially in enmund v florida 458 us 782 1982 the court held the death penalty unconstitutional for felony murder if the defendant did not kill or attempt to take life or intend that anyone be killed the intent to kill qualification was subsequently eased in tison v arizona 481 us 137 1987 under the new standard major participation in the felony committed combined with reckless indifference to human life is sufficient to satisfy the enmund culpability requirement 481 us at 158 proportionality analysis is also sometimes used to determine whether the death penalty is disproportionate to the age or capacity of the defendant the eighth amendment does not prohibit capital puni shment for persons who commit capital offenses at age 16 or 17 stanford v kentucky 492 us 361 1989 in an earlier case different majority did prevent im position of the death penalty against 15 yearold capital offender where the state statute set minimum age for capital punishment thompson v oklahoma 487 us 815 1988 the eighth amendment does not categorically prohibit execution of mentally retarded person who has been found competent to stand trial and whose insa nity defense has been rejected by the jury penry v lynaugh 492 us 302 1989httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96116crs8 due process clause while the bulk of the death penalty cas involve construction of the eighth amendment significant number of capital cases concern application of the due process clause of the fifth and fourteen th amendments due process issues include the reasonable doubt standard notification of criminal pr ocedures and standing to prosecute the court has upheld the constitutionality of two venerable formulations of jury instructions on the reasonable doubt st andard when taken as whole victor v nebraska 114 s ct 1239 1994 in later case the court v acated murder conviction and remanded for fu rther consideration apparen tly to determine whether or not the jury instructions as whole removed any ambiguity caused by explaining that reasonable doubt meant doubt beyond moral certainty north carolina v bryant 114 s ct 1365 1994 the court found due process violation in trial that did not require jury unanimity on either the charge of premeditated murder or of felony murder in order to impose the death penalty for firstdegree murder schad jr v arizona 111 s ct 2491 1991 due process standards are vi olated however where the state does not seek the death penalty but the judge im poses death sentence without adequate notice to defense counsel that the d eath penalty remains possible sentence lankford v idaho 500 us 110 1991 also the sixth amendment right to counsel requires that state must pr ovide defense counsel with notice before examining the defendant concerning future dangerousness if this is one of the criteria for imposing the death penalty powell v texas 492 us 680 1989 united states district court has jurisdiction to try foreign national for capital crime even though the defendant is br ought within the territory of the united states by abduction carried out by ited states government officials united states v alvarezmachain 112 s ct 2188 1992 the same competency standard applies for purposes of the ability to undergo trial to enter guilty plea or for waiver of the sixth amendment right to counsel godinez v moran 113 s ct 2680 1993 the waiver of counsel must be intelligent and voluntary but is not otherwise subject to heightened standard fair and impartial jury trial the right to an impartial jury under the sixth and fourteenth amendments prohibits the exclusion of juror for cau relating to his or her capital punishment views unless those views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of duties as juror gray v mississippi 481 us 648 1987 the erroneous exclusion of qualified juror because of perceived hesitation but stated willingness to impose the death penalty constitutes reversible constitutional error the right to an impartial jury is not abridged however if juro r who should have been excluded for cause is removed by exercise of peremp tory challenge by the defendant ross v oklahoma 487 us 81 1988 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96116crs9 4 mr justice blackmun however nnounced his opposition to the death penalty only towards the end of his tenure he had dissented in furman v georgia 408 us 238 1972 in his early days on the court after 20 years of attempts to apply the death penalty without arbitrariness and capriciousness he became convinced that the task was impossiblethe court concluded in mccleskey v kemp 481 us 279 1987 that statistical data allegedly showing racial disparity in capital sentencing did not by itself suffice to establish racial discrimination in any particular case unanimous court in amadeo v zant 486 us 214 1988 did find sufficient evidence of pattern of discrimina tion in georgia countys manipul ation of the master jury lists to overturn murder conviction for violation of the right to fair and impartial jury there is constitutional re quirement to examine prospective jurors about the extent and content of their exposure to newspaper and media accounts of the capital crime even substantial pretrial publicity will not disqualify juror who states he or she can be impartial if the trial court believes the juror has formed opinion about the case mumin v virginia 500 us 415 1991 conclusion the changed composition of the supreme court has had significant impact on death penalty jurisprudence during the last 6 years justices brennan marshall and blackmun4 who were opposed to the imposition of the death penalty in any case departed the court the early trend of decisions post furman v georgia 408 us 238 1972 was to create new procedural pr otections for capital defendant s in carrying out the death penalty this early trend has given way to an increasing impatience with the delays these procedural protections entail solid majority of the court seems committed to paring back or at least to halting the growth of constitutionally required criminal procedures the court is more hospitabl to state capital punishment procedures in twothirds of the cases decided in the last 6 years the state criminal procedures were held to comport with constitutional requirements the death penalty before the supreme court remains divisive intensely controversial subject within the last 6 years majority has formed to restrict access to habeas corpus review to curtail abuse of the writ of habeas corpus and to pare back other procedural hurdles delaying or preventing imposition of the death penalty this majority seems committed to process of streamlining constitutionally required procedures so that those states that choose to impos the death penalty may do so without the delays that have char acterized united states capital punishment procedures since the 1960s there are s till many fivefour decisions when they were on the court justices brennan and ma rshall deplored what they perceived was an unjustifiable assault on the great writ mccleskey v zant 499 us 467 507 1991 the majority responded that without finality the criminal law is deprived of much of its deterrent effect 499 us at 491 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96116crs10 the changed direction of capital punishme nt jurisprudence is only now making itself felt in state criminal trials and ppellate review of c onvictions and capital sentences
