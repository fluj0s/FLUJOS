agreement to the degree that its mutual defense provisions might enable the gcc states to shoulder more of their future defense burden this is onetime report the gulf cooperation council founded in 1981 during the iraniraq war is slowly maturing organization of six oilproducing persian gulf states saudi arabia kuwait bahrain qatar oman and the united arab emirates whic h has the stated goal of increasing economic and administrative cooperation between these wealthy and conservative arab regimes the governments have made incremental progress in number of fields over the years and gcc coordination at the level of foreign ministers and ministers of petroleum is now routine before major international meetings but the gcc governm ents have in general moved deliberately and cautiously and increased coordination has not led uniformly to increased cooperation much less integration labor capital and investment barriers among the states are gradually being whittled away but common customs regime one of the organizations primary stated tasks will not be in place until 2005 even on the present timetable1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20831crs2 2 the text of the pact has not been published kuwaiti minister of defense salem sabah described draft in these terms in 1999 mideast mirror nov 18 1999 defense agreement approved at the december 2000 summit meeting is something of new departure for an organization whose members have so far been careful to cede very little of their sovereignty and cautious on defense coordination in an effort not to irritate iraq and iran their more powerful neighbors the gcc member s never made mutual defense major stated goal of the organization nevertheless it has always been background objective and has over the years increasingly moved to the forefront with scheduled meetings of defense ministers regularly complementing other ministeriallevel sectoral meetings the agreement the december 2000 summit participants agreed according to press reports to make formal commitment by which they would consider any outside aggression against one gcc member as aggression against all members2 the treaty obligation which has been described as necess ary in order to give appropriate legal status to an existing informal commitment is unlikely to include automatic triggers for mobilization in the event of an attack it still has to be ratified by the member governments before going into effect so far only bahrain has done so and there is timetable for completion of the process the pact which has been under discussion by the gcc defense ministers for over year appears to have been approved as condition for agreement on package of measures which would move the countries somewhat further down the road toward common defense those include agreement to expand the existing joint defense force called peninsula shield and stationed in saudi arabia near the iraqi border from its present 5000 man strength up to 22000 men and agreements to move forward on common secure communications network and an early warning system status of gcc defense cooperation the members of the gcc have moved very slowly toward meaningful defense cooperation the joint peninsula shield force technically in existence since 1986 played virtually role in the 199091 gulf crisis and has rarely been manned at even its presently authorized strength the increase to mechanized infantry division strength of 22000 was authorized prior to the recent summit and it is not clear whether the members will now be more prepared than they have been in the past to permanently earmark or assign their scarce manpower to the joint force even the newly funded measures the 70 million early warning system and the 80 million secure communications network have been under development for over two years by linking the operations rooms of the national commands and their radar and early warning systems those projects will offer improved capacity for cooperation but not necessarily joint or common defense capability each gcc member has preferred to assure its primary defense against external aggression through unilateral measures strengthening its own armed forces to the degree possible and accepting defense cooperation agreements with outside powers the united states through the central command or centcom has signed defense cooperationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20831crs3 3 egyptian foreign minister amr mousa to cairo mena december 12 2000 quoted by the foreign broadcast information service 12202000agreements with all the members except saudi arabia and is seen by the gcc states as the primary guarantor of their external security most of the states have signed additional defense cooperation agreements with the united kingdom and france while kuwait also has agreements with russia and china immediately after the gulf war the gcc states also signed an agreement with egypt and syria in damascus that provided framework for military and economic cooperation but that has largely been ignored since that time and is considered to be moribund by its participants3 hurdles to increased defense cooperation the gcc is an association of likeminded conservative arab states which have come together to cooperate in facing the challenges of the times and of their strategically important region but which are still heavily influenced by long tradition of mutual competition and conflict one of the states the united arab emirates is itself confederation whose members have widely differing views as to domestic foreign and defense policy long standing disputes between the ruling families are diminishing slowly as border agreements are reached and new generation of rulers comes to the fore but history casts long shadow in the region and one border dispute between bahrain and qatar continues to impact negatively on the gcc as an organization in addition to the historical competition which has caused the ruling families to move slowly toward measures which would limit their sovereignty the gcc states do not fully share consensus on defense priorities kuwait and saudi arabia are focused on the threat from saddams iraq and are prepared in the circumstances to envisage closer relationship with iran than are their colleagues down the gulf saudi arabia has responded favorably to signs of moderation in iranian policy over the past few years and is expected to sign an agreement on police and border security cooperation with tehran the southern gulf states on the other hand farther from iraq and very conscious of the potentia l threat from their powerful iranian neighbor resist having the preponderant saudis set the organizations priorities and insist that any common defense measures also encompass the iranian threat the uae in particular wants stronger support from its gcc colleagues in its dispute with iran over iranian occupation of the midgulf islands of abu musa and the tunbs and might try to use the new defense pact if it is ratified to define iranian occupation of those islands as an aggression against it finally two states oman and qatar tend to espouse accommodation with both iran and iraq gcc caution in mutual defense measures is reinforced by desire to avoid polemics with neighboring states iran has long insisted that viable security regime in the gulf can only be developed by the states of the region free of outside powers involvement as the gccs limited common effort has so far been in the opposite direction they have moved hesitantly and with limited visibility so as not to aggravate their relations with the regional power the gcc members are also sensitive to charges leveled at them from other arab countries and arab nationalists that gcc defense cooperation undercuts the mutual defense commitments of the arab league as saudi arabia and kuwait based their call for arab military help in 1990 on the arab leagues defense pact they cannot ignorehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20831crs4 4 for comparative military strengths of the gulf states see crs report the persian gulf issues for us policy 2000 november 3 2000 rl 30728 5 official rules out common gcc arms deals financial times information october 17 2000 6 testimony of principal assistant secretary of defense alina l romanowski house committee continuedthese arguments and their public statements insist that gcc cooperation is within the framework of the arab league pact finally each gcc state gives absolute priority to its own national defense efforts their thin manpower pool precludes any meaningful force buildup and limits enthusiasm for major commitment to joint defense force stationed in and commanded by saudi arabia4 more importantly each state has jealously guarded its defense procurement capabi lities given the governments reliance on expensive hightech and manpower saving defense mechanisms defense procurement has been subjected to intense political scrutiny and control in each capital and government has shown readiness to subordinate its national interest to gccwide efforts toward joint procurement or even interoperability among different national systems the gcc has even emphasized that it has objective for common defense procurement5 us policy the united states has consistently encouraged gcc defense cooperation within framework of cooperation with us forces centcom has been in the forefront in pushing for policies such as common procurement planning to assure the greatest possible interoperability and has had some success in planning joint exercises with multiple gcc partners to the degree that there is growing gcc common defense mechanism it is in large measure due to centcoms efforts indeed the secure defense communications and early warning networks are scaleddown versions of centcom proposal of two years ago namely that the gcc countries develop theater missile defense system with us help that proposal which was actively pushed by former secretary of defense cohen was not accepted at the time by the gcc members in large degree because of its high visibility cost and accusations that it was designed to benefit american defense contractors above all that the gcc is now moving forward quietly and in more modest fashion with some key elements of the cooperative defense initiative in particular those elements that deal with planning for chemicalbiological attacks shows that they recognize the necessity for greater multilateral cooperation even if they are unwilling to accord it high priority bilateral defense cooperation will continue to be the key to their efforts coordinated to some degree through the gcc but more commonly in facto manner through their respective relationships with centcom the us military presence in the gulf continues to provide for international access to the regions energy supplies containment of iraq and the security of the gcc states our defen cooperation agreements or in the case of saudi arabia less formal agreements provide for facilities prepositioning of supples training and substantial host nation support at any given time around 20000 american

gcc as an entity but taken together with the regular consultations exercises and contacts between centcom and the local military establishments the united states in effect provides the basic elements of gccwide mutual defense system conclusion the gcc pact appears to add little to the mutual defense capability of the organization the ratification process moreover is likely to take time and is not assured of success the issues which have slowed meaningful gcc defense cooperation from historical differences to unwillingness to coordinate defense acquisitions will continue to militate against dramatic progress in mutual defense the us military presence in the persian gulf on which the individual gcc states rely will most likely continue to provide the major facto defense coordinating mechanisms for the gcc for the foreseeable future httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20831crs6 saudi arabiapersian gulfgulf of oman gulf of adenarabian seagulf of aqabamediterranean sea dead sea oman yemeniran
