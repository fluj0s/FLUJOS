competitive threat while others may view china as potential partner this is the final edition of this report introduction china has been launching sa tellites since 1970 most of th launches are of chinese communications weather remote sensing navigation or scie ntific satellites some of those satellites may be for military applications or are dual use some were commercial launches for foreign countries or companies primarily pl acing communications satellites into orbit china launched its first astronaut or taikonaut1 in october 2003 china has three space launch sites jiuquan also called shuang chengtzu in the gobi desert xichang in southeastern china near chengdu and taiyuan south of beijing jiuquan was chinas first launch site and is used for launches of variety of spacecraft including those related to the human spaceflight program xichang inaugurated in 1984 is used for launches in to geostationary orb it above th equator primarily communications sate llites taiyuan whic h opened in 1988 is used for launches into polar orbits that circle the earth s poles primarily weather and other earth observation satellites china has several different launch vehicles most are

humans into sp ace started in 1992 and is designated by the chinese as project 921 an earlier effort was discontinued due to economic pressures two chinese specialists trained at russias cosmonaut training facility in star city near moscow in 1997 according to chinese press reports the taikonaut corps consists of 12 trainees and tw trainers all fighter pilots the shenzhou spacecraft design is pa tterned after russias soyuz spacecraft although the chinese insist that the spacecraf t are made entirely in china shenzhou consists of three modules the descent modul service module and an orbital module at the end of the primary mission the des cent module and servi ce module detach from the orbital module the service module positi ons the descent module correctly for reentry and fires its engines to initiate descent it detaches from the descent module and disintegrates in the atmosphere as the scent module returns to earth the orbital module typically remains in orbit for severa l months it has its own propulsion system allowing it to make maneuvers on some of the test flights experiments were carried on the orbital module in addition to those in the scent module four orbital test flights of the shenzhou spacecraft were conducted without crews between 1999 and 2003 in preparation for the flight of shenzhou 5 shenzhou 6 two taikonauts on fiveday mission china launched its

after about five days 115 hours and 32 minutes in addition to learning more about human spaceflight in general the crew carried out scientific exper iments the shenzhou 6 orb ital module remains in orbit future plans including the moon chinese officials have been quoted discussing threestep human spaceflight plan send humans into earth orbit dock spacecraft together to form small laborator and ultimately build large space station2 following the landing of the shenzhou 6 cr ew chinese space offi cial said that mission including spacewalk was planned for 2007 and mission involving rendezvous and docking planned for the 20092012 time period whether the chinese are planning to nd humans to the moon has become topical subject since president bush announced plans for the united states to

such mission may be under discu ssion but there is definitive program or timetable most chinese reports regarding lunar expl oration plans discuss robotic rather than human missions an oftcite d threestep scenario calls for the launch of robotic spacecraft to orbit the moon in 2007 then robotic mission to land rover on the moon around 2010 and finally robotic probe to return lunar samples to earth around 20203 the first step of that plan to build pr obe to orbit the moon is underway the launch of the probe named change is expected in 2007 chinese space officials quoted in the chinese media rarely mention plans to nd humans to the moon however reports on chinese websites in 2002 and 2005 discussed th reestep plan to do so the plan begins with human trips to earth orbit including earthorbiting space labor atories then robotic probes to the moon and ultimate ly human landing on the moon4 timetable for the human lunar landing portion was provided in those stories however 2005 report in nonchinese government owned newspaper quoted designer with the chinese lunar orbiting exploration program as describing another version of the threestep plan robotic lunar orbiter in 2007 robotic probes to land on the moon and collect samples over 45 years and if things go well we will send astronauts to the moon by 20205 still other chinese space offici als assert they cannot be in space race with other countries citing factors such as chinas comparatively low percapita gross domestic product the gap between urban and rural areas the lack of medical insurance for its 800 million farmers and the lack of rocket powerful enough to send people to the moon6 guiding principles and funding the chinese government published wh ite paper in november 2000 outlining its goals and guiding principles for the space program the first principle is adhering to the principle of longter m stable and sustainable development and making the development of space activities cater to and serve the

commercial space launch activities china announced its intention to ente r the commercial space launch business in 1986 commercial space unch competition is discussed in crs issue brief ib93062 chinese launch services are marketed thr ough china great wall industries corporation cgwic virtually all communications satellites requiring commercial launch services are built in the united states or include u s components so us export licenses must be granted to send the satellites to china for launch the united states thus has played key role in the evolution of the chinese co mmercial launch services business in 1988 the reagan administration approved the first export licenses for three satellites to be sent to china on the condition that china sign three international treaties concerning among other things liability for damage from space unches negotiate fair trade agreement with the united states regarding launch services and reach agreement on protecting technology from being transferre d while satellites are in china all conditions were met by january 1989 at that time commercial communications satellite s were on the us munitions list and export license requests were handled by the state department following the tiananmen square uprising in june 1989 the bush administration suspended all export licenses for items on the munitions list including the three satellites the suspension was ultimately lifted and the satellites were launched by china the incident underscored the coupling of commercial comm unications satellites export licenses and overall rela tionships between the united states and china the 1990s witnessed repeated instances where export licenses would be granted suspended and reinstated depending on the political situati on in 1997 allegations surfaced that china was obtaining militarily useful information by launching us satellites the charges concerned investigations in to launch failures involving usbuilt satellites where two us companies loral and hughes allegedl assisted china in understanding the cause of the accidents and how to remedy them by that time responsibility for commercial communications satellite exports had been shifted from the state department to the commerce department in response to th allegations congress returned exporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21641crs5 responsibility to the state department as of march 15 1999 the st ate department has not granted any export licenses for usbuilt communications satellites or satellites containing us components to china si nce then most commercial communications satellites are usbuilt or c ontain us components so chinese commercial space launch operations have been suspended however in january 2006 china announced that it would launch frenchbuilt communications satellite presumably it does not contain us components and thus does not need to comply with us export controls military space activities chinese officials routinely call for usin g space for peaceful purposes and argue against the militarization of space in settin gs such as the conference on disarmament however the november 2000 white paper includes national security as one of the purposes served by the space program and chinas remote sensing communications and navigation satellites presumably satisfy both military and civilian objectives the chinese space program is c

spacecraft launch vehicles and other aer ospace products cgwic see above is part of casc cascs website is httpwwwspacechinacom the us department of defense dod publishes an nnual report on military

pp 3536 the dod report lists number of activities that are ongoing or in which china appears interested that dod asserts have potential milita ry applications the human spaceflight program remote sensing satellites electronic intelligence satellites and an assortment of what dod describes as small satellites not further defined microsatellites weighing less than 100 kilograms and minisatellites weighing between 101 nd 500 kilograms the missions for those various classes of small satellites include remote sensing communications and navigation the dod report states that in th next decade china most likely will field radar ocean surveillance and improved f ilmbased photorec onnaissance satellites china will eventually deploy advanced imagery reconnaissance and earth resource systems with military applications fi nally the report states that china is working on and plans to field antisatellite systems including conducting research to develop groundbased laser

and someday sending them to mars he invited other countries to join in november 2004 nasa sponsored an internati onal exploration workshop fo r other countries interested in the vision and chinese space officials participated th head of the chinese space agency laiyan sun made courtesy call on mr okeefe those actions sparked discussion of whether china might be incl uded in implementing the vision in january 2005 the trade publication aviation week space technology awst quoted mr okeefe as supporting cooperation with china11 representative mark kirk visited china in january 2006 and was quoted by the associated press january 11 2006 1909 as saying that president bush wants space c ooperation to be discusse d at planned april 2006 uschina summit representative ken calvert chairman of the space and aer onautics subcommittee of the house science committee was quoted by awst in october 2005 as expressing concern that china might send humans to the moon before nasa returns astronauts there even if we follow the president s vision and were back to the moon by 2020 i also serve on the armed service sic committee so i have the ability to look at lot of things and looking at things that are not classified more than likely the chinese will be on the moon before that i would rather be on the moon to greet the chinese rather than going to the moon and have the chinese greet us12 he reportedly added that any cooperation with the chinese at this point i suspect would be more oneway than it would be twoway plus the fact that we need to be cautious about how we go about doing cooperation and what our policy should be so i would be careful the awst article cautioned however that representative calverts assessment that china might land astronauts on the moon before the united states returns there had risk it could backfire over the long term if it becomes clear he was bluffing citing an unnamed congressional source the awst article stated it would be hard to make an argument that the us is in race to the moon when china has only one human orbital flight under its belt and is preparing to send two men on fiveday mission reminiscent of soviet flights in the 1960s
