issues involved the broad array of these i ssues briefly discussed in this report has been described by some as comprising perhaps the most complex negotiations ever undertaken internationally overview1 concerns over climate change often termed global warming have emerged both in the united states and internationally as major policy issues reports in 2007 by the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc provided scientific underpinnings for these concerns and the num ber of proposals and in ternational meetings devoted to these issues has grow n as discussed in this report in december 2007 the 13th conference of the parties cop13 to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc convened in balihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22899crs2 indonesia and agreed on the bali action plan to guide negotiations over the next two years with the goal of formulating by 2009 decisi on concerning the next round of commitments by the nations of the world to address climate change the third meeting of the parties mop3 of the kyoto protoc ol was held concurren tly the annual meetings are termed copmop during 2008 several ad hoc working group meetings were scheduled to work on these issues beginning with meeting in bangkok thailand in april that formulated work plan for the negotiati ons subsequent meetings in bonn germany in june and accra ghana in august will precede th annual unfccckyoto protocol meeting in poznan poland in december 2008 an increased intensity of effort is expected during 2009 culminating in the years end cop15 mop5 in copenhagen denmark by mid 2008 the variety of positions across the particip ants was evident in the meetings in bonn reflecting many conflicting concerns that ve been present from the beginning of the process in 1992 major challenges involve fi nding agreement on the nature of legally binding commitments if any that would prove acceptable to all major players developed nations that are subject to kyot protocol restricti ons developing countries that are major emitters and the united states other large issues include setting longterm goal for atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gase s agreeing on flexi ble mechanisms for meeting goals including future emissions trading systems financial assistance to developing countries for mitigation and adapta tion to climate change technology transfer issues and how to deal with land use change and forests as sinks that absorb carbon from the atmosphere background the first treaty to address climate change the unfccc was completed and opened for signature in 1992 the overriding objective of the treaty is to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interferen ce with the climate system it includes voluntary commitments for developed countries to establish national action plans that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 the united states was one of the first nations to sign and ratify this treaty and it entered into force in 1994 however it was s oon concluded by pa rties to the treaty that mandatory reductions in emissions of the six majo r greenhouse gases of which carbon dioxide mainly from burning of fossil fuels is the mo st prevalent would be required in order to meet the unfccc objective the resulting kyoto protocol which was co mpleted in 1997 and entered into force in february 2005 committed indus trialized nations that ra tify it to specified legally binding reductions in emissions of six major greenhouse gases the united states has not ratified the protocol and thus is not bound by its provisions in march 2001 the bush administration rejected the kyoto protocol and subsequently announced us policy for climate change that relies on voluntar actions to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity ratio of emissions to economic output of the us economy by 18 over the next 10 years under the kyoto protocol the collective commitments of the industrialized nations are to reduce the par ties emissions by at leas t 5 below their 1990 levels averaged over the commitment period 2008 to 2012 the 38 nations with such commitments are listed in annex i of the unfccc and usually referred to as annex i parties developing countries are generally re ferred to as nonannex i parties as ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22899crs3 may 13 2008 the unfccc secretariat listed 181 nations including the european union as parties to the ky oto protocol australia announ ced its ratification at the december meeting in bali during 2007 several highlevel meetings focused on the need to deal with climate change including the g8 meeting in june 2007 and meetings at the united nations president bush announced on may 31 2007 that the united states would convene series of major economies meetings mems to begin in washington dc through 2008 to find voluntary framework for dealing with energy security and climate change in april 2008 president bush announced us c limate change policy that would aim for an end to the growth of us emissions by 2025 during 2007 climate change gained widespr ead attention as critical issue facing the nations of the world and the negotiati ons held in bali indonesia december 314 2007 were widely regarded as key next step in continuing to chart an international course to mitigate global warming and deal with its impacts the kyoto protocol was always intended to be first step in moving toward reducing global accumulations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere negotia tors recognized that the goals of the protocol even if met by all the parties w ould not produce the stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gases posited as the goal of the unfccc the protocol set forth timetable for reviewing progress of actions undertaken to meet the protocols goals and to consider next steps it has been generally anticip ated that next steps after 2012 would include measures to be taken by both developed and developing countries throughout the process developing countries have b een unwilling to make binding commitments on greenhouse gas limitations or management the bali action plan the outcome of negotiations at the bali co p13mop3 was expected to be at best what was termed road map for future negotiations it was agreed by all parties that negotiations following from decisions at bali need to be completed by the end of 2009 some observers have noted that this is very tight time frame in that many parties are aware that the current us administration continues to reject mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reductions and they expect that further progress on mandatory ghg limitations cannot be made unless new ad ministration in 2009 is willing to participate further it appears unlikely that major developing and even developed countries will be willing to make legally binding commitments in the absence of such commitment by the united states four key pillars or elements of the bali action plan guided the negotiations in late 2007 and continue as the focus areas of followon meetings 1 mitigation of climate change primarily finding ways to reduce greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere 2 adaptation to impacts of climate change 3 financial assistance issues and 4 technology development and transfer thes four areas of consideration plus the question of shared vision for longterm goal s and action constitute the five key elements of the bali action plan while future negotiations will likely grapple with the effort to obtain some form of legally binding mandatory commitments from all parties the recognition of differing national circumstances and differing abilities of nations to take on various types of commitments will continue to be major elements in the discussionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22899crs4 2 see httpunfcccintmeetingscop_13items4049php fo r the full text of the bali action planmajor elements and issues of the bali action plan2 include the following need for deep cuts in global emissions the decision at bali recognized that deep cuts in global emissions will be required to achieve the ultimate objective of the convention avoiding dangerous climate change and emphasized the urgency to address climate change as indicated in the fourth assessment report of the ipcc some developed countries notably eu members had argued that sp ecific goals should be articulated in terms of atmospheric concen trations of ghg that should not be exceeded but this was opposed by others including th united states and as compromise the limits discussed by the ipcc were referenced in general with footnote citation to the specific numbers negotiations process twotrack negotiatin g process was launched 1 an ad hoc working group on longterm cooperative action awglca was established as subsidiary body under the unfccc to conduct the process of negotiating agreement by 2009 on measures to be undertaken by all parties to the convention developing nd developed this was regarded as breakthrough because it established body that coul d negotiate decision not just as previously carry on dialogue that would include developing countries and would address mitigation measures emissions reductions as well as the other items listed for consideration and 2 the ad hoc working group under the ky oto protocol awg kp will continue to consider action by devel oped countries to succeed the 2 012 conclusion of the kyoto protocol explicit reference to this awg was made in the bali decision document thus it simply continues shared vision for longterm coope rative action and differentiated responsibilities need to develop shared visi on for cooperative action was agreed including longterm global goal for emission reductions to achieve the ultimate objective of the convention in accordance with the provisions and principles of the convention in particular the principle of common but differentia ted responsibilities and respective capabilities and taking into account social and economic conditions and other relevant factors mitigation action the actions to be considered fo rby developing country parties in the negotiations under the bali action plan pr oved to be one of th most controversial points and almost led to breakdown of negotiations on the final day in bali the document outlining the bali action plan contains two separate paragraphs for mitigation considerations i for veloped country considerati ons and ii for developing countries initially both paragraphs stated that enhanced nationa linternational action on mitigati on of climate change would include c onsideration of measurable reportable and verifiable nationally appropriate mitigation actions by both developed and developing parties some developing countries objected that this language was not what had been agreed to and reversal of clauses in the language of pa ragraph ii regarding actions by developing countries was proposed by india this was opposed by the unitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22899crs5 3 agreements at cop meetings like most international negotiations are made by consensus not through voting thus objections by any party can serve as an effective veto by preventing consensusstates nearly causing the breakdown in negotiations3 the phrase as adopted is as follows ii nationally appropr iate mitigation actions by veloping country parties in the context of sustainable development s upported and enabled by technology financing and capacity building in measurable reportable and veri fiable manner those supporting this language argued that the financing technology transfer and capacity building actions by veloped countries should also be measurable reportable and verifiable as the langua ge was debated in the final plenary session some of the developing countries reassure d participants that they d made commitment to consider mitigation actions in the negotiations that w ould follow this debate underscored the continuing tensions between veloped and developi ng nations over the issue of financial and other assistance and the degree to which such assistance must be made available through international agreement emissions from deforestati on and forest degradation the decision to include reducing emissions from deforesta tion and forest degradation among the considerations in the negotiations to follow bali is widely regarded as major positive step by many participants in the process ope ning the door to discussions of incentives for developing countries to reduce and avoid deforesta tion the decisi on states that mitigation considerations in th negotiations should include iii policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries nd the role of conservation sustainable management of forests and nhancement of forest carbon stoc ks in developing countries other major elements in the action plan adaptation considerations were also listed among considerations for negotiations including international support for adaptation actions risk management and ri sk reduction strategies disaster reduction strategies and means to address loss and damages associated with climate change impacts in developing countries and wa ys to strengthen the role of the convention in encouraging multilateral bodies and all sectors of society to support ad aptation activities considerations for ways to improve access and provide support concerning tec hnology development are also included in the action plan as well as enhanced action on provision of financial resources and investments to spur both mitigation and adaptation activities next steps the bali decision mandates that the ad hoc working group on longterm cooperative action under the unfccc is to complete its work in 2009 and present the outcome to the 15th copmop5 which is due to meet in copenhagen denmark november 30 to december 11 2009 statem ent is included concerning the ad hoc working group under the kyoto protocol but many observers expect that at some point the two working groups will find way to conn ect their considerations the question of making this linkage has not been directly addressed in negotiations to date but will be important if comprehensive agreement is to be achieved the two ad hoc working groups meet concurrently at each of the ne gotiating sessions often along with the two longstanding subsidiary bodies that addre ss variety of techni cal and implementation issues the subsidiary body on implemen tation sbi and the subsidiary body onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22899crs6 4

first session of the unfccc ad hoc working groups met march 31april 4 2008 in bangkok thailand broad work plan was agreed upon including series of eight workshops to discuss specific issues such as measuring reporting and verifying mrv sector approaches finance risk management and othe rs all five key elements of the bali action plan are to be on the agenda and considered at each future session of the ad hoc working groups it was also agreed that the awglca will finalize its work program for 2009 later th an at its fourth session in december 2008 discussions in bangkok involved in large pa rt continuation of the often conflicting approaches taken by countries in the past si gnaling the challenges faced by negotiators however the meeting ended on positive note according to reports from those attending the second in the series of ad hoc wo rking group meetings in 2008 was held in bonn germany june 213 2008 the meetings in bonn continued to illustrate the growing complexity of the issues under discussion and negotiation4 and included concurrent sessions of sbi and sbsta as in past such gatherings each day contained multitude of specialized meetings on speci fic subjects often in contact groups that offer the opportunity for informal interacti ons that can iron out or sometimes exacerbate differences and pave the way for future agreement on some of the more contentious issues decisions were expected in bonn but the array of meetin gs in which several groups often took up the same issue revealed not only the complexity of the issues at hand but also the slow pace that led to majo r concerns as to whether resolution can be found over the next 18 months major issues continue to focus on finding an agreedupon shared vision for reducing the threat of climate change the role of financial ssistance and technology transfer what developing countries regard as essential and both the mechanisms and funding levels regarded as acceptable by developed countries adaptation to climate change multitude of issues under the kyoto protocol such as flexibility mechanisms and role of forests and land us as sinks and how the issues and concerns being discussed in the two ad hoc working groups will be li nked as the time period proceeds in most of the discussions the partic ipants ended by agreeing on technical papers or workshops that should be created the next meetings will convene in accr ghana august 2127 2008 at the end of the year the two working groups will m eet concurrently with the cop14mop4 meeting in poznan poland december 1 12 2 008 the work program for 2009 was addressed in bonn with decision that four sessions should be held in 2009 in marchapril in june in conjunction with sbi and sbsta sessions in augustseptember and the fourth in conjunction with co p15mop5 in copenha gen november 3 to december 11 at which time decisions will be reached about how to proceed concerning the post2012 period after the kyoto protocol ex pires the possibility of two additional sessions in 2009 was discussed but decision was made at bonn
