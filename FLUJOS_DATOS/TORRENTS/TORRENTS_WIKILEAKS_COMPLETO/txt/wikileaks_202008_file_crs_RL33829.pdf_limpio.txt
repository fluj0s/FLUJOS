affecting domestic food assistance programs in the 110th congress the program areas that are addressed include the regular food stamp program programs operating in lieu of food stamps eg puerto rico indian reservations the emergency food assistance program tefap the commodity supplemental food program community food projects the niors farmers market nutrition program initiatives to provide fresh fruit and vegetable in schools and newly proposed nutrition and health promotion or support projects other nutrition programs child nutrition and wic programs have not been major part of the active legislative debate although number of bills noted in this report address them and some legislative changes affecting them are part of appropriations law and the farm bill the 2008 farm bill has been enacted as pl 110246 the nutrition title of this law has projected new cost of about 3 billion over the next 5 years fy2008fy2012 and well over 9 billion over the next 10 years fy2008fy2017 the major share of this spending is due to changes in food stamp rulesincreasing benefits and loosening eligibility standardsand expansion of support for tefap and fresh fruit and vegetable initiatives the most significant substantive nutrition program i ssues that were raised in the farm bill debate were those surrounding the food stamp program and support for fruit and vegetable programs particularly how much to add in new spending despite cost differences the house and senate bills were very similar in the policy changes they proposed their nutrition titles title iv renamed the food stamp program increased program benefits and loosened some eligibility rules they increased spending for tefap added support for the fresh fruit and vegetable program and allowed exercise of geographic preference when procuring food for child nutrition programs however they differed in some policy aspects the house proposed substantial limits on states ability to privatize their administration of food stamps not adopted in the final measure and the senates bill included number of initiatives not covered in the house only some of which were incorporated in the final law relating to food stamp eligibility for able bodied adults without dependents eased access to the food stamp program support for farmers markets projects to promote health and nutrition through the food stamp program and dietary supplements lingering issue involves the response of food assistance programs to recent relatively rapid food price inflation although legislation has been introduced in this regard this report will be updated as warranted by legislative action httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33829g6g152g150g142g156g157g146 g140g561g8g152g152g141g561g3g156g156g146g156g157g138g151g140g142g497g561g22g145

last farm bill was enacted in 2002 that covers most programs and activities carried out by the us department of agriculture usda or agriculture department in this report farm bills serve as vehicle for reauthorizing wide range of expiring authorities making changes in or ending existing programs and launching new initiatives 1 on the other hand some food assistance efforts are reauthorized and reviewed on different schedule and are up for review in 2009 these include child nutrition programs like the school lunch program the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic program and the wic fa rmers market nutrition program2 with exceptions annual appropriations laws typically are not the arena for significant policy decisions relating to nutrition assistance programs3 and some important nutrition program changes now under way at the usda are unlikely to become the subject of legislation per such as revision of the content of food packages distributed through the wic program revamping the nutrition guidelines for school meals modification of food packages offered under the food distribution program on indian reservations the fdpir this report covers issues and legislative changes addressed in the farm bill legislative changes included in the fy2008 agriculture appropriations measure included in the fy2008 consolidated appropriations

provisions and legislative action by ren√©e johnson et 2 normally the only childnutrition or wicrelated provisions that might appear in farm bill are those relating to commodity assistance to schools or initiatives like fresh fruit and vegetable projects discussed later in this report however past farm bills have in some cases included relatively minor revisions affecting child nutrition and wic program operations child nutrition and wic programs were last subject to comprehensive review and reauthorization in the 2004 child nutrition and wic reauthor ization act pl 108265 unlike in the senate where they along with most other food assistance programs are under the jurisdiction of the senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry child nutrition and wi c programs are in the jurisdiction of the education and labor committee in the house 3 major exceptions are funding levels for the commodity supplemental food program the csfp and the food distribution program on indian

36 of usda outlays4 the lions share of this support was for the food stamp program which along with child nutrition and wic programs is widely viewed as the federal governments primary response to the food needs of lowincome americans nutriti on assistance programs also play role in federal support for the agricultural sector through direct commodity purchases and increased demand for food the usda oversees almost 20 domestic nutrition assistance programs and related activities spending some 54 billion in fy2006 55 of usda outlays5 virtually all are administered by states schools or local grantees under federally prescribed rules federal oversight of these programs eg regulations governing program operations is the responsibility of the usdas food and nutrition service fns in addition the usdas agricultural marketing service ams the farm service agency fsa and the commodity credit corporation ccc play roles in the procurement and distribution of food commodities for some programs the farm bill covers 8 of these program areas accounting for about 65 of federal spending on domestic nutrition aid farm bills traditionally reauthorize expiring authorities and appropriations for these domestic nutrition assistance initiatives and are the principal vehicle for revising rules that govern how they operate and how much they will cost they regularly include the following 5 areas the regular food stamp program in the 50 states the district of columbia guam and the virgin islands programs operating in lieu of the regular food stamp programnutrition assistance block grants for puerto rico american samoa and the northern mariana islands along with the food distribution program on indian reservations the fdpir the emergency food assistance program tefap the commodity supplemental food program the csfp and community food projects moreover the 2002 farm bill added 3 items to this list it provided statutory authority and mandatory funding for new seniors farmers market nutrition program the sfmnp and established pilot program to distribute free fruits and vegetables in schools later expanded and made permanent it also included provision affecting commodities distributed to schools earmarking some federal spending on these commodities for fresh produce acquired and distributed through defense department procurement facilities the dod fresh program all farm bill domestic nutrition assistance programs except for the csfp the fdpir and the administrative and distributioncost component of tefap generally are treated as mandatory entitlements for budget purposes for the regular food stamp program this means that in order 4 for domestic food assistance in the usda budget see crs report rl34132 agriculture and related agencies fy2008 appropriations by jim monke 5 nutrition programs for the elderly authorized under the older americans act and administered through the department of health and human services are the only domestic nutrition assistance programs outside the usda they are typically funded at about 700 million year in th appropriations measure for the department of health and human services

other program rules must be changed specific annual mandatory funding levels are set by law for the puerto rico and american samoa grants these are indexed the food component of tefap community food

govern the csfp the administrative and distribution cost component of tefap and the amount set aside for the fdpir the 2002 farm bill made extensive changes to food stamp program rules and relatively minor revisions to those for the other programs 6 using its march 2002 baseline the congressional budget office cbo estimated that the total additional cost of the provisions in the nutrition assistance title of the 2002 farm bill would be about 3 billion over the sixyear life of the bill representing 56 of total new spending prompted by the bill however while there is direct measure of the real cost of the 2002 bills nutrition title as opposed to costs incurred because of other variables like unforeseen participation changes related to economic conditions or increased participation rates total actual costs through fy2005 for the programs covered by the nutrition titleincluding both baseline spending and new spending caused by the farm billwere 12 higher than projected in 2002 if current cbo estimates for fy2006 and fy2007 are added in and compared to the 2002 estimates for those years the gap widens to 20 g8g152g152g141g561g21g157g138g150g153g156g349g561 the largest of the nutrition assistance programs is the food stamp program at 33 billion in fy2006 it represents some 95 of the federal spending for farm bill nutrition assistance programs is the foundation of federal initiatives to give lowincome households the chance to obtain at least minimally adequate diet and is major factor in overall federal policy for the poor the purpose and structure of the program has evolved over time it is meant to play role in three areas of federal public policy food stamps originated as way of providing an outlet for surplus agricultural production with the notable side benefit of supporting poor families however its goals and role in the countrys support system for the lowincome population have shifted and expanded greatly to the extent it expands food purchasing power it continues to support demand for agricultural products 8 but it now also is seen as the governments primary response to important concerns about the overall food security status of the lowincome population although only an estimated 65 of eligible individuals choose to participate by the most recent count 2005 2006 economic resear ch service ers study reports that in 2005 11 of us households were food insecure and that the prevalence of very low food security was 399 finally the food stamp program has become an integral part of the overall 6 for detailed discussion of nutrition assistance program changes made and considered in the 2002 farm bill see crs report rl33690 food stamps and nutrition programs in the 2002 farm bill by joe richardson 7 authorized under the food stamp act 7 usc 2011 et seq 8 dollar in food stamp benefits is estimated to result in new food spending of 1747 cents depending on household income and type versus 510 cents in the case of dollar of cash although food stamp aid itself must be spent on food dollar in food stamps does not lead to full dollar of additional food spending b ecause cash previously spent on food is freed up and can be used for nonfood expenses that for the recipient may be more pressing 9 this second category was denominated as food insecure with h unger in reports for earlier years households classified as food insecure were grouped into two categories those classified as having low food security 71 continued

for typical lowincome recipient family with children food stamps can provide some 25 of their purchasing power g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 the regular food stamp program provides inflationindexed monthly benefits to lowincome households that supplement their own spending on food benefits vary by income household expenses like shelter costs and household sizebut generally not by state or region 10 they are delivered through electronic benefit transfer ebt cards that are used like debit cards eligibility for food stamps is primarily based on households financial status monthly gross income typically must be below 130 of the inflationindexed federal poverty income guideline for the households size eg 1107 for 1person household and 1861 for 3 persons in fy2008 and liquid assets must be under 2000 3000 for those households with elderly and disabled members however some households can be categorically eligible if they participate in or receive services under another incometested program like temporary assistance for needy families tanf or the supplemental security income ssi program and certain categories are barred irrespective of their financial need such as many noncitizens ablebodied adults without dependents abawds not meeting work test program costs are shared with the states which administer the program under generally uniform federal rules the federal government pays the full cost of benefits and about half the cost of administration operating work or training programs for recipients and statedirected nutrition education and outreach activities states and in some cases localities pay the remainder some 27 billion in fy2006 the level of food stamp spending varies with pa rticipation which is closely linked to economic conditions and eligibility rules and benefit levels benefits are indexed to foodcost inflation and adjusted for recipients income household size and certain nonfood expenses like high shelter costs child care spending in addition basic unindexed minimum amount the standard deduction typically 134 month for each household is disregarded when calculating households ability to contribute to its food needs the basic theory underpinning food stamp benefits is that they should provide the difference between what recipient household can afford for food out of its own monthly cash income assumed to be about 30 of counted income and the estimated minimal cost of an adequate diet the monthly cost of the usdas thrifty food plan for its size since the 2002 farm bill participation has increased substantially from some 19 million persons per month in fy2002 to 272 million october 2007 and the average monthly continued reported multiple indications of food access problems but typi cally reported few if any indications of reduced food intake those classified as having very low food security 39 reported multiple indications of reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns due to

expanded eligibility for noncitizens most notably allowing eligibility for noncitizen children and those who meet fiveyear legal residence requirement raised benefits modestly for larger households by counting less of their income and allowed states to provide transitional food stamps for families leaving the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program in addition the 2002 bill set up number of state options to ease access to the program and administrative burdens on applicants and recipients and program operators eg allowing states to reduce recipient reporting requirements simplify benefit calculations conform some food stamp rules to those used in the tanf and medicaid programs and revamped the quality control system to reduce the number of states subject to financial sanctions and grant bonus payments to states demonstrating exemplary administrative performance 13 virtually program cuts were made even small changes to eligibility or benefit rules in program as large as food stamps can bring on relatively large budget costs or savings and as with the 2002 farm bill the ability to revise the food stamp program depends heavily on budget constraints at the time the farm bill is considered major issues that emerged in the house and senate consideration of the farm bill and the administrations farm bill package related to eligibility for food stamps including the treatment of household assets the use of food stamp benefits benefit levels state administration and program access details of congressional action on these issues are covered at the end of this

tightening current rules governing the eligibility of noncitizens have been raised as potential changes to food stamp rules although major legislation to further restrict noncitizens eligibility was introduced in the 109th congress the house of the bill implementing spending reductions to comply with the fy2006 budget reconciliation measure would have further limited eligibility for noncitizens on the other hand several bills called for ending existing limits on legally resident noncitizens the farm bill did not address the issue of noncitizens eligibility for food stamps states may make households participating in their tanf programs categorically eligible automatically eligible for food stamps and most states make use of this option the administration contends that states have taken advantage of this rule and made those with financial resources above normal food stamp standards eligible simply by providing some minimal tanflinked services and to protect prog ram integrity it proposed to limit categorical eligibility to those tanf recipients getting cash aid which presumably is subject to financial tests similar to or more stringent than food stamps on the other hand opponents of this view noted that many of the estimated 300000 persons affected are receiving services eg child care transportation assistance for work that help them keep working that they still must have their benefit calculated under normal food stamp rules and can only qualify for benefit if they have high living expenses eg shelter costs that limiting categorical eligibility would impose added administrative burdens on states and applicants and that as sideeffect number of children would lose eligibility for free school meals 14 legislation concerning categorical eligibility was introduced and the farm bill did not address this issue but it is important to remember that limiting categorical eligibility is one of very few proposals that put forward that would produce significant cost savings opponents of the current restrictions on participation by ablebodied adults without children abawds which bar eligibility after three months unless the individual meets workrelated test contend that they should either be abolished as too punitive and administratively complex or greatly eased these restrictions were put in place as part of the 1996 welfare reform law and in many cases they can be and are waived by states although the senate farm bill would have eased them the enacted law did not finally the administration proposed 1 new rules that would disqualify food stamp recipients who exchange food purchased with their benefits for cash or misuse benefits to obtain container deposits and bar from food stamps those who have been disqualified from the food distribution program on indian reservations the fdpir and 2 making permanent rule disregarding combat pay when considering the eligibility of and benefit amounts for military households the enacted farm bill

policy disregards savings for education as assets only if determination is made that they are inaccessible the administration and others supported disregarding all taxrecognized retirement savings or plans and education savings to avoid penalizing those who save for retirement or education but are temporarily in need the food stamp programs dollar asset limits have not been significantly changed in over 25 years program advocates argued that they should be raised or possibly abolished to encourage saving and simplify administration in addition to the administrations farm bill package number of bills dealing with loosening asset rules have been introduced the enacted farm bill loosens asset rules along the line discussed above g23g156g142g561g152g143g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g156g561 food stamp benefits can be used for virtually any food purchase they cannot be used for alcohol tobacco hot prepared food or dietary supplements food choice has been recurring theme in food stamp policy debates critics argue that nutritionrelated limits should be placed on the types of food that can be bought with food stamps on the other hand others contend that incentives to purchase healthy foods should be built into the food stamp program and that support for nutrition education should be increased and expanded to cover broader range of initiatives separately some have proposed to allow food stamps to be used for dietary supplements as in the senate version of the 2002 farm bill the senate version of the 2007 farm bill included provisions that opened up the possibility that food stamp benefits could be used to purchase dietary supplements and included provisions for projects to encourage the use of food stamp benefits for healthful foods the enacted farm bill does not include changes with regard to dietary supplements but does authorize efforts to support the purchase of healthful foods g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g561g14g142g159g142g149g156g561 major contention of critics of the current structure of the food stamp program has been that the value of food stamp benefits has been significantly eroded since the 1996 welfare reform law that is benefits are significantly smaller than they would have been without the changes made in 199615 although basic maximum food stamp benefits are indexed annually they point out that rising nonfood living costs are heavily affecting recipients budgets limiting their ability to supplement their food stamp benefits as the program expects and that one of the programs major methods for taking these costs into account when calculating benefits uniform income disregard called the standard deduction has been effectively frozen at 134 month since 1996 they also note that the 1996 law imposed an acrosstheboard 3 benefit cut program advocates and number of bills aim to address this by increasing and indexing the standard deduction raising maximum benefits by 3 or both opponents of this type of action are concerned about the substantial costs involved and argue that the food stamp program should not be expected to be general purpose income support program responding to all of the needs of the lowincome population the enacted farm bill addresses this issue with boost to the standard deduction separately the administration and several bills proposed to remove the current dollar limits on the degree to which dependent care expenses are considered when calculating benefits thus 15 fuller discussion can be found in report families food stamp benefits purchase less food each year from the center on budget

food stamps medicaid and the tanf program 16 food stamp law requires that final eligibility and benefit decisions be made by government employees and that contracts for computerrelated services with federal matching money be federally approved however these state initiatives can involve privatizing contracting out or outsourcing many backoffice and other more important administrative tasks and modernizing and streamlining administration through efforts like performing program intake by computer application and establishing call centers using privatesector employees resulting in cost savings from fewer state staff and offices and it is hoped better client service there are few federal standards for these types of initiatives eg with respect to c lient service pilot testing what roles private company employees can play how extensive displacement of government employees can be many of those watching the current initiatives have argued that standards should be set legislatively to give the federal government the ability to more effectively oversee the progress in this area or that limits should be placed on states ability to delegate administrative responsibilities to nonstate employees and entities they point out that modernization and streamlining steps can potentially leave some vulnerable groups without real access to food stamp help needlessly complicate the application and benefit process blur lines of accountability result in incorrect information for or treatment of applicants and recipients and end many state jobs however number of states are concerned that legislatively set privatization standardslimits will severely restrict innovation in administering food stamps and other public assistance programs and reduce or eliminate cost savings that might result on the other hand the administration has been concerned about widespread benefit overpayments that can occur in changeover to new administrative systems and would like to hold states not recipients responsible in cases of widespread systemic errors the enacted farm bill includes number of provisions for oversight of state changes in their systems for administering food stamps but does not have provisions substantially limiting privatization initiatives the food stamp programs quality control system for overseeing state administration also is under some scrutiny the administration proposed two important changes 1 impose financial penalties on states with high rates of error in denying food stamp benefits and 2 end an option for states to invest amounts owed as financial penalties for high rates of error in overissuing or underissuing benefits in administrative improvements as an alternative to paying part of their 16 floridas project is effectively fully

advocates have argued that further steps need to be taken in their view procedural rules governing how applicants and recipients are treated eg reporting requirements as well as those relating to eligibility for applicants participating in other public assistance programs could be further loosened to ease access to food stamp benefits for example added federal administrative costsharing for accessoriented state administrative changes eg longer office hours grants for accessimproving efforts loosened reporting requirements and changes in application procedures could be legislated moreover advocates have been concerned about any access restrictions that might result from the initiatives to privatize modernize or streamline administration noted above in addition to issues surrounding

recommendations for changes in the food stamp program as part of the 2007 farm bill they were not introduced as legislative package and only few have been adopted in the enacted 2008 farm bill eligibility the administration proposed to restrict categorical automatic eligibility for food stamps to households who receive cash temporary assistance for needy families tanf benefits those receiving only tanffunded services would not be automatically eligible on the premise that cash benefit recipients are subject to stricter eligibility tests this revision accounted for the bulk of savings attributed to its proposals for nutrition program changes the administration was especially concerned that states can in effect game the categorical eligibility option and make households with financial resources well above normal food stamp limits eligible for food stamps by simply providing minimal services financed with tanf funds on the other hand critics pointed out that the services being provided often are key to supporting households work efforts eg child care that there would be added administrative costs to carry out full eligibility determinations for those who chose to apply through regular procedures and that some households losing their categorical food stamp eligibility would as result lose their foodstampparticipationbased automatic 17 more extensive discussion

are to reinforce federal policy encouraging savings for these ends and avoid penalizing those in temporary need who have put aside money for retirement or education however some critics argued that asset eligibility rules should be loosened even further than recommended by the administration for example by raising or indexing the dollar limit on allowable assets or by standardizing the application of more liberal rules on how to count the value of households vehicles the enacted farm bill adopts the administrations recommendations and raises dollar limits on allowable assets benefit

restrictions that do not take into account workand educationrelated dependent care costs above 200 month for each child under age 2 and 175 month for all other dependents however some critics argued that food stamps should not be viewed as child care program while others maintained that there is need to go further in recognizing the effect high nonfood living expenses have in eroding the value of food stamps the enacted farm bill incorporates the administrations recommendation state administration the administration advanced four revisions to rules governing state administration of food stamps it would assess states quality control financial penalty if the state has negative action error rate above the national average for two consecutive years negative action error rates measure the extent to which states improperly deny suspend or terminate food stamp applicants and recipients 18 secondly it proposed to eliminate an option permitting states to invest in administrative improvements as

would like for example more authority to impose fines in lieu of disqualification for minor violations and new authority to fine retailers in addition to disqualification for major violations it also advanced proposal to allow the department of agriculture to immediately suspend redemption of retailers food stamp receipts where expedited action is warranted in certain egregious trafficking cases these retailer participation recommendations are covered in the enacted farm bill other proposals the administrations farm bill package would have renamed the food stamp program the food and nutrition program in recognition of the changes in how food stamp benefits are delivered ie through electronic benefit transfer systems and the programs role in improving nutrition 19 it also would have established pilot project under which states would be allowed to pay with 50 federal matching for state support for some workrelated expenses incurred by working food stamp recipients and it proposed

nutrition assistance program that works much like the regular food stamp program including delivery of benefits through ebt cards 21 the major feature distinguishing puerto ricos program from the regular food stamp program other than more restrictive financial eligibility tests and lower maximum benefit levels is that just 75 of households benefit must be used for food purchases as opposed to 100 in the regular food stamp program puerto rico was converted to its nutrition assistance block grant in 1982 as quid pro quo it was given total flexibility in how its program is designed since 1994 american samoa has received an annual nutrition assistance grant 61 million in fy2006 it has designed program that serves lowincome elderly and disabled persons some 3000 persons in fy2005 this grant

puerto rico and american samoa and specifically authorized american samoas grant as part of the food stamp act legislative issues related to these programs have been focused on puerto ricos nutrition assistance grant and the fdpir puerto rico advocates argued that funding for assistance in puerto rico lags behind need bills in the house and senate would increase puerto ricos nutrition assistance grant and then index it for both foodcost inflation and population growth require study of the feasibility and effects of treating puerto rico as state under the regular food stamp program or both opponents are concerned over the costs associated with expansion of the grant and the prospect of having potentially over half the commonwealths population receiving aid there were administration proposals other than extending existing law with regard to puerto rico the enacted farm bill extends puerto ricos current indexed grant and directs study of the effects and feasibility of treating puerto rico as state for food stamp purposes significant questions have been raised over the level of federal support for fdpir costs for administration and distribution of commodities on indian reservations and the degree to which funding for the fdpir limits the types and quality of the foods provided the administration 22 authorized under section 4b of the food stamp act 7 usc 2013b 23

in 19811982 as temporary expedient designed at least initially to dispose of huge stocks of governmentheld food commoditi it also occurred in the aftermath of noticeable reductions in the coverage of and benefits provided by food assistance programs like food stamps and school meal programs legislated in 19811982 and in the midst of an economic recession and concern over hunger and homelessness among the needy in 1983 the emergency food assistance act gave the program official status and authorized funding for administrative and distribution costs in the early years through fy1988 the only significant federal expenditures involved were appropriations for administrative and distribution costs the commodities were socalled bonus commodities those acquired for farmsupport reasons and held in excess of what was needed to fulfill other federal commitments eg to school meal programs the establishment of tefap helped reduce federal commodity stocks and storage costs associated with them provided an alternative source of food assistance for the needy and was instrumental in supporting and expanding network of emergency food aid providers that also drew food and other resources from many nongovernmental sources in 1988 after the administration indicated plans to phase out the program because of the lack of bonus commodity inventories congress began the practice of mandating funding for tefap commodities thereby creating minimum entitlement to certain level of commodity assistance this entitlement component was ensconced in permanent law by the 1996 welfare reform act pl 104193 which guaranteed the program 100 million year additional bonus commodities continued to be made availablediffering each year according to usda acquisitions this guarantee was increased to 140 million year in the 2002 farm bill under tefap the federal government provides food commodities to states this assistance supplements other sources of food aid for needy persons and often is provided in concert with food bank and homeless shelter projects either as food packages or meals eligibility decisions for tefap assistance are made by states and they choose local administering agencies

bills before congress would greatly expand the federal commitment to making more fruits and vegetables available through federally supported nutrition programs number of bills would boost funding for the fresh fruit and vegetable program so that it could operate in all states although not all schools some of the same bills would up the minimum required spending on fruits and vegetables from section 32 funds to at least 400 million year and increase the setaside for the dod fresh program most of these purchases would go to schools the administration proposed to provide new money 50 million year for the purchase of fruits and vegetables specifically for the school lunch program above acquisitions under any other authority it also supported increasing purchases of fruits and vegetables using section 32 money by an escalating amount starting at 200 million year and totaling 275 billion over 10 years other initiatives include new funding for fruit and vegetable promotion program pilot projects offering financial incentives for food stamp recipients to purchase fruits and vegetables grants to facilitate the procurement and transportation of highly perishable healthy foods for lowincome persons proposal to require the agriculture department to establish its own program for acquiring fruits and vegetables for schools and allowing schools to divert significant portion of their federal commodity allowance to purchase fruits and vegetables through the departments program and grants to communitybased organizations and other local agencies to promote greater

changes to law noted below most of the amendments in the house bill did not directly affect nutrition program costs however number of important provisions did and the required new funding generally from tax law changes was provided in the bill the congressional budget office estimate of the cost of the provisions of the nutrition title using its march 2007 baseline assumptions projected that they would add some 42 billion in federal spending budget authority and outlays over the next five years the life of the farm bill 36 six provisions of title iv accounted for virtually all of its cost in the first five years increasing food stamp benefits by raising the standard deduction disregard of income 52 boosting food stamp benefits by eliminating limits on income disregards tied to dependent care expenses 6 raising minimum food stamp benefits 6 increasing food stamp dollar limits on allowable liquid assets and disregarding retirement savingsplans and education savings as countable assets when judging food stamp eligibility 15 increasing mandatory spending on tefap commodities 14 and expanding support for the fresh fruit and vegetable program in schools 7 as can be seen the large majority of new spending generated in the house bill was tied to changes in food stamp lawthat is 33 billion over the next five years over the next ten years changes made by the house bill were expected to cost total of 115 billion using march 2007 baseline assumptions because its revisions were made part of permanent law unlike the senates measure 35 for longer discussion of

for oneperson household the minimum benefit 10 month for one and twoperson households would be initially lifted to an estimated 16 month this change represented some 6 of the new spending in the

testtheir total income before disregards deductions must be below 130 of the federal poverty income guidelinesand net income testtheir income after disregards deductions must be below the poverty guidelines themselves in the overwhelming majority of situations meeting the gross in come test is the more important requirement but boosting or establishing an income disregard also decreases households net income and can make their income eligibility more likely elderly or disabled households are subject only to net income test 38 current limits are 200 month for children under age 2 and

srept 110220 as amended on the senate floor as passed the senate bills nutrition title title iv incorporated the significant changes to law noted below as with the house bill most of its amendments did not directly affect nutrition program costs but number of important provis ions did and the required offsetting funding from savings in other agriculture programs and titles in the billwas provided estimates from the congressional budget office using its march 2007 baseline assumptions placed the overall fiveyear cost new budget authority at 54 billion or 53 billion in new outlays 44 changes to the food stamp program and tefap and expansion of the fresh fruit and vegetable program in schools accounted for 97 of the new spending in the senate bill food stamp amendments alone represented 66 of the new spending 35 billion the four most expensive of these revisions were an increase in the standard deduction disregard of income loosened asset eligibility rules higher minimum monthly benefit and removal of dollar limits on income disregards tied to dependent care expenses new tefap spending accounted for 10 of the added spending 550 million and additional money for the fruit and vegetable program represented 21 11 billion as can be seen in major difference from the house bill the senates version placed substantially more emphasis on support for the fresh fruit and vegetable program both in absolute dollar terms and as proportion of total spending under the nutrition title 43 current provisions have not been implemented instead the hunger fellowship program continues to receive nnual appropriations 25 million in fy2006 and proposed for fy2008 from congress without any specific legislative guidance as to their use 44 this represents 28 increase over the

measure was expected to cost only 56 billion over the next ten years as opposed to the houses 115 billion because most of its major revisions were terminated after fy2012 not made permanent for

dependent or child care expenses by removing the dollar limits on the degree to which these expenses are taken into account ie disregarded in calculating household income 46 this change was the same as in the house bill and accounted for about 4 of the new spending expected under the nutrition title increased minimum benefits for recipient households near the income eligibility limits by calculating minimum benefits as 10 of the indexed maximum monthly benefit for oneperson household the minimum benefit 10 month for one and twoperson households would initially rise to an estimated 16 month this revision was the same as in the house bill represented some 4 of the new spending under the nutrition title placed into permanent law rule now in annual appropriations laws that disregards combatrelated pay for families with military members when calculating benefits and to limited degree income eligibility 47 this amendment was the same as in the house bill 45 note income disregard

the cbo estimate of the total new spending expected from title iv initiatives varies according to which baseline ie costs with changes in law assumptions are used and the time period over which costs are projected spending figures also differ depending on whether offsetting reductions are taken into account under pre2008 law the programs covered by title iv were anticipated to cost in outlays approximately 186 billion over fy2008fy2012 the 5year life of the 2008 farm bill and almost 400 billion over the 10year span from fy2008 to fy2017 using the cbo march 2007 baseline projecting from the cbo march 2008 baseline title iv programs were expected to cost about 206 billion over fy2008fy2012 and just over 430 billion over fy2008fy2017 taken as percentage increase over these baseline amounts title iv provisions are expected to add between 1 and 2 in new spending outlays over 5 years and just over 2 over 10 years see below using the march 2007 cbo baselinethis baseline was employed by congress in making decisions as to the provisions to be included in title iv and estimates using it are those most often cited in describing the effects of the farm billthe cbo estimates project total net title iv costs outlays at 2897 billion over fy2008fy2012 and 9218 billion over fy2008fy2017 on the other hand if the march 2008 baseline is used total net title iv costs increase to 311 billion over fy2008fy2012 and 966 billion ov er fy2008fy2017 these net cost estimates under both baseline assumptions do not include new spending for the fresh fruit and vegetable program see below that are effectively offset with money from permanent section 32 52 appropriations provided through an amendment section 14222 in title xiv of the new law that is 274 million fy2008fy2012 and 102 billion fy2008fy2017 six provisions of the enacted law account for virtually all of the cost of the provisions of title iv 1 increasing food stamp benefits by raising the standard deduction disregard of income 2 boosting food stamp benefits by eliminating limits on income disregards tied to dependent care expenses 3 raising minimum food stamp benefits 4 increasing food stamp dollar limits on allowable liquid assets and disregarding retirement savingsplans and education savings as countable assets when judging food stamp eligibility 5 increasing mandatory spending on tefap commodities and 6 expanding support for the fresh fruit and vegetable program in schools the large majority of new spending generated by the changes incorporated in title iv is tied to changes in food stamp law the
