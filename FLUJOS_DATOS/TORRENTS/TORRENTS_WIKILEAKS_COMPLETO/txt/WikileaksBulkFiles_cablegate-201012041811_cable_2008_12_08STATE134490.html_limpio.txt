please deliver the following letter from deputy secretary negroponte there will be signed original embassy should also propose discussions with the government of armenia in coming weeks suggested dates and team composition will be provided septel embassy yerevan is requested to report response 2 secretrel armenia begin letter dear mr president we value our positive relationship with your government as we explore range of shared interests especially an agreement on nagorno karabakh and normalization of armenias relations with turkey at the same time we are dismayed by serious and indeed deadly arms reexport case secretary rice assistant secretary fried deputy assistant secretary bryza and ambassador yovanovitch have raised with you our deep concerns about armenias transfer of arms to iran which resulted in the death and injury of us soldiers in iraq notwithstanding the close relationship between our countries neither the administration nor the us congress can overlook this case by law the transfer of these weapons requires us to consider whether there is basis for the imposition of us sanctions if sanctions are imposed penalties could include the cutoff of us assistance and certain export restrictions to avoid such sanctions it is essential that you present compelling evidence that your government is now in partnership with us to ensure such transfers do not occur in the future to convince the united states that this will not happen again we seek written agreement from armenia memorializing its intent to implement measures that will prevent armenia from becoming source of weapons for iran or other states or groups involved with terrorism andor weapons proliferation such measures include reform the armenian export control commission so its members are full time employees who exclusively work on export controls establish at each point of entry into armenia armenian teams dedicated to detecting and interdicting dualuse commodities and other contraband periodically accept unannounced visits by us experts to assess the work of the teams harmonize armenias export control legislation with that of the eu update and make public armenian export control lists incorporating the control lists of the wassenaar arrangement missile technology control regime and other international control regimes ensure that armenianbased brokers do not facilitate arms related transfers and consult with the united states on transfers to countries that are not member states of nato or the eu or participating states of the wassenaar arrangement we are prepared to send team as early as possible in the new year to discuss this proposal further it is my hope that we can work together to forge positive outcome which provides your government the opportunity to strengthen armenias export controls and for my government to assist you in this effort sincerely john d negroponte end text of letter 3 s background in 2003 armenia facilitated irans purchase of rockets and machine guns in 2007 some of these weapons were recovered from two shia militant attacks in which united states soldier was killed and six others were injured in iraq the secretary discussed our concerns with president sargsian on the margins of the general assembly but he denied any transfer occurred the direct role of highlevel armenian officials and the link of the weapons to an attack on us forces make this case unique and highly troubling these transfers may provide basis for sanctions pursuant to us legal authorities we propose series of steps that armenia will need to take to prevent future transfers which will be weighed in the consideration of sanctions we hope to use the threat of sanctions as tool to generate armenian responsiveness so that we will not be forced to impose sanctions measures 4 s the deputy secretary is writing to president sargsian and indicating that team will be sent to armenia to seek written agreement that armenia will take steps to ensure that it does not become source of weapons for iran or other states or groups of concern the team will also present additional information that will make clear why the united states is convinced that the transfers happened and make it unreasonable for sargsian to continue his denials we anticipate that the team will travel to yerevan in the coming weeks to provide sufficient time for the incoming administration to be briefed on the situation 5 s objective our objective is to prevent armenia from becoming source of weapons for iran or other states or groups of concern without derailing possible nagornokarabakh settlement embassy yerevan should seek to convey the seriousness with which the united states views this issue and emphasize that the transfer of arms to iran and subsequently to terrorists in iraq in particular transfers that resulted in the death of an american serviceman cannot be overlooked by the united states 6 u please contact eurpra matt hardiman and isncatr margaret mitchell with any questions or followup issues related to this case and slug any reporting on this issue for isn and eur rice
