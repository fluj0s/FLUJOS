classified by ministercounselor for political affairs kirk augustine reasons 14 bd 1 c summary adding fuel to already intense speculation about who will succeed him president putin confirmed to state media may 13 that he will endorse candidate before the march 2008 election both kremlinconnected and independent analysts believe putins choice will be driven by desire to ensure his physical and financial security to maximize the likelihood of continuity in his policies and to preserve the current political system in which he is the final arbiter of disputes among rival groups role he likely intends to play even after leaving office our contacts generally think putin will consult about possible successors with his closest advisers but make the final decision alone without involving elites outside the kremlin or relying heavily on public opinion surveys as former president boris yeltsin did the conventional wisdom remains that first deputy prime minister dmitriy medvedev and deputy prime ministerdefense minister sergey ivanov are the two frontrunners but other horses of varying shades of darkness are believed to be at least potentially in the running putins interest lies in prolonging uncertainty to avoid premature slippage of power away from him and toward perceived successor but that uncertainty encourages competitive jockeying for position among the candidates and feedingfrenzy among those who fear their snouts could soon be torn from the trough end summary helping russia by helping himself 2 c most of our contacts take for granted that putins own physical and financial security and social status post2008 loom large in his succession calculations xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that financial considerations would drive putins thinking xxxxxxxxxxxx agreed describing the russian presidency as business and saying that putins decision on successor would be based on his sense of who would best be able to protect the wealth he and his associates had acquired equally important to putin according to xxxxxxxxxxxx is preserving the elitebased political system in which ad hoc interest groups vie for political clout and control over economic resources with putin as the ultimate arbiter xxxxxxxxxxxx said putin feared the system would collapse without him at its center and therefore intended to remain active behind the scenes while leaving daytoday governance to his successor xxxxxxxxxxxx agreed saying that preserving the current balance of power among competing elite groups was of great importance to putin 3 c xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that putin needs to choose strong successor who is not beholden to any one group and who has already amassed personal fortune during putins tenure such figure xxxxxxxxxxxx explained would have vested interest in maintaining the status quo in order to protect his own wealth and standing xxxxxxxxxxxx disagreed arguing that strong successor would inevitably side with one group or another and succumb to the temptation to crush his rivals such turn of events would not only disrupt the precarious balance of clans and lead to redistribution of assets but also undermine putins role as arbiter of the competing groups xxxxxxxxxxxx offered another perspective saying that succession candidates strength or weakness would be of only secondary interest to putin the overriding criterion would be loyalty to putin personally putin listening but will decide alone 4 c many of our contacts believe that having weakened all his potential rivals and atomized the elite putin will be able to make the choice of his successor alone without needing to consult extensively with political and economic elites to ensure their support xxxxxxxxxxxx expects putin to discuss the issue informally with his closest advisers but to reveal his final decision to them only shortly before going public in order to maintain strict secrecy the broader elite and the general public would learn of putins decision simultaneously xxxxxxxxxxxx concurred saying putin would consult only handful of close advisers including medvedev sergey ivanov and deputy pa head igor sechin xxxxxxxxxxxx expected that on questions of succession sechins opinion would carry more weight than medvedevs or ivanovs because putin would consider that as possible successors the latter two could not give disinterested advice 5 c asked whether putin by not consulting more broadly would not risk alienating those whose financial resources and media outlets would be central to ensuring smooth succession xxxxxxxxxxxx predicted that the elites on hearing the name of putins preferred successor would fight each other to be first to pledge allegiance to his choice if elite opinion mattered to putin xxxxxxxxxxxx added pointedly former yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovskiy would still be free instead xxxxxxxxxxxx said putin was confident elites have learned from the khodorkovskiy case the severe consequences of defying the kremlin xxxxxxxxxxxx agreed saying that despite real divisions within the elite there remains profound corporate interest in maintaining the existing contours of political and economic power and that can best be done by falling in line behind putins choice whoever it may be 6 c given how extensively former president yeltsins team used public opinion polls to identify an electable successor many have assumed putin would do the same xxxxxxxxxxxx however told us the kremlin would not poll to determine what qualities the public wants to see in russias next president since the results would be meaningless respondents in such poll would simply describe putin when asked what their ideal president would be like reversing the pattern from 1999 when respondents listed as desirable qualities those that the deeply unpopular yeltsin lacked xxxxxxxxxxxx also argued that the kremlins control over major media outlets would not be sufficient in itself to build mass following for presidential candidate the key to winning public support would be to find way to resonate with the public as putin did when he gave an emotional speech in september 1999 in response to series of apartment bombings that had terrorized the population until that point xxxxxxxxxxxx said even daily television coverage had only modestly improved putins popularity rating 7 c xxxxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxxx disagreed arguing that the kremlin has sufficient administrative and media resources to ensure that the public votes correctly in 2008 taking different tack xxxxxxxxxxxx told us public opinion could be an important variable if the electorate were actively engaged but he did not expect it to be mobilized for this election voters like the elites would primarily be interested xxxxxxxxxxxx thought in maintaining the higher standard of living they have attained under putin and would see putins chosen successor as the best available insurance policy five who are thought to be alive 8 c upwards of thirty names have appeared in the russian press as possible successors to putin but xxxxxxxxxxxx told us she believes putin has now narrowed the field to five first deputy prime minister dmitriy medvedev deputy prime ministerdefense minister sergey ivanov presidential administration pa head sergey sobyanin russian railways ceo vladimir yakunin and head of the government apparatus sergey naryshkin nearly all analysts see medvedev and ivanov as the clear frontrunners at this stage and most of our contacts describe sobyanin yakunin and naryshkin as at best reserve candidates xxxxxxxxxxxx dismissed the theory that putin was using medvedev and ivanov as red herrings to distract attention from the real as yet unidentified successor saying that putin is serious about making medvedev or ivanov russias next president xxxxxxxxxxxx concurred noting that putin has nothing to gain by choosing lessfamiliar figure to succeed him those seeing the succession as twohorse race are divided as to whether putin will endorse medvedev or ivanov with xxxxxxxxxxxx positing powersharing scenario in which one would serve as president and the other as prime minister medvedev 9 c medvedevs longstanding loyalty to putin his administrative skills his propensity for hard work and his potential to benefit if the national projects that he supervises are successful are among his qualifications for the presidency xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that medvedev would respect putins wishes and work to maintain the existing balance among rival elite groups which would make his selection acceptable to all key power elements xxxxxxxxxxxx also said medvedevs administrative skills were widely underestimated citing his kremlin contacts xxxxxxxxxxxx said the pa had run more efficiently under medvedev than now under sobyanin xxxxxxxxxxxx who said medvedev was his own choice for president described him as dedicated hardworking and skilled in management note in addition to his duties as first deputy prime minister medvedev directs the implementation of the national projects is chairman of the board of gazprom is responsible for coordinating russias response to avian flu and since midmay has chaired government commission on bringing digital television to russia end note 10 c medvedev nonetheless has challenges to overcome xxxxxxxxxxxx told us medvedev does not come across as presidential on television or in public although she noted that he has nearly two years to strengthen his image the camp of pa deputy head igor sechin which is still trying to convince putin to remain in office beyond 2008 poses another challenge to medvedev xxxxxxxxxxxx said sechins camp is trying to discredit both medvedev and ivanov in order to convince putin to seek third term according to xxxxxxxxxxxx medvedev lost recent battle when fradkov who is allied with sechin was given control of the customs service which had previously been subordinated to medvedevs frequent ally minister of economic development and trade german gref sergey ivanov 11 c ivanov has putins trust is widely regarded as patriot and pragmatist comes across as presidential and has proven politically resilient in the face of recurrent criticism including from within the military establishment xxxxxxxxxxxx said ivanov is regarded as more effective administrator and bureaucratic player than medvedev xxxxxxxxxxxx said ivanov had demonstrated his ability to weather political attacks over the last year as his popularity rating had not been affected by the sechin camps efforts to tarnish his image by exploiting cases of military hazing using the main military prosecutor to highlight the high rate of crime in the armed forces and publicizing the fact that ivanovs had run over and killed an elderly pedestrian xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that putins may 10 address to the legislature gave ivanov boost by highlighting improvements in military capability innovation and morale 12 c our contacts note that putin and others could perceive some of ivanovs strengths as weaknesses for instance while many say that ivanov is not corrupt at least in relative terms some of putins close advisers reportedly see that as threat since they do not know how to do business with such person xxxxxxxxxxxx said putin may also see ivanovs leadership skills as potential threat to the balance of forces among elites and potentially to putins own continued influence yakunin 13 c putin probably considers vladimir yakunins longstanding friendship and business experience his best qualifications for the presidency according to our contacts yakunin shares putins kgb background and they first met in the 1990s in st petersburg yakunin has thus far generally avoided the public spotlight and according to close supporter hopes medvedev and ivanov will fall short of putins expectations in the runup to 2008 ref our contacts generally consider yakunin fallback candidate who would probably remain loyal to putin after taking office but could have difficulty forging ties with the political and economic elites and the general public xxxxxxxxxxxx said yakunin was too exotic and strange to become president citing yakunins close and secretive relationship with the hierarchy of the russian orthodox church his reported ties to fidel castro and lyndon larouche and his involvement in organizations like the center for the national glory of russia xxxxxxxxxxxx agreed saying yakunin was generally seen as an outsider in the elite notwithstanding his ties to putin sobyanin 14 c sobyanin is thought by some to be potential successor because of his loyalty to putin and apparent lack of ambition he recently visited london at putins direction providing the beginnings of an international profile in xxxxxxxxxxxxs view putin could feel confidentthat sobyanin if elected would continue to defer to him xxxxxxxxxxxx said sobyanins lack of ambition was one reasonputin had felt comfortable bringing him into the pa note the basis for the judgment by xxxxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxxx that sobyanin lacks ambition rather than has veiled ambition is not clear end note among sobyanins liabilities according to xxxxxxxxxxxx was that he i onedimensional and comfortable only when dealing with regional affairs xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that sobyanin lacks public platform that would help him build support among voters and despite good reputation as governor of tyumen he was proving an ineffective manager in the pa xxxxxxxxxxxx told us sobyanin had been charged with overseeing the drafting of the annual state of the nation address that putin had presented may 10 but putin had been so dissatisfied with the early drafts that he took over the speechwriting process himself others have painted sobyanins role in the production of the speech in more positive terms xxxxxxxxxxxx thought putin would not be comfortable making sobyanin president given their relatively brief connection naryshkin 15 c sergey naryshkins name has recently begun surfacing with greater frequency in the media and in conversations with our contacts ref b but he continues to be regarded as at best longshot for president xxxxxxxxxxxx said naryshkin who worked with putin in the kgb is junior partner to fradkov who has used him to attack gref and minister of finance aleksey kudrin xxxxxxxxxxxx said naryshkin dutifully follows instructions from putin and fradkov in the hope of becoming putins successor or at least to be minister of economic development and trade in the next presidents administration xxxxxxxxxxxx described naryshkin as an interesting figure and cautioned against underestimating his chances xxxxxxxxxxxx agreed saying that naryshkin is capable detailoriented official whose loyalty to putin is undisputed comment 16 c xxxxxxxxxxxxs list of five live candidates is not in our judgment definitive given putins tendency to make surprise personnel decisions and the unforeseeable political issues that could arise before march 2008 other potential successors may emerge moreover although we believe putin does plan to leave office in 2008 that is at most present intention if as 2008 approaches he is not persuaded of the viability of any of the succession candidates particularly if it appears that russia will face difficult domestic or international circumstances putin could still decide to remain in power and would likely have little trouble in arranging to do so xxxxxxxxxxx told us thirdterm scenario was still on the table in the kremlin although only as fallback option 17 c our expectation however remains that putin will step out of the presidency in 2008 we concur that in choosing the person he wants to succeed him he will be motivated to protect his wealth and security eg from prosecution and to ensure his continuing political influence and social status after leaving office we believe he will also reject any succession candidate who he suspects might steer russia away from his policy legacy those factors suggest he will choose successor in whom he has high degree of personal and political trust and who he sees as at least competent as an administrator and politician we share the judgment that he has relatively free hand in his choice with the political class and broader public ready at least initially to defer to his judgment within broad limits 18 c views differ on how involved putin plans to be in daytoday governance after 2008 unlike yeltsin in 2000 putin will leave office at relatively young age in good health and with very high public support if he wants highly operational behindthescenes role that could incline him to opt for successor whom he saw as easy to control if he envisions on the other hand standback post2008 role in which he would engage only on strategic issues deng xiaoping model that our counterparts in the chinese embassy claim to find germane that could be reflected in choice of more dynamic and capable successor expected to act with substantial autonomy obviously the degree to which any successor having won popular election and received at least the externalities of power would long be content to administer daytoday affairs while allowing putin to direct the real course of policy from behind the scenes is open to question 19 c we also agree that last falls appointments of medvedev and sergey ivanov to the government put them in frontrunner positions while some xxxxxxxxxxxx argue that medvedev is likely to get the nod for the presidency with sergey ivanov as his prime minister we do not see compelling evidence for that conclusion an at least equally strong argument we believe could be made in favor of sergey ivanov as president and medvedev as prime minister given putins demonstrated trust in ivanov and the likelihood that in world seen to be full of external challenges to russia silovik with experience in the kgbfsb as head of the security council and as defense minister and manager of the moscow 00005740 005 of 005 militaryindustrial complex would be seen as best prepared and most credible as head of state 20 c putins present interest lies in leaving such issues unresolved to prevent the initiation of shift of power away from him and towards any perceived successor the uncertainty that is beneficial to him however feeds competition among possible or at least selfperceived candidates jockeying for position and encourages feedingfrenzy among those currently in high positions who fear their snouts could soon be torn from the trough burns
