later near the capital skopje the nla was thought to have ties to the kosovo liberation army kla and rebel albanian forces operating in southern serbia in march the macedonian government began counterinsurgency campaign it opened talks on political reforms with elected ethnic albanian representatives but refused to negotiate with the rebels themselves clashes between the rebels and

auspices between the republic and greece which has opposed its northern neighbors use of the name macedonia for the sake of simplicity the former yugoslav republic of macedonia fyrom shall herein be referred to as macedonia macedonia1 country background and recent conflict introduction for nearly decade the former yugoslav republic of macedonia managed to escape the kind of brutal ethnic conflict in croatia bosnia and kosovo that accompanied the breakup of the former yugoslavia in the 1990s the international community gave high priority to preventing the spread of ethnic conflict to macedonia since it was feared that war in macedonia could quickly involve some or all of macedonias neighboring countries and lead to broader balkan war macedonia was held up as model albeit an imperfect one of interethnic coexistence and democratic rule with active participation of the albanian community in political institutions despite persistent discord in interethnic relations the swift emergence in early 2001 of militant ethnic albanian guerrilla movement in western macedonia therefore caught many observers by surprise by march 2001 violent conflict between the rebels and macedonian security forces had spread to several areas around the city of tetovo prompting the macedonian government to embark on major military campaign to quell the insurgency in western macedonia with strong international backing the government opened allparty talks on interethnic issues in april national unity government comprised of all major political parties was created in may clashes between rebel and government forces continued in some areas of the country as marathon talks among all coalition parties on political reforms remained deadlocked negotiations finally reached agreement on key reform issues in early august the political parties signed framework agreement on august 13 paving the way for the deployment of small nato force to begin disarming the rebel forces operation essential harvest comprising 4500 european forces began collecting rebel weapons on august 27 and completed its mission within month much smaller task force has remained in macedonia to provide security for international civilian monitors overseeing the process of implementing interethnic reforms implementation of the framework agreement has progressed slowly but has moved forward in recent months several factors may have accounted for the emergence in early 2001 of the rebel insurgency in macedonia one may have been the increasing radicalism of disparate ethnic albanian militant groups operating in kosovo serbia and macedonia andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30900crs2 2un resolution 1244 which provides for an interim international protectorate for kosovo calls for the province to achieve autonomy within the federal republic of yugoslavia for additional information see crs report rl31053 kosov and us policy updated regularly 3prior to this century macedonia had comprised much larger geographic area after the balkan wars of 19121913 macedonia was partitioned among bulgaria greece and serbia the serbian part became the yugoslav republic of macedonialinked to organized crime and regional smuggling rings the unresolved status of kosovo and limited progress in realizing kosovar selfgovernment since the end of the kosovar war in mid1999 may have fueled ethnic albanian radicalism2 in addition the international embrace of the postmilosevic yugoslav and serbian leadership after the fall of milosevic in late 2000 may have discouraged some ethnic albanians hopes for kosovar independence to which the international community has not agreed some ethnic albanian rebels in macedonia as well as in serbia may have sought to provoke heavyhanded response by the serb or macedonian forces in order to elicit western sympathy and support another contributing factor to the macedonian conflict was the continued activism of members of the kosovo liberation army kla who were supposed to have disbanded and given up their weapons to the natoled kosovo force kfor after the end of the 1999 conflict in kosovo instead many former kla members regrouped in the demilitarized buffer zone around kosovo and transferred arms and personne l to macedonia border agreement between macedonia and the federal republic of yugoslavia fry in february 2001 intended to tighten border controls may have also triggered clashes between macedonian border police and ethnic albanian smugglers finally underlying interethnic tensions and poor economic conditions especially among ethnic albanians in macedonia provided fertile ground for drawnout conflict political background macedonia is one of six former republics of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia3 under yugoslav leader josip broz tito macedonians were granted the status of constituent nation language and culture equal to that of the other yugoslav republics following the example of slovenia croatia and
