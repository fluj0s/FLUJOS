revolving fund srf as di scussed later the rescission would have taken away nearly all of the increase that congress provided for this purpose reducing the appropriation close to what th administration requested in february in addition to proposed reductions for so ongoing programs the presidents fy2006 budget did not include funding signated by congress in fy2005 for individual projects locations or institu tions often referred to as earmarked funding within epas appropriations acc ounts this is consistent with past administrations budget requests acco rding to omb the presidents fy2006 budget did not include 489 million appropr iated in fy 2005 for unrequested projects4 more than half of these appropria ted funds were for water infrastructure projects in the fy2006 appropriation c ongress restored earmarked funding for many of these projects and designated ne w earmarked funding for others as well although the presidents budget proposed decreases for some programs relative to fy2005 it included steady or increased funding for other activities such as cleanup of superfund sites cleanup and re development of brownfields homeland security and several grant pr ograms for scientific research on human health effects the administration submitted subsequent request on october 28 2005 that would have increased overall funds available to epa by 15 million through reallocation of emergency spending for disaster relief in gulf coast states affected by hurricanes katrina and rita of whic h congress reallocated 8 million to epa in the fy2006

states and local school districts seeking grants to retrofit or replace older polluting diesel buses from its initial grant solicitation epa received more than 120 proposals from school districts state nd local agencies and nonprofit organizations these proposals sought total of 60 million in grants which significantly exceeded appropriations of 5 million each year in fy2003 and fy200424 in response to the amount of funding sought by grant pplicants epa requested 65 million for the program in fy2005 to expand its support of diesel retrofit projects to reduce particulate matter and for outreach efforts to raise awareness of the health risks posed to school children from diesel emi ssions as noted above congress provided significantly less than this amount fo r fy2005 and the

administration had requested but provided less than congress appr opriated the previous fiscal year as in past years the largest portion of epas appropriation for fy2006 was allocated to the state and tribal assistance grants stag account the adequacy of funding for this account was among the most prominent issues of congressional debate the administrations request to significantly reduce funding for the clean water state revolving fund srf within the stag account from 109 billion in fy2005 to 730 million in fy2006 was particularly contentious prior to the two above rescissions pl 10954

relative to the request was made available by reducing funding for other activities within epas appropr iation in passing its version of the fy2006 interior bill the house had proposed 850 million fo r the clean water srf including 100 million rescinded from prior year appropriations amendments during the house debate to increase fy2006 funding for th clean water srf closer to the fy2005 level were not adopted th senate had proposed 11 billi on in passing its version of the interior bill which was s lightly above the fy2005 appropriation the extent to which congress shoul d designate or earmark funds for individual projects locations or institutions continued to be an issue pl 10954 provided less funding than congress appropriated in fy 2005 for projects identified in the conference report as congressional pr iorities earmarks within the science and technology environmen tal programs and management and state and tribal assistance grants accounts congress has traditionally awarded funding for thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32856crs29 types of projects noncompetitively the house appropriations committee had proposed different approach for the ear marking of funds in the science and technology and environmental programs and management accounts recommending epa award them competitively among past recipients of earmarked funds this approach was not adopted in the final bill the adequacy of funding for the superfund program to clean up hazardous waste sites also continued to be pr ominent issue in the debate over epas appropriation pl 10954 pr ovided more funding for the superfund program than congress appropriated for fy2005 during the debate some members questioned whether the increase was sufficient they along with states environmental organizations and others argued that hi gher funding is necessary to adequately address the risks to human health and th environment from hazardous waste sites other members and the adminis tration asserted that the proposed funding would be sufficient to meet cleanup needs in addition to the adequacy of fundi ng for superfund cleanup activities the source of funds continued to be point of contention in congress as the balance of the superfund trust fund has been expe nded the program is now supported with general treasury revenues leading some members of congress to advocate the reinstatement of the taxes on industry that once supported th trust fund the administration and other members assert th at individual polluters continue to pay for site cleanups and that tax on industr as whole is therefore not needed several bills were introduced in the first session of the 109th congress to reinstate superfund taxes but did not receive furt her action pl 10954 continued the use of general treasury revenues to s upport the superfund program in fy2006 epas use and consideration of inte ntional human dosing studies whether conducted by epa or others for determining associated human health risks of pesticides were of interest to members during the appropriations debate of particular interest we re concerns about the adequacy of health safety standards for human research subjects and general ethical questions with respect to epas use of data from such studies pl 10954 incl uded provisions directing epa to complete relevant rulemaking according to specific congressional recommendations and banned the use of fy2006 funds to consider or to conduct human dosing studies in the agencys review of pesticides until final rule is issued throughout the debate there were varying levels of interest in specific funding for other epa activities as well the ability to increase funding for projects or add new projects in fy2006 ultimately was affected by compe ting priorities of congress to allocate limited funding to numerous federal agencies within the interior appropriations bill where epas funding now falls epas funding was moved from the jurisdiction of the house and senate appropriations subcommittee on veterans affairs housing and urba n development vahud and independent agencies to that of the interior subcommittees begi nning with the fy2006 appropriation this was the result of reorganization during the first session of 109th congress that included the elimination of the vahud nd independent agencies appropriations subcommittee
