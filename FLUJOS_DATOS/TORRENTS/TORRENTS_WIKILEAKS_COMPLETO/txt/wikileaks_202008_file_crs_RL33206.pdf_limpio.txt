united states that their incapacity would harm the nations physical security economic security or public health critical infrastru cture is often geographically concentrated so it may be distinctly vulnerable to events like natural disasters epidemics and certain kinds of terrorist attacks disr uption of concentrated infrastructure could have greatly dispropor tionate effects with costs pot entially running into billions of dollars and spreading far beyond the imme diate area of distur bance hurricane katrina in 2005 and hurricane ivan in 2008 have demonstrated this kind of geographic vulnerability by disrupting much of the us energy and chemical sectors congress has been examining federal policies related to the geographic concentration and vulnerability of critical infrastructure in the 109th congress the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 fac ilitated the constructi on of new liquefied natural gas import terminals in diverse ports provisions in the pipeline safety improvement act of 2006 pl 109468 require studies to identify geographic areas in the united states where unplanned loss of oil pipeline faci lities may cause oil shortages or price disruptions the 110th congress is considering additional policies which may affect critical infrastructure c oncentration prominent among these are legislative proposals such as hr 6566 hr 6709 s 3202 and s 3126 which would lift federal moratorium s on or otherwise encourage offshore oil and natural gas development outside the western gulf of mexico geographic concentrations of us critical infrastructure typically have developed through some co mbination of market infl uences including resource location agglomeration economies scale economies community preferences and capital efficiency congress and federal agen cies also have adopt ed policies affecting the capacity and location of critical infrastructure including prescriptive siting economic incentives environmental regu lation and economic regulation some federal policies ve been developed specifically to address perceived threats to critical infrastructure these influences often have been in place for decades gradually driving critical infrastructure to its geographic configuration today some analysts may argue that little g overnment intervention is necessary to alleviate geographic vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure because the private sector will adjust its practices out of its own financial interest however if congress concludes that federal intervention is needed it may employ number of policy options to encourage geographic dispersion including eliminating policies that encourage concentration ensure survivability or ensure that effective infrastructure recovery capabilities are in place to mitigate impacts of concentrated infrastructure disruption addressing geographic vulnerabil ities may call for combination of options congress may also consider whet her other legislative proposals with the potential to affect critical infrastructure velopment directly or indirectly are likely to relieve or exacerbate geographic vulnerability the economic efficiency of public critical infrastructure nd the efficient use of fede ral funds for infrastructure development may also be important considerationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33206contents introduction 1 scope and limitations 2 g g r p h i c i n f r s t r u c t

critical infrastructure is so vital to the united states that its incapacity would harm the nations physical security economic security or public health the federal government has key role in helping protect the nations critical infrastructure from all types of hazards thr ough programs of mitigation pr eparedness response and recovery accordingly congress has strong interest in the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to natural hazards accident s or terrorism since september 11 2001 legislators government agencies and indus try increasingly have been focused on the sources of infrastructure vulnerability and potential measures to address those vulnerabilities through operational changes and capital investment when infrastructure is physically concentrated in limited geographic area it may be particularly vulnerable to geogra phic hazards such as natural disasters epidemics and certain kinds of terrorist attacks whereas typical geographic disruption is often expected to affect in frastructure in proportion to the size of an affected region disruption of concentr ated infrastructure could have greatly disproportionate nd national effects catas trophic ice storm in metropolitan chicago for example would undoubtedly cr eate local emergencies but could also temporarily disrupt rail tr ansportation and associated commerce throughout the country because chicago is major railw ay hub extended closure of the port of long beach the largest port in the nati on would greatly harm californias economy but could also disrupt vital supply chai ns for number of national industries1 the social and economic impacts of geographic disasters are often difficult to quantify but their costs can quickly run into the b illions and can spread far beyond the area of the event itself in 2005 hurricanes katrina and rita demonstrated this kind of geographic impact by disrupting substantia l part of the national us energy and chemical sectors both heavily concentr ated in the gulf of mexico in 2008 hurricanes gustav and ike have caused s imilar disruptions rene wing concerns about geographic vulnerability as the nations responses to recent na tural disasters continue and as its homeland security activities evolve congress has been examining federal policies related to the geographic concentration and vulnerability of critical infrastructure for example in the 109th congress the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33206crs2 2 for further discussions see crs report rl33404 offshore oil and ga s development legal framework by adam

the construction of new liquefied natural gas import terminals in diverse ports by granting the federal energy regulatory commission exclusive siting approval authority section 311 provisions in the pipelin safety improvement act of 2006 pl 109468 require periodic studies to identify geographic areas in the united states where unplanned loss of oil pipeline facilities may cause oil shortages or price disruptions sec 8a the 110th congress is overseeing implementation of these measures and considering additional policies which may affect critical infrastructure concentration prominent among these are legislative proposals such as hr 6566 hr 6709 s 3202 and s 3126 which would lift fe deral moratoriums on or otherwise encourage offshore oil and natural gas deve lopment outside the western gulf of mexico2 this report provides an overview of geographic concentration and related vulnerab ility among critical infrastructures in the united states the report illustrates the nature of such geographic concentr ation and how it may expose infrastructures to catastrophic failure due to geographic zards it identifies several longterm forces which have contributed to infrastru cture concentration these forces include resource location agglomeration ec onomies scale economies community preferences and capital efficiency it reviews several ways in which the federal government has also influenced critical infrastructure such as prescriptive siting economic incentives environmental regula tion and economic regu lation the report concludes with options to address geographic vulnerability in the context of current federal infrastructure policy scope and limitations this report focuses on nationally criti cal infrastructure and related federal policies while many of the infrastructure and policy issues addressed in this report may also apply at the state and local leve ls the report discusses them only in the context of federal activities this report also discusses number of specific geographic hazards to critical infrastructure in the context of broader federal policy discussion the report does not attempt to quantify the likelihood of any particular hazard occurring in any particular loca tion or the degree of vulnerability of any particular infrastructure centration to geographic hazards such projections are available elsewhere3 and are beyond the

is critical infrastructure twenty years ago infrastructure was defined primarily with respect to the adequacy of the nations public works in the mid1990s however the growing threat of international terrorism led policy makers to reconsider the definition of infrastructure in the context of homela nd security successive federal government reports laws and executive orders have refined and generally expanded the number of infrastructure sectors and the types of assets considered to be critical for purposes of homeland security th usa patriot act of 2001 pl 10756 section 1016e contains the fe deral governments most recent definition of critical infrastructure according to the act critical infrastructure is systems and assets whether physical or virtual so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have debilitating impact on security national economic security national public health or safety or any combination of those matters

httpwwwaarorgpubcommondocumentsabouttheindustryrrstate_rankingspdfwhat is geographic concentration this report defines geographic concentra tion of critical infrastructure as the physical location of critical assets in suffi cient proximity to each other that they are vulnerable to disruption by the same or successive regional events to be of national significance the collection of concentrated assets may account for significant fraction of the nations total infrastructure capacity in given sector or subsector alternatively the collecti on of regional assets could make up an infrastructure hub accounting for nationally significant fraction of commodity or service flows through that infrastructure sector or subsector the threshold above which such assets could be considered nationally c oncentrated would depend upon the type of impact resulting from prolong ed disruption from strictly market perspective for example some policy makers have suggested that change in energy infrastructure capacity of as little as 10 to 15 could have an exaggerated effect on related market prices6 the corporate merger guidelines used by the united states canada and the european union variously assume that company must have 25 to 35 market share to exercise market power and so uncompetitively influence market prices or supplies7 although the loss of critical infrastructure would have effects beyond market price other po ssible metrics of c oncentration eg environmental offer little additional clarity on concentration thresholds many of the critical infrastructure sectors identified in the nipp exhibit some degree of geographic concentration as illustrated by the following examples chemicals chlorine over 38 of us chlorine production is located in coastal louisiana8

may be distinctly vulnerable to range of geographic hazard s including natural or unnatural events these events could have varying potentia l for infrastructure disruption depending upon the type of event its location and th infrastructure sectors present in that location what such events have in comm on is their geographic scale among the geographic events posing the greatest hazard to us critical infrastructure concentrations are the following meteorological events major meteorological events such as hurricanes tropical storms floods and ice storms have the potential to physically disrupt critical infrastructures or displace related critical workers in large geographic areas for example the damaging effects of hurricanes katrina and rita and associated flooding on energy and chemicals infrastruct ure in the gulf of mexico have been widely reported in 1998 major ice stor m in quebec canada and the northeastern united states caused widespread persis tent power and communications blackouts disrupted other powerdependent servi ces and prevented critical workers from traveling to their jobs18 earthquakes and tsunamis earthquakes have th potential to damage concentrations of critical infrastructure in seismically active regions of the united states including the west coast alaska and the central mississippi valley the 1994 earthquake in northridge ca is an example of such seismic activity in region with concentrated critical infrastru cture the northridge earthquake had limited impact on the regions major ports airports and energy infrastructure but it did cause significant damage to bridges and highways vital for commercial trucking and public transportation19 1995 earthquake in kobe japan was far more destructive to japanese critical infrastruct ure in addition to highway damage the earthquake heavily damaged the port of k obe japans largest container shipping port as well as chemical manufacturers steel manufacturers railroads

southern california could close the ports of long beach and angeles for two months and cause 60 billion in economic losses23 infectious disease epidemics and pandemics of infectious diseases such as severe acute respirator syndrome sars and avian influenza bird flu have the potential to disrupt critical infrastructure by infecting critical workers or restricting their movement the bush administrations national strategy for pandemic influenza states that while pandemic will not damage power lines banks or computer networks it will ultimate ly threaten all critical infrastructure by removing essential pe rsonnel from the workplace for weeks or months24 n outbreak of infectious disease may sicken critical workers or force them into quarantine it may also re strict their access to critical facilities where the disease may be present as one federal governme nt report states during such an event operations become disrupted exposed people and facilitie s undergo extensive testing and buildings and equi pment require decontamination25 the 2003 sars outbreak in toronto dem onstrated the vulnerability of critical health and transportation infrast ructure in canada to such an infectious disease the world health organization the us depar tment of health and human services and other health organizations have since expr essed concern about the likelihood of bird flu pandemic with more serious pot ential consequences than sars26 in the event of bird flu or similar outbreak in particular geography some analysts have predicted up to 40 absenteeism among work ers during the

how ever such events occur often enough to warrant dedicated policy attention as table 1 shows reviewing only the past 15 years major disasters have occurred in north america almost annually not all of these events have impacted regions of centrated critical infrastructure nor have they all significantly affected such infrastructure where it has been present nonetheless the cost estimates for

infrastructures is driven by the location of related na tural resources or in some cases natural terrain such influences are particularly apparent in ergy agriculture and transportation united states oil and natural gas basins for example are located in particular regions of the country including the gulf of mexico the rockies and appalachia these locations are generally far from northeastern urban centers which are the primary locations of oil and gas demand consequently rge oil and gas pipelines tend to be concentrated between these widely separa ted resource regions and the northeast as shown in figure 1 likewise production of phos phoric acid key component of agricultural fertilizer is concentrated in florida which has the nations largest deposits of phosphoric rock32 agricultural production is also driven by geography since particular crops requi re particular climates w eather conditions and types of soil terrain may also be driver of infrastructure concentration there are relatively few natural harbors suitable as deepwater ports in the western united states compared to the eastern part of the country consequently the ports that exist such as long beach have become very heavily utilized in these cases and others the concentration of natural resource drives the concentration of infrastructure exploiting that resource source energy information administration

availability of specialized knowledge the availability of skilled workers access to production inputs and access to large markets for the g oods and services produced34 the concentration of semiconduc

skilled graduates from leading research universities eg uc berkeley stanford university and with access to both produc t suppliers computer manufacturers eg apple computer and software companie s agglomeration economies have also been demonstrated in food manufacturing and may similarly influence other critical infrastructure sectors such as financia l services chemicals manufacturing and telecommunications35 scale economies critical infrastructure may become geographically concentrated in pursuit of scale economies scale economies are found in industries where unit costs fall as the scale of operations increases this phenomenon was first studied in pipeline i ndustries when it was observed that the amount of material required to make pipe of given diameter increased only twothirds as quickly as the carrying capacity of the pipe this observation led to larger pipes having lower unit costs36 in addition to pipelines researchers have identified scale economies across many critical infrastructure sectors37 the size of new chemical plants for example increased by factor of five between th late 1950s and early 1980s in part due to scale economies38 some analysts likewise suggest that the concentration of shipping container traffic among several us mega ports is partly due to economies of scale in warehousing and rminal operations39 because scale economies tend to drive an increase in size of individual facilities they may also geographically concentratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33206crs12 40 for further discussion of lng siting see crs report rl32205

are facing stiff community opposition in some cases state nd local agencies also have been at odds with federal agencies over lng terminal siting jurisdicti on communities in only few states notably louisiana and texas have encouraged the siting of new lng facilities as result most new lng terminals approved by federal agencies are located in the gulf of mexico where natural gas infrastructure is already heavily concentrated40 similar siting preferences have faced other types of critical infrastructure and industries including electric power tel ecommunications and transportation41 capital efficiency capital efficiency seeks to maximize financial returns on capital investment since most us critical infrastructure is in the private sector capital efficiency has long influenced how and where private companies have invested in infrastructure capacity42 attention to capital efficiency sharply increased in the 1990s however as financial markets grew dissatisfied with other measures of company performance such as simple revenue growth43 this attention in turn led range of capitalintensive infrastructure companies such as electric utilities telecommunications providers pipelines and other industria l companies to sharply reduce annual capital requirement s from historical levels44 economic deregulation of the energy telecommunications and tr ansportation industries among others

in capital equipment or reducing inventories of production s upplies justintime invent ory for example power generation capacity margins for the us electric utility industry as whole fell by almost 40 between 1992 and 200045 there has been similar reduction in excess capacity among other critical infrastructures many of which now operate near or at capacity oil refineries for example have seen capacity utilization rise from below 77 in 1985 to 89 in 200546 while such reduction in reserve capacity has not itself led to geographic infrastructure concentration it has greatly increased the sensitivity of infrastructures to the disruption of concentrated capacity federal policies and infrastructure concentration although market forces have been the primary influence on critical infrastructure development especially in the private sector congress and federal agencies historically have from time to time adopted policies inte nded to affect the capacity and location of critical infrastructur in the national interest although these policies often have been motivated by the desire to promote specific social objectives eg economic development environmental protection infrastructure reliability they have sometimes also encouraged or discouraged the geographic concentration of critical infrastructures examples of these policies follow prescriptive siting the federal government has prescriptively sited constructed and operated federally owned or ope rated critical infrastructure such infrastructure includes transportation facilities military bases posta l facilities federal energy facilities and national laboratories in some cases such prescriptive siting has led to geographic concentration of critical infrastructure for example the federal government sited and constructed the panama canal in the early 1900s encouraging concentration of military and commercial shipping through the new waterway which persists today the canal carried over third of us grain exports in 200647 in the pacific northwest dams constructed or operated by federal agen cies on the columbia river system account for 28 of us hydroelectric generation capacity48 in other

dispersed critical infrastructur in the early 1940s for example the federal governme nt financed and sited majo r steel plant in utah far from existing us steel plants and steel markets key reason for siting the plant viewed as critical for shipbuilding during world war ii in utah was as precaution against steel shortages in the west in case of pacific coast invasion or closure of the panama canal49 more current example is the us postal service which routes more than 13 of all mail through any single processing and distribution center50 although the federal government prescrip tively sites its own infrastructure it is difficult to find examples of federal prescriptive siting of private sector infrastructure one way the government s done so however is through its control of federal lands and other federal assets necessary fo r infrastructure development for example the transalaska pipelin authorization act of 1973 pl 93153 directed the secretary of the interior to authorize rightofway for construction of the transalaska pipelines system taps through federal lands in alaska the construction of taps phy sically diversified us oil supplies although it initiated new geographic concentration of critical in frastructure in alaska taps transports nearly 17 of united states domestic oil production51 more recently the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 directs federal agencies to designate energy corridors on federal lands in 11 western states for the siting of new oil gas and hydrogen pipelines and electricity tran smission facilities sec tion 368 while both the taps and energy corridor projects involve privately owned facilities the location of those facilities is established prescriptively by the federal government economic incentives economic incentives are another policy mechanism employed by the federal government to direct private sector infrastructure siting such incentives are intended to encourage private developers to build infrastructure that might otherwise not be built or to build infrastructure in location favored by government while most federal incentive programs are not geogra phically targeted some are intended to affect infrastructure developm ent in particular geogra phic areas the construction of the transcontinental railroad and telegraph is an historic example of such policy under the pacific railway act of 1862 th congress provided private companies with 30year bonds federal nd grants and other incentives to construct rail and telegraph line along specified route from nebraska to the pacific coast the federal government continues to offer such financial incentives for critical infrastructure projects today for example in 2004 congress passed the alaska natural gas pipeline act pl 108324 div c

assets environmental regulation federal environmental laws such as the coastal zone manage ment act and the clean air act also have influenced the geographic development of critical infrastructure the coastal zone mana gement act of 1972 czma pl 92583 was enacted to enable states to establish coordinated coastal zone management programs balancing environmental protection with coastal development state coastal management plans implemented under the czma may affect the geographic concentration of infrastructure by encourag ing or discouraging the siting of coastal infrastructure research has shown for exampl that one third of states with coastal management plans under czma appear to have adopted po licies seeking to confine the physical expansion of ports to ar eas already committed to port and industrial uses52 energy industry representatives ve argued that state plans under czma have also been used to block the devel opment of new energy infrastructure in many parts of the country53 the clean air act of 1970 caa pl 91604 created national program to mitigate the harmful effects of air pollution by regulating pollution sources among other provisions the caa requires that new facilities emitting certain air pollutants install best available cont rol technology as determined by the environmental protection agency new facilitie s being sited in counties not in attainment of federal air quality standards may have more stringent and potentially more costly emissions control requirements than facilities sited in coun ties that are in attainment of those standards depending upon state determination of the lowest emission rate available and the need to acquire emissions offsets by affecting facility costs in this way some analysts argue that the caa encourages the concentration of infrastructure in geographic pollution have ns or alternatively encourages the dispersion of facilities away from existing infrastructure in polluted regions one empirical study in new york for example suggests that air quality regulations have significantly affected the destination choices of relocating manufacturing plants54 because facility siting decisions are complex however other empirical studies of caa effects on siting concentration specifically have been less conclusive55httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33206crs16 56 for further discussion see crs report rl33493

czma and caa apply generally to many regions in the united states some federal environmental policies have been directed at more specific geographic areas congressional moratoria on oil and natural gas development in specific parts of the outer continental shelf due to concerns about local economic and envir onmental impacts are one example of such federal policy56 energy industry analysts have argued that the moratoria have resulted in oil and gas infrastructure concentration in the central and western gulf of mexico where such development is permitted this example notwithstanding the federal government does not appear to impose regionalle vel as opposed to facility level environmental re strictions frequently57 economic regulation economic regulation of critical infrastructure or the lack thereof by the federal government may also influence infrastruct ure concentration under federal price regulation the us airlines industry offere d primarily direct poi nttopoint service after economic deregulation in 1978 the air lines began offering far more indirect flights routing air traffic through c oncentrated hub airports largely unanticipated consequence of intercarrier competition58 federal deregulation of banking led to consolidation of the banking sector with everlarger banks concentrating critical operations in centralized administration facilities to capture economies of scale59 limited federal regulation does not necessarily lead to infrastructure concentration however especially if state or local agencies have regulatory authority under the federal power act of 1935 fpa for example retail electricity sales and generation investments of investorowned electric utilities are regulated by the states state regulators have historically required utilities to meet state electric generation needs by constructing instate plants or by jointly constructing plants with neighboring utilities consequently privatel yowned electric power plants have been geographically dispersed among the 50 states the largest shares of us generating capacity in individual states are 10 in texas and 6 in california60 by contrast the federally owned tenness ee

plans would have created nati onally significant conc entration of nuclear generating capacity within tvas territory it is interesting to note that the recent restructuring of the electri c utility i ndustry wh ich exempts new generation plants from state economic regulation appears to be encouraging the geographic concentration of new generating plants near certain transmission corridors because plant developers are longer constrained by state regulators in their site selection policy options to reduce infrastructure vulnerability since helping to reduce the overall vulnerability of critical infrastructure is an objective of the federal government it is useful to outline what options if any may be considered to reduce vulnerabilities and potential national consequences arising specifically from the geographic concentration of such infrastructure some analysts may argue that little government intervention in infrastructure concentration is necessary because the pr ivate sector will appropriately adjust its infrastructure practices out of its own fi nancial interest ca tastrophic insurance premiums for example or internal co rporate risk management programs may influence corporate practices in way that reduces vulnerabilities and associated risk to future profits by reducing the geographic vulnerability of private infrastructure as the national strategy for the physical pr otection of critical infrastructures and key assets states customarily private sector firms prudently engage in risk management planning and invest in security as necessary function of business operations and customer confidence consequently private sector owners and operators should reassess and adjust their planning assurance and investment programs to better accommodate the increased risk62 holders of such view would assert that the socially optimal geographic distribution of critical infrastructure balancing economic efficiency with geographic risk is best left to the market forces outlined earlier in this report other analysts have argued that the pr ivate sector does not properly account for the full social costs of critical infrastructure failure or that individual companies cannot independently and si gnificantly influence geographic concentration in critical sector63 holders of this view would see definite and active role for the federal government in alleviating geographic vulnerability of critical infrastructure in addition to the marketdriven measures taken by the private sector on its own if congress concludes that fede ral intervention is appropr iate it has veral broad policy options for doing sohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33206crs18 64 rc mireles cure for west coast congestion logistics today january 2005eliminating policies enc ouraging concentration one way congress may alleviate geographic concentration and associated vulnerability is to eliminate existing policie s that encourage such concentration as the previous discussion has shown some fe deral policies may increase concentration prescriptively others especially certain economic and environmental policies may implicitly or unintentionally encourage ge ographic concentration without such government influence market forces ma drive developers to less geographically concentrated locations for future infrastructure projects the challenge to this approach of alleviating geographic concentr ation is that it may conflict with other objectives of federal legisl ation in the cas of the economic deregulation for example geographic concentration often pr ovides the consumer cost reductions and service improvements that deregulation was intended to achieve in the case of environmental laws concentra tion is often viewed as sirable means of preserving undisturbed natural areas from destructive development would the czma be able to fulfill its fundamental balance of environmen tal protection and economic development if states were not free to c oncentrate infrastructur where they choose to the resolution of such policy questi ons would require careful and complex reconsideration of longstanding policy objectives in light of evolving concerns about critical infrastructure risk encouraging geographic dispersion another remedy for geographic vulnerability is to encourage the geographic dispersion of concentrated assets where such dispersion is possible as discussed in this report the federal government may implement range of targeted policies including prescriptive siting economic incen tives and regulation to help bring about infrastructure dispersion such dispersi on could involve the development of new infrastructure capacity or the shifting of critical goods and services among existing infrastructure some transportation anal ysts for example have proposed shipping containers through mexican ports and then on to the united states by rail as means of reducing cargo traffic in southern californias ports64 shifting concentrations of critical supplies and services to alternative infrastructure already in place and not itself concentrated may be one way to alleviate geographical vulnerabilities relatively quickly if the alternative infrastructure lies outside the united states however such strategy may create new vulnerabilities since it might longer be under us protection or administration while encouraging infrastructure disp ersion through fede ral policy may be helpful doing so may be challenging it may be difficult for example to identify and prioritize geographic infrastructure concentrations amenable to such dispersion predicting the longterm effects of such po lices on market economics especially the effects on market competition may also be uncertain if incentives are involved dispersion policies may also be costly to the federal government potentially drawing resources away from other federal progra ms furthermore since infrastructure development is mostly in private and re gional government sta and local handshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33206crs19 65 congressional budg et office cbo federal policies for infrastructure management june 1986 p xi 66 oconner t

energy information administration annual energy outlook 2008 doeeia03832008 june 2008 p 39ensuring that regional infrastructure proj ects are consistent with federal objectives may also be problem as the c ongressional budget office has stated the federal governments most important role in infrastructure provision is as source of finance thus for infrastructur to be managed in way that furthers national objectives federal agencies must offer incentives for local managers to align their choices with the welfare and equity goals of federal programs choices for infrastructure systems that aim at such broad objectives must similarly be based on wide searches among new investments rehabilitation efforts or operational changes they must also be derived from consistent evaluations of the longterm effects of these possible choices on the efficiency of activities using the infrastructure65 infrastructure owners and regional govern ments are also likely to have vested interests in existing concentrations of critical infrastructure and may oppose dispersion on competitive or other economic grounds state and local governments may also have concerns bout federalism particular ly where federal policies affecting infrastructure dispersion may supercede local infrastructure priorities notwithstanding the challenges of prom oting infrastructure dispersion congress appears to be pursuing such policies with respect to the siting of new energy infrastructure including lng import terminals oil refineries electric transmission lines and an alaska gas pipeline even where such federal policies may be implemented successfully how ever it may still take years or decades to achieve dispersion objectives because critical infras tructure often develops slowly for example industry experts pr oject that it would take five to seven years absent community opposition to construc t new us oil refinery66 it would take at least nine years to build the alaska natural gas pipeline67 ensuring infrastructure survivability for geographic concentrations of critical infrastructure that are difficult to diversify or that may take long time to diversify congress may wish to ensure their nearterm ability to function or survivability during nd after major geographic disaster particularly where resource cation provides few ge ographic alternatives as in the case of ports reducing vulnerability through infrastructure protection may be effective such an approach would broadly align with the presidents existing strategy for protecting critical infrastructure from terrorist attack as stated in the nipp although it would incorporate explic itly geographic vulnerabilities in the context of the nipp or other emerge ncy management pr ograms geographic vulnerability could be viewed as distinctive type of infrastructure vulnerability and therefore considered in federa lly mandated risk assessmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33206crs20 68 for further discussion see crs report rl32348 selected federal homeland security assistance programs summary by shawn reese 69 see crs report rl31734 federal disaster recovery programs brief summaries by mary jordanincreasing standards for design c onstruction and ope ration and retrof itting existing infrastructure to higher standards may also enhance infrastructure survivability while there are numerous i ndustry and government building standards for protection from earthquakes hurricanes nd floods in regions where such hazards exist such standards may not account for the critical nature of certa in types of assets in particular the degree of general survivability these standards impose on critical assets may not appropriately reflect the economic and social costs that might arise should such an asset fail federal author ity to change such standards may be limited however if they fall primarily under state or local jurisdiction principal challenge to alleviating geographic infrastructure vulnerabilities is incorporating the geographic dimension appr opriately into the broader infrastructure risk management and decisionmaking pr ocess one key question is whether survivability measures in place to protect against facilityspecific event would be effective against regional event b ackup supply networks redundant control centers and other systems intended to harden infrastructure may themselves be subject to disruption from geographic zard although history does provide some guidance as to the likelihood of disruptive natural events and their potential effects quantifying such geographic vulnerabilities in way that allows comparison to broader set of vulnera bilities may be analytically comp lex predicting the likelihood of future terrorist attacks for which history provides little guidance adds considerable uncertainty attempting to allocate limited public resources for critical infrastructure survivability based on geographic considerations may also be challenging in particular it could complicate the use of quantitative riskbased formulas to distribute federal suppor t for critical infrast ructure protection68 increasing the private costs of infrastruct ure through new cons truction standards to improve survivability could also be controversial ensuring infrastructure recovery capabilities in addition to policies promoting geographic dispersion and survivability congress may consider infrastructure recovery as means of mitigating the impacts of geographic hazards on concentrated critical infrastructure the federal government through the federal emergency management agency fema and other agencies provides range of emergency aid programs for communities affected by disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes or terrorist attacks among other assistance these federal programs can provi grants loans loan guarantees food and shelter to disaster victims they may also provide longterm infrastructure assistance such as repair of public utilities to affected communities69 while the evolving objectives of federal emergency assistance programs are topic of ongoing debate in congress the programs traditionally have been intendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33206crs21 70 federal emergency management agency fed eral aid programs for louisiana disaster recovery fact sheet hq08182 september 2 2008 pm prah is the us ready for

colleagues urge bush administration to include low income home heating funds in budget press release november 21 2006to assist primarily in the recovery of an immediate disaster area70 however if natural disaster terrorist attack or other regional incident disrupts critical infrastructure it may have serious social or economic conseque nces far beyond the area where the disaster occurs the loss of concentrated natural gas supplies in the gulf of mexico after hurricanes katrina and rita for example sharply increased us energy prices and threatened to create significant shortages of fuel for home heating and electric power generation in new england71 these natural gas shortages prompted congressional calls to increas federal aid for low income households nationwide facing high natural gas bills72 in light of the farreaching impacts like these congress may wish to incorporate into existing federal infrastructure recovery plans and aid programs measures that account for the distinctive vulnerabilities of concentrated critical infrastructure measures related to the restoration or alternative provision of critical infrastructure services away from the immediate area of geographic incident may warra nt particular attention conclusions geographic concentrations of critical infrastructure exist across number infrastructure sectors although such c oncentrations often provide substantial economic and social benefits they may also be distinctly vulnerable to catastrophic geographic disruption any public polic addressing critical infrastructure concentration must try to balance these benefits and potential costs both government and industry have taken step s to try to protect critical infrastructure from natural disasters epidemics and terrorist attacks nonetheless questions remain as to whether these steps appropriately address such geographic vulnerabilities if congress concludes that more federal intervention is needed to alleviate vulnerabilities due to geographic concentr ation it may employ number of policy options to encourage geographic dispersion including eliminating policies that encourage concentration ensure survivability or ensure that effective infrastructure recovery capabilities are in place to mitigate impacts of concentrated infrastructure disruption because geographic hazards exist today and geographic dispersion would likely take decades to achieve ddressing geographic vulnerabilities may call for combination of options in addition to these issues congress may assess how geographic infrastructure vulnerability and survivability fit together in the nations overall infrastructure policies as congress evalua tes diverse proposals with th potential to affect critical infrastructure development directly or indirectly congress may consider whether such proposals are likely to relie ve or exacerbate geographic vulnerability the economic or social benef its of adding capacity eg refinery airport shippinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33206crs22 to an existing concentration of critical infrastructure or veloping additional infrastructure in new location may be out weighed by the increased geographic risk implicit in such an expansion fiscal impli cations especially related to the economic efficiency of public critical infrastructure and the efficien t use of federal funds for infrastructure
