that women as group are paid less than men in 2007 for example women with strong commitment to the work force earned about 7880 cents for every dollar earned by men as womens earnings as percentage of mens earnings have narrowed by less than 20 percentage points over the past 40plus years some members of the public policy community have argued that current antidiscrimination laws should be strengthened and that additional measures should be enacted others in contrast believe that further government intervention is unnecessary because the gender wage gap will narrow on its own as womens labor market qualifications continue to more closely resemble those of men the equal pay act epa which amends the fair labor standards act flsa prohibits covered employers from paying lower wages to female than male employees for equal work on jobs requiring equal skill effort and responsibility and performed under similar working conditions at the same location the flsa exempts some jobs eg hotel service workers from epa coverage and the epa makes exceptions for wage differentials based on merit or seniority systems systems that measure earnings by quality or quantity of production or any factor other than sex the equal work standard embodies middle ground between demanding that two jobs be either exactly alike or that they be merely comparable the test applied by the courts focuses on job similarity and whether given all the circumstances they require substantially the same skill effort and responsibility the epa may be enforced by the government or individual complainants in civil actions for wages unlawfully withheld and liquidated damages for willful violations in addition title vii of the 1964 ci vil rights act provides for the award of compensatory and punitive damages to victims of intentional wage discrimination subject to caps on the employers monetary liability the issue of pay equity has attracted substantial attention in recent congresses

the pay or wage gaphas been the subject of extensive debate and commentary congress first addressed the issue nearly four decades ago in the equal pay act of 19631 mandating an equal pay for equal work standard and again the following year in title vii of the 1964 civil rights act2 collection of compensation data and elimination of malefemale pay disparities are also integral to labor department enforcement of executive order 11246 which mandates nondiscrimination and affirmative action by federal contractors during the 1980s some members of the public policy community sought to advance the earnings of women relative to men by pressing comparable worth theory before state legislatures and in federal court litigation during the last decade of the 20 th century and the initial years of the 21st century initiatives to strengthen and expand current federal remedies available to victims of unlawful sexbased wage discrimination have been taken up in congress this report begins by showing the trend in the malefemale wage gap and by examining the explanations that have been offered for its enduring presence it next discusses the major laws directed at eliminating sexbased wage discrimination as well as relevant federal court cases the report closes with description of pay equity bills that have been introduced in recent years including bills introduced in the 111 th congress g22g145g142g561g9g142g151g141g142g155g561g25g138g144g142g561g9g138g153g561

the fact that women as group are paid less than men in 1960 half of all women employed yearround fulltime ie 5052 weeks and at least 35 hours per week earned more than 3257 and half earned less than that amount in the same year the median annual earnings of men employed yearround fulltime were 5368 almost five decades later according to us census bureau data for 2007 the median earnings of women with strong commitment to the labor force were 35102 while those of men were substantially higher 45113 it often is noted that even when comparisons are made between similar groups women still are paid less than men women with bachelors degree employed yearround fulltime earned 52859 in 2007 while similarly educated men earned an average of 77536 male high school graduates were paid 42042 on average well above the 30657 paid to female high school graduates women typically earn less than men of the same age as well the wage gap is narrowest among young adults and then it generally widens although these disparities between seemingly comparable men and women sometimes are taken as proof of sexbased wage inequities the data have not been adjusted to reflect gender differences in all characteristics that can legitimately affect relative wages eg college major or uninterrupted years of employment the size of the malefemale wage gap has shrunk at slow and uneven pace over time as shown in table 1 the pay differential narrowed steadily during the 1980s so that by the end of the decade women were being paid about 70 cents on the dollar the trend for the 1990s is less clear 1 29

columns 2 and 5 and of the bureau of labor statistics columns 3 and 6 shown in the table the ratio of femaletomale wages fluctuated erratically and sometimes in different directions during the decade the extent of improvement in the gender wage gap that occurred during the 1980s does not appear to have been sustained during the 1990s the wage gap thus far during the 2000s has narrowed further according to the census bureau series column 2 but according to the bureau of labor statistics series column 3 the gap widened in the last few years despite womens greatly increased commitment to the labor force over the past 40plus years3 the observed or unadjusted wage gap has narrowed by less than 20 percentage points or less than half percentage point per year consequently by 2007 women with strong attachment to the job market had come to earn about 7880 cents for every dollar earned by men t able 1 ratio of f emaletomale earnings year yearroun d f ulltime workersa fulltim workersb year

the existence and persistence of the gender wage gap has led to search for explanations basically two schools of thought have devel oped the human capital explanation has supply side focusthat is it looks at the personal characteristics of working women and men the sex segregationintheworkplace or discrimination ex planation has demandside focusthat is it looks at the characteristics of the jobs in which women and men typically work some researchers have tried to explain the pay gap by examining differences in the average amounts of human capital eg educational attainment accumulated by women and men other researchers have looked to jobrelated factors for an explanation of the wage gap with some particularly focusing on the relationship between sex segregation in the workplace and womens comparatively low wages in this instance segregation refers to the clustering of women and men in different occupational groups in different occupations within these groups in different jobs within these occupations and in different industries or firms performing the same jobs still others have attributed the wage gap to combination of personal characteristics eg number of hours worked per week or year and job characteristics eg extent of unionization or size of firm although adjusting womens and mens wages for human capital and jobrelated differences considerably narrows the pay gap it does not entirely eliminate it 4 those who ascribe to the human capital explanation of the gender wage disparity argue that as women increasingly become like men in terms of their participation in the workforce womens earnings will further approach those of men they thus believe that government intervention is warranted to achieve pay equity beyond current antidiscrimination measures others believe that sexbased wage discrimination is responsible for the pay gap that remains after accounting for 4 see crs report 98278 the gender wage gap and pay equity is comparable worth the next step by linda

strengthened government enforcement of antidiscrimination laws and regulations enhanced government dissemination of information about and provision of training in comparatively highpaying nontraditional jobs for women5 or employers paying female and male employees in comparable jobs the same wages in the 1980s the latter perspective led to largely unsuccessful lawsuits that brought comparable worth claims under title vii of the civil rights act these lawsuits are discussed in the next section of this report the idea motivating comparable worth is that the size of workers paycheck should be related to job content rather than to the predominant sex of employees in an occupation comparable worth proponents argue that some jobs are undervaluedthat is pay relatively low wages because they are largely held by women instead of continuing to largely rely on supplydemand conditions in the labor market to set wages and instead of waiting for further lessening of sex segregation in the workplace comparable worth advocates typically propose that job evaluation be conducted on all positions within firm so they can be compared with each other in terms of such attributes as skill effort responsibility and working conditions employers would then raise the wages of workers in all jobs or in femaledominated jobs deemed to be underpaid on the basis of the evaluation ie jobs with wages below other jobs having the same total scores on the attributes included in the evaluation would be awarded raises 6

discrimination by employers specifically permitted by the epa however are wage differentials based on seniority systems merit systems systems that measure earnings by quality or quantity of production

of antidiscrimination rules based on race color national origin religion and sex found in title vii of the civil rights act the epa and title vii provide overlapping coverage for claims of sexbased wage discrimination but differ in important substantiv procedural and remedial aspects crucial difference is that the equal work standard of the eparequiring substantial identity between compared male and female jobsdoes not limit an employers liability for intentional wage discrimination under title vii for example in miranda v b b cash grocery store inc 11 the plaintiffs inability to demonstrate that she perfor med the same work as higher paid males did not preclude title vii claim based on evidence ma employees who performed fewer duties were paid more than she or that the employer would have paid her more had she been male thus violation of the epa will generally violate title vii but the converse is not true12 additionally the remedies for violation of the two laws differ under the epa prevailing plaintiff may obtain backpay for any wages unlawfull withheld as the result of pay inequality and twice that amount in liquidated damages for willful violation by contrast the civil rights act of 1991 added to the back pay remedy authorized by title vii provision for jury trials and compensatory and punitive damages for victims of intentional sex discrimination in wage cases and otherwise13 such damages may only be recovered however in cases of intentional discrimination not in socalled disparate impact cases alleging the adverse effect of facially neutral employment practice on protected group member in addition the title vii damages remedy is limited by dollar caps which vary depending on the size of the employer 14

during the 1980s some litigants tried to substitute job equivalency for the equal work standard in the epa through socalled comparable worth title vii cases as previously mentioned whole classes of jobs are undervalued according to comparable worth theory because they traditionally have been predominately held by women because of alleged labor market bias against female dominated jobs title vii plaintiffs contended that pay discrimination claims should not be limited by the epa standard requiring that jobs be substantially equal or similar for different pay rates to be considered

that the epas equal work standard was not restriction on title vii relief for intentional sexbased discrimination in pay between dissimilar male and female jobs15 but the supreme court did not speak specifically to the title vii standard of proof for wage discrimination since in gunther the countys intention was clearly demonstrated by its failure to redress underpayment of wages to female employees revealed by its own pay evaluation study outside of such refusal to pay cases however where market surveys or pay evaluations were done the courts have been reluctant to secondguess the wage rate dictated by the local labor market for dissimilar jobs in pair of decisions the ninth circuit firmly rejected title vii liability for public employers failure to pay equal wages to male and female employees allegedly performing comparable duties that case afscme v state of washington 16 held that the state lawfully paid employees in predominantly male job classifications more than it paid employees in predominantly female classifications even though statecommissioned st udy concluded that the male and female classifications were comparable reliance on market forces of supply and demand to set compensation for dissimilar male and female jobs was not per illegal since neither law nor logic deems the free market system suspect enterprise the state may have discretion to enact comparable worth plan the court held but title vii does not obligate it to eliminate an economic inequality which it did not create17 earlier in spaulding v university of washington 18 the same court denied comparable worth claim by members of the female nursing faculty of the university of washington who alleged that they were underpaid by comparison to other faculty departments19 some more recent judicial developments in equal pay and promotional opportunities for women should also be noted on june 21 2004 federal district judge in san francisco permitted to proceed class action on behalf of more than 15 million current and former female employees of walmart retail stores nationwide in dukes et v walmart stores inc 20 the plaintiffs claim that women over the past five years have been paid less than male workers in comparable positions and that the company systematically passed over female employees when awarding promotions to management according to two studi conducted by sociologist and statistician for the plaintiffs 65 percent of walmarts hourly employees were women but women make up only 33 percent of all management positions the gender gap was even more striking when employment categories are further broken down while the vast majority of walmarts cashiers are women only small fraction are store managers the top instore management position the studies also found that women employed on fulltime hourly basis earned less per year on average than their male counterparts and the short fall was substantial for female store managers at this initial stage the district court considered only whether the evidence raised issues of law and fact common to all members of the proposed class sufficient for class action to proceed under federal law the court did not decide the merits of plaintiffs discrimination claims or any issue of walmart liability in its opinion however the court noted 15 452 us 161 1981 16 770 f 2d 1401 9th cir 1985 17 id at 1407 18 740 f

show that women working at walmart stores are paid less than men in every region that pay disparities exist in most job categories that the salary gap widens over time that women take longer to enter management positions and that the higher one looks in the organization the lower the percentage of women 21 walmart argued that any disparities were the result of decentralized decisionmaking at the regional and local level not the result of any sy stematic employer bias and that massive class action would be too large to administer the court rejected that argument however noting that title vii contains special exception for large employers moreover insulating our nations largest employers from allegations that they have engaged in pattern or practice of gender or racial discriminationsimply because they are largewould seriously undermine these imperatives 22 thus any inference of discrimination in company compensation and promotion policies was found to affect all plaintiffs in common manner and warranted the requested class certification 23 walmart appealed the district courts class action certification but the appellate court upheld the class action certification24 if as expected the case now goes to trial the female plaintiffs carry the burden of proving that the company engaged in an intentional pattern and practice of discriminating in pay and promotions the record to date suggests that this may be easy task in part due to subjectivity in the companys personnel procedures and the fact that prior to january 2003 the company apparently failed to post or document most available promotion opportunities 25 there may be limited data on how many employees male or female applied for most of these positions but if they prevail whether at trial or by settlement substantial monetary damages may be available to members of plaintiff class under title vii since the ruling in the walmart case the investme nt firm morgan stanley has reportedly agreed to pay 54

plaintiffs in the costco lawsuit28 although the company is planning to appeal the decision29 meanwhile the supreme court issued decision that may make it more difficult for employees to sue for pay discrimination under title vii in ledbetter v goodyear tire rubber co inc 30 the female plaintiff alleged that past sex discrimination had resulted in lower pay increases and that these past pay decisions continued to affect the amount of her pay throughout her employment resulting in significant pay disparity between her and her male colleagues by the end of her nearly 20year career under title vii plaintiffs are required to file suit within 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred 31 although the plaintiff argued that each paycheck she received constituted new violation of the statute and therefore reset the clock with regard to filing claim the court rejected this argument reasoning that new violation does not occur and new charging period does not commence upon the occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination 32 as result the court held that the plaintiff had not filed suit in timely manner although the decision may limit some pay discrimination claims based on title vii individuals may still sue for sex discrimination that results in pay bias under the epa which does not contain the 180day filing requirement33 g20g142g140g142g151g157g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 the issue of pay equity has garnered considerab congressional attention in recent

employers who pay different wages to men and women for equal work and would add programs for training research technical assistance and pay equity employer recognition awards the bill would also make it more difficult for employers to avoid epa liability and proposed safeguards would protect employees from retaliation for making inquiries or disclosures concerning employee wages and for filing charge or participating in any manner in epa proceedings in short while this bill adheres to current equal work standards of the epa it would reform the procedures and remedies for enforcing the law

the 111th congress hr 12 and s 182 are identical to the version of hr 1338 that was passed by the house during the 110th congress under the epa as noted prevailing plaintiffs may recover backpay in an amount equal to the total difference between wages actually received and those to which they are lawfully entitled and an additional amount equal to the backpay award as liquidated damages34 compensatory damages are not authorized and consequently awar ds do not include sums for physical or mental distress medical expenses or other costs35 as introduced in the 110th congress the paycheck fairness act would have authorized epa class actions and such compensatory and punitive damages as may be appropriate in addition the bill would have established more restrictive standards for proof by employers of an affirmative defense to epa liability based on any bona fide factor other than sex thus for pay factor to be bona fide the employer would have to have established that it was job related or furthered legitimate business purpose and that the employers purpose could not be accomplished by less discriminatory alternative means as passed by the house the requirement in hr 1338 that employers bona fide factor defense must further legitimate business purpose was replaced by requirement that such factor shall apply only if it is consistent with business necessity and is not derived from sexbased differential in compensation as noted above the version of the act under consideration in the 111 th congress hr 12s 182 is identical to the version that passed the house in the 110th congress the fair pay act hr 2019 and s 1087 in the 110th congress which has predecessors dating back to the 103rd congress would go further by proposing fundamental expansion to the scope of the epa which is presently confined to sexbased wage differentials by adding racial and ethnic minorities as protected classes under that law intentional wage discrimination against these groups is already prohibited by title vii but title vii and the epa have different standards of proof and because proof of intent to discriminate is not required by the equal pay for equal work standard of the epa 36 it may provide greater protection to minority groups than title vii in many cases the epas catchall exception affording employers broad immunity for pay differentials attributable to factors other than sex would be significantly narrowed by the fair pay act compensatory and punitive damages remedy without statutory limit would replace the present epa backpay and liquidated damages scheme based on the fair labor standards act significantly the fair pay act would also redefine the basic statutory standard of the epa by requiring employers to pay equal wages regardless of sex race or national origin to workers in equivalent jobs unlike the current law equal pay act claims based on wage disparities between dissimilar jobseg janitor and clerkwould be permitted if they are determined to be equivalent in some largely undefined manner by substituting job equivalency for the equal work standard in the epa the fair pay act arguably could revive legal issues similar to those confronted by the federal courts during the 1980s in socalled comparable worth title vii cases another aspect of epa enforcement addressed by proposed pay equity bills concerns employer recordkeeping and the conduct of technical assistance research and educational programs by federal agencies for example the fair pay act would require all covered employers to maintain 34 29 usc 21617 35 eg hybki v
