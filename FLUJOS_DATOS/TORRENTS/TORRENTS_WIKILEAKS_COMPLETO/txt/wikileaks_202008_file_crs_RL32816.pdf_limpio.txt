congress todd m masse domestic social policy division march 24 2005 abstract the purpose of this report is to outline the commonalities and potential diﬀerences between eo 13354 and pl 108458 as these conceptual diﬀerences could be meaningful in the implementation process of pl 108458 andor should the issue of intelligence reform be revisited by the 109th congress the report examines some aspects of the law related to the nctc including the relationship between the nctcs director and the director of national intelligence dni which may have implications related to policy and implementation of an eﬀective and eﬃcient nationally coordinated counterterrorism function moreover the report examines several issues that may be of interest to congress as the nctc matures and evolves including potential civil liberties implications of collocating operational elements of the traditional foreign intelligence and domestic intelligence entities of the us intelligence community while the appointment and conﬁrmation of dni may resolve some of the uncertainty regarding the nctc the nctc is only one of myriad of complex issues that will be competing for the time and attention of the recently nominated dni an issue for congress is whether to let the existing intelligence reform law speak for itself and let certain ambiguities be resolved during implementation or to intervene to address apparent ambiguities through amendments to the law now alternatively the executive branch may choose to intervene to clarify apparent ambiguities within pl 108458 or between eo 13354 and pl

terrorist attacks upon the united states recommended the establishment of national counterterrorism center nctc to serve as center for joint operational planning and joint intelligence staffed by personnel from the various agencies on august 27 2004 president george w bush signed executive order eo 13354 national counterterrorism center which established the national counterterrorism center and stipulated roles for the nctc and its leadership and reporting relationships between nctc leadership and nctc member agencies as well as with the white house in december 2004 congress passed the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108 458 like the preceding executive order among many other reform initiatives the act prescribes roles and responsibilities for the nctc and its leadership the purpose of this report is to outline the commonalities and potential differences between eo 13354 and pl 108458 as these conceptual differences could be meaningful in the implementation process of pl 108458 andor should the issue of intelligence reform be re visited by the 109th congress the report examines some aspects of the law related to the nctc including the relationship between the nctcs director and the director of national intelligence dni which may have implications related to policy and implementation of an effective and efficient nationally coordinated counterterrorism function moreover the report examines several issues that may be of interest to congress as the nctc matures and evolves including potential civil liberties implications

congress is whether to let the existing intelligence reform law speak for itself and let certain ambiguities be resolved during implementation or to intervene to address apparent ambiguities through amendments to the law now alternatively the executive branch may choose to intervene to clarify apparent ambiguities within pl 108458 or between eo 13354 and pl 108458 in any event congressional

two legal mechanisms governing the establishment of the national counterterrorism center nctc1 the nctc was initially established by executive order 13354 signed by president george w bush on august 27 2004 section 3 of eo 13354 outlined the functions of the nctc which included among others 1 serving as the primary organization within the us government for analyzing and inte grating all intelligence possessed by the us government pertaining to terrorism and counterterrorism 2 conducting strategic operational planning for counterterrorism activities 3 assigning operational responsibilities to lead agencies for counterterrorism activities and 4 serv ing as shared knowledge bank on known and suspected terrorists and international terror groups less than two months later the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 hereinafter the act became pl 108458 section 1021 of the act amends the national security act of 1947 as amended 50 usc 402 et seq to establish within the office of the director of national intelligence national counterterrorism center the primary nctc missions outlined in the act are largely consistent with those stipulated in eo 13354 however there are some differences between these two legal mechanisms that may be worthy of congressional consideration moreover within section 1021 of the act itself there are some provisions that may prove problematic if efficient and effective implementation of nationally coordinated counterterrorism function is to take place in timely manner 1 for an analysis of the debate and rationale for the establishment of the nctc see crs report rl32558 the 911 commission and national counterterrorism center issues and options for congress

related to national security is derived from article ii section 2 clause 1 of the us constitution which identifies among other powers that the president serves as the commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states3 in general the president can also issue executive orders based on congressionally delegated statutory authority the preamble to eo 13354 titled national counterterrorism center states that the presidents authority to issue the executive order flows from the authority invested in the presiden t as by the constitution and laws on the united states of america including section 103c8 of the national security act of 1947 as amended4 at the time the executive order was issued this section of the national security act stipulated that the director of central intelligence dci acting as head of the ic shall perform such other functions as the president or the national security council may direct 5 one of the issues for the 109th congress with respect to the implementation of the functions outlined for the nctc or the role and responsibilities of its director is the extent to which the executive order and intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 hereinafter act are consistent or at least not contradictory in general executive orders are interpreted as having the force of law unless they contravene existing law6 given that the nctc its roles and responsibilities and those of its director have been established in both an executive order and in statute it is reasonable for one to conclude that any differences or inconsistencies would be 2 this report is not intended to provide an authoritative lega l interpretation of the relationship between executive orders and statutes others have done that elsewhere see crs report rs20846 executive orders issuance and revocation by t j halstead see also phillip j cooper by order of the president the use and abuse of executive direct action lawrence kansas university press of kansas 2002 the case of youngstown sheet and tube v sawyer is often cited as offering an appropriate framework for determining the constitutionality of an executive order in this case the supreme court ruled that an executive order issued by president truman in 1952 directing the secretary of commerce to seize us steel mills and continue their operation in order to avert strike was unconstitutional as one of five concurring opinions justice black developed threepronged test against which to weigh the presidential power to issue executive orders the first leg of the triad concludes that the presidential power to issue an authoritative executive order was at its maximum when the president acts pursua nt to an express or implied authorization of congress the second leg of the triad stipulates that presidential authority to issue authoritative executive orders is in zone of twilight in which he and congress may have concurrent author ity or in which its distribution is uncertain in this area presidential power is likely to depend on the imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables rather than on abstract theories of law the third leg of the triad concludes that the presidents power is at its lowest ebb when the president takes measures incompatible with th expressed implied will of congressfor then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of the congress over the matter arguably the presidents decision to issue eo 13354 lies somewhere between the first and second legs of justice blacks test the majority and minority opinions may be found at youngstown sheet and tube v sawyer 343 us 579 72 s ct 863 96 l ed 1153 1952 3 presidential authority to issue executive orders can also be derived from the vesting of executive power of the us government in the president in article ii section 1 clause 1 and from article ii section 3 which states that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed 4 executive order 13354 national counterterrorism center 69 federal register 53589 sept 1 2004 5 as amended by the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 section 1011a the prior sections 102 through 104 of the national security act were replaced with new sections 102 through 104 under new section 102af7 of the national security act the newly created director of national intelligence is directed in part to perform such other functions as the president may direct section 1012 of pl 108458 established the nctc in the office of the director of national intelligen ce and

generally given that the intelligence reform legislation passed in the 108th congress is open to interpretation in some areas7 the basis for this interpretation could be either the legislative history of pl 108458 or eo 13354 as result legislative oversight and potential amendments to the act in the 109th congress are possible as means of understanding the varying conceptual underpinnings for the nctc its director and how its director relates to the established director of national intelligence it may be useful to outline the areas of commonality and difference between these two legal authorities g9g142g151g142g156g146g156g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g16g5g22g5g561 in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 two authoritative reports concluded that the lack of adequate and timely coordination and communication within the intelligence community ic was one factor contributing to the inability of the ic to detect and prevent the terrorist attacks the joint inquiry into intelligence community activities before and after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 hereinafter joint inquiry concluded in part that within the intelligence community agencies did not adequately share relevant counterterrorism information prior to september 11 this breakdown in communications was the result of number of factors including differences in agencies missions legal authorities and cultures information was not sufficiently shared not only between intelligence community agencies but also within agencies and between the intelligence and law enforcement agencies 8 while the joint inquiry did not recommend the crea tion of national counterterrorism center per it did recommend the following measures which are largely consistent in conceptual sense with the creation of the nctc 1 the development within the department of homeland security dhs of an allsource terrorism information fusion center and 2 congressional consideration of legislation modeled on the go ldwaternichols act of 1986 pl 99433 to instill the concept of jointness throughout the in telligence community with respect to the all source terrorism information fusion center the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 created within dhs an information analysis and infrastructure protection iaip directorate which has among other functions legal responsibility for the fusion of federal state and local intelligence information to identify and assess the nature and scope of terrorist threats to the homeland 9 subsequently in his state of the union address on january 28 2003 president george w bush announced the creation of new organization the terrorist threat integration center ttic designed to merge and analyze all threat information in single location while the iaip continues to exist within dhs ttic and its fusion functions have been absorbed into the newlycreated nctc directorate of intelligence 10 7 see walter pincus national intelligence director proves to be difficult

upon the united states hereinafter the commission also found among other factors11 that the lack of information sharing and coordination within the ic led to numerous missed operational opportunities12 to detect and prevent the attacks however it also expounded on the virtues of jointness with respect to operational planning unification of effort and analysis seeking unity of effort across the foreigndomestic divide and deliberate avoidance of the proliferation of intelligence fusion centers one of the commissions central recommendations was the creation of an nctc which would have responsibilities for both joint counterterrorism operational planning and joint intelligence analysis 13 the central tenets of this recommendation were incorporated into both eo 13354 and pl 108458 albeit in somewhat different forms

there is high degree of consistency between section three of eo 13354 functions of the center and the primary missions provisions of pl 108458 15 under each of these legal mechanisms the nctc is to 1 be the primary organization for analysis and integration for all intelligence possessed or acquired by the united states government pertaining to terrorism and counterterrorism 16 2 conduct strategic operational planning for counterterrorism activities integrating all instruments of national power including diplomatic financial military intelligence homeland security and law enforcement activities within and among agencies 3 assign operational responsibilities to lead departments or agencies as appropriate with the limitation that the center shall not direct the execution of operations 4 serve as shared knowledge bank on known and suspected terrorists and international terror groups as well as their goals strategies capabilities and networks of contact and support and 5 ensure that agencies have access to and receive allsource intelligence needed to execute their counterterrorism plans or perform independent alternative analysis 11 the commission outlined what it considered four broad areas of failureincluding 1 imagination 2 policy 3 capabilities and 4 management see the final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states chapter 11 pp 339360 12 see the final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states july 22 2004 pp 355356 13 as recommended by the commission the joint intelligence element of the nctc would be built on the foundation of the existing terrorist threat integration center this has occurred as the ttic has been incorporated into the nctcs directorate of intelligence the nctc currently has over 300 personnel on board either as employees or assignees from over ten different federal agencies and continues to hire addition staff see faye bowers us intelligence agencies make headway on reform christian science monitor mar 14 2005 p 2 14 quotes in this section of the report illustrate identi cal language in the executive order and the act the nctc continues to function under eo 13354 until the dni is confirmed 15 see new section 119d of the national security act of 1947 as amended by pl 108458 section 1021 16 both eo 13354 and pl 108458 exclude intelligence pertai ning exclusively or purely to domestic terrorists and domestic counterterrorism from the nctcs analytical responsibility see eo 13354 section 3a and new section 119d1 of the national security act of 1947 as amended by section 1021 of pl 108458 however the act allows the nctc to receive retain and disseminate domestic c ounterterrorism intelligence to fulfill its responsibilities see section 119ae of the national security act of 1947 as amended by section 1021 of pl 108458 this exclusion is generally interpreted to mean that the nctc will not be responsible for comprehensive threat analysis concerning terrorist groups based largely in the united states and gaging in politically motivated violence within the united states for example domestic terrorist groups such as the earth liberation front or the animal liberation front do not generally take direction from any foreign group see the threat of ecoterrorism testimony of james f jarboe domestic terrorism section counterterrorism division fbi

g346g347g350g561 it is clear that at least with respect to the baseline functions of the nctc there is general agreement between the executive and legislative branches of government however as it pertains to the roles and responsibilities of the director of the nctc who has yet to be named and reporting relationships for the director of the nctc to the dni and to the president there is less agreement between these two legal mechanisms the executive order specifies how the president prefers to implement the functions of the nctc however the act altered some of the processes and structures underlying the executive order while the explicit act will take precedence legally ambiguities in implementation may cause confusion which could undermine the intent of integrating the counterterrorism function nationally there are at least two areas in which there are inconsistencies between the executive order and the act 1 the appointment of the director of the nctc and 2 the roles and responsibilities of the director of the nctc including the reporting relationships associated with this position the appendix outlines some of the potential inconsistencies or factors which may complicate effective implementation of the nctcs mission between the executive order and the act and within the act itself which may be of congressional interest to the extent that there are inconsistencies or contradictions between these two legal mechanisms specific provisions of the act would take precedence over the executive order

this individual will be appointed by the dci w ith the approval of the president as result of pl 108458 however the position of dci as envisioned in the national security act of 1947 as amended longer exists 17 under the act the director of the nctc is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate although the nctc now has an acting director former head of the ttic john brennan it is not known at this time whether he will be asked by the president to assume the statutorily defined role of director of the nctc it is possible that the nomination of the director of the nctc may not occur unless and until the us senate confirms ambassador john negroponte the presidents nominee for dni

the executive order and the act with respect to the reporting relationships for the dire ctor of the nctc under the executive order the reporting chain of command for the director of the nctc would have the individual reporting directly to the dci who in turn would report to the president even if one changed the language in the executive orderreplacing dci with dnia substantial difference between the executive order and the act in the reporting relationships of the director of the nctc would remain under the executive order the dci would have authority direction and control over the center and 17 sections 102104 of the national security act of 1947 were deleted and repl aced with new language regarding the new position of dni unlike the former dci who held simulta neously the positions of dc i and the director of the central intelligence agency the dni is prohibited from concu rrently serving as the director of the cia or any other element of the ic see pl 108458 title i

summarized here only to highlight alternative perspectives with regard to the nctc should congress consider amending pl 108 458 it may want to examine elements within the act that may contribute to lack of clarity within the nctc and the broader ic while clarity can be byproduct of experience specific guidance may prove useful in facilitating the more rapid development of effective and efficient operations there are at least two areas within section 1021 of pl 108458 that may be worthy of additional congressional scrutiny the first concerns the bifurcated reporting relationships the act outlines for the director of the nctc through this mechan ism the director of the nctc reports directly to president with regard to the planning and progress of joint counterterrorism operations other than intelligence operations this language could be construed to mean that under the act the director of the nctc will be reporting to the president on the planning and progress of joint military counterterrorism operations role traditionally reserved to components of the department of defense dod as noted earlier the director of the nctc also reports to the dni with respect to 1 the budget and programs of the nctc 2 the activities of the nctcs directorate of intelligence and 3 the conduct of intelligence operations implemented by other elements of the ic the act then differentiates between joint counterterrorism intelligence operations and other presumably military counterterrorism operations this bifurcated structure was intentionally designed to reflect what the commission and the congress believed should be the dual missions of the nctc its first mission is to integrate and analyze all counterterrorism intelligence available to us government departments and agencies and to serve as knowledge bank on known and suspected terrorist and international terrorist groups given that this function is directly germane and limited to intelligencerelated activities the act stipulates that the directorate of intelligence report to the dni it is the second functionstrategic counterterrorism operational planningthat gave rise to the unique reporting structure that has the director of the nctc reporting directly to the president for planning and progress of joint counterterrorism operations according to senator joseph i lieberman cosponsor of the act and the ranking httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32816g22g145g142g561g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g5g152 g158g151g157g142g155g157g142g155g155g152g155g146g156 g150g561g5g142g151g157g142g155g561 g561

strategic operational planning function is an an executive branch wide planningwhich is beyond the dnis jurisdiction18 while such reporting mechanisms and processes may be necessary to achieve jointness it is not implausible to foresee potential conflicts between the dni and the director of the nctc concerning who is the presidents primary advisor with respect to joint counterterrorism operational initiatives is the role of the dni as principal adviser to the president to the national security council and the homeland security council for intelligence matters relating to national security 19 undermined by establishing separate reporting channel to the president for certain counterterrorism operations moreover given that the director of the nctc is confirmed presidential appointee question could be raised as to whether the individual will serve more of policy advisory role to implement the administrations agenda or will serve as an unbiased professional civil servant 20 some believe however that the nctc director will have greater analytical independence and objectivity because the incumbent will be confirmed by the senate21 second issue which may be of interest to appropriate congressional oversight committees is the collocation of what has traditionally been foreign and domestic intelligence operators in general national security professionals look favorably upon the concept of jointness22 at least in part as result of the positive results yielded from the goldwaternichols department of defense reorganization act of 1986 this favorable predisposition generally extends to the intelligence arena especially with respect to joint intelligence analysis projects alternative analysis red teaming and competing analysis conducted creatively and without undue duplication are all generally thought to result in better analysis however with respect to joint intelligence operations and the integration of traditionally foreign and domestic intelligence operations there seems to be less of consensus at macro level it is clear that coordination23 in intelligence operations is common good yet the legal mechanisms and regulations that underlie and guide foreign intelligence collection and domestic intelligence collection particularly as it relates to us persons24 are substantially different25 18 see congressional record december 8 2004 senate consideration of the conference report to accompany s 2845 senator lieberman continued that the thenproposed nctc directorate of strategic operational planning would conduct planning for

objectives to be achieved tasks to be performed interagency coordination of activities and the assignment of roles and responsibilities26 the executive order does not directly define strategic operational planning other than to state generally that it involves the integration of all instruments of national power as stated above under both the executive order and the act the nctc itself is expressly prohibited from executing operations it assigns roles and monitors overall counterterrorism operational progress it is explicitly stated in the executive order that each agency representative to the center unless otherwise specified by the dci shall operate under the authorities of the representatives agency that is while strategic planning may be joint if the nctc director assigns the fbi cia and depa rtment of defense certain counterterrorism operational responsibilities each agency operates under its own legal authorities while it may be implicit such similar and explicit legal authority guidance was provided in pl 108458 the fbi has physically moved substantial portion of its operational and analytical counterterrorism personnel from fbi headquarters to offsite locations in the interest of closer coordination with the rest of the ics counterterrorism entities 27 while not necessarily integrated into the nctc these individuals are now collocated with elements of the nctc as envisioned by the commission and pl 108458 this collocation could yield substantial analytical dividends particularly when information systems are integrated in manner that allows for closer analytical collaboration across the ic the collocation of ic personnel engaged in counterterrorism operations may also lead to substantially improved and informed counterterrorism operations human assets recruited by the ic can be highly mobile as these individuals move between the united states and overseas locations coordination amongst and between ic agencies having sole or shared juri sdiction can add substantial value to an operation and avoid inefficient as well as potentially embarrassing operational overlaps recent media coverage suggests tension between the fbi and the domestic intelligence arm of the cia on domestic intelligence activities 28 while distinction must be made between collocation which implies reliance on existing legal authorities and integration which implies the creation of new continued the immigration and nationality act an unincorporated association substantial number of members of which are citizens of the united states or aliens

unintentional mission creep and operational zeal could lead to situations in which rules designed to guide traditional foreign intelligence collection may be applied to us persons that is the civil liberties of us persons could be at risk if domestic intelligence collection is directed against them in manner that may not be consistent with or constrained by appropriate attorney general guidelines29 finally with respect to the resolution of disputes between the nctc and its constituent agencies the act stipulates that the dni shall resolve confli cts in the event that the heads of constituent agencies disagree with the dnis resolution they may appeal the resolution to the president given the nctcs role to monitor the implementation of strategic operational plans it is possible to envision conflicts between the nctc and an agency with respect to what exactly constitutes implementation and how specifically operational success is defined this may be exacerbated by the acts distinction between joint intelligence counterterrorism operations and joint counterterrorism operations other than intelligence regardless resolution of potential disputes within the nctc is one area that may be worthy of congressional oversight g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 an issue for congress is whether to let the existing intelligence reform act speak for itself and let certain ambiguities be resolved during implementation or to intervene to address apparent ambiguities through amendments to the act now alternatively the executive branch may choose to intervene to clarify apparent ambiguities within pl 108458 or between eo 13354 and pl 108458 30 in any event congressional oversight of the status quo and implementation of the present act could prove useful should congress amend intelligence reform legislation in the 109th congress or introduce new legislation possibly through the annual intelligence authorization process related to the nctc there are at least two areas in which it might consider action the first concerns the reporting relationships of the director of the nctc to the dni and to the president while the coordination of planning for counterterrorism operations is necessarily an executive branch wide endeavor the daily implementation of such practice remains relatively nebulous function and may therefore be topic for close congressional oversight some might argue that if close professional and personal bond develops between the president and the dni31 then direct reporting chain for the director of the nctc to the president for certain joint operations relating to counterterrorism is unlikely to undermine the dnis new authority the frequency substance and duration of the direct meetings between the president and the director of the nctc may pale in comparison to those between the president and the dni however it is possible that confusion could develop because the act differentiates between intelligence joint counterterrorism operations and joint counterterrorism operations other than intelligence operations presumably military operations 29 the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 as amended 50 usc 1801 et seq authorizes under certain circumstances and subject to court order elect ronic surveillance directed

generally even joint military counterterrorism operations require sound tactical intelligence to achieve their objectives second congress may wish to consider adding to its expressed prohibition for the nctc to execute operations language which would explicitly clarify the legal authorities of constituent nctc members with respect to counterterrorism operations alternatively congress could consider specifically stating in law that the privacy and civil liberties oversight board established in pl 108458 32 has explicit responsibility for oversight of the joint counterterrorism operations of the nctc particularly when these operations involve us persons finally another potential area for congressional scrutiny may be the appropriate arrangements and congressional committees that have jurisdiction over the activities of the nctc while the directorate of intelligences activities are largely bounded by traditional intelligence functions such as the setting of collections requirements collection of raw intelligence and the conduct of intelligence analysis the directorate of strategic operational plannings activities go beyond intelligence as such the universe of committees having oversight over the executive branch wide functions associated with strategic operational planning may exceed those that will conduct oversight over the nctcs directorate of intelligence one could envision situation in which not unlike the activities of the department of homeland security the number of committees claiming jurisdiction over the nctcs director of strategic operational planning could be substantial the challenge would then be to coordinate congressional oversight in manner that is rigorous and meaningful without unduly burdening nctc leadership g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the ostensible purpose for the creation of intelligence centers including the nctc is to bring together the disparate elements of the ic having different intelligence foci and missions in order to achieve common intelligence and national security objectives given the positive results of jointness achieved in the armed forces context as result of the goldwaternichols defense reorganization act of 1986 there is an inherent attraction to apply such best practices to the ic yet the cohesive integration of functions across the ic requires relatively clear guidance or at least the absence of contradictory or confusing authorities with respect to the nctc the act outlines some authorities which may cause lack of clarity which may in turn undermine the effective and efficient implementation of truly national approach to counterterrorism the bifurcated reporting relationships the act outlines for the director of the nctc illdefined distinctions between joint counterterrorism intelligence operations and joint counterterrorism operations other than intelligence as well as the authority of the nctc to define operational success and have the tools necessary to ensure compliance with its joint plans are all areas in which unclear authority could lead to inefficient business practices professionalism and high degree of commitment among the counterterrorism cadre assigned to the nctc may go long way toward ameliorating these ambiguities and thus negate the need for legislative action it is also possible however that the ambiguities outlined in the act may only complicate the inevitable growing pains associated with establishing an effective nationally coordinated counterterrorism 32 see title i subtitle f privacy and civil liberties in pl 108458 as currently drafted the act would likely allow such oversight as it is stated that the board shall continually review regulations executive branch policies and procedures including implementation of such regulations policies and procedures to ensure that privacy and civil liberties are protected
