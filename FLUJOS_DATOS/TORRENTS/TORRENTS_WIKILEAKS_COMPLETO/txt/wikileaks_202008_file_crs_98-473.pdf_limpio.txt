l income tax in 1913 the appropriate taxation of capital gains income has been perennial topic of debate in congress almost immediately legislative steps were initiated to change and modify the tax treatment of capital gains and losses the latest changes in the tax treatment of individual capital gains income occurred in 1998 and 2003 it is highly probable that capital gains taxation will continue to be topic of legislative interest in the 109th congress capital gains income is often discussed as if it were somehow different from other forms of income yet for purposes of income taxation it is essentially different from any other form of income from capital capital gain or loss is merely the result of sale or exchange of capital asset an asset sold for higher price than its acquisition price produces gain an asset sold for lower price than its acquisition price produces loss ideally tax consistent with theoretically correct measure of income would be assessed on real inflationadjusted income when that income accrues to the taxpayer conversely real losses would be deducted as they accrue to the taxpayer in addition under an ideal comprehensive in come tax any untaxed real appreciation in the value of capital assets given as gifts or bequests would be subject to tax at the time of transfer since 1913 at least twenty major legisla tive acts have affected the taxation of capital gains income and loss over this period the definition of what constitutes capital asset has been steadily expanded there have been periods when capital losses were not deductible periods when they were fully deductible and periods when they were only partia lly deductible likewise th ere have been periods when capital gains income has been partially taxed fully taxed or excluded from tax the logical question to ask after reviewing past legislative changes is why after 80 years is there still controversy over the appropriate means of taxing capital gains income and loss from purely economic perspective the appropriate means of taxing gains and losses from capital asse ts under tax that measures income comprehensively is relatively clear ind eed workable procedures for an approach more consistent with the ideal tax treatment have been outlined in great detail in the pasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98473contents current law tax treatment 2006 2 an overview

overview by jane g gravelleindividual capital gains income legislative history since the enactment of the individua l income tax in 1913 the appropriate taxation of capital gains income has been perennial topic of debate in congress almost immediately after the passage of the revenue act of 1913 legislative steps were initiated to change and modify the tax treatment of capital gains and losses these legislative initiatives continue today with the latest change in the tax treatment of individual capital gains income ccurring in legislation passed in 2003 capital gains income is often discussed as if it were somehow different from other forms of income yet for purposes of income taxation capital gains income is essentially different from any other form of income from capital such as interest or dividend income capital gain or loss is merely the result of sale or exchange of capital asset if the asset is sold for higher price than its acquisition price then the transaction produces capital gain if an asset is sold for lower price than its acquisition price then the transaction produces capital loss ideally tax consistent with theoretically correct measure of income would be assessed on real inflationadjusted income when that income accrues to the taxpayer conversely real losses should be deducted as they accrue to the taxpayer in addition any untaxed real appreciation in the value of capital assets given as gifts or bequests should be subject to tax at the time of transfer under the current income tax however nominal noninflation adjusted capital gains income is taxed when it is realized sold or exchanged by the taxpayer capital losses within certain limits are also deducted on nominal basis when they are realized by the taxpayer currently the untaxed appreciation in the value of capital assets transferred at d eath is not subject to tax obviously the current law tax treatment of capital gains and losses is at variance with the approach that would be applied if income were measured in theoretically correct manner putting theory into practice however is not easy appropriately taxing income and losses from the sale of capital assets involves difficulties such as differentiating between real and nominal gains and losses and accounting for tax deferral moreover the taxation of capital gains income affects resource allocation the distribution of the tax burden and the re venue yield of the individual income tax1httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98473crs2 2 for more information on depreciation recapture see archived crs report 97858 depreciation recapture after the taxpayer relief act of 1997 by gregg esenwein available from authorsince 1913 there has been considerable gislative change in the tax treatment of capital gains income and loss this report provides brie f history of those changes to establish perspective brief overview of the current law tax treatment of capital gains income and losses is presented first the remainder of the report then focuses on the legislative changes that have affected the tax treatment of capital gains income and losses since 1913 current law tax treatment 2006 under current law capital assets are separated into four categories assets that have been held for 12 months or less are c onsidered shortterm assets assets that have been held longer than 12 months are considered longterm assets collectibles art work antiques coins stamps etc are the third category of assets and the fourth category of capital gains assets includes the portion of gain attributable to previously taken depreciation ductions on section 1250 property depreciable real estate shortterm capital gains are taxed at regular income tax rates for assets sold or exchanged on or after may 6 2003 and before january 1 2011 the maximum tax rate on longterm capital gains is 15 the maximum tax rate on longterm gains is 5 for taxpayers in the 10 and 15 marginal income tax brackets collectibles held longer than 12 months are taxed at 28 the unrecaptured section 1250 gain attributable to depreciati on deductions is taxed at maximum tax rate of 252 net capital losses are deduc tible against up to 3000 of ordinary income that is noncapital gain income any portion of the net loss in excess of the 3000 limit can be carried forward and used to offset gains in succeeding tax years excess net losses can be carried forward indefinite ly and without limit on the amount of losses that can be carried forward under current law taxpayers are allowed to exclude from taxable income up to 500000 250000 in the case of single returns of the gain from the sale of their principal residences to qualify the taxpayer must ve owned and occupied the residence for at least two of the previous five years prior to the date of sale under current law capital gains transferred at time of death are not subject to tax on transfer at death the basis of the asset original cost plus changes in the value due to improvements or depreciation is stepped up to the market value of the asset on the date of deathhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98473crs3 3 the information contained in this report on legislative changes through 1949 draws from two primary sources the first source is the federal income tax by roy g and gladys c blakey published in 1940 the second source is legislative histor of treatment of capital gains under the federal income tax 19131948 by anita wells national tax journal march 1949 for legislative changes after 1949 the primary sources of information include the conference committee reports and th general explanations of the individual tax acts prepared by the joint committee on taxationan overview of legislative changes since 19133 revenue act of 1913 the revenue act of 1913 enacted af ter the adoption of the sixteenth amendment to the constitution established the framework for th current individual income tax it did not include any speci fic provisions covering the tax treatment of capital gains income capital gains on transactions entered into for profit were considered regular income and were taxed in full at normal tax rates capital losses unless they were losses specifically associated with taxpayers trade or business were not deductible revenue act of 1916 the revenue act of 1916 was primarily concerned with raising revenue through general increase in the marginal tax rates applicable to individuals in addition however it contained provisions which llowed deductions for capital losses on transactions not associated with taxpay ers primary trade or business deductible capital losses however could not exceed taxpayers capital gains income revenue act of 1918 the revenue act of 1918 wa s one of the largest tax increases in american history an important change related to capital gains income involved the removal of the restriction on deductible losses for the first time capital losses in excess of capital gains were deductible against ordinary income revenue act of 1921 the revenue act of 1921 marked significant change in the tax treatment of capital gains income for the first time capital assets were specifically defined in the individual income tax code and were separated into l ong and short term assets assets held longer than two years were considered longterm while assets held two years or less were c onsidered shortterm gains on shortterm assets were included in income and taxed at normal tax rates losses on shortterm assets were ductible against ordinary income net gains on longterm assets were at the taxpayers election subject to flat tax of 125 instead of taxes assessed at the regular and rtax rates however to qualify for this election the total tax owed by the taxpayer including regular taxeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98473crs4 and taxes on longterm capital gains could not be less than 125 of the taxpayers total net income if the combined tax fe ll below 125 of net in come then taxes on longterm capital gains were assessed at regular rates losses on assets held longer than two years were deductible in full against any other type of income this system howev er created an asymmetrical treatment of longterm gains and losses longterm losses were deductible in full at regular income tax rates which including surtax ra tes went as high as 56 on the other hand longterm gains were taxed at only 125 which meant that longterm losses could be deducted at much higher rates than those applied to longterm gains revenue act of 1924 the revenue act of 1924 corrected the imb alance in the tax treatment of long term capital losses created by the 1921 act by establishing symmetrical treatment between longterm gains and losses ta x credit of 125 was llowed for net long term losses if this produced tax that was less than the tax if net longterm losses were deducted at regular rate s however then net longt erm losses would have to be deducted at regular rates other changes in the 1924 act included re peal of the provision that prohibited the use of the alternative 125 rate on l ongterm gains if it produced total tax liability on net income below 125 the definition of capital asset was also changed by eliminating the provisos that assets be acquired for profit or inve stment in order to be considered capital assets this change allowed taxpayers selling their residential property to treat the resulting gains or losses as capital gains or losses revenue act of 1932 this act changed the income tax treatment of shortterm held two years or less losses on sales of stocks and bonds shortterm sses on stocks and bonds were deductible only to the extent of gains from the sale of these same types of assets losses that exceeded gains in given year could be carried forward to the next year and used to offset gains from the sales of stocks and bonds in that year this loss carry forward was repealed prior to its b ecoming effective by the national industrial recovery act national industrial recovery act one provision of this 1933 legislation re pealed the loss carryforward for short term losses on the sale of stocks and bonds revenue act of 1934 the revenue act of 1934 ins tituted sliding inclusion scale for the recognition of gains and losses based on how long capita l asset had been held the gain or loss to be included for income tax purposes was 100 if the asset had been held less thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98473crs5 one year 80 if the asset had been held less than two years 60 if the asset had been held less than five years 40 if the asset had been held less than 10 years and 30 if the asset had been held longer than 10 years net recognized gains were included in income and taxed at normal and surtax rates recognized capital losses were netted against recognized capital gains if losses exceeded gains then losses up to the amount of recognized gains plus 2000 were deductible revenue act of 1938 the 1938 act included major changes in th tax treatment of gains and losses from the sale of capital assets gains and losses were classified as shortterm if the capital asset had been held 18 months or less and longterm if the asset had been held for longer than 18 months shortterm losses were deductible up to the amount of shortterm gains short term losses in excess of shortterm gains could be carried forward for one year and used as an offset to shortterm gains in that succeeding year the carryover could not exceed net income in the taxable year the loss was incurred net shortterm gains were included in taxable income and taxed at regular tax rates longterm gains and losses were subj ect to two alternative methods of determining the tax on those gains or losse s under the first method percentage of longterm gains or losses was recogniz ed and included in taxable income and taxed at regular tax rates if the asset d been held for more than 18 months but for 24 months or less then 6666 of the gain or loss was recognize d if the asset had been held for longer than 24 months then 50 of the gain or loss from the sale of that asset was recognized and included in taxable income net recognized longterm losses could be ducted against other forms of income without limit the 1938 act also adopted an alternative method of taxing longterm gains and losses assets held longer than 18 months that was calculated as follows regular taxes on taxable income excluding an net longterm capital gains would be computed to this partial tax flat tax of 30 of the net longterm capital gain would be added if this lternative method produced ta x liability that was less than the tax assessed under the sta ndard method then the taxpayer could pay the lower amount of tax the 30 flat tax was applied against recognized net longterm gains that means the maximum tax on assets held longer than 18 months but less than 24 months would be 20 30 of the 6666 of the gain that was recognized and the maximum tax on assets held longer than 24 months would be 15 30 of the 50 of the gain that was recognized the alternative tax treatment of net longterm capital losses worked in similar fashion regular taxes on taxable income excluding any net longterm capital losses would be calculated from th is partial tax an amount equa l to 30 of the net long term capital gain would be deducted if this alterna tive method produced tax thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98473crs6 was greater than the tax assessed under the standard method then the taxpayer was obligated to pay the higher amount of tax final change in the 1938 act involved change in the definition of capital assets after 1938 depreciable property used in trade or business was longer considered capital asset for income tax purposes as result losses on this type of property were longer subject to the limitations on losses on the sale of capital assets and hence we re deductible in full revenue act of 1942 this wartime tax legislation made several changes in the individual income tax treatment of capital gains and losses these changes included reduction in the holding period slight increase in the tax rate on longterm gains limit on the loss offset against ordinary income and crea tion of fiveyear carryforward for losses under prior law to qualify as longterm capital asset the asset had to be held for over 18 months the 1942 act reduced this holding period to six months gains on assets held less than six months were included in taxable income and taxed at regular tax rates the 1942 act increased the tax rate on long term gains under prior law the alternative tax rate on recognized longterm gains was flat 30 which resulted in maximum tax rate on longterm gains of 15 the recognized portion of the gain 50 taxed at flat 30 rate the 1942 act increased the alternative tax rate on longterm gains to 50 which in turn increased the maximum tax rate on longterm gains to 25 the recognized portion of the gain 50 taxed at flat 50 rate the 1942 act also changed the tax treatment of capital losses in two significant ways first it consolidated the tax treatme nt of short and long term losses second it established 1000 limit on the amount of or dinary income that could be offset by combined short and longterm net capital loss finally it created fiveyear carry forward for netcapital losses that could be used to offset capital gains and up to 1000 of ordinary income in succeeding years new provisions in the 1942 act changed th tax treatment of certain business property under these new provisions in s ection 117j of the ta x code gains on the sale or involuntary conversi on of real and depreciable property used in trade or business would be treated as capital gains losses however would continue to be treated as ordinary losses revenue act of 1943 through expansion of provisions in s ection 117j and 117k the revenue act of 1943 extended capital gains tax treatment to timber owners of timber or those with contracts to cut timber were permitted to treat the income from the sale of the timber as capital gains income while losses were treated as ordinary losses httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98473crs7 revenue act of 1951 the revenue act of 1951 made three ch anges affecting the tax treatment of capital gains and losses first under s ections 117j and 117 k it extended capital gains tax treatment to the sales of land w ith unharvested crops sales of livestock and coal royalties second it amended the tax treatment of gains and losses that since 1942 had allowed taxpayers to use 1 in shortterm losses to offset 2 in longterm gains under prior law since only 50 of l ongterm gain was included in income allowing shortterm losses to offset recognized longterm gains the 50 included in taxable income on dollar for dollar ba sis created situation where 1 of short term losses was actually offsetting 2 of longterm gain the 1951 act eliminated this two for one offset finally the 1951 act allowed taxpayer to roll over the capital gains he received from the sale of his personal residence if within one year the taxpayer used the gain to acquire new reside nce of equal or greater value revenue act of 1964 the revenue act of 1964 made three chan ges in the tax treatment of capital gains and losses it extended under sec tions 117j and 117k capital gains tax treatment to iron ore royalties it also repealed the fiveyear loss carryover for capital losses and replaced it with unlimited loss carryover net losses however were still deductible against only 1000 of or dinary income in any given year the 1964 act introduced the first exclusi on for the capital gain arising from the sale of principal residence under these new provisions the first 20000 of capital gain from the sale of personal residence by taxpayer aged 65 years or older who had owned the house for at least eight year s and lived in the house for at least five years was excluded from tax tax reform act of 1969 the tax reform act of 1969 made several major chan ges in the tax treatment of capital gains and losses it increased the alternative tax ra on large amounts of capital gains income it restricted the deductibility of longterm losses and it created an addon minimum tax on tax preference items one of which was the excluded portion of longterm gains the act eliminated the 50 alternative tax rate on netlong term gains in excess of 50000 for joint returns 25000 for single returns this alte rnative tax rate on longterm gains had originally been enacted in 1938 and was modified in 1942 netlong term gains in excess of these amounts were taxed at regular income tax rates which at the time went as high as 70 hence the maximum rate on longterm capital gains rose from 25 under prior law to 35 50 of gain included in taxablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98473crs8 income taxed at 70 rate this change was phasedin over threeyear period and was fully in effect by 1972 the act imposed 50 limitation on the amount of net longterm losses that could be used to offset ordinary income under prior law even though only 50 of net longterm gains were subject to tax ne t longterm losses coul d be deducted in full and used to offset up to 1000 of ordinary income the act repealed this provision and established new 50 limit on the deductibility of net longterm losses subject to the same 1000 limit on ordinary income in addition the law specified that the nondeductible portion of net longterm losses could not be carried forward to be deducted in succeeding years the 1969 act created new 10 minimum tax on tax preference items this tax was adopted because of concern that wealthy taxpayers were escaping taxation through excessive use of tax preferences the tax was 10 of the value of all tax preference items in excess of 30000 basi c exemption amount and regular income taxes owed final tax liability was determined by adding the minimum tax to the regular income taxes owed the excluded portion of net longterm capital gains was considered tax preference item for purposes of this addon minimum tax finally the act capped the tax rate on pe rsonal service income at 50 regular tax rates went to 70 however the 1969 act required that the amount of personal service income eligible fo r treatment under this maximu m tax rule be offset on dollar for dollar basis by the excl uded portion of capital gains income tax reduction act of 1975 the tax reduction act of 1975 increased from 12 months to 18 months the capital gains tax free roll over time allowed between the sale of principal and the acquisition of new principal residence tax reform act of 1976 the tax reform act of 1976 changed the length of time capital asset had to be held to qualify for preferential treatment increased the capital gains loss offset against ordinary income increased the minimum tax rate and for the first time eliminated the practice of stepping up the basis of property passing from decedent to an heir prior to the 1976 act capital asset had to be held only six months to qualify for longterm capital gains treatment th 1976 act increased the holding period to nine months for tax year 1977 and to one year for tax years beginning after 1977 under prior law net capita l losses could offset up to 1000 of ordinary income the 1976 act increased the capital loss offset to 2000 in 1977 and 3000 for tax years starting after 1977 another change in the 1976 act affectin g capital gains income was an increase from 10 to 15 in the addon minimum tax rate on tax preference itemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98473crs9 the act also increased the onetime exclusion from capital gains taxes for the sale of principal residence by ta xpayer aged 65 years or older from 20000 to 35000 the final change in the 1976 act involved the elimination of the practice of stepping up the basis of property when it was passed from gene ration to generation under prior law the basis of property passe d from decedent to an heir was stepped up to reflect the fair market value of the property on the date of death the stepped up basis was then used to determine the am ount of gain or loss occurring when the property was sold by the heirs the 1976 act changed this practice so that the basis of property passed from decedent to an heir would longer be stepped up but rather the basis of the property would be carried over and remain unchanged from the basis when held by the decedent thes new rules were to become effective for property transferred after december 31 1976 revenue act of 1978 the 1978 act changed the taxation of capita l gains and losses in several ways first it repealed the 25 alternative ta x on an individuals first 50000 of netlong term gain second it increased the excl usion for net longterm capital gain from 50 to 60 third it decreased the age limit for eligibility for the onetime exclusion of gain from the sale of pr incipal residence from 65 to 55 years in addition it increased the amount of gain eligible for the onetime exclusion to 100000 finally it allowed taxpayers who had owned and occupied property as their principal residence for period aggregating three out of the last five years immediately preceding the sale of the prope rty to qualify for the onetime exclusion from capital gains taxation on the sale of principal residence the act also affected the tax treatment of capital gains and losses by introducing new alternative minimum tax for individuals in addition to the old addon minimum the excluded portion of capital gains income was deleted from the list of tax preferences subject to the addon minimum tax instead the excluded portion of capital gains income along with certain itemized deductions were added back to gross income to form the tax base for the alternative minimum tax the tax rates for the alternative minimum tax went up to 25 on alternative minimum taxable income in excess of 100000 if the tax computed under the alternative minimum tax was larger than taxpayers regular and addon minimum tax the taxpayer was obligated to pay the alternative minimum tax the 1978 act removed the excluded portion of capital gains income as an offset to the amount of personal service income eligible for the treatment under the maximum tax rate rule since 1969 the ta x rate on personal rvice income was capped at 50 even though regular tax rates went as high as 70 the excluded portion of capital gains income along with other tax preference items reduced on dollarfordollar basis the amount of pers onal service income that was subject to this cap finally the 1978 act postponed the impleme ntation of the carryover basis rules enacted in the 1976 act under the 1978 act the carryover basis rules would apply to property transferred after december 31 1979 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98473crs10 crude oil windfall profit tax act of 1980 this act repealed the carryover basis pr ovisions enacted in the 1976 reform act in its place it reestablished the process of stepping up the basis of property to reflect its fair market value at the time of death of the decedent economic recovery tax act of 1981 the economic recovery tax ac t increased from 100000 to 125000 the amount of capital gain eligible for the one time exclusion from tax on the sale of principal residence by taxpayer aged 55 years or older the act also increased the taxfree roll over period for the sale of principal residence from 18 to 24 months indirectly because of reductions in the top personal income tax rate from 70 to 50 the 1981 act also reduced the max imum tax rate on longterm capital gains income from 28 to 20 40 of longterm gain included in taxable income times 50 tax rate deficit reduction act of 1984 this act temporarily reduced the holdi ng period from 12 months to six months for determining whether an asset was considered shortterm or longterm capital asset assets held longer than six months qualified for the preferential tax treatment accorded longterm capital gains income this provision was effective for assets acquired after june 22 1984 and before january 1 1988 after 1988 the holding period to qualify as longterm capital asset reverted back to 12 months tax reform act of 1986 the tax reform act of 1986 repealed the net capital gain deduction for individuals both shortterm and longterm capital gains income were included in taxable income and taxed in full at regular income tax rates st atutory rates under the act were reduced from maximum of 50 to 33 28 statutory rate plus 5 surcharge the tax treatment of capital losses wa s unchanged losses could be netted against gains and any excess losses c ould be deducted against up to 3000 of ordinary income net losses in excess of this amount could be carried forward indefinitely revenue reconciliation act of 1990 this act established 28 maximum tax rate on netlong term capital gains income under the act the maximum statutory income tax rate was set at 31httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98473crs11 taxpayer relief act of 1997 this act made multiple changes to the tax treatment of capital gains income first it lowered the maximum tax rate on longterm assets held longer than 18 months capital gains income to 20 10 for taxpayers in the 15 tax rate bracket for regular income tax purposes second it kept the maximum capital gains tax rate on assets held more than 12 months but less than 18 months at 28 third it kept 28 maximum tax rate on the gain from the sale of collectibles held longer than 12 months fourth it instituted 25 tax rate for the

for asse ts held five years or longer and whose holding period began after december 31 2000which would otherwise have been taxed at 20 would instead be taxed at 18 finally the act repealed both the rollover provisions and the onetime exclusion provision for the sale of owner occupied housing in its place it established an exclusion of 500000 250000 in the case of singles on the gain from the sale of personal residence the new exclusi on would only be allowed once every two years the act also contained conforming ame ndments establishing these maximum capital gains tax rates as the maximum ta x rates for capital gains income under the alternative minimum tax internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of 1998 this act eliminated the 18month holding period for longterm capital gains income enacted in the taxpayer relief ac t of 1997 in its place it reestablished 12month holding period as the requirement for preferential longterm capital gain tax treatment the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 in may 2003 the 108th congress passed the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 under this act the maximum tax rate on longterm capital

members of the intelligence community to suspend the fiveyear test required for sale of principal residence during periods when they are serving extended duty legislative proposals in the 110th

appropriate way of taxing capital gains income and loss is relatively clear under tax system that measures income in comprehensive manner real capital income and loss would be treated as regular income and taxed or deducted as it accrues to the taxpayer untaxed real gains would be taxed when transferred as gifts or bequests several workable procedures for an approach more consistent with comprehensive measure of income have been proposed in the past4 putting theory into practice however would make the tax code more complex under more comprehensive approach to taxing income taxing capital gains income and losses would involve differentiating between r eal and nominal gains and losses and accounting for tax deferralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98473crs14 appendix statutory marginal
