g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 postemployment revolving door statutes rest ricting certain subsequent private employment activities of former federal officers and employees were enacted as early as 1872 and again in 1944 1 portion of the current statutory provision at 18 usc 207 was enacted in 1962 as part of major revision and recodification of the federal bribery and conflict of interest laws2 that postemployment conflict of interest law was then amended and broadened by the ethics in government act of 19783 which added certain oneyear coolingoff periods for highlevel executive branch personnel limiting their postemployment advocacy activities before the federal government for one year after leaving office after president reagan vetoed major congressional revision of the postemployment law which had been passed by congress in 1988 4 congress adopted as part of the ethics reform act of 1989 most of the reforms it had passed the year earlier in the vetoed legislation5 the statute has been modified in amendments several times since 1989 including extensive technical amendments in 19906 in 2007 as part of legislation dealing with lobbying laws and internal congressional rules on gifts changes were made to the revolving door statute increasing the oneyear cooling off period for very senior executive officials and for us senators to two years and broadening the oneyear cooling off restrictions for covered senior senate staff7 1 17 stat 202 1872 58 stat 668 1944 and 41 stat 131 1919 recodified at 18 usc 284 june 25 1948 62 stat 698 see

revolving door laws was to protect the government from the use against it of proprietary information by former employees who leave the government take with them such information and knowledge and then use that on behalf of private party in an adversarial type of proceeding or matter against the government to the potential detriment of the public interest as noted by the united states court of appeals in upholding the constitutionality of the switching sides prohibition of 18 usc 207a the purpose of protecting the government which can act only through agents from the use against it by former agents of information gained in the course of their agency is clearly proper one 8 another interest of the government in revolving door restrictions was to limit the potential influence and allure that lucrative private arrangement or the prospect of such an arrangement may have on current federal official when dealing with prospective private clients or future employers while still with the government th at is that the government employee not be influenced in the performance of public duties by the thought of later reaping benefit from private individual 9 in case dealing with another federal statute which relates in part to potential future private employment of current federal official10 the court noted that the statutory scheme was intended to deal with the nagging and persistent conflicting interests of the government official who has his eye cocked toward subsequent private employment11 additional interests asserted in the proposed amendments to 18 usc 207 in the 99th and 100th congresses were to prevent the corrupting influence on the governmental processes of both legislating and administering the law that may occur and the appearances of such influences when federal official leaves his government post to cash in on his inside knowledge and personal influence with those persons remaining in the government12 as noted in the post employment regulations promulgated under the statute by the office of government ethics the provisions of the law and regulation are directed at prohibiting certain acts by former government employees which may reasonably give the appearance of making unfair use of prior government employment and affiliations 13 these purposes in adopting limitations on former employees private employment opportunities must however also be balanced against the deterrent effect that overly restrictive provisions on career movement and advancement will have upon recruiting qualified and competent persons to government service 14 furthermore unduly restrictive provisions on the revolving door that is movement of government personnel into the private sector and private sector employees into the government may tend to isolate or at least insulate government employees from private sector 8 united states v nasser 476 f2d 1111 1116 7th cir 1973 9 brown v district of columbia board of zoning 423 a2d 1276 1282 dc app 1980 note

federal law with applicability to the broadest range of federal employees is criminal statute codified at 18 usc 207 which may work to restrict or regulate some private representational lobbying or advocacytype of activities by all employees in the executive branch after they leave government service some parts of this statutory restriction also apply to legislative branch officials and those are discussed in more detail later in this report in the part dealing with legislative branch restrictions section 207 of title 18 provides series of po stemployment restrictions on representational activities for executive branch personnel including 1 lifetime ban on switching sides on matter involving specific parties on which any executive branch employee had worked personally and substantially while with the government 2 twoyear ban on switching sides on somewhat broader range of matters which were under the employees official responsibility 3 oneyear restriction on assisting others on certain trade or treaty negotiations 4 oneyear cooling off period for certain senior officials barring representational communications before their former departments or agencies 5 twoyear cooling period for very senior officials barring representational communications to and attempts to influence certain other high ranking officials in the entire executive branch of government and 6

provides lifetime ban on every employee of the executive branch of the federal government switching sides that is representing private party before or against the united states government in relation to particular matter involving specific parties when that employee had worked on that same matter involving those parties personally and substantially for the government while in its employ this lifetime ban is fairly narrow and casespecific restriction wh ich in practice would apply to one who worked substantially on particular governmental matter such as specific contract particular investigation or certain legal action involving sp ecifically identified private parties and who then leaves the government and attempts to represent those private parties before the government on that same specific matter the switching sides prohibition does not generally apply to broad policy making matters including rulemaking of an agency but rather as noted by the office of government ethics typically involves specific proceeding affecting the legal rights of the parties or an isolatable transaction or related set of transactions between identifiable parties 16 15 an executive order 12834 january 20 1993 issued by president clinton had required senior presidential appointees to fulltime government positions to take an ethics pledge which required observance of longer time periods generally fiveyears for some of the restrictions on private employment after leaving their government posts that executive order was revoked on december 28 2000 eo 13184 and similar fiveyear bans have not been reinstituted in the current administration 16 5 cfr 2637201c

which were merely under the official responsibility of the federal official while he or she was with the government this twoyear restriction while more limited in time than the previous ban discussed is potentially broader in matters covered as it does not require that the former government employee had personal and substantial involvement in the matter when that individual worked for the government but rather merely that it was under his or her official responsibility

current federal employees in the executive branch who are seeking private employment may incur restrictions on the performance of their current duties for the government the principal federal conflict of interest law at 18 usc 208 provides among other restrictions that once any federal employee or officer in the executive branch begins negotiating subsequent employment with private employer that employee or officer must disqualify recuse himself or herself from any official governmental duties such as recommendations advice or decision making on any particular matter which has direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of that potential private employer 25 the office of government ethics has issued regulations concerning this potential conflict of interest and has expanded by regulation certain disqualification requirements beyond bilateral negotiations applying such requirements where the employee has even merely begun seeking employment the regulations note that federal employee has begun seeking employment not only if the employee is involved in discussion or communication that is mutually conducted even if the specifics of job or employment are not discussed but also if the employee has made an unsolicited communication regarding employment other than merely asking for an application or sending resume to someone who is affected by the employees duties only as part of an industry or other discrete class or if the employee has made response other than rejection to an unsolicited communication from private source concerning employment this status of seeking employment will continue until all possibilities of employment are rejected and discussion ended or two months have passed after an unsolicited communication had been made by the employee and indication or interest or postponement of consideration was indicated 26 during the time one is within this status of seeking employment the employee should notify the person responsible for his assignment or if the individual is responsible for his or her own assignments then the employee must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure compliance appropriate oral or written communication to ones coworkers and supervisors concerning required disqualification is suggested in the regulations although written documentation of recusal is not required in the regulations except to conform to previous ethics agreement with the office of government ethics 27 waivers from the disqualification requirements may be obtained in writing from the official responsible for the employees appointment28 in the area of procurement even if actual negotiations with potential private employer are involved or have begun certain contacts about prospective private employment between certain private contractors and federal procurement personnel may trigger reporting and recusal requirements agency officials who are participating personally and substantially in federal procurement for contract in excess of 10000029 must report all contacts from or to bidder or 25 note 5 cfr 2635601 see united states v conlon 628 f2d 150 dccir 1980 caci inc federal v united states 719 f2d 1567

employment by members and ce rtain staff in both the house and senate the general rule is that members may not begin private employment negotiations or have arrangements for subsequent private employment until their successors have been elected 31 the exception to the house and senate rules allows for such negotiations to begin earlier before successor is elected if the senator or representative makes disclosure statement within three business days concerning the commencement of such negotiations or agreements however in the senate this exception will not apply to and thus will not allow such negotiations or arrangements for future private employment which involves lobbying activities until the senators successor has been elected 32 the rules adopted in 2007 further provide that member of the house of representative who is negotiating or has an arrangement for future employment prior to successor being elected must recuse or disqualify himself or herself from participating in any matter that may raise conflict or interest or the appearance of conflict of interest because of such negotiations or employment arrangements and must notify the house committee on standards of official conduct of such recusal 33 in the senate the original disclosure statement of negotiations or arrangements is to be made public at the time it is made to the secretary of the senate while in the house the original notification of private employment negotiations or arrangements is not made public until and unless the member must recuse himself or herself for conflict of interest purposes and then the recusal notification as well as the original disclosure statement are made public 34 senior staff in both the house and senate i those employees who are compensated in excess of 75 of members salary must notify the appropriate ethics committee within three business days that the staffer is negotiating or has any agreement concerning future private employment 35 covered senate and house employees must then recuse themselves from official legislative matters that raise conflicts of interest because of their prospective private employment interests and notify the appropriate ethics committees of such recusal covered senate staffers must specifically recuse themselves from making any contact or communications with the prospective employer on issues of
