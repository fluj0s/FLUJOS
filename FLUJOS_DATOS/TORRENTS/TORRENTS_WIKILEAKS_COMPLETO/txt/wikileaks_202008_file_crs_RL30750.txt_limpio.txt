policy division dietary supplements ephedra summary ephedrine is natural constituent of the herb ephedra and synthetic compound present in certain overthecounter drug products the herbal form known as ma huang in china has been used as remedy for asthma in western cultures ephedrine the active drug product ingredient has been used as bronchodilator and decongestant for various respiratory problems more recently dietary supplements containing ephedra have been promoted for weight reduction and as performance enhancer in body building and other sports under the provisions of the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994 the food and drug administration fda must show that supplement is unsafe and causes harm before it can be removed from the market in 1997 following several hundred reports of adverse effects alleged to be caused by ephedra use fda proposed rules to restrict the dosage prohibit supplements containing ephedrine to be combined with other known stimulants and require specific warnings on ephedracontaining supplements the proposed rule was criticized for the lack of scientific evidence to support dosage limitations and the labeling requirements which led the agency to withdraw part of the proposal in 2000 however several high profile deaths attributed to ephedra led fda to repropose the original regulation in 2003 and publish final rule prohibiting the sale of ephedra under the safety provisions of dietary supplement health and education act in february 2004 in april 2005 the fda ban was overturned in federal district court but subsequently upheld in the us court of appeals in august 2006 several congressional hearings have focused on the limitations of fdas current adverse events reporting system which was used by the agency to conclude that dosage restrictions and mandatory labeling were needed and specific cases of death attributable to ephedra government accountability office report examined the scientific basis for fdas 1997 ephedra proposal and concluded that the number of adverse event reports related to ephedra warranted agency attention to safety concerns but failed to provide adequate evidence to support the dosing levels and duration of use limits in june 2002 hhs announced that it planned expanded research on the safety of ephedra following completion of rand corporation report commissioned to review the existing science the rand report indicated that the literature showed that while ephedra can promote modest shortterm weight loss in clinical trials there was insufficient data on longterm benefits for weightloss and body building and combined with other stimulants it was associated with increased health risks in the 108th congress several resolutions were introduced that would have expressed the sense of the congress either that all major sports organizations should ban the use of ephedra or that the secretary of the department of health and human services should remove ephedra from the market several bills introduced would have established labeling and advertising rules for supplements containing ephedra prohibited sales to minors required premarket approval and postmarket reporting of serious adverse effects these bills received further action bills concerned with supplements containing ephedra were introduced in the 109th congress contents background 1 fdas

pharmaceutically active compound found in both natural form in herbal ephedra and the synthetic ingredient present in certain overthecounter otc drug products1 dietary supplements containing ephedra and their regulatory status have been of ongoing concern to congress the supplement industry and consumers this report will attempt to clarify the current regulatory status of dietary supplement products containing ephedra ephedra is botanical whose herbal properties have been known for centuries by the name of ma huang in china where it was first used as remedy for the treatment of bronchial asthma although some 40 species are known worldwide its herbal and pharmaceutical effects are attributable to the contents of ephedrine and related alkaloids found primarily in the species of chinese origin historically practitioners of traditional medicine in china have been trained in the art and skills of compounding small amounts of variety of botanical ingredients including ephedra to treat specific conditions ma huang has generally been consumed in the form of an invigorating tea or infusion with beneficial effects on respiration in western cultures ephedrine has been used for years in various drug products ephedrine is mainly used as an ingredient in bronchodilator and decongestants for treating asthma and hayfever and to combat circulatory collapse in reaction to anesthesia poisoning shock and allergic reactions most recently ephedra in pill form has been promoted for weight reduction and as performance enhancer in body building and other sports the pharmaceutical effects of ephedra are due to the ephedrine alkaloids but the herbal product may not have the same physiological effect as the pure compound which can be produced synthetically the ephedra herb has been used for similar medical purposes although dietary supplement advocates claim that its action is more gentle and less likely to cause adverse effects however report that investigated the pharmacokinetics of ephedrine from three commercially available herbal ma huang products compared to 25 milligrams mg ephedrine hydrochloride capsules showed that the products had similar effect2 the authors reported that 1 note since ephedrine is the active chemical present in both dietary supplements and otc drug products the term ephedra will be used to refer to the dietary supplement natural form and ephedrine will refer to the drug synthetic form for purposes of this report 2 gurley b et ephedrine pharmacokinetics after ingestion of nutritional supplements containing ephedra sinica ma huang therapeutic drug monitoring 1998 v 20 pp 439 445 crs2 recent increases in ma huang toxicity were not due to the differences in the absorption rates of botanical ephedrine compared with synthetic ephedrine but instead resulted from accidental overdose often promoted by offlabel claims and belief that natural medicinal agents are inherently safe the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994 dshea exempted dietary supplements from the type of premarket approval process that drugs medical devices and food additives must undergo before they are allowed to be sold for medical devices and food additives manufacturers must demonstrate to the food and drug administrations fda satisfaction that the products are safe through adequate scientific testing prior to marketing in the case of prescription and otc drugs manufacturers must prove through adequate and wellcontrolled investigations that their products are safe and effective before they can be approved for marketing however congress effectively shifted the burden of proof under dshea from the manufacturer to the agency to show that dietary supplement is unsafe standard significantly more difficult to meet moreover the agency must demonstrate that the dietary supplement causes harm before it can be removed from the marketplace in the case of herbal supplements fda has only voluntary reports from consumers to rely on along with generally limited scientific evidence very often ephedra is one of several supplements consumers are using thus complicating determination of the actual cause of an adverse reaction because the law does not require that these products undergo premarket testing and evaluation there is reliable baseline information on the possible side effects that can be used to anticipate or compare adverse events another confounding factor is research evidence that supplement users are less likely than other consumers to report adverse effects from product they use3 in contrast when ephedrine is used in prescription or otc products it is regulated as drug by fdas center for drug evaluation and research cder ephedrine is used for treating mild forms of asthma and is also approved by the agency for treating such conditions as hypotension nasal congestion and sinusitis fda considers nonprescription ephedrine to be safe and effective as bronchodilator preferably when used under doctors care the dosage recommendations in adults and children over 12 years are 125 25 mg every 4 hours not to exceed 150 mg per day4 according to the industry handbook the principal adverse effects can include central nervous system cns stimulation sleeplessness nausea loss of appetite tremors tachycardia and urinary retention5 the handbook further indicates there are reports that chronic overdose of ephedrine may in some patients result in either severe cardiac toxicity or psychosis ephedrine along with other cns stimulants such as caffeine and phenylpropanolamine are frequently used 3 barnes j

manufactured to physically resemble much stronger controlled substances such as amphetamines to prevent both misuse and abuse with the otc version of ephedrine an fda drug advisory committee recommended and in 1995 the agency subsequently proposed an amendment for more stringent regulation of ephedrine which is primarily contained in bronchodilators6 however the agency has not yet finalized the proposed rule on ephedrine in bronchodilators denmark which has considerable research and use experience with ephedrine for weight loss regulates it as prescription drug in 1999 the world health organization had proposed restriction on the manufacture and distribution of ephedrinecontaining bronchodilator products however final restriction has been implemented fdas regulation of herbal ephedra 1997 proposed regulations in the 1990s fda began receiving reports that consumers were experiencing variety of adverse effects allegedly caused by ephedra use after the agency accumulated several hundred reports of adverse effects including number of deaths attributed to the supplements use it convened on october 1112 1995 an ephedra working group which included members of the fda food advisory committee and outside experts following the testimony presented at its first meeting the group reached conclusions or determination whether fda should take any action on regulating these supplements at second meeting on august 2728 1996 when additional information was reviewed some group members indicated their concern that there was safe level of this substance others however believed that there were certain levels that were safe for use of ephedra subsequently fda proposed rule for ephedra that addressed issues concerning its dosing labeling and warning statements7 the agency proposed that in supplement form single dose should not exceed eight milligrams and products should bear required labeling to indicate that more than 24 mg should be taken in given day also labeling information was to indicate that the product should not be used for longer than seven days and required warning statement that the product was not for longterm use such as for body building andor weight loss the agency also proposed to prohibit the use of ephedra in dietary supplements in combination with ingredients that have known stimulant effect such as caffeine which might cause an interaction in addition fda proposed that statement accompany any claims that encourage shortterm excessive intake to enhance purported effect such as increased energy stating that consuming more than the recommended serving dose might result in serious adverse health effects such as heart attack stroke 6 us department health and human services hhs food and drug administration

fdas proposed regulation generated considerable comment primarily from consumers and the dietary supplement industry most critical comments claimed that fdas ephedra dosage limitations were not based on scientific evidence and its labeling requirements were excessive the voluntary adverse events reporting aers system which had been the source of the agencys justification for proposing the regulatory changes also came under scrutiny the aers data were criticized for being insufficient to determine whether the adverse events reported were actually caused by ephedra use as result of the continued criticism of the agencys use of the aers as the basis for its rulemaking fda announced in april 2000 that it was withdrawing certain provisions of the proposed rule on ephedra8 the provisions that were withdrawn included the dietary ingredient limit for ephedra on per serving basis proposed compliance procedures for use of the high performance liquid chromotography method for sample analysis limitations on the duration of the products use and the prohibition on claims for longterm use such as for bodybuilding and weight loss the agency retained the sections of the proposed rule that would prohibit use of ingredients with stimulant effects in combination with supplements containing ephedra and the requirement that products containing ephedra carry warning statement on its use by consumers with certain diseases or health conditions or who use certain drugs accompanied by recommendation that use be discontinued if they experience certain signs or symptoms continued adverse events reporting on march 31 2000 fda released 140 additional recent cases of adverse events associated with ephedra use9 the agency indicated that these cases had been more fully reviewed and evaluated to determine whether ephedra was the likely cause of the adverse events fda also announced its intention to participate in public forum to address these new adverse events reporting data by that time about 1200 cases of adverse events allegedly attributed to ephedra had been reported to the agency the department of health and human services office of womens health convened the safety of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids public meeting on august 89 2000 to provide an opportunity to review the analysis of adverse events reports by fda and outside experts additional public testimony on recent scientific information on ephedra use was also taken the federal register announcement of the meeting sought comments on several questions concerning physiologic actions of

experience with ephedra use some reported lifechanging weight loss improvements in other health conditions and increased energy while others told of experiencing severe side effects after consuming even minimal doses several scientific investigators currently engaged in research on the use of ephedra for weight loss spoke at the meeting but were unable to disclose the final results of their

tommy thompson announced new efforts to expand scientific research on the safety of ephedrine alkaloids and aggressively pursue the illegal marketing of nonherbal synthetic ephedrine alkaloid products11 on october 7 2002 fda stopped imports of the ephedracontaining products by the dutch operator selling these products in the united states in addition the agency sent inspectors to the new jersey firm that was distributing the dutchmade products in this country when inspectors were denied access to the building court order was obtained to enter the building and inspect the companys records on october 8 2002 secretary thompson announced that he had asked fda to evaluate the best scientific evidence available and recommend the strongest possible mandatory warning labeling for ephedra containing products following the deaths of several athletes fda reopened for 30 days its earlier proposed rules for ephedra on march 5 2003 the published document specifically requested comments on the portions of the proposal that addressed dosing labeling and warning statements based on new evidence concerning health risks associated with the use of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in addition the agency signaled its intention to consider whether in light of recent evidence it should determine that ephedracontaining supplements present significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury under conditions of use recommended or suggested in labeling fda also sought comments on whether additional legislative authorities would be necessary or appropriate to enable it to address this issue most effectively the agency had proposed the following warning statement to appear on the principal display panel of the supplement product see box 1 the additional 10 jones w

before or during strenuous exercise crs7 prohibition on sale on december 30 2003 hhs and fda announced plans to prohibit the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra the decision to prohibit the sale of ephedra under the safety provisions of dshea represented the first time that the statute has been used to remove supplement ingredient from the marketplace the ban was to take effect 60 days after the agency published the final rule the 60day period following publication of the final rule is required under the congressional review act in the meantime fda released consumer alert that announced its plan to prohibit sales of ephedracontaining dietary supplements and urged consumers to stop using these products the agency also sent certified letters to over 60 manufacturers who had been producing supplements containing ephedra to provide the companies with advance notice of the final rule to be published to facilitate their earliest compliance the final notice of the ephedra ban was published on february 11 2004 and went into effect on april 12 2004 without any congressional objection12 by the time the fda ban was announced several members of congress were calling for it to be banned however several manufacturers sought temporary restraining order to prevent the ban from taking effect pending further scientific testing in us district court for the district of new jersey the arguments were heard on april 12 2004 and rejected from the bench on the same day because the case put forth by the plaintiffs did not meet certain legal standards the judge would not immediately stay the rule and ordered the plaintiffs to submit additional briefs so that the court could reach decision on whether to stay the ban permanently in its announcement of its plans to prohibit the sale of ephedracontaining supplements fda indicated that it had reached this decision after conducting an exhaustive and highly resourceintensive process that is required under the provisions of dshea for banning supplement that presents significant and unreasonable risk to human health to meet the safety standard fda said it gathered and thoroughly reviewed prodigious amount of evidence about ephedras pharmocology clinical studies of ephedras safety and effectiveness newly available adverse events reports the published literature and seminal report by the rand corporation the agency also reviewed tens of thousands of public comments on its march 2003 request for information about ephedraassociated health risks coupled with several highprofile deaths alleged to be from ephedra use and the subsequent reopening of the comment period on the previouslypublished proposed rule on ephedra regulation plus increasing pressure from congress the agencys decision was the culmination of process that began in 1997 when fda first proposed to require warning statements on the hazards of ephedra use following the announcement on the ephedra ban the agency had indicated that it planned to move beyond its recent action against ephedra and increase its focus on certain other supplements former fda commissioner mcclellan had stated the agencys intention to examine kava bitter orange citrus

supplement ingredients have been associated with kidney and liver problems in may 2004 then acting fda commissioner crawford stated that the agency was developing approaches to systematically review the evidence about the safety of individual dietary supplement ingredients fda plans included evaluation of the available pharmacology published literature including animal in vitro epidemiological and clinical trial data evidencebased reviews and adverse event information which is the approach that formed the scientific foundation for its rulemaking on ephedra however on april 14 2005 federal district judge in utah struck down the fda ban on supplements containing ephedra13 the ruling was in favor of utah supplement company that had challenged the agencys ban claiming that ephedra has been consumed safely for hundreds of years and that the agency had not proven that supplements containing ephedra were harmful the decision prevented fda from stopping the manufacturer from selling its product containing ephedra and sent the case back to the agency to determine both safe and dangerous levels of ephedrine ephedras active ingredient hhs officials and department of justice department lawyers took some time to examine the ruling to determine the next step some anti ephedra advocates viewed the ruling as falling short of an outright reversal of the ban and interpreted the language in the order as only applying to specific lower dosage 10 milligrams segment of the market the supplement manufacturers attorney declared that the courts ruling has lifted the fda ban on august 17 2006 the us court of appeals for the tenth circuit in denver upheld the fdas final rule declaring all dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids adulterated and therefore illegal for marketing in the united states14 this decision reverses the 2005 decision in utah the appeals courts ruling demonstrated the soundness of the agencys decision to ban dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids consistent with dshea it also found that congress required fda to conduct riskbenefit analysis under the provisions of the act counsel for the supplement company that had originally challenged the fda ban plans to ask for rehearing of the case by the full court since the august 17 2006 decision was made by two judges failing that they plan to take the case to the supreme court 13

scrutinized15 the agency acknowledged that all adverse event reporting cases were posted on its website without being subjected to vetting process to determine the likely cause of the adverse reaction according to fda officials this process was used to expedite release of adverse cases to interested parties in lieu of freedom of information procedures which usually take up to year to respond to specific requests thus the cases were reported as they were received due to the agencys limited resources to review the cases before they were released committee members acknowledged that the resources needed to improve the adverse events reporting system were limited the house committee on science requested that the general accounting office gao examine the scientific basis for fdas ephedra supplement proposal and determine whether the agency adhered to the regulatory flexibility analysis requirements for federal rulemaking on august 4 1999 gao released report in which it raised concerns about the process by which fda had compiled the 800 reports on the harmful effects of ephedra16 the report indicated that the agency was justified in its determination that the number of adverse events relating to supplements containing ephedra warranted agency attention and consideration of steps to address safety concerns however gao expressed concern about the manner in which fda used the adverse events reports in supporting the proposed dosing levels and duration of use limits and concluded that the agency needed additional evidence to support these restrictions the report indicated that while ephedra might be harmful the agency lacked adequate data to set dosage levels gao concluded that fdas economic analysis contained the basic elements of federal agencys costbenefit analysis however the agency analysis was not sufficiently transparent about how it reached its estimate of the costs and benefits of the proposed actions the gao report led to fdas decision to withdraw portions of the proposed rule in 2000 in the fy2001 hhs appropriations report srept 106293 accompanying s 2553 the senate committee on appropriations indicated its continued support for the work of the office of dietary supplements ods at the national institutes of health nih and the need for additional research to better inform consumers of the health benefits of supplements the committee specifically encouraged ods to support research on ephedra within the funds provided on october 9 2001 representative susan davis introduced the ephedrine alkaloid consumer protection act hr

hearings were held in 2002 on july 25 the house committee on government reform convened hearing on the recent research on the impact of diet and lifestyle on personal health the growing trend toward obesity and the use of supplements in promoting good health the draft rand corporation report that reviewed the literature on health problems associated with ephedra was discussed during the hearing subsequently the committee requested that gao review health related calls that one company collected from consumers from may 1997 to july 2002 gao examined the extent to which consumer information in the records was comprehensive interpretable and consistently recorded counted the number of call records reporting types of adverse events that fda had identified in 1997 as serious or potentially serious and compared its findings with those of six other reviews of the call records including one by the company17 gao reported in march 2003 that it counted 96 reports that were for heart attacks strokes seizures deaths and cardiac arrest the company had identified 78 cases the other reviews had ranged from 65 to 107 cases on july 31 2002 the senate committee on governmental affairs

fda as well as contact information for purposes of the medical product reporting program in addition to the prohibition of sales to minors the bill would have required that products be held in portion of the retail establishment not intended to be accessible to its customers these provisions are similar to the bill introduced in the 107th congress the bill was referred to the house committee on energy and commerce and subsequently to the subcommittee on health but further action occurred on march 4 2003 the ephedra public protection act hr 1075 was introduced by representative sweeney it would have required premarket approval for supplements containing ephedrine group alkaloids and subsequent reporting of serious adverse effects once they were allowed to be marketed the bill defined ephedrine supplements serious adverse experiences and documented incident the bill also would have required that the secretary of hhs publish the proposed rules of good manufacturing practices with 120 days of enactment the proposed rules for good manufacturing practices for dietary supplements were actually published on march 13 2003 finally the bill would have required the testing of each

issues related to ephedra containing dietary supplements18 on the first day witnesses included victims families researchers several manufacturers and agency officials the second day the witnesses included representatives of collegiate and major league sports baseball auto racing football and soccer at hearing convened by the senate committee on commerce science and transportation on october 28 2003 the members heard testimony from representatives of the fda the federal trade commission anti doping agency supplement trade association consumers and scientist the hearing was designed to determine the availability of supplements to consumers of all ages industry marketing practices the effectiveness of dshea to protect consumers and whether the current level of domestic consumption exposes consumers to unexpected long and short term effects legislation was introduced in the 109th congress that addressed the issue of dietary supplements containing ephedra prior to the fda ban several members had supported banning supplements containing ephedra so congressional interest may depend on the outcome of further legal action published research on november 6 2000 the new england journal of medicine released an article on the health effects of dietary supplements containing ephedra19 the report was the result of an fda request for an independent review of adverse event reports related to the use of supplements containing ephedra to assess causation and to estimate the level of risk that use of these supplements poses to consumers the researchers reviewed 140 reports of adverse events related to ephedracontaining supplements submitted to fda between june 1 1997 and march 31 1999 the results indicated that 31 of cases were considered to be definitely or probably related to the use of ephedracontaining supplements and 31 were deemed to be possibly related among the adverse events 47 involved cardiovascular symptoms hypertension palpitations tachycardia and stroke and 18 involved the central nervous system seizures ten events resulted in deaths and 13 events produced permanent disability the authors concluded that the use of ephedracontaining dietary supplements may pose health risk to some individuals and the findings indicated the need for better understanding of individual susceptibility to the adverse effects of these supplements the final version of the report was published in nejm on 18 house of representatives committee on energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations and commerce trade and protection hearings

potentially pose the greatest hazard to care of patients undergoing surgery the study found that for ephedra the relevant pharmacological effects included increased heart rate and blood pressure which increased the risk for heart attack and stroke use of the supplement needed to be discontinued at least 24 hours before surgery the report concluded by suggesting that during the preoperative evaluation physicians need to explicitly elicit and document history of herbal medication use as well as learn the potential preoperative effects of the commonly used herbal medications to prevent recognize and treat potentially serious problems associated with their use and discontinuation separate analysis of adverse reactions to ephedra and other herbal products during 2001 documented by the toxic event surveillance system was published23 products containing ephedra alone or in combination with other herbs or substances accounted for 64 of all adverse reactions while these products represented only 082 of herbal products sales the relative risk for an adverse reaction from ephedra was markedly elevated in comparison to all other individual herbs by 10 to 40fold nih office of

evidencebased practice center at its randsouthern california unit the review addressed series of questions related to safety and efficacy of ephedra alone and in combination with other ingredients for use in weight management athletic performance and energy enhancement the reviewers concluded that ephedrine and ephedra promote modest shortterm weight loss in clinical trials24 they determined that there were data on longterm weight loss and insufficient evidence to support the use of ephedra for athletic performance the evidence did show that the use of ephedra or ephedrine with caffeine was associated with increased risk of psychiatric autonomic or gastrointestinal symptoms and heart palpitations the report was to have been used in shaping the ods research agenda related to ephedra until fda announced the ban on ephedracontaining products ephedra status in other countries on june 14 2001 health canada hc released an advisory warning consumers not to use products that contain ephedra either alone or in combination with caffeine and other stimulants for weight loss body building or increased energy25 the agency noted that it had authorized ephedrine only for use in nasal

controlled ephedras availability the council of the european union lists ephedra in the category of an illicit crop most european union members have longstanding prohibition against its use in food and dietary supplements while also strictly regulating its use for medicinal purposes by requiring physicians to write prescriptions which allow for monitoring the quantity and duration of use germany and the netherlands have essentially banned it the united kingdom has restricted its use under the category of herbal medicine and ireland has banned it all together australia lists ephedra and any product containing it as controlled substance along with prohibiting its sale as food or in food product in the middle east jordan has withdrawn an herbal weight loss product that contained ephedra

ephedra for centuries in traditional herbal healing the chinese government owns and operates ephedra farms and processes products for pharmaceutical use although some ephedra is available in stores alone and in supplements where use is less restricted state regulation of ephedra in the absence of fda regulation of dietary supplements containing ephedra number of states attempted to take action to regulate ephedra following reported adverse effects on consumers state efforts have taken several different forms some states have regulated the product by age group some states have declared it an illegal drug while other states have adopted regulations on how and to whom it can be sold see the crs congressional distribution memorandum entitled ephedrine federal and state law regarding access and control by m ann wolfe and diana t duffy november 2 2000 for further information on state action in march 2003 suffolk county new york banned the sale of ephedra and in april the new york city

nnfa and unpa29 the petition requested that the agency revoke the parts of the 1997 proposed ephedra rule that still stood and implement an industry standard for the labeling and marketing of dietary supplements containing ephedra the industry standard for labeling and marketing of supplements containing ephedra outlined in the petition was essentially the same as the provisions outlined above in this report of the industrys voluntary program that had been in place for more than eight years the industry indicated in the petition that virtually all major manufacturers and distributors of ephedra products represented by the trade associations filing the petition have already adopted the voluntary program guidelines in december 2000 the council for responsible nutrition announced the results of the cantox health sciences international report that it had funded to review recent clinical trials on the safe use of ephedra30 cantox analyzed in detail 19 clinical trials aers from fda case reports and published articles including data from human and animal studies the report indicated that ephedra is safe to use at total daily dose of 90 mg divided into smaller doses of up to 30 mg each which would cause observed adverse effects in addition 150 mg total daily dosage was determined to be the lowest level at which moderate adverse effects were first observed observations the hhsfda determination that ephedra was risk to public health under the standard for safety in dshea represented the first time that the 1994 statute has been used to prohibit the sale of dietary supplement the process which started in 1997 was both time consuming and labor intensive for the department to establish that it had met the standard of significant and unreasonable risk the fdas final decision appeared to have been based on the collective information available ephedras pharmacology clinical studies of its safety and effectiveness hundreds of adverse event reports including 150 deaths an extensive review of the published literature and report of an independent scientific institute since the department decided to appeal the recent legal challenge to the ephedra ban and prevailed the ephedra case could serve as model for the review process and procedures for supplement that raises public health concern in the future the current voluntary adverse reporting system continues to be controversial due to its limitations in providing the information needed to determine causality between the use of supplements containing ephedra and suspected health problems these limitations also make it difficult for fda in its rulemaking to address safety 28 continued ephedrine alkaloids public meeting august 89 2000 5p 29 apha chpa nnfa unpa citizens petition to the food

ephedra dec 20 2000 crs18 duration of use and dosage levels for dietary supplements containing ephedra or in the future any other supplement ingredient that seems to present public health concern the aer reports are generally incomplete and difficult to use in establishing whether ephedra was the cause of particular adverse event in given individual furthermore according to barnes et al31 the number of adverse reports received into the system may represent an underreporting of the actual number of adverse events occurring future research on the use of ephedra for weight reduction may shed some light on its efficacy as well as on any adverse events that may occur in more controlled research environment and holds out the possibility of evidence of benefits outweighing the risks to the extent that it might be regulated and used as drug congress has continued to review the problems with the voluntary aers system for supplements through oversight hearings and reports in 2006 it introduced and enacted legislation that would require mandatory reporting of dietary supplement aers see crs report rs22480 for further information nevertheless the number of adverse event reports relating to supplements containing ephedra seems to indicate that there is problem with its use in at least select group of consumers who experience severe adverse reactions including life threatening events following use of the supplements given the current dearth of controlled clinical trials it is impossible to ascertain which consumers many of whom seem to have known health problems might be adversely affected by ephedra use it seems plausible that determining safe level of ephedra for the general population as whole may never be possible an additional question to be examined concerns the health effects of caffeine in combination with ephedra fdas decision to prohibit the sale of supplements containing ephedra signaled final agency determination that there was safe level to date new information has been reported that changes that determination the industrys claim that ephedra has been used for hundreds of years while technically correct fails to consider the different dosage and uses to which it is being put today although the final rule was still subject to the congressional review act after it was published congress did not alter the final rule and by the time of the ban number of members had been advocating that fda ban ea the congressional language encouraging nihods to conduct research on ephedra was aimed at helping to generate the answers to numerous questions on the health effects and the vulnerable populations that should avoid use of this supplement however specific funding has been provided for such an initiative congress has indicated that it should be supported out of existing funds while the funding provided to ods has been increased in recent fiscal years there are number of areas of research investigation competing for the monies that the office receives furthermore the results of any research focused on specific supplement ingredient that is funded by nihods will not be available for threefive years because of the time involved in initiating such program completion of the research and publication of the results in peerreviewed journal nevertheless the recent announcement concerning the expansion of research on the safety of these products 31 barnes j et different standards for reporting adrs to herbal remedies and conventional otc medicines facetoface interviews with 515 users of herbal remedies journal of clinical pharmacology v 45 1998 p 496500 crs19 suggests that the department recognized the need to seek additional information on the health impact from the use of ephedracontaining supplements the plans for future research on supplement ingredients were placed on hold following fdas decision to ban ephedra given the number of adverse event reports associated with ephedra including the number of deaths and the amount of controversy surrounding the strict requirements that fda had originally proposed for dietary supplements containing ea the final rule to prohibit the sale of ea as dietary supplement was an interesting development the more moderate voluntary selfregulatory program for the formulation and labeling of ephedracontaining products that the supplement industry has had in place for some time was not adopted by all manufacturers of ephedracontaining products and was not considered as effective as it might have been bills introduced in the 108th congress would have mandated number of the provisions of both the fda proposed rules and the selfregulatory program that the supplement industry has endorsed the regulatory stalemate might have been resolved by the fda decision to prohibit the sale of this supplement ingredient however the recent court challenges may keep the question of regulation open the longterm impact of the ephedra ban and the court ruling may be to raise concern among some lawmakers and others about changes needed to make dshea more effective in addressing regulation of supplements in the future several bills introduced in the 108th and 109th congresses attempted to begin to address concerns beyond the problems with ephedracontaining products alone see crs report rl30887 for further information congress has now made aers mandatory for dietary supplements with the enactment of s 3546pl109462 fda had indicated it planned to complete rules on good manufacturing practices gmps by the end of 2006 however to date final regulations have been published in addition the agency also is reportedly developing approaches to systematically review the evidence about the safety of individual dietary supplement ingredients it remains to be seen whether these various piecemeal changes will improve fdas ability to regulate supplements in the future for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30750
