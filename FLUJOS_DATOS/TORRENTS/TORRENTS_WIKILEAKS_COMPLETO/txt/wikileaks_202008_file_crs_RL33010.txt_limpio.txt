values with the united states and has been treaty ally since the signing of the australianew zealandunited states anzus treaty in 1951 australia made major contributions to the allied cause in both the first and second world wars and has been staunch ally of britain and the united states in their conflicts under the former liberal government of john howard australia invoked the anzus treaty to offer assistance to the united states after the attacks of september 11 2001 in which 22 australians died australia was one of the first countries to commit troops to us military operations in afghanistan and iraq in october 2002 terrorist attack on western tourists in bali indonesia killed more than 200 persons including 88 australians and seven americans second terrorist bombing which

of the labor party was elected prime minister on november 24 2007 while rudd has fulfilled an election promise to draw down australian military forces in iraq and has reversed australias position on climate change by signing the kyoto protocols relations with the united states remain very close rudd has initiated review of australias defense policy that is expected to reaffirm australias traditional view that the united states is key source of stability in the asiapacific region the previous howard government and the us signed bilateral free trade agreement fta and negotiated treaty on defense trade cooperation that would require senate ratification to come into force despite the strong strategic ties between the united states and australia there have been some signs that the growing economic importance of china to australia may influence australias external posture on issues such as taiwan it is likely that australia would not support policy of containment of china if the united states sought this australia plays key role in promoting regional stability in southeast asia and the southwest pacific australia has led peacekeeping efforts in the asiapacific region including east timor and the solomon islands and has supported us efforts and worked closely with key regional states in the war against terrorism in southeast asia these actions demonstrate

government in november 2007 kevin rudd was elected prime minister ending former prime minister john howards term in office that began in march 1996 prime minister rudd has reaffirmed australias and the labor partys commitment to its alliance relationship with the united states even as he has differed with the united states on iraq and climate change rudd has moved to draw down australian military forces in iraq while australian troops remain in afghanistan the australian left has grown increasingly disillusioned with the war in iraq and views us foreign policy as increasingly unilateralist us policies on iraq guantanamo bay and abu ghraib appear to have negatively affected the australian publics perceptions of american power despite this support for the anzus alliance with the united states remains strong among most australians minister for defence joel fitzgibbon announced the commissioning of new defence white paper for australia on february 22 2008 the white paper process will include set of accompanying reviews and community consultative process to underpin the white paper the white paper is not expected until some time in the first half of 2009 such review could have significant implications for australias defense policy and procurement in the future1 the fact that rudd chose to visit the us on his first visit abroad as the opposition leader prior to becoming prime minister signaled that despite potential differences on iraq and climate change he views the us strategic alliance to be of central importance to australia rudd is generally viewed as part of the moderate element within the labor party2 rudd may take very active role in foreign policy given his former career in the department of foreign affairs and trade rudd may also place relatively more emphasis on the united nations than howard did australias external posture during the 2007 election campaign rudd identified maintaining strong alliance with the united states engaging more fully with asia and seeking to play more active role in the united nations as the three pillars of australian foreign 1 cynthis banham rudd to shake up national security the sydney morning herald

australias policy emphasis on chinas military buildup by identifying it as potentially leading to misunderstanding and instability in the region4 some observers of australian foreign policy have speculated that australia increasingly will have difficult time developing robust trade relationship with china while at the same time continuing its close strategic and defense relationship with the united states former australian defence minister brendan nelson traveled to beijing in july 2007 to explain to the chinese that the defence update as well as growing trilateral ties between australia japan and the united states did not mean that australia in any way supports policy of containment of china australia and japan signed joint declaration on security cooperation in march 20075 subtle shifts in australias position relative to china may emerge under rudd he is expected to take direct interest in australias foreign policy toward china as mandarin speaker rudd is well informed on china policy but will be conscious of not wishing to be perceived as too close to the chinese by australian voters or the united states rudd was posted to beijing as diplomat and worked as consultant on china in the private sector according to some observers rudd is seeking balance through strong ties with both the united states and china6 defense policy minister for defence joel fitzgibbon announced in february 2008 that the rudd government would fulfill an election promise and initiate new defence white paper initiating such review is not surprising given the turnover of government from the liberal party to the labor party ministerial advisory panel has been formed to provide external advice consisting of professor ross babbage major general peter abigail ret and dr mark thompson7 there has been long standing debate in australian defense planning circles over the relative emphasis on continental defense of australia and the need to configure australian forces to integrate with key allies in expeditionary operations traditionally with great britain and since the end of world war two the united states despite this debate there has been much continuity in

key analysts have speculated that the new defense white paper will emphasize the defense of australia and the ability to lead regional operations other issues to be addressed may include contributions to coalition operations with the united states particularly in the asiapacific and related interoperability issues efforts to curb terrorism and the evolving geopolitics of northeast asia will also likely receive emphasis in the document8 fitzgibbon has committed the government to maintain an annual real three percent increase in defense funding through 20189 it is estimated that this increase will bring australian defense expenditure up from 2 of gdp to 2610 fitzgibbon has reportedly stated that he believes australia will go ahead with the 16 billion purchase of the joint strike fighter built by lockheed martin in fort worth texas11 bilateral developments with the united states secretary of state rice reaffirmed the close relationship between the united states and australia during her july 2008 visit to perth australia where she noted that australian military contributions in afghanistan are tremendously appreciated and stated there is better friend for the united states than australia12 the close relationship with the rudd government was similarly reaffirmed by defense secretary gates during his february 2008 visit to australia when he stated the bonds of unity that grew from our common heritage and have been strengthened on battlefields around the world are every bit as strong as they have ever been13 the united states and australia signed treaty on defense trade cooperation in september 2007 this treaty is proposed at time when the united states has found few friends willing to work as closely with it in its efforts to contain militant antiwestern islamists

brought increased focus on the environment by the australian electorate the australian commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro has predicted that new weather patterns will mean that parts of eastern australia where most australians live will receive only 40 of their past average annual rainfall by 207015 labors more proactive stance on environmental issues may have helped rudd win the last election one of rudds first actions as prime minister was to sign the kyoto protocol australian minister for climate change and water senator penny wong released the australian governments green paper on carbon pollution reduction scheme on july 16 2008 in releasing the paper minister wong pointed out that australia is one of the worlds hottest and driest places and that australian agriculture and water supplies are threatened by climate change the scheme involves emissions trading with governmentset limits on how much carbon pollution industry can produce the government intends on implementing the scheme in 201016 key challenge for australia in implementing the scheme will be addressing australias use of coal australia has extensive reserves of coal and is thought to have 200year supply approximately 83 of australian power comes from coal this dependence has made australians some of the highest emitters of carbon on per capita basis australian coal exports are expected to increase by third over the next five years this has led some to view australia as exporting its problem even if it achieves its goal of reducing its own emissions by 60 from 2000 levels17 soon after taking office the rudd government indicated that it was considering using naval vessels to track japanese whaling vessels near australian waters in order to collect evidence possibly to make case against japans whaling in the international court of justice the japanese whaling fleet reportedly intended on killing some 1000 whales including 50 humpback whales18 this pressure on whaling issues with japan was departure from the policy orientation of the previous howard government that signed security agreement with japan in 2007 developing positive relations with japan is priority of the rudd government despite differences over whaling 15 john vidal australia suffers worst drought in 1000 years the guardian november 8 2006 16 senator penny wong minister

recent poll only 13 of australians favor nelson as opposed to 68 who favor rudd the next federal elections do not have to be held until 201024 the most dramatic political decision brought about by the

opposition labor party mark latham was criticized by the former howard government in the leadup to the 2004 election for describing president bush in unfavorable terms and for his intent to withdraw australian troops from iraq if elected in response to lathams proposed policy president bush stated that it would be disastrous decision that would dispirit those who love freedom in iraq and embolden the enemies who believe they can shake our will31 many on the left of the labor party also opposed free trade agreement fta with the united states32 the exchange between latham and bush made the anzus alliance an election issue in australia in 2004 former deputy secretary of state richard armitages criticism of labors earlier policy on iraq led former labor prime minister paul keating to urge the united states to stay out of australian elections trilateral ties the united states japan and australia initiated trilateral security dialogue in 2002 china the korean peninsula and the war against terror all provide an impetus for security collaboration between these three partners33 in may 2005 secretary of state rice stated that the dialogue would intensify and be elevated to the ministerial level and would discuss broad range of regional and global security issues34 the announcement came short time after series of antijapanese demonstrations in china marked deterioration in the bilateral relationship between japan and china the announcement also came soon after australia had sent contingent of 450 soldiers to iraq to protect group of japanese engineers based in southern iraq thenprime minister howard stated that working alongside and in partnership with close regional ally and partner such as japan is very important from australias point of view35 commentary speculated that the deployment had as much to do with bolstering ties with japan as it did with iraq36 australias 2007 defence update described japan as australias closest ally in the region37 at the time of the announcement of the elevated trilateral security dialogue there was much speculation that china was to be the central focus of the dialogue it was reported that resurgent china and recalcitrant north

reported that the move could revive chinese concerns about containment by potential strategic competitors australia the united states japan and india formed core group during the relief effort in the wake of the december 2004 tsunami one interpretation of the reason australia and japan would wish to upgrade the trilateral security dialogue is that there is uncertainty over whether chinas rise will generate more prosperous and stable east asia or whether china will seek to use east asian regionalism to exclude the united states which neither australia nor japan would wish to see40 dr rice stated in the leadup to 2006 meeting with australian counterparts that i think all of us in the region particularly those who are longstanding allies have joint responsibility and obligation to try and produce conditions in which the rise of china will be positive force in international politics not negative force some australian strategic commentators were concerned that statements by the secretary of state that portrayed the trilateral security dialogue as directed at containing china may provoke china into more aggressive posture41 many in australia value australias lucrative trade relationship with china even as they look to the united states as australias overwhelmingly most important strategic ally defense australia did much to augment its defense capabilities under howards leadership including 47 real increase in defense spending under his watch42 the 2007 defense budget represents 106 increase over 2006 howard committed his government to 3 annual real increase in

it is now shifting emphasis away from iraq australian defence minister fitzgibbon recently explained australias decision to reduce its military commitment to iraq by stating that its obligations had

south pacific the so called arc of instability52 although australia will leave p3 orion aircraft and an australian frigate in the persian gulf the drawdown of its military commitment marks shift in

identity and asia australias identity as nation is intertwined with its ongoing debate over how it should engage asia former prime minister howard approached the debate by making the point that australia need not choose between its history which is grounded in the west and its geography which locates australia on the periphery of the asiapacific region former labor prime minister paul keating 19911996 moved enthusiastically to engage asia building on his predecessor bob hawkes 19831991 efforts that included the formation of the asia pacific economic cooperation apec forum in 1989 many in australia viewed keatings initiatives as going too far reflecting the fact that many australians sense of identity was not grounded in an asian identity these debates over identity are real to australians although australia is large continent its population of only 21 million people is located relatively close to key population centers of asia including indonesia china and india australias isolation from its key cultural partners and strategic allies in the west has led traditionally to an existential fear of being overwhelmed by asia this has given way in recent years to increasing interest in asia as it is viewed as source of prosperity and longer only as potential threat the rudd governments decision to extend an apology to the aboriginal population of australia demonstrates that the dominant angloceltic identity is increasingly prepared to accommodate nonwhite australian identities increasing asian immigration is also changing the face of australia australias shifting trade patterns have drawn it to asia even as it has not reconciled itself with what this means for its identity the evolving regional and global strategic landscape has led many in australia to begin to reconceptualize the role of geography in australian external and security relations while it remains to be seen how kevin rudds leadership will shape australias engagement with asia the howard administration consistently took the position that australia does not have to choose between its history and its geography meaning that it can engage asia while maintaining close ties to western liberal democracies with similar values62 australia has in the past relied on concepts such as the defense of australia selfreliance within an alliance framework forward 60 geoff hiscock australia

relied to large extent on australias geography andor its historical ties to great and powerful friends and allies australia is now adapting these concepts to integrate regional asiapacific outlook and global perspective in an effort to maximize its national interests this evolving posture is largely the outcome of number of key recent events that have shaped how australia perceives the external environment the most significant of which are the rise of china the asian financial crisis of 1997 and its political impact on the region australias east timor intervention of 1999 and increasing instability in southeast asia and the southwest pacific the war against terror and deployments to afghanistan and iraq and the bali bombings of 2002 and 2005 and the bombing of the australian embassy in jakarta in 2004 many of these events had significant global as well as regional dimensions63 the former howard governments central foreign policy tenet that australia does not have to choose between its history and geography is now viewed by many as undergoing significant test as australias strategic relations may increasingly be at odds with australias trade interests southeast asian terrorism with its linkages to global terrorism and the potential disintegration of unstable states to the north of australia such as the solomon islands east timor and papua new guinea are key security interests for australia that compel australia to play an active role in promoting regional security in tandem with american regional interests although australia does not see conflict between the united states and china as inevitable such conflict would make australias position with china more difficult australias asian engagement although australia has increasingly recognized the need for close relations with asia it has tried not to emphasize these ties at the expense of its western roots and democratic values australian governments have traditionally sought to keep the united states closely involved in east asia and the pacific some asian countries have welcomed the strengthened usaustralian defense relationship but others notably china have been less supportive beijing strategists are thought by some to be concerned that strengthening of the us alliances with australia and japan may be aimed at containing china some have argued that greater australian support of the united states may undermine australias efforts to engage asia at deeper level64 rudds asiapacific community concept in june 2008 prime minister rudd put forward an inclusive vision for an asiapacific community that would include the united states china japan india and indonesia as well as other regional states as way of shaping the evolving regional architecture of asia the group 63 see michael

proposal was not overly well received in southeast asia and malaysia came out against the concept67 it appeared that india gave rudd cautious support for the concept68 rudds proposal now joins other proposed asian architectures including the east asia summit apec association of southeast asian nations asean plus three and the asean regional forum rudds concept differs from these most significantly in that it includes the united states and india and would address political and security issues as well as economic issues69 indonesia indonesias geographic proximity and size make good relations with jakarta key foreign policy priority for australia while australias relationship with indonesia has at times been troubled as was the case as result of indonesians displeasure over australias role in east timors independence relations are at present positive the strategic aspect of the relationship is defined by the 2006 lombok treaty as well as recently renewed memorandum of

india in 2007 in this way some in asia view australia under rudd as more independent of the united states than it was under howard79 one of the most significant changes in australias external relations and one with potential implications for the bilateral relationship with the united states is australias growing relationship with china australias trade with china has more than tripled over

by some in washington83 while it remains to be seen where rudd will take australias china policy it may have much continuity with the previous governments approach the government of former prime minister howard favored policy of engagement with china his foreign minister alexander downer stated that policy of containment of china would be very big mistake this view reflects concern in australia that more hawkish elements of the us security community may seek shift of us policy away from pragmatic constructive engagement to more confrontational position toward china84 other areas of policy departure with the united states include australias april 2006 agreement to sell uranium to china and canberras reluctance to condemn the european unions move to lift its arms embargo of china

treaty to be included in the regional grouping australia had not wanted to sign the treaty which binds members to policy of noninterference and nonaggression because of concerns that it might
