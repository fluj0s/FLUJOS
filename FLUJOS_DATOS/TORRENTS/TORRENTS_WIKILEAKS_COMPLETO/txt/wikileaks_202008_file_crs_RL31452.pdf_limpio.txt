summary since 1994 nine bills have been introduced to allow dietary supplements to be purchased with food stamp benefits in the 107th congress provision in the senate version of the farm bill would have added vitamin and mineral supplements to the items that can be purchased with food stamps the provision also would have required 2year study to determine the impact of this change on the programs administration and participan ts the provision was not adopted in the conference on the farm bill with the house the use of dietary supplements is ofte n promoted as solution to number of nutrition problems including general dietary patterns and nutrient intakes malnutrition in the elderly the nutritiona l needs in pregnant women poor nutrient intakes in lowincome children the iron n eeds of infants after 6 months and the prevention of disease although there are situations where the use of vitamin and mineral supplements can improve the health of certain individuals the consumption of conventional foods conti nues to be the preferred thod to improve nutritional and health status under normal circum stances individuals need the protein carbohydrate fat and calories as well as vitamins and minerals that food provides current us dietary guidelines continue to suggest that consumption of these nutrients in conventional foods is the preferred form of intake the us department of agriculture usda has long held that vitamin and mineral products serve as supplements to f ood and therefore are not part of the food stamp program which was designed to pr ovide nourishment in the form of food 1999 usda congressionallymandate d report indicated that on balance food is the preferred way for nutrients to be consume d the report addressed number of issues lowincome populations might face if f ood stamps were used to purchase vitamin and mineral supplements congress faces several issues in cons idering this dietary supplement proposal in the future although some lowinco households could surely benefit from appropriate use of vitamin and mineral supplements llowing dietary supplements to be purchased with food stamps represen ts fundamental change in the programs original intent which was to provide additional resources to purchase food currently food stamp recipients have minimum amount of bene fits with which to buy foods needed for an adequate diet nd none of the bills proposed so far would have provided any additional moneys to purchase dietar supplements individuals need the calories macronutrients vita mins and minerals th at conventional foods provide while dietary supplements provide only vitamins and minerals without any food value the provision allowed only fo r the purchase of vitamins and minerals yet at practical level these products are difficult to separate from those containing herbs and botanicals certain administrative issues also would need to be resolved some of which would have been addre ssed by the study that would have

supplements of vitamins and minerals this provision wa s dropped in conference with the house this report examines the dietary supplem ent provisions of th 2002 senatepassed farm bill relevant nutrition issues and specific issues regarding the purchase of supplements with food stamps bills introdu ced since 1994 since 1994 nine bills have been introdu ced that would allow food stamps to be used to purchase dietar supplements of vitamins and minerals the first bill hr 5219 was introduced in the 103rd congress by congressman emerson during the 104th congress mr emerson introduced two bills hr 236 and hr 1997 which contained the dietary suppl ement provision the house committee on agriculture held hearing and an amended bill was reported by voice vote and sent to the full committee for further considera tion however the supplement provision received unfavorable comment from usda nd further action was taken in the same congress senators mcconnell and hatch introduced similar language in s 1133 and s1143 respectively in the 106th congress companion bills were introduced as hr 3304 by representativ burton and s 1307 by senator harkin but they received action the dietary supplement language has been essentially identical in all the bills introduced in past congresses most b ills in the 103rd106th congresses consisted of single provision that would have am ended section 3 of the food stamp act of 1977 by adding nutritional supplements of vitamins minerals or vitamins and minerals to the list of items that could be purchased with food stamps the bill introduced by senator hatch in the 104th congress s 1143 would have added dietary supplements as they are defined under the provi sions of the federal food drug and cosmetic act to the items allowed on the purchase list the manner in which these proposals use the term dietary supplement is significant nutritional supplements of vitamins minerals or combin ations are at least theoretically limited to only nutrients classified as vitamins or minerals in contrast the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994 pl 103417 which amended the federal food drug and cosme tic act defined the term dietary supplement to include product other than tobacco added to the total diet that contains at least one of the following ingredients vitami n mineral herb or botanical amino acid another

congress the provision passed by the senate to allow dietary supplements to be purchased with food st amps as part of food stamp program fsp reauthorization in the farm bill was or iginally introduced as s 1628 by senator harkin the language was later adopted into the farm bill the agriculture conservation and rural enhancement act s 1731 and passed by the senate on february 13 2002 comparable language re garding supplements was not included in the housepassed version of the bill so the supplement provision had to be addressed in conference the vitamin and mineral supplements provision was not adopted by the housesenate conferees in the final farm bill that passed both chambers in may 2002 the senatepassed provisi on differed from the previously introduced language by specifying that products allowed to be purchased with food stamps include dietary supplements that provide exclusively one or more vitamins or minerals it also required that an impact study be undertaken under contract be tween the secretary of agriculture and scientific organiza tion to examine and report on the technical issues economic impacts and health effects associated with allowing individuals to use food stamp benefits to purchase vitamin mineral supplements the study which was to be completed within 2 years at an authorized appropriation level of 3 million was to have addressed the following issues the extent to which problems arise in the purchase of the supplements with electronic benefit transfer cards the extent of difficulties in distinguis hing vitaminmineral supplements from herbal

nutritional inadequacies since their total caloric intakes tend to be low at time when certain nutrient needs are higher due to menstrual losses and increased re quirements during preg nancy and

to an iom report 50 of all pregnancies in the united states were unintended at the time of conception defined as mistimed or an unwanted pregnancy8 in 1991 the public health service p hs recommended that all women of childbearing age who are capable of b ecoming pregnant should consume 04 mg of folic acid per day for the purpose of reducing their risk of ntds9 however phs cautioned that because the effects of high folic acid intakes are not well known and complications in diagnosing vitamin b12 deficiency may occur women should be careful that their total folate intake is less than one milligram per day according to phs the possibility of reducing the number of cases of ntds in the united states by 50 through daily consumption of 04 mg of folic acid is an important opportunity phs

vitamins and minerals and disease prevention scientific evidence continues to support the position of dietar supplement advocates that increasing consumption of specific nutrients over an extended period of time may offer some protection against certain diseases or conditions such as osteoporosis cataracts cancer and heart disease since 1980 diet ary recommendations for the general public have been published by number of federa l agencies private health organizations and consumer groups all dietary guidance materials have been designed to provide consumers with information on how to lect foods that are more healthful however the research data which suppor t these recommendations primarily indicate that nutrients in the context of foods in the total diet have greater impact on an individuals health the scientific evidence behind these recommendations clearly indicates that foods rather than supplements are the pref erred source of the nutrients needed to protect against such chroni c diseases as cancer heart disease and osteoporosis17 the most recent version of the dietary guidelines for americans suggests that there may be situations in which certain individuals need

with food stamps for years the department of agriculture has held the view that vitamin and mineral supplements are merely therap eutic agents and as such should not be eligible for purchase with food

instruction 230g11985 states vitamins and minerals vitamins and minerals which are marketed in various forms such as tablets capsules powde rs and liquids serve as supplements to food and food pr oducts rather than as foods and therefore are not eligible for purchase with food coupons vitamins and minerals are also present in natural foodstuffs and certain vitamins and minerals have been determined to be essential to nutrition however because these essential vitamins and minerals occur naturally in foods good diet will include variety of foods that together will supply all nutrients needed therefor nutritionally adequate diet may be obtained without the use of specially formulated vitamin and mineral preparations and other specially formul ated therapeutic products since these products serve as deficiency correctors or therapeutic agents to supplement diets deficient in essential nutrition rather th an as foods they are not eligible for purchase with food coupons benefits

terms of the quality of the diets age and gender are more indicative children have higher nutrient intakes than the general population while fe males of childbearing age pregnant and lactating females and the elderly ve nutrient intakes below th recommended levels for more nutrients than the general population data on dietary supplement use from nati onal surveys indicate that somewhere between 41 and 48 of the general us popul ation report that they take some type of vitamin andor mineral products the usda report found that higher income individuals are more likely than lowincome individuals to report the use of supplements and among lowincome persons food stamp participants are less likely than nonparticipants to use supplemen ts information on the use of dietary supplements by household is limited although there is general sc ientific consensus that di etary patterns and nutrient intakes can dramatically ffect health and general understanding about the makeup of healthy diet the usda report confirms that the link between diet and chronic degenerative disease is complex and not yet well defined while some research supports the use of dietar supplements in certain circumstances the relative effectiveness of improved diet fortifie d foods and supplement use varies across nutrients and s ubpopulati on groups the report also noted that current scientific knowledge was particular ly limited on the contribution some nonnutrient components of food make in reducing disease the differe nces in the bioavailability of nutrients in food compared to supplem ents the nutrient levels that represent deficient and excessive intakes for certa in nutrients and subpopulation groups and the important interactions between different nutrient combinations the average cost of commercially ava ilable vitamin and mineral supplements per tablet typically falls below 10 cents it is generally expected that households with low income should be responsible for tion of their food costs and it also has been argued that these households have incomes sufficient to afford the cost of supplements on their own according to th usda report allowing individuals to use food stamps to buy supplements w ithout also increasing total household resources is unlikely to lead to greater spending on supplements and food or to any improvement in their hea lth and nutritional status httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31452crs10 the usda report also identified several administrative concerns for the fsp if benefits were used to purchase supplem ents for example the department would need to define which supplements are elig ible for purchase with food stamp benefits deal with the challenges of monitoring and enforcement and determine whether the existing thrifty food plan adequately define s healthful diet in addition consumer information would have to be provided so that food stamp recipients would know which dietary supplements to purchase in order to meet their individual needs and receive good value under current law usda is respons ible for the food stamp program while the food and drug administration is the ag ency responsible for the regulation of vitamin and

which these provisions have been introduced congressional sponsors have repeatedly he ld the view that food stamp recipients should be afforded greater flexibility to balance their diets by permitting food stamp purchases of vitamin and mineral supplements further they have stated that while it is possible to receive optimum levels of nutrients through careful selection of foods most people do not make these choi ces and enactment of the proposal could improve the nutrition and health of segmen t of society that frequently falls below adequate levels of nutrien t consumption since millions of americans take vitamin and mineral supplements regularly to assure that they r eceive appropriate levels of these essential nutrients sponsors believe that food stamp recipients should be afforded the same opportunity freedom of choice and the incons istency of allowing food stamps to be used for nonnutriti ous or minimally nutritious foods while excluding the purchase of nutritional suppl ements

supplements for the first time this expanded use of f sp benefits would have been fundamental departure from the original intent of the fsp which was designed to deliver foods to lowincome individuals by increasin g their food purchasing power however supplementing wellbalanced meal with vitamin and mineral products was likely never envisioned by the original sponsors of the food stamp act although dietary supplements can be source of essential nutri ents to aid in the prevention of disease and promotion of health they cannot be surrogate for the alleviation of hunger which requires sufficient calories carbohy drate protein and fat the fsp was designed to address food security by provi ding resources to enhance access to these macronutrients and their associated calories vitamins and minerals in the debate over the use of food stam ps for dietary suppl ements fundamental issue is the adequacy of the benefits currently provided participants are provided with benefit package that is intended to enable them to obtain nutritious diet through the purchase of lowcost foods however beneficiaries frequently report running out of food stamp bene fits before the end of the month in these situations they have to make choices among the competing demands on their limited resources ie utilities housing health care and food or resort to emergency feeding services the model food plans on which benef its are determined are reviewed periodically to be sure that they provide fsp participants with an adequate diet in the current economic environment the food plans are criticized regularly by hunger advocates as inadequate to meet fsp participants nutritional needs over the long period of time that they may be in the pr ogram the latest revisions in 1999 sought to bring the thrifty food

if the dietary supplements provide 100 of the rdas national nutrient standards for vitamins and minerals on daily basis consumption of such supplement in addition to whatever foods are consumed would assure that those who are more likely to be at nutritional risk would have adequate amounts of essential nutrients however many vitamin andor mineral preparations contain only one or two nutrients and do not provide for balanced in take of all the essential nutrients the nutrients in these products frequently are in megadoses ie the amount per tablet is considerably more than the national intake
