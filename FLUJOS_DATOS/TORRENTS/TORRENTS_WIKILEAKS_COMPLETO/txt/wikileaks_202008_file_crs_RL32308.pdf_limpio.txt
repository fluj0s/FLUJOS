transportation treasury and independent agencies appropriations bill was passed as division h of pl 108 447 an omnibus appropriations bill and was signed into law on december 8 2004 the bill provides 906 billion for transportation treasury and independent agencies however the bill also includes an acrosstheboard rescission of 080 which will reduce the transportation treasury and independent agencies f unding by approximately 725 million this will make the final figure 899 billion slightly less than fy2004s 903 billion but more than the administrations request for fy2005 for fy2005 the administration requested 889 billion for the departments of transportation and the treasury the executive office of the president and variety of independent agencies this was 16 billion 17 less than the amount enacted for fy2004 on september 22 2004 the house of re presentatives passed hr 5025 the transportation treasury nd independent agencies ppropriations act 2005 the committee on appropriations had recomme nded 899 billion an increase of 09 billion over the presidents reque st and 495 million below the fy 2004 level during the house floor debate on the bill sections of the bill appropriating funds for unauthorized programs were struck since at the time of the floor debate the surface transportation programs were not authorized for fy2005 the result was that funding for federal highway highway safety and transit programs was eliminated as was funding for amtrak and the airport improveme nt program in the end the house cut some 47 billion in transportation funding from the 899 billion bill reported by the committee the appropriation subcommittee chairman assured members that this funding would be restored in conference fo r this reason the tables in this bill do not reflect these cuts the house bill included several provisions similar to provisions that were included in the fy2004 house bill and that proved cont roversial these included setting the fy2005 fede ral civilian pay increase at the same level the administration requested for the military 35 for fy2005 limits on the outsourcing of government work nd loosening of sanctions on cuba on september 15 2004 the senate co mmittee on appropriations reported out s 2806 their fy2005 transportation treasury and general government appropriations bill the committee recommended 906 billion in funding and included provisions aligning the fy2005 federa l civilian pay increase with that of the military and limiting outsourcing of government work this full senate never acted on this bill the conferees dropped the provisions limitin g outsourcing of government work and relaxing restrictions on cuba final passage of the bill was delayed to allow congress to delete provision that w ould have given

appropriations act during conf erence the provision intended to aid oversight over the internal revenue service would have given appropriators and their staff access to the tax returns of indi viduals

provision and the resolution was approve d on december 6 2004 the bill was then sent to the president and was signed into law on december 8 2004 the bill provides 906 billion for the departments of

appropriations except senate figures are from the budget authority table in srept 108342 b ecause of differing treatment of offsets the totals will not always match the administrations totals the figures within this table may differ slightly from those in the text due to supplemental appropriations rescissions and other funding actions columns may not add due to rounding or exclusion of smaller program lineitems because the transportation appropriations subcomm ittee chairman assured members that the cuts made to transportation programs on the floor would be restored in conference this table shows the figures recommended by the committee on appropriations these figures reflect the 059 acrosstheboard rescission included in pl 108199 b these figures do not reflect the 080 acrosstheboard rescission in pl 108447 c these amounts are in addition to the 50 million annua l authorization for the essential air service program thus the total fy2004 and fy2005 funding w ould be 102 million 50 million 52 million d in addition to amtraks fy2004 appropriation congress postponed amtraks repayment of 100 million loan from the dot for fy2005 congress required amtrak to repay 20 of the loan during fy2005 the figures do not reflect 14 million in permanent appropriations therefore the total resources for rspa for fy2004 may be seen as 126 million and for fy2005 131 million f rescissions of unobligated previous years contract authority have been subtracted from this total b ecause rescissions of prior years contract authority have impact on the budgetary resources

provides the faa with 1383 billion this is slightly less than the bush admin istration request for fy2005 which was 1396 billion the conference version of the appr opriations bill is very close to the fy2004 level of funding of 1388 billion the propos is essentially devoid of major new initiatives but contains some program ad justments and shifts significant amount of funding 393 million from the facilities nd equipment fe program to the operations and maintena nce om program the house proposal for total faa funding was 143 billion not including rescission of 758 million of prior year f unds depending upon how this rescission is treated the house number was slightly above or slightly below the administration request th bill provided for general fund contribution to om programs of 17 billion which was slightly below the administrations request for this source of funding but was well below th fy2004 level during floor debate the general fund contribution level was ame nded to level of approximately 27 billion and the trust fund contribution was reduced accordingly the senate committee on ppropriations proposed an overall faa funding level of 139 billion which is roughly the same level as the administration request the bill included rescissi on of 265 million the bill pr oposed major programmatic changes or initiatives the bill accepted the administrations recommendation to reduce fe funding and increase om funding accordingly the general fund contribution to om was set at slightly more than 25 billion the vast majority of faa funding is provided from the airport and airway trust fund only om funding uses mix of trust fund and treasury general fund monies in fy2002 treasury genera l fund contribution of 11 billion was provided for om funding while the ge neral fund contribution for fy2002 was on the low side historically the fy2003 amount returned to higher contribution level of 34 billion the fy2004 act raised the general fund contribution to 45 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32308crs8 3 general fund appropriations have varied substantially both in dollar terms and as percentage of faa appropriations as whole from year to year over the last 12 years the share has ranged from 0 to 47 see table 1 in crs report rs20177 airport and airway trust fund issues in the 106th congress by john w fischerthe fy2005 bill however reduces the ge neral fund contribution to 28 billion which is more in line with the historical contribution level hist orically this funding split has been an important part of the nnual faa budget debate the rationale behind the general fund contribution has been that the public at large realizes some benefit from aviation whether it uses the system or not3 operations and ma intenance om for fy2005 the administration proposed 78 billion in total spending this compares with spending level of 75 billion in the fy2004 act the majority of f unding in this category is for the salaries of faa personnel engaged in air traffic control certification and safetyrelated activities much of the increased funding called for in the fy2005 request is for increased air traffic control system costs and safetyrelated activities the house bill included 77 billion for this function while the senate bill c ontained almost 78 billion the conference bill at 771 billion is more in line with the house bill one issue getting attention in this years appropriations bills is the question of hiring additional air traffic controllers there is concern that many of the current controllers who were hired after the air traffic controllers strike of 1981 are now rapidly approaching retirement age contro ller union representatives contend that the faa is not taking sufficient action to mitigate against potential future staff shortages the house bill tries to remedy this situation by providing an additional 9 million to hire and train new controllers and an additional 4 million to hire and train new controller supervisors the senate bill also addresses this issue and provides an additional 10 million to hire and train new controllers the conference report includes provisions that accommodate new hiring and training especially for supervisors facilities and equipment fe the administration request for fe was 25 billion 393 million below the fy2004 enacted figure fe funding is used primarily for capital investment in air traffic control and safety the bush administration request would provide less for some safe ty and capacity technology and hardware replacement initiatives than in fy2004 this is potentially the most controversial aspect of the administra tions faa proposal both the house and senate bills however adopted the adminis trations requested level of 25 billion and the conference re port does the same research engineering and development red under the administration proposal this program would have been subject to small cut to 117 million from the 1194 million in the fy2004 act most red activity is focused on safetyair traffic control activities significant new initiatives were proposed in the bush administration faa budget the house bill accepts the administrations requested level but makes some changes in the research projects to be carried out during fy2005 the senate bill also makes some project changeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32308crs9 and increases overall funding for red to 1294 million the conference bill at 1299 million is slightly more generous than any of the bills discussed above essential air service eas the eas program is operated through the office of the secretary of transportati on ost and receives its funding from designated user fees collected from overflig hts of united states territory by foreign aircraft eas has had an nnual authorized funding vel of 50 million for the last several years the overflight funding m echanism however has never provided this much annual funding so dditional funding has been provided from other sources the eas program continues to enjo significant support in congress the fy2004 act provided 102 million for eas 50 million from its regular authorization and 52 million in additional funds from the aviation trust fund the act does not however rely on the overflight fee as its principal funding mechanism during the fy2004 debate congress rejected the bush administrations calls to reduce the size of the eas program by half and require local contribution at each airport receiving eas service in its fy2005 request the administration was once again proposing that the size of the eas program be reduced capping the pr ogram at the 50 million level the administration was also proposing that there be local contribution in its bill the house co mmittee on appropriations reject ed the administrations proposal instead it provided 1017 milli on for fy 2005 of this amount 517 million was made available from the airpor t and airway trust fund with 14 million to come from prior year carry over f unds and the remaining 36 million to come from other funds available to the faa this is essentially the same level of funding as that provided in fy2004 the house b ill also includes provision that prohibits implementation of the local participation program title v section 525 during floor consideration the 517 million to be made available from the trust fund was removed on point of order committee lead ership expected that these funds would be restored in conference the senate committee on appropriations so rejected the administrations funding request the committee allowed 102 million in total eas spending for fy2005 of this total 52 million was direct appropriation and 50 million was from overflight fees the committee did not specifically reject the local participation program rather it chose not to allow fo r its funding the conference bill accepts the senate funding arrangement and preclude s the administration from pursuing the local match provision

to boost enforcement efforts and eventually collect an additional 5 billion per year in revenue once the new employees received proper training16 under hr 5025 as passed by the h ouse in september 2004 the irs would receive 10291 billion in funding in fy2005 or 1073 million more than in fy2004 but 3825 million less than the amount requested by the bush administration the measure would funnel

administering the health in surance tax credit about 75 of the difference between the budget recommended in the bill and the administrations requested budget was due to lower reco mmended funding for

taxpayer clinics and 41 million on the ta x counseling program for the elderly some of the amendments to hr 5025 pproved during the floor debate in the house would affect irs operations in fy2005 one would prevent the irs from using any appropriated funds to plan enter into or impleme nt contracts for collection of delinquent individual income tax bt involving the irs and private debt collectors as result of the recently enacted american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 the irs has the authority to hire private debt collectors under certain conditions for the purpose of collecting ove rdue

barring age discrimination under s 2806 as reported by the nate appropriations committee but not considered by the full senate irs ope rations would be funded at 10253 billion in fy2005 or 688 million more than the fy2004 budget but 38 million less than the amount recommended in hr 5025 and 4211 million less than the amount requested by the bush administration the bill would allocate 4107 billion for processing assistance nd management of which 41 million would go to the tax counseling program for the elderly and 70 million to lowincome taxpayer clinics 4519 billion for tax law enforcement 1606 billion for information systems 125 million for business systems modernizati on and 348 million for administering the health insurance tax credit in ddition the bill would rescind 140 million in unobligated balances in the account for busin ess systems modernization in its report on s 2806 the appropriations committee expr essed the concern that the irs has consistently used the majority of its ne w compliance funding for purposes other than those that congress intended in order to insure that the agency uses most of the funding it receives for tax law enforcem ent in fy2005 for programs intended to improve compliance among highincome indi viduals and large corporations the bill would restrict the irss ability to tran sfer funds from the tax law enforcement account to 3 of the appropr

omnibus appropriations bill hr 4818 in separate votes on november 20 2004 under the measure the irs would receive total of 10319 billion or 1341 million more than in fy2004 but 3558 million less than the amount requested by the bush administration more than 46 of this latter difference is due to reduced levels of spending on tax law enforcem ent the measure appropriates 4089 billion for processing

business systems modernization 1827 million below fy2004 and 348 million for administering the health insurance tax credit 47 million above fy2004 in addition hr 4818 specifies that the irs spend 41 million of the funds appropriated for processing assistance and management on tax counseling for the elderly and 80 million on wincome taxpayer clinics and that the irs commissioner submit quarterly

to provide report detailing its blueprint and mast er plan for realizing substantive reductions in regulatory burdens on industries which if achieved will result in true savings regardless of system efficiencies the report should identify regulatory areas with the greatest time cost and volume burden and note how ombs blueprint and master plan addre sses these areas for substantive reduction the committee recommends that omb first direct its reduction efforts at regulations where the greatest gain can be achieved with the least effort the committee considers paperwork reduction to be especially crucial in the area of health care the committee strongly encourages omb to give priority attention to the health care area for reducing the paperwork burden on hospitals and physicians and their staffs omb is urged to convene and coordinate the governmentwide task force that includes industry representatives to examine the original intent of the underlying laws and determine where

concurrence with the report and act accordingly the co mmittee report accompanying the senate bill explains the need for these provisions re lated to omb review of water resource projects according to the committee it is aware that numerous water resource project s that have been fully vetted through the lengthy water resource planning process established by the executive branch are being held up by the omb for tec hnical reviews or other policy questions that are unrelated to budgetary matters the committee has found that omb does not have the proper staffing or expe rtise to make these types of decisions in addition the committee is deeply concerned that water resource matters are being unnecessarily delayed for extended periods of time sometimes without further action ever being taken because of such obstinacy45 the committee report accompanying the nate bill addresse s several issues related to ombs funding as follows om bs request to transfer funding for the federal accounting standards advisory board fasab and the joint financial management improveme nt program jfmip to the department of the treasury is denied according to the committee the justification for consolidating ombs annual payments to fasab and jfmip in the treasury department is exceptionally weak and rests on the desire to include the expense in the organiza tion where the services are contracted rather than in the organization that initiates the expense this proposal is inconsistent with the manner in which similar payments are treated in other agencies budgets and leaves the impressi on that the transfer of these payments is being requested to mask the actual amount of resources for fiscal year 2005 the recommendation assumes an adjustment of 63900046 as for the core enterprise services

nnual unified congressional budget it is also considered part of the discreti onary budget funding for the dot budget is derived from number of sources the ma jority of funding comes from dedicated transportation trust funds th remainder of dot funding is from federal treasury general funds the transportation trust f unds include the highway trust fund which contains two accounts the highway trust account and the transit account the airport and airway trust fund and the inland wa terways trust fund all of these accounts derive their respective funding fro m specific excise and other taxes in fy2002 trust funds accounted for well over twothirds of total federal transportation spending together highway and transit funding constitute the largest component of dot appropriations most highway and transit programs are funded with contract authority derived by the li nk to the highway trust fund this is very significant from budgeting standpoint c ontract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into cont ract to pay for pr oject at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc authorized funds are automatically made available at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriati ons legislation although ppropriations are required to make outlays at some future da to cover these obligations where most federal programs require new budget authority as part of the annual appropriations process tr ansportation appropriators are faced with the opposite situation that is the authority to spend for the largest programs under their control already exists and the mechanism to oblig ate funds for these programs also is in place transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 during the 105th and 106th congresses major legislation changed the relationships between the largest transpor tation trust funds nd the federal budget the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 pl 105178 linked annual spending for highway programs di rectly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund in addition core high way and mass transit program funding was given special status in the discretionary tion of the federal budget by virtue of the creation of two new budget categories the act thereby created virtual firewall around highway and transit spending progra ms the funding guarantees were set up in way that makes it difficult for funding vels to be altered as part of the annual budgetappropriations pr ocess additional highway f unds can be provided annually by mechanism called revenue aligne d budget authority raba raba funds accrue to the trust fund as result of increased trust fund revenues for fy2003 however the raba adjustment if it d been applied during the

was not included in the fy2004 appropriations calculations tea21 changed the role of the hous and senate appr opriations and budget committees in determining annua l spending levels for high way and transit programs the appropriations committees are precluded from their former role of setting an annual level of obliga tions these were established by tea21 and are adjusted by an annual raba computation in addition it appears that tea21 precludes at least in part the house and senate appropriations committees from exercising what some members view as their once traditional op tion of changing spending levels for specific core programs or projects in the fy2000 appropriations act the appropriators took some tent ative steps to regain some of their discretion over highway spending the fy2000 act called for the redistribution of some funds among programs and added two significant spending projects in the fy2001 appropriations act the appropria tors continued in this vein by adding funds for large numbers of earmarked projects further the fy2001 act called for redirection of limited amount of funding betw een programs and include s significant additional funding for some tea21 programs this trend continued and even accelerated in the fy2002 act as appropriators made major redistributi ons of raba funds and in some instances transferred raba funds to agencies that are not eligible for raba funding under tea21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32308crs93 appendix 3 transportation budget terminology transportation budgeting uses confusing lexicon for those unfamiliar with the process of budget authority and contract authority the latter form of budget authority contract authority provides obligational authority for the funding of trust fundfinanced programs such as the federa laid highway program prior to tea21 changes in spending in the annual tr ansportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process by combining changes in budgetcontract authority and placing limitations on obligations the principal function of the limitation on obligations is to control ou tlays in manner that corresponds to congressional budget agreements contract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into contract to pay for project at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc which tea21 amended authorized f unds are automatically made available to the states at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriations legisl ation appropriations are re quired to make outlays at some future date to cover these obligations tea21 greatly limited the role of the appropriations process in core highwa and transit programs because the act enumerated the limitation on obligations level for the period fy1999 through fy2003 in the statute highway and transit grant programs work on reimbursable basis states pay for projects up front and federal payments are made to them only when work is completed and vouchers are presented months or even years after the project has begun work in progress is represented in the trust fund as obligat ed funds and although they are considered used and remain as commitments against the trust fund balances they are not subtracted from balances trust fund balances therefore appear high in part because funds sufficient to cover actual and expected future commitments must remain available both the highway and transit accounts ve substantial shor t and longterm commitments these include payments that will be made in the current fiscal year as projects are completed and to much greater extent outstanding obligations to be made at some unspecified future date additionally there are unobligated amounts that are still dedicated to highway and transit projects but have not been committed to specific projects two terms are associated with the distribu tion of contract authority funds to the states and to particular prog rams the first of these apportionments refers to funds distributed to the states for formula driven programs for example all national highway system nhs funds are apportioned to the states allocated funds are funds distributed on an administrative ba sis typically to programs under direct federal control for example federal nds highway program monies are allocated the allocation can be to another federal agency to state to an indian tribe or to some other governmental entity these terms do not refer to the federal budget process but often provide frame of reference for high way program recipients who may assume albeit incorrectly that state apportionment is part of the federal budget per
