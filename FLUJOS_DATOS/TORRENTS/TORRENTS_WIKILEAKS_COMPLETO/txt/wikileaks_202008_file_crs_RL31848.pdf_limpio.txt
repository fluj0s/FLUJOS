technology control regime mtcr and international code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation icoc background and issues for congress summary on november 25 2002 ninetytwo count ries including the united states signed draft internati onal code of conduc t icoc intended to control the proliferation of ballistic missiles th is code of conduct joins the 1987 ssile technology control regime mtcr as the primary means by which the international community atte mpts to regulate missile proliferation both are arrangements not treaties requiring volunt ary application of st andards and measures by participating countries while the mtcr has been credited with number of successes over the years critics point out that it lacks treaty status and only addresses the supply side of the missile prolifera tion equation the icoc was developed primarily to focus on the demand aspect of pr oliferation but great deal of work may lie ahead for the drafters and signatories of the icoc in order to craft the code into useful nonproliferation tool the mtcr has been credited by many analysts with slowing or impeding missile proliferation and preventing many countries from advancing beyond scud based missile technology the icoc created by mtcr members is intended to employ confidence building measures cb ms as means to promote transparency and hopefully decrease the demand for ballis tic missiles among veloping nations the existence of two multilate ral missile nonproliferation rrangements leads to the possibility of potential synergies but also could result in conflicts that could reduce the overall effectiveness of the arrangements the bush administration cites both th mtcr and icoc in the 2002 national strategy to combat weapons of mass struction while us commitment to the mtcr is acknowledged by the internationa l community many countries feel there is less us commitment to the icoc the united states sees useful roles for both arrangements in dealing with missile proliferation but appears to place great deal more emphasis on the mtcr than the icoc both arrangements are administered through the interagency process with the us state department assuming lead ag ency responsibilities in both cases while laws related to the us involvement in the icoc currently exist there are number of key pieces of legislation dealing with the mtcr there are several proposals that mig ht be put before congress which proponents believe could potentially improve the efficacy of both the mtcr and icoc and increase their usefulness as means of addressing the globa l issue of

regime c onsists of guidelines and an associated annex and each member country honors their commitment to th regime by the application of their nations export control laws and regulations the mtcr guidelines call on each of the member countries to exercise restrain t when considering transfers of equipment or technology that would provide or help recipient country build missile capable of delivering 500 kilogram kg 1100 pound warhead to range of 300 kilometers km 186 miles or more the 500 kg weight threshold was intended to limit transfers of missiles that could carry relatively cr ude

intended to be used for the delivery of weapons of mass destruction wmd with the 1993 addition some missiles with warh eads weighing less than 500 kg now fall under mtcr guidelines the mtcr anne x

respectively current listing of mtcr members is at table 1 international code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation the icoc like the mtcr is not tr eaty but instead set of fundamental behavioral norms and framework for coope ration to address ssile proliferation the draft code signed on november 25 2002 consists of approx imately 3 pages of written text and provides fairly basic statement of the codes principles general measures and organizational aspects the icoc urges countries to exercise maximum possible restraint in the testing and deployment of wmdcapable

also to reduce their holdings of these systems if possible the code also calls for vigilance in assisting countri with their space launch vehicle slv programs recognizing that such programs can serve as surrogate ballistic missile programs the icoc encourages cooperation between subscribing states that choose to eliminate their ballistic missile and or slv programs the code aspires to achieve its goals by means of confidence building measures cbms specifically designed to promote transparency in this regard th code calls upon subscr ibers to make annual declarations on their national ballistic missile policies including relevant information on systems and test and unch sites furthermore the icoc requests that subscribers provide annual in formation on the types and num bers of ballistic missiles launched during the preceding year space unch vehicles are also addressed in similar manner with the exception that the code asks that subscribers voluntarily invite international observers to their sl v landbased launch and test sites finally under cbms the icoc encourages bilatera l or regional transparency measures from an organizational perspective the draft code calls for regular meetings annual or as required to review define and further develop the code the development of mechanism to exchange notifications and other information and to resolve questions is also encouraged like the mtcr the icoc does not call for the formation of standing international body to administer the code because the hague the netherlands was the scene for much of the codes developmental work and also the location of its initial signing the icoc is also sometimes referred to as the hague code of conduct against ballistic missile prolifera tion hcc current listing of icoc members is at table 2 and the draft icoc is at table 3 histories of the arrangements missile technology control regime the origins of mtcr can be traced back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when the soviet union transferre d several scudbs 280 km ra nge to number of arab countries during its later stages the carter administrati on began to publically acknowledge the threat posed by the re gional proliferation of nuclearcapable missiles and also began to realize that the problem extended far beyond the soviet unions provision of scudbs to arab stat industrialized countries such as france italy west germany the united ki ngdom and the us were providing dual use technology to include components manuf acturing technology and scientific and engineering expertise to num ber of potential proliferants4 the reagan administration took steps to address th problem in its november 1982 national security decision directive 70 nsdd70 wh ich instructed us agencies to initiate appropriate measures to velop both

missiles to arab countries which serv ed to further heighten regional tensions between 1989 and 1993 number of other reve lations about pro liferation involving china pakistan israel south africa north korea iran syria and india led the first bush administration and congress to pus h for reforms to the mtcr designed to bring more countries into the mtcr as well as to enhance relevant export controls in january 1993 the regimes technical wo rking group revised the guidelines and annex to include export controls for any systems capable of delivering any payload to range of 300 kms or any system of any range or payload intended to deliver wmds9 in the early 1990s the united states bega n to reform its export control system to better address the new strate gic situation indicative of the need to reform was the commerce departments doc legal inability to restrict the export of dualuse items not included in the mtcr annex but which still had missile proliferation applications dr gary milhollin director of the wisconsin project on nuclear arms control testified to the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs that over 40 us companies had obtained more than 100 export licenses to export sensitive dualuse nuclear and missile related technologies to iraq10 to resolve this and other export issues the first bush administration enacted the enhanced proliferation control initiative epci in december 1990 the epci required us companies to obtain licenses for any export destined for publicallylisted company ministry project or other entity engaged in missile or wmd proliferation activities11 the administration also assisted italy and germany in improving their export control systems after both countri were rebuked for exporting prohibited items to iraq and argentina 12 significant improvement was made to the regime in 1994 when the mtcr partners agreed to undercut policy on license denialshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31848crs5 13 bans on missile technology

that it would observe the mtcrs guidelines largely attributed to the lifting of sanctions imposed on chinese firms accused of transferring m11 missile technology to pakistan15 in 1998 three new countries the czech republic poland and ukraine were approved for mtcr membership in march 2001 after five years of cons ultations with the united states south korea became the 33rd member of the mtcr with us support south korea was permitted to build missiles with range in excess of 300 km s for research purposes and were also permitted to develop rocket boosters of unlimited range for civilian purposes16 this unprecedented arrangement while viewed by some as necessary to counter north koreas missile threat and to enhance regional security has been criticized as double standard by many mtcr members nd nonmembers alike in september 2002 mtcr mbers modified the definitions of cruise missilerange and payload to close per ceived loophole in the mtcr the range definition was revised to reflect the missiles range maximizing range and not the shorter range at lower altitudes for stealth purposes this shorter range often third less than the range maximizing range can fall under th mtcrs 300 km range guidelines for export control the payload defin ition was revised to include onboard countermeasures which are common features of some advanced cruise missiles international code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation the icocs origins date back to 1999 when number of mtcr members began to discuss methods to address the d emand side of the missile proliferation equation draft code wa s circulated among mtcr members during the regimes october 2000 plenary meeting and the draf t code was finished in september 2001 the european union eu took over the draft code in early 2002 and convened series of meetings designed to involve nonmtcr members in the code all member states with the exception of iraq were invited to join and on november 25 2002 ninety three countries including the ited states signed the code of conduct notable nonsignatories included syria nort h korea iraq china pakistan india and israel libya country with ballistic missile program did

slv launches and test flights17 number of issues that were introduced in november 2002 will likely be on the upcomin g meetings agenda selection of chairman the creation of fina ncial arrangements establishi ng point of contact and information exchange procedures as well as scheduling date for the next annual meeting are possible topics18 one issue that will likely dominate initial deliberations is that of what institutional form the icoc will take there are basically three options available to members controlled organization an independent organization like the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw or central point of contact as is the case with the mtcr run out of participating members foreign ministry19 several countries including germany and ireland are strongly in favor of bringing the code under auspices but it remains to be seen if the icocs 93 members will choose this or some other option issues for congress mtcrs and icocs role in us

adherence to the icoc the proclamati on does not however call for strengthening the icoc or the eventual creation of ssile nonproliferation treaty this would seem to indicate that the administration does not intend to play leading or active role in further developing the icoc if this is indeed the intent of the administration then the mtcr emerges as the preferred means for promoting missile nonproliferation with the icoc playing lesser or supporting role us support for the icoc while us support for the mtcr has been relatively unquestioned over the course of its 16 year history the same can not be said for the icoc much of the devel opmental work on the code was done by the eu and us undersecretary of state john boltons presence at the codes signing ceremony at the hague surprised many experts who perceived that the bush administration did not consider the code to be of major significance21 us participation in the icocs negotiations has been inconsistent during the codes february 2002 round of negotiations the ited states did not provide any input during the proceedings22many experts have also characterized secretary boltons remarks at the hague as less than suppor tive secretary bolton called the code an important addition to the wide range of t ools available to countries to impede and rollback the proliferation threat23 also included in this range of tools were the mtcr and the us missile defense program which is consistent with the current us national security strategy for comb ating wmd proliferation the reference to the controversial us missile defense program may have c ontributed to the less than supportive perception held by some countries the mtcr and icoc in us policy discussions with various us state department officials about the mtcr and icoc provide s additional insight on the role that each plays in us policy in order for country to become an mtcr member it must be approved for membership by all current members the us criteria for membership is fairly extensive be significant supplier of missile technology be member in good standing of internationa l nonproliferation norms such as the chemical w eapons convention and

qualifies under us standards and there may also be inst ances when country that meets these standards might not be desirable member even though mtcr membership does not guarantee access to missile technologies of other members countries could potentially get access to ssile equipment and technology by virtue of their association with other mtcr member s in both of these circumstances the us views icoc membership as viable alternative to mtcr membership for those countries that cannot meet us entrance criteria or for those countries who meet the criteria but might use mtcr membership as means of obtaining equipment and technology for ballistic missile development the us will likely be an active participant in future icoc deliberations if only to protect national security interests the department of defense dod takes an active role in supporting the us state department on icoc and mtcr issues proposed icoc cbms and transparency meas ures could have implications for us military missile programs and ultimately national security these proposals are reviewed by dod for security and policy implications and recommendations are then made to the state department on how to address these concerns25 the intelligence community views the icoc and mtcr as both means to learn more about countrys missile and slv pr ograms and vehicle by which signatory states can gain similar insights to us missile and slv programs26 adequacy of the mtcr and icoc given the developments in many regi onal and national miss ile programs some critics have suggested that the mtcr has done little to stop miss ile proliferation since its inception in 1987 the icoc has b een characterized by some observers as weak and ineffective offering little in terms of membership incentives for proliferating countries such as china ira n india pakistan and north korea one of the central questions posed is the degree to which these arrangements have controlled missile proliferation in the past and their potential to do so in the future slowing proliferation many analysts credit the mtcr with dramatically slowing missile proliferation by making missile development both an economically and politically costly venture for many developing countries bent on acquiring missiles and their associated production tec hnology while some analysts claim this is generalization that is not supported by comparative cost data there appears to be degree of validity to this position in an unregulated market unhindered byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31848crs9 27 efficiency and inefficiency of the mtcr in

similar system or component this could enable proliferators to get more for their money which could lead to shorter development to deployment timelines and larger missile inventories mark smith from the mount batten centre for in ternational studies suggests that the mtcr is responsible fo r keeping at least for the time being icbms in the hands of the permanent 5 p5 nuclear weapons states us uk france russia and china and forcing most other countries to rely on second world war v2 technology the basis of the scud missile for their missile programs27 aaron karp in his new politics of missile proliferation suggests that only the countries of brazil israel and india were able to progress beyond the scud barrier because their missile programs predated the mtcr and also benefitted from extensive western assistance for number of years before assistance was terminated28 in more general sense some analys ts believe that the mtcr provides both form and structure to ssile nonproliferation by29 assisting states in identifying issues of common concern facilitating information sharing drawing up lists of key component s and technologies to be placed under control coordinating na tional policies delaying certain proliferation projects and making illicit acquisition projects more expensive and buying time for more effective strategies to be formulated the mtcr is also credited by some experts with curbing missile proliferation in specific instances such as30 argentina it abandoned the condor ii project in 1990 to large degree because of the embargo placed

export denials with slowing progress in number of other missile programs because of the mtcrs role in terminating the argentinian missile program egypt wa s denied the acquisition of 200 condor ii missiles promised them by the argentinian government31 the mtcr was also credited in delaying indias program by veral years and also in delaying chinese sales of m9 and m11 missiles to pakistan32 missile apartheid another criticism of the mtcr is that it is discriminatory in nature some critics have gone so far as to label the mtcr as missile apartheid33 many countries view the mtcr as cartel formed by developed nations designed to monopolize lucra tive missile and sp ace launch technology34 this view is further articulated in pakistan s 1997 paper to the where they state the mtcr is not negotiated multilateral treaty it is cartel formed by some industrialized countries for the pur pose of placing controls on the transfer of technology which could contribute to the manufacture of ballistic missiles with nuclear weapons delivery systems there is commitment on the part of the originators of the mtcr to engage in good faith efforts to eliminate ballistic missiles globally it is therefore essen tially an arrangement for promoting their own security interests only35 this inequity between missile haves and have nots has long been contentious issue amongst current mtcr members and prospective members according to senior us state departme nt official unlike the chemical weapons convention cwc for exampl where all states partie s undertake never under any circumstances to develop produce otherwis acquire stockpile or retain chemical weapons or transfer directly or indirectly chemical weapons to anyone selected mtcr members with missiles that exceed th regimes guidelines are permitted to keep them while most other countries are required to abandon them to gain entry to the mtcr another example of this ine quity was south koreas admission to the mtcr with us support south korea was permitted to tinue development of missiles and space launch vehicles with ranges greater than 300 km and with payloads in excess of 500 kg due to thei r unique security requirements regarding north korea this special dispensation could easily serve as precedent for otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31848crs11 36 verifiable control of ballistic missile proliferation mark

against ballistic missile proliferation ian davis british american security information council december 3 2002 p 2 countries with their own unique security requirements should they apply for mtcr membership given these normative inequities amongst members it follows that factions within the mtcr membership could develop between states aspiring to missile or space launch program and those states with well established and financed programs because the mtcr is consensus based such factions could conceivably undermine the regime s effectiveness an unverifiable regime another criticism of the mtcr is that it is inherently unverifiable due to the dual use na ture of much of its regulated technology in terms of the mtcr some critics have pointed out that it is almost impossible to develop space launch vehicle program th at does not have tent convertibility to ballistic missile program so purportedly peaceful sl v programs can be swiftly weaponized36 this criticism is also applicable to cruise missiles and uavs both covered under mtcr guidelines turbo jet and turbo fan engines guidance and navigation systems and composite materi als which are key components for cruise missiles and uavs are the mainstays of civ ilian aircraft technol ogy while small fuelefficient turbojet and turbofan engines that could be used in cruise missiles are category ii items under the mtcr they may be exported as part of manned aircraft or in quantities ppropriate for replacement pa rts for manned aircraft37 under these circumstances turbojet or tur bofan engines for cruise missiles could be purchased under the guise of purchasing manned aircraft or replacement parts compounding the dual use dilemma is the lack of means of verification other than nations application of their export control laws countries outside the regime the mtcr is also criticized because many proliferating countri remain outside of the regime and because some members of the regime continue to violat its guidelines for countries outside of the regime such as china and north korea the mtcr offers little in terms of membership incentives for members such as russia which has been repeatedly challenged on variety of missile t echnology transfers not permitted under the mtcr serious questions have been raised on how best to deal with these violations these circumstances are not exclusive to the mtcr both the chemical weapons convention cwc and biolog ical weapons convention b wc are criticized in similar fashion and some states parties maintain clandestine cw or bw programs in clear violation of their respective treaties the codes role in nonproliferation the code of conduct is too new to credit achievements there are however number of potential areas where the icoc may have

of secrecy from programs pa rticularly those of major missile powers and perceptually level the playing fiel d perhaps fostering greater cooperation amongst subscribing states another pr oposed cbm is that of universal launch notifications similar in nature to the prelaunch notification system currently being negotiated on bilateral ba sis by the united states and russia one proposed incentive for joining the code providi ng space technology ssistance to countries that give up their ballistic missiles has recei ved mixed reviews because of the dual use nature of space launch technology c ountries with older scudbased programs for example could trade up and gain access to more advanced technology by forfeiting their ballistic missile programs this proposal could be modified so that countries that eliminate their ballistic miss ile programs could receive preferential treatment in the launching of peaceful pa yloads such as communication satellites or research experiments all of these proposed initiatives designed to target the demand for ballistic miss iles and their associated technol ogy could serve as the basis for future efforts by the subscribing states to further develop the code criticisms of the code while there are criticisms to date on how well the code has performed there are number of criticisms of the draft code itself number of analysts characterize the code as weak or cautious noticeably absent in this regard is the mtcr criticism that the code is not treaty this is perhaps realization that the code is only in its infancy or possibly that treaty to halt ballistic missile prolifer ation is an unrealistic aspiration in an attempt to avoid the membership conflicts the in mtcr some analysts suggest that the code appears to be written so as not to offend states with substantial missile inventories39 another criticism is that the code does not set specific norms to address the demand aspect of missile pr oliferation the code simp ly implores subscribers to exercise maximum possible restraint in all ballistic missile matters this may attest to the inherent difficulty in vising mutually acceptable demandside norms or this could be deliberate tactic to get the maximum number of states to subscribe to the code before undertaking the conten tious work of devising real workable norms even in its relatively benign form the code was not signed by countries of concern such as china north korea iran iraq syria india and pakistan israel also opted not to subscribe to the code possibly out of concern for the sanctity of their missile programs the code is also widely criticized becau it lacks of tangible incentives the code vaguely addresses cooperative meas ures outreach programs and bilateral initiatives as means to get countries such as china and north korea to join and thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31848crs13 40 ibid p 5 41 nartker p 1lack of substance may be more of negative incentive than positive one40 acceding to what is perceived by many as thinly worded agreement could be considered signing blank check where country may have to abide by future provisions that turn out to be contrary to their national security interests or be compelled to withdraw from the arrangement due to their national security needs and run the risk of being brande d rogue nation in this regard many countries may be taking wait and see attitude about subscribing to the code both the mtcr and icoc have the potential to make positive contribution to the cause of missile nonproliferati on despite criticisms both arrangements provide variety of means ranging from confidence building measures cbms to export denials to address ssile proliferation in both flexible and relatively non confrontational manner th mtcr and icoc also provide countries with an important forum to discuss missile prolifer ation issues and approaches to deal with countries who choose to proliferate cont rolled missile and uav technologies such forum could offer benefits and as ch congress may review how the us can best work with likeminded countries on both unilateral and multilateral basis to further develop and streng then both arrangements benefits and liabilities of two missile nonproliferation arrangements congress may wish to consider the overall benefits of supporting both the mtcr and icoc as well as the possible liabilities proponents claim that the mtcr and icoc will complement one another and critics view the icoc as only reinforcing past failures in missile nonproliferation synergies the most widely cited synergy between the mtcr and the icoc is that of the supply and demand relati onship canadian puty defense minister margret bloodworth suggested that the c ode of conduct would work in tandem with the mtcr while the regime is suppl yside arrangement the code works to address the demand side of missile proliferation41 from theoretical perspective the addition of demand side component to the missile nonpro liferation equation should have positive influence on curbing ssile proliferation in order to achieve this synergy countries must subscribe and abide by both agreements while some countries will undoubtedly choose this pa th other countries will likely remain outside of both arrangements increased participation the fact that there are now two multilateral missile proliferation arrangements may also serve to heighten international participation as more countries become member s of one or both arrangements in this regard as the number of countries who subscribe to th arrangements potentially grows over time countries on the outside may begin to f eel political and perhaps economic pressure to join another aspect of this synergy is that increased membership might

richard speier former pentagon official involved in establishing the mtcr cautions that with range of agreements or measures to offer states might be tempted to go venue shopping to see which arrangem ent best kept open the possibility of developing ballistic missiles while assuming veneer of multilateral respectability43 with the icoc still in its formative phase it follows that country wishing to be viewed as nonproliferator could sign the icoc and then make case that they are not pursuing ballistic missiles but instead slv program for peaceful commercial purposes by participating in cb ms and by virtue of the fact that such country is associating with other count ries with missile and slv programs country could conceivably acqui re information and technology to be used in missile program this tactic may possibly explain why libya country of concern with both active missile and wmd programs acceded to the icoc in november 2002 in order to achieve synergy between these tw arrangements that have standing governing bodies the international community may consider establishing some form of organization or place the agreements under the auspices of an existing organization under current conditions it is unlikely that these arrangements will independently generate the intended synergy or compleme ntary effect without some higher entity to mediate conflicts or provide direction when necessary to date there has been little discussi on about the blishment of such an organization which in and of itself would likely take number of years to bring into being cruise missiles and uavs with over 70 countries currently in possession of cruise missiles44 and the demonstrated role of uavs in the global wa r on terror and the current war with iraq many analysts feel that the proliferati on of cruise missiles and uavs poses greater threat than ballistic missile proliferation if cruise missile and uav proliferation indeed are the greater threat that some analysts suggest what are the

domestic law enforcement and border surveillance and civilian communications to name few46 with the expanding military and commercial utility of uavs and their pot ential positive economic impact for the international and domestic aerospace industr pressure may begin to grow for relaxing mtcr restrictions47 with advances in uav technology which could make them virtually indistinguishable from manned aircraft aside from their lack of an onboard pilot congress may wish to exa mine the option of completely removing uavs from the mtcr and treating them as or dinary aircraft while this could be viewed as contentious and selfserving it might have the effect of simplifying and streamlining the mtcr which would then regulate only ballistic and cruise missiles systems which have commercial applicability while critics may accuse supporters of this proposal as promoting pro liferation it should be noted that there are agreements or treaties restricting the development of manned military aircraft the aerospace industry may also benefit from ch proposal which would likely be well received by both us and international firms given their current economic situations new technologies advances in cruise missile technology such as stealth hypersonic propulsion reprograming and loitering technolog ies and improved warheads and guidance present the question whether they should be included in the mtcrs annex including these technologie s in the regimes annex could regulate their export but could also hinder any efforts by the united states and its allies to jointly develop future generations of these weapons systems uavs and cruise missiles absent from the code noticeably absent from the code are any provisions for crui missiles and uavs this absence has number of possible ramifications without provisions for cruise missiles and uavs the icoc may well be viewed as the weaker of the two arrangements and thus attract countries with less than honorable intentions48 the lack of both cruise missile and uav provisions in the icoc will invariab ly place the burden of regulating cruise missiles and uavs exclusively on the mtcr some analysts feel that the icoc in its current form will offer very little value added to international efforts to control and regulate missile proliferation without including cruise missiles and uavs and could have decidedly nonsynergistic effect on overall international nonproliferation efforts49 the exclusion of cruise missiles and uavs from the icoc may be deliberate attempt by technologically dvanced nations to keep

from zero ballistic missile treaty that would ban all ballistic missiles to expanding the bilateral ussoviet intermediate range nuclear forces treaty inf into global pact50 there have been renewed calls for missile treaty most recently at the icoc signing ceremony in novemb er 2002 and congress at some point may be called on to examine the feasibility of the creation of ssile nonproliferation

for the c ode to be first step in creation of legally binding treaty on ballistic missiles51 jingdong yuan writing for canadas department of foreign affairs and trade suggests that the ultimate goal in restricting missile proliferation would be fullfledged legally binding international treaty52 one of the most frequent criticisms of the mtcr is that it is not treaty as such the regime has international or domestic legal status and many critics cite this as the fundamental reason why th mtcr is ineffective in the prevention of missile proliferation critics such as mark smith from the mountbatten centre cite the regimes lack of legal mechanis m formal status and enforcement and compliance mechanisms fundamental components of multila teral treaties as reasons why the mtcr is inefficient53 while missile technology control treaty may promote greater efficiency through various norms and legal mechanisms some treaty opponents argue that empirical evidence exists that suggests that treaty would be any more effective than the current regime has been in limiting missile proliferation basis of treaty should international consen for treaty coalesce the mtcr and the icoc could

and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5500 kms into global regime while many analysts cite the treatys simplicity and clarity of purpose as formula for success other analysts disagree54 opponents argue that the infs lower limit of 500 km is too high to capture many types of wmd capable cruise miss iles and shortrange ballistic missiles55 another criticism of the inf approach is that it would not cover sealaunched ballistic miss iles and uavs and would turn the mtcr into supplemental tool to comb at missile proliferation56 treatys impact on the mtcr and icoc efforts to develop missile nonproliferation treaty could so incite degree of c onflict between the mtcr and icoc in 1995 mtcr member states reporte dly reached consensus that they would not entertain proposals to establish gl obal treaty to ban ballistic missiles with specific ranges57 many analysts believe that th is decision was due to lack of support from the declared nuclear powers w hose support would be essential for the treaty to have any hope of success58 even with the advent of the icoc and renewed calls for treaty from number of countries this lack of support from the declared nuclear powers probably still exists in this regard efforts to draft treaty would likely be contentious at best and could possibly impact on the dayto day efficacy of the mtcr and icoc missile nonprolifer ation and export control officials and diplomats from countries involved in the mtcr and icoc would likely be asked to play role in developing and negotiating treaty due to their expertise and familiarity with missile nonproliferation issues give n these possible circ umstances officials involved in drafting the treaty may not be ab to devote as much attention to mtcr and icoc issues which could have detr imental impact on these two arrangements particularly the icoc which still is in the early phases of development would treaty be more effective perhaps very critical consideration is whether treaty would be any more effective than the mtcr and icoc in curbing missile proliferation in or der to have an appreciable and lasting impact on missile proliferation countries such as china rth korea iran iraq syria india and pakistan would need to subscribe to treaty agreement or arrangement and then abide in good faith with its provisions it is somewhat unlikely that this will ever occur because like
