warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98739research and development in russia an important factor for the future summary if the us government had reduced its research and development rd funding by about 76 in real dollars from 1990 to 1996 the us national r d system would be in c risis but even then the situation in the united states probably would not have been as severe as is now the case in russia where that percentage of reduction in governmental rd fundin g has occurred because the united states has large privatesector rd system the leadership under president yeltsin continues to move russia from th sovieter command economy toward freemarket system this involves restructuring and downsizing of russias rd system and its reorientation toward civilian rd this restructuring however also has been driven to significant extent by the nations deep economic recession although large decreases in rd funding and personnel and deteriorat ion of rd facilities have occurred since 1991 recent rd budget figures questioned by some experts might indicate reversal of thi s trend the most recent changes in the governments toplevel rd policy leader s also suggest that rd despite its budget decreases still is considered important in yeltsins reform government among several recent important rd reforms was the establishment of the russian foundation for basic research in 1993 an important innovatio n in russian rd policy because it funds individual researchers directl rather than their research institutes on the model of the us national scienc foundation number of international financing schemes and structures to bolster the russian rd system also have been created us policy issues parallel ongoing us and interna tional programs to more fully integrate russia peacefully into the community of nations thereby reducing th potential for future conflict and increasing russias contribution to world economic development major federal programs in support of russian rd accounted fo r about 15 billion during the period from 1992 through 1998 with nas contributing over 900 million and dod doe and other federal agencies the rest one of the several new organizations established to cooperate with russia in rd activities by providing research grants to russian scientists is the us civilia n research and development foundation created by congress in 1992 supporting all us coope rative rd programs with russia is the usrussian joint commission on economic and technological cooperation established in april 1993 it appears that the us cooperat ive rd programs are contributing to russias peaceful transition to market economy and are s uccessfully addressing scientific and technological problems and opportunities of mutual concern to the united states russia and other countries several years of experience with usrussi cooperative rd programs suggest that it is both worthwhile and practicable for the united states to identify and promote cooperative rd p rograms which are mutually

and development has the potential to c ontribute just as significantly to russias economic strength in the long term as it does in the united states other western industrialized nations and th newly industrialized countries of asia the asian tigers singapore south korea and taiwan the russian economy however is undergoing great upheaval during its transition fr om centrally planned to market economy an important aspect of that economic transition is the proposed conversion of much of its defense industry to civilian goods production russi as economic problems in general and its defense industry conversion in particular have resulted in large decreases in the governments funding of r esearch and development before 1991 about threefourths of russias rd funding was supported by the defense ministries some estimates indicate that1 by 1992 russian defense spending had dropped by onethird to twothirds of its 1991 level by now it may have fallen to onetenth of its 1991 level that large loss of2 3 financial support for the russian rd establishment beginning in 1991 an d continuing to the present has not been replaced by other rd funding sources to any significant extent 4 if the us government had reduced its research and development funding b about 76 in real dollars from 1990 to 1996 the us national rd system would be in crisis but even then the situation in the unit ed states probably would not have been as severe as is now the case in russia where that percentage of reduction i n governmental rd funding has occurred about 58 of russias internal r d funding in 1996 came from the government in the united states in 1996 b contrast only about 34 of national rd funding came from the federa l government and that decreased to about 31 in 1997 the remaining us

november 1997 2funds come from industry and other sources the russian rd funding problem has caused number of structural changes in the russian rd system and the creation of numbe r of international financing schemes and structures to bolster the russian rd system the soviet rd establishment contributed significantly to the status of th soviet union as military super power before 19 91 after 1991 in spite of the many negative aspects of downsizing the russian rd establishment such as the loss of many scientific jobs nd some rd capabilities several positive developments may be occurring the soviet rd establishment then the largest in the world an d respected for high achievements in some areas particularly mil itary rd was bloated and wastefu l according to many accounts smaller more efficient rd syste m focused on developing commercial products would b of more benefit to the evolving russian market economy than the old rd system even with the large decrease in rd personnel since 1991 the russian rd establishment still may not hav reached such an optimal size in addition decrease in military rd as russi converts its defense industry to civilian goods production could contribute to russia being less of military threat to th national security of the united states in the years ahead than it has been in the past the period of transition from the wellfinanced but inefficient soviet r d system to significantly changed russian rd system probably will continue fo r another 10 to 15 years according to many experts on russian science and technology st policy the united states may have an important role to play during thi s period it along with other nations could continue to cont ribute in major ways to the stabilization of smaller more fficient russian rd system geared more to civilian market goals than to the predominantly military rientation of the past alternatively the united states could reduce its support of and cooperation with some russia n rd projects if this is determined to be in longterm us interests background the russian academy of sciences was created by peter the great in 1725 following the establishment of the soviet union in 1922 it became the sovie t academy of sciences in november 1991 it was reestablished as the russia n academy of sciences during the soviet era it was t he central scientific organization of the soviet union with rd capabilities in russia and the other 14 sovie t republics its mission was to conduct research in support of the technoeconomi c and later military needs of the state the prestigious

even today about onehalf may be devoted to military rd6 toward the end of the soviet era and the cold war the soviet union particularly russia was comparable to the united states in some areas of science especially in several areas of theoretical science and few areas of experimenta l science it was weaker than the united states in m ost other scientific areas including most areas of experimental science this was due largely to the prestige historically associated with theoretical science and mathematics in the soviet union but als because of the lack of adequate scientific equipment the soviet union also wa s competitive with the united states in several areas of military research an elite area of its rd establishment this elite status was achieved however7 not beca use of separate system but because of higher standards and the higher standards were achieved through massive inspection system t enormous cost civilian consumer could afford the real costs of th products produced by and for the soviet military8 the russian rd s ystem in its economically inefficient soviet configuration has not contributed significantly to the market system reforms in stituted in the postsoviet era under president boris yeltsin in contrast in the united states and othe r industrialized nations civilian applied research has contributed significantly t economic development one factor in russias favor however is that most of the r d capabilities of the former soviet union at the time of dissolution were in russia russia had about two thirds of the researchers and major research institutes and almost 60 of all research organizations of the former sov iet union these rd capabilities are concentrated in moscow st petersburg and novosibirsk9 post1991 changes in russia

1990 although some analysts knowledgeable about russian rd and rd statistics question the accuracy of the official stat istics especially in regard to military rd large decreases in both rd funding and personnel since 1991 are apparent the decrease in rd funding was due to decreasing percentages of gross domestic product gdp being devoted to research and development at the sa time that gdp itself was decreasing given these caveats about the data table 1 indicates that from 1990 to 1996 gross domestic expenditur on civilian and military rd decreased about 76 in constant 1989 rubles and about 57 as percentage of gross domestic product the latter indicates not only decrease in rea l rd funding but trend of overall national financial resources away fro m research an d development since

government revenues have failed to meet budget targets moreover not all russia rd organization s share equally in the actua l allocations of the rd budget in 1996 for example the russian academy of

were received from foreign nations including the united states it is unclear however how much of the foreign funds actually wen t into the russian rd system in 1993 for example oecd estimated that

onehalf civilian the rd funding difficulties of the past several years could have been mad significantly worse by draft tax code approved by the russian cabinet in february 1997 and planned to be submitted to the duma in april 1997 the thenexisting tax laws were in need of reform because they were contradictory and confiscatory the draft code although it would have increased governmental revenues which russia desperately needs also would have eliminated almost all of the tax exemptions and concessions that applied to the russian rd establishment including universities it was estimated that it would have deprived russian rd of funds amounting t about onehalf of the 1997 budget this threat to rd funding was eliminated in27 1997 the new tax code passed by the duma in july 1998 favors

to the significa nt decreases in rd funding are similar decreases in the number of rd personnel and scie ntific degrees awarded table 1 shows that from 1990 to 1996 the number of scientific degrees

the current russian st policy leadership as to the proper level and foc us of research and development that rivalry includes continuing competition for scarce rd funds between for example the ministry of science and tec hnology and the russian academy of sciences in some ways though the rd structure has not changed much since the breakup of th soviet union the russian academy of sciences is basically the same organization as the former soviet academy of sciences and is still the most influential an d prestigious rd organization in russia it remains hostile to rd reform th ministry of science and technology especially under former minister saltykov has been the principal agent of reform in russian st policy saltykov for example attempted to identify russias best research institutes and fund them on priorit basis as federal research centers also referred to as state science centers these centers now numb ering about 60 about twice the number originally envisioned are particularly favored in the rd budget the program however has been seriously diluted by the inclusion of the additional institutes given the governments limite d financial resources after he was app ointed deputy prime minister bulgak promoted reform of russian science including radic restructuring of the russian academy of sciences and substantial reduction in the number of statesupported researc h institutions his reform plan was published in october 1997 be cause it lacked detail time schedule and deadlines however it has been criticize d by other reformminded individuals as being too vague41 another important rd reform was the establishment of the russian foundation for basic research rfbr in 1993 headed until recently by the former minister of science and technology vladmir fortov it has prov ided westernstyle meritbased peerreviewed grants for about 54000 research scientists although the foundation accounted for only about 4 to 6 of the federal budget allocation in 199597 an d actually received only about onethird of that it may have contributed roughly one42 third to onehal f of salary support for russian scientists conducting basic research43 this is mainly because the much larger budget of the russian academy of sciences has been going principally for maintenance of its physical pl ant rather than for salaries or scientific equipment the rfbr is an important innova tion in russian rd policy with potentially longreaching ramifications because it funds individual researcher s directly rather than their research institutes on the model f the us national science foundation other important postsoviet rd organizations include the russian spac agency and the ministry of atomic energy which are r esponsible for the military and civilian nuclear complex the
