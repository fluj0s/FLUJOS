overview and background on july 1 2003 the european union eu began requiring us and other firms located outside the eu to pay value added tax vat on the sale of goods and services digitally delivered to individual consumer s in eu countries the vat on ecommerce directive 200238ec may 7 2002 amended ear lier eu tax legislation changing the rules for vat collection on digitally delivered products eu firms are longer required to pay tax on exports from the eu noneu firms are now required to pay tax on theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21596crs2 sales to individual consumers within the eu imports into the eu eu firms pay the single vat rate for the country where they are located as described below these changes conform the tax trea tment of digital commerce to that of other goods and services if noneu firm establishes s ubsidiary in an eu country it can follow the tax rules for eu companies and pay single rate otherwise noneu firms are required to register in one eu country and pay the vat on each sale at the tax rate in the customers home eu country thus noneu companies must collect potentially up to 25 separate vat rates corre sponding to the 25 member countries of the eu value added tax is broa dbased consumption tax on goods and services levied at each stage of production under the eus crediti nvoice vat business r eceives credit for the vat paid on its purchases of inputs against the tax due on its sales of output the vat is typically rebated on exports and imposed on imports in contrast the retail sales tax used by us st ates is levied primarily on goods at the point of final sale the united states is the only major economy that does not levy some form of vat prior to july 1 2003 eu ecommerce tran sactions including goods and services delivered in both tangible and digital form were taxed under the ec european community sixth vat directive directive 77388eec the vat was collected from eu companies on all sales including exports to customers outside of europe as noted above this contrasted to th treatment of other exports for which the vat was rebated for eu companies distinction was made between physically nd digitally delivered goods in contrast noneu companies were taxed on imports of tangible goods and services but not taxed on imports ectronically delivered into europe the eus taxation of digital commerce by noneu firms moves counter to stated us goal of keeping internet transactions free from tax both within the united states and worldwide however it moves in the directi on favored by many us states of broadening the state sales tax base to include dig ital goods and services and of supporting interjurisdictional tax collection conditions of the directive the vat on ecommerce directive makes two substantive changes to the taxation of digitally delivered ecommerce transactions noneu firms are now required to pay tax on ecommerce transactions digitally delivered into europe eu companies are longer require d to pay tax on digitally delivered sales occurring outside of europe the tax rules for noneu companies appl to the supply over electronic networks ie digital delivery of soft ware and computer services ge nerally plus information and cultural artistic sporting scientific educational entertainment or similar services as well as broadcasting services examples include webhosting sales of downloadable software and upgrades the sale of electronic books streaming music digital movies computer games and distancelearning services httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21596crs3 1 paul hofheinz eu approves ne w rules on taxation of ecommerce the wall street journal may 7 2002 key distinction is that the new vat rule s apply to goods and services that are digitally delivered to indivi dual consumers busin esstoconsumer or b2c sales this directive does not apply to busin esstobusiness b2b sales b2b sales which reportedly comprise 90 of the 422 billion ecommerce market1 are taxed under other previous eu legislation under special provision for noneu busin esses noneu firm need register in only one eu country rather than all 25 however noneu firm must pay vat based on the tax rate applying in the country of each eu customer the firm is to remit all tax to the country in which it is registered the member state of registration is then responsible for distributing th appropriate amount of revenue due to each of the other member countries of the eu based on the fi rms sales to customers in each country european reasons fo r the new directive to many european observers the impetus for the directive was that the prior tax system placed eu firms at competitive disadvantage to noneu firms the prior system levied the vat on european firms digital commerce transactions both inside and outside the eu but did not tax noneu suppliers on sa within the eu in may 7 2002 press release frits bolkestein european commi ssioner for taxation remarked they the new tax rules will remove the serious competitive handicap which eu firms currently face in comparison with noneu suppliers of digital services both when exporting to world markets and when selling to european consumers some observers on both sides of the atlantic maintain that the direc tive was proposed and passed on political rather than economic justifications by making th compliance costs higher for noneu firms many contend that the new regulations ar nontariff barrier that will prevent some firms from selling their digitally delivered goods within europe the new directive accords similar vat trea tment to digital commerce that the eu applies to exports and imports of tangible products the vat on most goods and services is rebated on exports and imposed on imports rather than placing foreign noneuropean firms at disadvantage these border tax adjustments are widely viewed as ensuring that noneuropean products face the same vat ta x burden as do european products eu officials have argued that the new vat directive is necessary to maintain eu competitiveness with noneu firms that were previously paying vat at all on their european sales it is seen as leveling the playing field between eu and noneu firms an initial version of the directive w ould have permitted noneu comp anies to register in one eu country and pay tax at that countrys rate the concern especially for high vat nations such as sweden was that most firms would register in the lowesttax jurisdictions of madeira or luxembourg the products of these noneu firms would then bear the lowest tax rates when competing against the products of firms from other eu countries as an alternative it was decided in the final directive that noneu firms should be taxed based on the destina tion principle at the tax rate of the eu country of consumption imports from outside the eu are t hus taxed at the same rate as products andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21596crs4 2 matthew newman the economy aol ebay am azon add levies in eu as taxes hit web sales the wall street journal july 2 2003 a2 3 ibidservices produced in the custom ers home country this tax ra may be higher or lower than the rate paid on produc ts from other eu countries issues of concern to the united states the eu vat on ecommerce directive has raised concerns from the bush administration congress and us companies these include the taxation of digital commerce possible discriminatory taxation of noneu firms compared with eu firms through unequal tax rate s and higher compliance costs and whether the new eu directive undercuts multilateral di scussions of ecommerce taxati on under the auspices of the organization for economic coopera tion and development oecd taxation of digital commerce in the united states as well as the eu opponents of any tax on ecommerce have used the infant industry argument to ask for exemption from sales tax or the vat to llow ecommerce to grow unhampered by taxes on transactions imposing the vat on sales in to the eu of digitally supplied goods and services will raise the costs faced by us expor ters leading them to try to raise the prices they charge eu customers hi gher prices are likely to redu ce the amount of exports to the eu by us companies firms in highly co mpetitive industries whic h are not able to pass along the tax and compliance costs in higher prices may curtail their exports to eu customers note however that under pr ior eu law us exporters received vat advantage and us digital exports may have been artificially high unequal tax rates while european firms have to pay only one tax rate in 2003 noneu firms paid up to 15 sepa rate tax rates on di gitally delivered commerce into the eu depending on their customers country of residence in 2004 the number of rates increased to 25 when the eu expanded to include 10 additional countries from eastern and southern europe as of 2005 vat rate s range from 13 on the portuguese island of madeira to 25 in sweden the lowe st rate on continental europe is 15 in luxembourg luxembourg company selling digital product in sweden for example would be subject to luxembourgs 15 vat rate while an american firm selling the same product in sweden would be subject to swedens 25 rate us treasury officials have commented negatively on the vat rules tara bradshaw treasury department spokesperson reportedly said that the new ru would have disp roportionate effect on noneu businesses2 eu firms

10 of the european ecommerce market some analysts argue that the cost of implementing the new tax struct ure will likely exceed the tax revenue gained the combination of higher tax compliance costs plus the new tax liability might price some noneu suppliers out of the eu market eu vs oecd approach to ecommerce taxation in europe there has been growing movement to implement taxation of some sort on electronic commerce european tax systems are viewed by some as the model for countries worldwide the us chamber of commerce argues and the european commission acknowledges that the eus new taxation policy could set global precedent4 the united states and the eu are currently negotiating global accord regarding the taxation of ecommerce under the auspices of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in paris5 the oecds taxation framework conditions agreed to in ottawa canada in 1998 provided initial principles to guide countries in their policy towards ecommerce taxation the oecds model income tax treaty is used to set guidelines and resolve tax di sputes among member oecd countries the treaty allows countries to tax business ac tivities that have socalled permanent establishment in country much of the future debate on globa l tax accord will center on how permanent establishment is defi ned for use in ecommerce oecd member countries have agreed that website alone does not constitute permanent establishment however the physical locati on of servers or other computer equipment may constitute permanent establishment6 oecd member countries are continuing their work to implement the ottawa taxation framework conditions7 some us observers assert that the eu directive undercuts these multilateral oecd initiatives in february 8 2002 speech us deputy treasury secretary kenneth w dam remarked on the yettobeenacted eu gislation that the proposal may potentially be inconsistent with the international trad obligations in the world trade organization and that unilateral proposals such as the eu s may encourage others to take unilateral measures rather than waiting for the global consensus that can be developed through deliberative and inclusive process such as the oecds8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21596crs6 9 karen myers united states council for intern ational business testimony before the senate committee on foreign relations

to the wto in 2003 there was some talk of the united states filing complaint with the worl d trade organization wto regarding the requirement that noneu companies collect multiple vat rates and its use as discriminatory tool although complaint was ever formally brought karen myers chairman of the united states council fo r international businesss subcommittee on commerce stated in testimony before congress that the disparity in vat rates for eu and noneu firms might not be consistent with wto rules9 this point was acknowledged by the european commissi on which initially supported the earlier eu proposal allowing noneu firms to register in one country and pay only its rate for two years prior to the adoption of the directive the european commission ec argued that system such as the one now in place is di scriminatory and could lead to complaint at the wto the ec position was overruled by certain highvat members of the eu10 similar controversy within the u s over taxation of interstate sales and digital commerce concern about the compliance costs for u s firms to pay vat taxes on digital imports into the eu based on the tax rate of each custome rs home country parallels

judiciary committee held hearings on the states st reamlined sales nd use tax ssuta companion bills hr 3184 and s 1736 would have granted states that comply with the ssuta the authority to require remote sellers to collect state and local use taxes on interstate sales11 in the united states the term electronic commerce or ecommerce encompasses transactions arranged over the internet but livered in physical form as well as digitally delivered commerce concern in the inters tate sales tax debate largely involves the taxation of goods ordered by phone mail order or the intern et but delivered in tangible form many states are less likely to tax digital than tangible commerce for example in most states canned or prewritten software is subject to sales tax if sold in the tangible form of diskette if the software is deliv ered digitally by downloading 28 states tax the transaction but 18 states do not during th internet tax moratorium under the itfas definition of discriminatory tax products or services deliver ed uniquely over the internet with tangible counterpart may not be taxed by state or local governments
