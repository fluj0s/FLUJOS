2001 media marketing accountability act first amendment analysis henry cohen legislative attorney american law division summary the media marketing accountability act of 2001 s 792 and hr 2246 107th congress would prohibit the targeted marketing to minors of adultrated media this report considers whether it would violate the first amendments guarantee of freedom of speech1 section 101a of the bill would make targeted advertising or other marketing to minors of an adultrated motion picture music recording or electronic game violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act 15 usc 45 section 101b would in effect define targeted advertising or other marketing to minors as advertising or other marketing that is intentionally directed to minors or is presented to an audience of which substantial proportion is minors or the commission determines is otherwise directed or targeted to minors section 103 would authorize the ftc to prescribe rules that define when an audience is comprised of substantial portion of minors and that may include requirements for the purpose of preventing targeted advertising or other marketing to minors though the bill would prohibit targeting advertising or other marketing to minors of motion pictures music recordings or electronic games that their producers or distributors make adultrated it would not require that any product be rated or labeled therefore producer or distributor of motion picture music recording or electronic game who chooses not to rate or label his product would not be subject to the bill further the bill would not prescribe criteria by which to rate or label products that are voluntarily rated or labeled producer or distributor who wished to rate or label his product could decide for himself how to do so or could choose to follow an industrywide system the bills purpose is apparently limited to prohibiting producers or distributors who voluntarily rate or label their products as being suitable only for adults from advertising or marketing them to minorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20977crs2 2 despite the word system the bill would not require that there be rating or labeling system 3 note that under the bill if specific age is established then that age rather than less than 17 would govern suppose that rating or labeling system established less than 12 as its definition of minor but did not require that ratings or labels disclose that fact the producer or distributor whose rating or label said merely something like suitable for minors could then market the product to an audience of 12yearolds without engaging in what the bill would deem engaging in targeted advertising or other marketing to minors nevertheless if the ftc determined that the product was not suitable for 12yearolds it appears that independently of the bill it could find that the producer or distributor had falsely or deceptively rated or labeled the product apart from whom it marketed it to in violation of section 5 of the ftc actthe bill would also leave to the producer or distributor or to the ftc under section 102 discussed below what age to deem minor except that section 1062 provides that in event would an individual 17 or older be deemed minor and if specific age is so established under the rating or labeling system in question the term means an individual less than 17 years of age2 this apparently means that whether producer or distributor was engaging in targeted advertising or other marketing to minors would depend upon the producer or distributors own definition of minor except that if that definition included individual s 17 or older then the producer or distributor would not violate the law by marketing it to individuals 17 or older3 section 1061 would define an adultrated motion picture music recording or electronic game as one rated or labeled by the producer or distributor whether individually or pursuant to an industrywide system in manner that indicates that it is appropriate or suitable only for adults or one to which access by minors should be restricted music recording would also be deemed adultrated if it were rated or labeled in manner that indicates that it may contain explicit content including strong language or expressions of violence sex or substance abuse again motion picture music recording or electronic game would not have to be rated or labeled and if it were rated or labeled would not have to be rated or labeled in manner that made it subject to the bill it could for example be labeled as to its subject matter comedy western etc if it were rated or labeled so as to be subject to the bill however then to reiterate section 101 would make it subject to section 5 of the ftc act unless the producer or distributor opted to adhere to the voluntary selfregulatory system that section 102 would direct the ftc to establish section 102 which is titled safe harbor would permit producers or distributors who choose to rate their products to in lieu of being subject to section 101 adhere to voluntary selfregulatory system that the ftc would establish such system would include 1 an agebased rating or labeling system for the product in question 2 for all products that are rated or labeled as adultrated under the system prohibitions on the targeted advertising or other marketing to minors of such products and b other policies to restrict to the extent feasible the sale rental or viewing to or by minors of such products 3 procedures including sanctions for noncomplying producers and distributors

selling the product is communicated in the context of proposed commercial transaction 6 central hudson gas electric corp v public service commission of new york 447 us 557 566 1980 7 board of trustees of the state university of new york v fox 492 us 469 480 1989first amendment analysis the bill would affect two types of speech it would prohibit advertising and marketing to minors of adultrated motion pictures music recordings and electronic games and it would place disincentive on rating and labeling such products the bill would place disincentive on rating and labeling products because producer or distributor may now rate or label his product as suitable for adults only and face penalty for advertising or marketing the product to minors whereas if the bill were enacted he would be subject to civil monetary penalty under the ftc act for such advertising or marketing therefore the bill could impose possible financial burden on speech and that as well as outright censorship may violate the first amendme nt statute is presumpt ively inconsistent with the first amendment if it imposes financial burden on speakers because of the content of their speech4 both types of speech that the bill would affect advertising and marketing and rating and labeling constitute what in the first amendment context is called commercial speech and commercial speech is entitled to less first amendment protection than non commercial speech5 the supreme court has prescribed the fourprong central hudson test to determine whether governmental regulation of commercial speech is constitu tional this test asks initially 1 whether the commercial speech at issue is protected by the first amendment that is it at least must concern lawful activity and not be leading and 2 whether the asserted governmental interest in restricting it is substantial if both inquiries yield positive answers then to be constitutional the restriction must 3 directly advance the government interest asserted and 4 be not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest6 the fourth prong is not to be interpreted strictly to require the legislature to use the least restrictive means available to accomplish its purpose instead the court has held legislation regulating commercial speech satisfies the fourth prong if there is reasonable fit between the legislatures ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends7 we now attempt to apply the central hudson test to the bill first prong the first prong asks whether the speech at issue concerns lawful product and is not misleading if it concerns an unlawful product or if the speech is misleading then the government may ban it and the matter is settled the bill would make targeted advertising or other marketing to minors of adultrated motion pictures music recordings and electronic games subject to section 5 of the ftc act which makeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20977crs4 8 although the first prong as quoted above uses the word misleading the court also said in central hudson that the government may ban forms of commercial communication more likely to deceive the public than to inform it there seems basis to distinguish misleading from deceptive 9 463 us 60 7475 1983 10 id at 73unlawful unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce section 101a of the bill in fact says the targeted advertising or other marketing to minors of an adultrated motion picture music recording or electronic game in or affecting commerce shall be treated as deceptive act or practice within the meaning of section 5 of the federal trade commission act 15 usc 45 and is hereby declared unlawful the bill thus would treat marketing adultrated material to minors as deceptive and deceptive advertisements under the first prong of the central hudson test may be banned8 this does not settle the question however because the fact that the bill would treat marketing adultrated material to minors as deceptive would not make it deceptive whether it is deceptive for purposes of the central hudson test would be for the courts to decide the bill as noted would in effect define targeted advertising or other marketing to minors as advertising or other marketing that is intentionally directed to minors or is presented to an audience of which substantial proportion is minors or the commission determines is otherwise directed or targeted to minors perhaps intentionally directing to minors advertisements for adultrated products would be deceptive in that it might be construed to imply that the rating or label did not mean what it said but strong case could be made that to advertise an adultrated product to an audience of which substantial proportion is minors would not be deceptive especially if the advertisement stated clearly that the product was not suitable for minors an audience with substantial proportion of minors might after all depending upon how the ftc defines it contain significant number of adults and the supreme court said in bolger v youngs drug products corp that the government may not reduce the adult population to reading only what is fit for children9 the court actually has said this in number of cases but we cite bolger because it was commercial speech case that struck down statute with similarity to the bill the statute in bolger prohibited the mailing of unsolicited advertisements for contraceptives and the court struck it down despite recognizing that it served to assist some parents who desire to keep their children from confronting such mailings10 this governmental interest seems similar to one that might be asserted in support of the bill we do not mean to suggest however that bolger would be sufficient by itself to lead court to find the bill unconstitutional this is because the statute in bolger totally banned nondeceptive advertisements for legal product whereas the bill would ban advertisements and marketing which it would deem deceptive only if directed to minors though it would limit adults access to them as well if they were in an audience comprised of substantial portion of minors and would place disincentive on but not ban rating and labeling certain productshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20977crs5 11 posadas puerto rico associates v tourism company of puerto rico 478 us 328 341 1986 12 greater new orleans broadcasting v united states 527 us 173 188 1999 citations omitted 13 in case challenging restriction on sexual material on cable television threejudge federal district court wrote the federal government presents clinical evidence linking child viewing of pornography to psychological harms rather the government argues by analogy to clinical studies showing the effect of child viewing of televised violence as well as anecdotal evidence of the effects of sexually explicit television the reference to televised violence research is weakened by the lack of evidence establishing the appropriateness of the analogy even if watching televised violence causes children to be violent should the same hold true for televised sex we cannot say that it would we are troubled by the absence of evidence of harm playboy entertainment group inc v united states 30 f supp 2d 702 716 d 1998 affd 529 us 803 2000 nevertheless the court wrote the supreme court has not required empirical proof of harm to justify contentbased restrictions on constitutional ly protected speech when children are involved only some minimal amount of evidence is required when sexually explicit programming and children are involved id at 715 716 therefore the court found continuedin applying the first prong of the central hudson test we have thus far considered only the bills ban on advertising and marketing to minors if we consider the disincentive that it would place on ratings and labeling products then it is even clearer that the commercial speech at issue concerns lawful activity and is not misleading this is because the bills disincentive would apply to ratings and labels that are not misleading it may apply to those that are misleading but those that are already violate the ftc act thus we must proceed to the rest of the central hudson test second prong the second prong of the central hudson test asks whether the government has substantial interest in limiting the commercial speech in question the bills findings state its purposes which are essentially to prevent the exposure of minors to media violence court would likely find this to constitute substantial interest because the supreme court has held that governments interest in the health safety and welfare of its citizens constitutes substantial governmental interest11 third prong the third part of the central hudson test asks whether the speech restriction directly and materially advances the asserted governmental interest this burden is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture rather governmental body seeking to sustain restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to material degree consequently the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the governments purpose we have observed that this requirement is critical otherwise state could with ease restrict commercial speech in the service of other objectives that could not themselves justify burden on commercial expression12 it appears from this quotation that whether the bill passes the third prong will depend in large measure upon the evidence that the government presents in trial challenging its constitutionality court might consider evidence on questions such as is media violence in fact harmful to minors are media portrayals of sexual material harmful to minors13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20977crs6 13 continued sufficient governmental interest though it struck down the statute for other reasons though the supreme court may not have required empirical proof of harm in the context of sexual material on cable television in the commercial speech context as noted above it requires the government to demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to material degree 14 the supreme court has acknowledged the theory that product advertising stimulates demand for products while suppressing advertising may have the opposite effect lorillard tobacco co v reilly 121 s ct 2404 2423 2001 15 greater new orleans supra note 12 citations omitteddoes advertising or marketing of adultrated products itself convey violent or sexual material do retailers enforce adult ratings to the extent that advertising or marketing adultrated products to minors does not significantly increase the likelihood that minors will view or listen to those products14 is the bill likely to decrease significantly voluntary rating and labeling and thereby work counter to its stated purpose fourth prong the fourth part of the test complements the directadvancement inquiry of the third asking whether the speech restriction is not more extensive than necessary to serve the interests that support it the government is not required to employ the least restrictive means conceivable but it must demonstrate narrow tailoring of the challenged regulation to the asserted interest fit that is not necessarily perfect but reasonable that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served on the whole then the challenged regulation should indicate that its proponent carefully calculated the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed by its prohibition15 in applying the fourth prong court might ask complementing its inquiry as to the third prong whether it might be more reasonable for congress to require that theaters electronic game arcades and music and video retailers enforce existing ratings and labels though this too might raise constitutional questions than that it prohibit advertising or marketing of adultrated products to minors if enforcing existing rating and labels would be more reasonable that would not necessarily make the bill unconstitutional because in commercial speech cases the supreme court does not require the government to use the least restrictive means to further its interest nevertheless the possible superiority of an alternative means could be factor in courts decision court applying the fourth prong might also consider the extent to which the bill would limit adults access to commercial speech concerning adultrated products the extent to which it would would depend upon how great disincentive to rating and labeling the bill proved to be and upon how the ftc defined through regulation when an audience is comprised of substantial portion of minors because courts decision on the bills constitutionality would apparently depend on the evidence presented to it it does not seem possible to predict what its ruling would be congress might increase the likelihood of the bills being upheld if it developed legislative history of the bill that contained persuasive evidence with regard to the questions suggested above that court might consider
