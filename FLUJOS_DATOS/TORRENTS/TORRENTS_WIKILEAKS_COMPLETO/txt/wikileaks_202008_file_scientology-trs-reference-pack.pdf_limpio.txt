indoctrination is gi ven to staff auditors and very advanced students after these have long since satisfactorily passed routine indoctrination high school indoctrination at the moment consists only of teaching an auditor not to let preclear stop him the failure of most sessions is the action of the preclear in going out of session the preclear goes out of session at any moment when the preclear starts to control the session when the preclear controls the session he is out of session therefore it is necessary for the preclear not to stop or alter the course of action of an auditor the mome nt that preclear can satisfactorily to himself stop the auditor that preclear is out of session and the probability of doing him much good while he is out of session is very remote in high school indoctrination the technique 8c simply having fellow walk over to the wall and touch it and let go is followed the person being indoctrinated or the auditor starts to use this 8c upon his preclear w ho is actually the one doing the high school in doctrination the preclear does everything in hi s power to stop divert change or alter the intention of the auditor it will be found that such simple things as just moment my shoe is untied are the best in effecting this stopping the auditor can be thrown aside into running some other process by announcing to him that f acsimile has just appeared or that one should really use his left hand since one is lefthanded the auditor in high school indoctrination ses at any moment when he is made to pause if he is made to pause or interrupt his session in any way then the session has to be started over again he has lost because high school indoctrination is rather hard on the instructor it is run for only 45 minutes and an exact moment of stopping the session in actuality is agreed upon we are going to stop this session now at five oclock exactly it now being fourfifteen then the session is entered and is run for these 45 minutes to run one longer is sometimes almost fatal on the high school indoctrinator then for the ensuing hour the high school indoctrinator runs the person being in doctrinated with stopcs this is to reverse the positions which have been occupied therefore to use high school indoctrination it is necessary that two hour period be free and that the first 45 minutes of it be devot ed to high school

auditor to be given stopcs by the former preclear high school indoctrination depends for its ffectiveness mainly upon the cleverness of the person doing the indoctrination he has to be very smooth very often his most casual ef forts are the greatest and will be found to be the most effective the final goal of high school indoctrination is to have staff auditor or advanced auditor who is not capable of being halted by preclear under any circumstances because the person doing th high school indoctrination always has higher altitude being higher on st aff or in scientology it will be found that the person being indoctrinated is much more likely to become confused during the indoctrination than he would be in the average session however it s been learned that those people who become confused in any way during high school indoctrination have in the course of their auditing career blown several preclears it will also be found that they have not achieved very high results in auditing they were too willing to be stopped too easily rattled too easily thrown aside and did not know their subject well enough some of the effects which can be made on people undergoing high school indoctrina tion are quite startling they can be made to sw ear or even cry after being stopped as arduous ly and viciously as they can be stopped by person doing the indoctrination there is reason to list the number of commands or dodges or attempted stops which the person doing the indoctrination can use it is only necessary to synthesise these if only out of ones own experience with very difficult preclears who would rather have done anything than be audited it is better to think these up on the spur of the moment than otherwise plan ned dodges can be used where one goes very sm oothly through the thing for eight or nine commands without offering the least difficulty or resistance and then suddenly hauls back on the next one and says i wont this occasi onally completely stops

acc tape material of l ron hubbard it is interesting to know that thetan doesnt look through his eyeballs he has two little gold discs one in front of each eye lens th are not the lenses of the eyes but as you might say mockedup energy they are little gold discs that are superimposed over the eye and he looks through these the eyeballs merely serve to locate these discs an eyeball isnt even good camera some pe ople dissecting eyeballs to find out how people looked with them have been totally baffl ed since the first time this was done because it is about the worst camera that anybody ever had anything to do with what the ophthalmologist doesnt know is th at the individual looks through these little discs the ones in front of each eye and when things begin to deteriorate or when the an chor points of the body deteriorate they are lia ble to follow suit they become distorted one way or another they begin to qanda with the distortions of the eye themselves the eye reacts to light so these little golden shields react to li ght after while the little gold shield becomes black or corrodes in some fashion which makes it very difficult to look through of course we dont know why he is looki ng through them in the first place when they do deteriorate the individual starts wearing glasses the person thinks this is necessary the next thing he does is to make the lenses of the glasses stronger he puts on pair of glasses this is big shield big disc this disc also goes in front of the eyeball and he knows this and he cannot see things unless he looks through one the reason why glasses become very difficult in an auditing problem is that one is not audi ting glasses i have audited glasses just as an experi ment for long time havingness in terms of glasses or in terms of eyeballs does produce so sort of change but havingness in terms of little golden discs produces an awful alteration in terms of eyesight sometimes faster than is comfortable eyesight and glasses 2 pab 111 1557 trs reference pack 6 trs you can take this oldtime effort processing and produce change of vision with eve rybody with permanence but fantastic lteration of vision can occur making somebody very uncomfortable have the preclear get the effort to see fo llowed by the effort not to see followed by the effort to see one after the other the ne xt thing you know is that all the little muscles in the eyes will start to qanda with the little golde n lenses in front of the eyeballs which are changing under all this processing and the next thing you know is that he is seeing double crosseyed or something like that things will turn on with tremendous br illiance as though somebody swung rheostat and he will turn it down quickly because that w ould mean that he would be confronting too much you should thus change his idea of what he should be able to confront if you change that idea he will then adjust the machinery of sight but if you attack the machinery of sight directly you are just forcing him to confront and you get this phenomenon of person turning up his vision and turning it down again at once you get the person capable of being able to get beautiful scenes and visio in the bank and then going totally black you get person cl eared up tonight and tomorrow morning he is psychotic wreck that is all under the heading of havingness and confrontingness when you remedy havingness and confrontingness he will remedy the rest of it there is reason why thetan couldnt stand in the middle of the room and look at everything just as clear and flat and hard as it ever was he doesnt need any mechanics he certainly has to be able to be it and have it in other words he has to be able to occupy the middle of something and he has to be able to do lot of things before he can even see so mething but all of these things adjust on straight havingness havingness will change vision and special perception that is something nobody can argue with but the whole problem of glasses is the problem of confronting i once had bomb go off in my face with some authority some time or another becau i was standing in place where i shouldnt have been standing at all total miscalculation on my part the startlement that i could miscalcu late to this degree did in after that i couldnt see finally my eyesight turned on bit and got way up to 3120 420 that in the service is what wall i was doing combat rvice and navigation and every other thing i was supposed to do with that kind of eyes ight clear through until 1946 after the war was over i was still wearing black glasses i was trying to write books and what piece of paper in what typewriter my instincts are very good and i was perceptive enough and wasnt unwilling to confront things to such degree that i ran into doors or did embarrassing things but i was rather upset because my marksmanship was wa off i shot too many bullets into too many forbidden directions i guess or something of the sort that used to be great hobby of mine so i wore glasses contact lenses trying to increase my vision i found out that vision increased only when you diminutivized the subj ects you were looking at in other words the more powerful the glasses become the smalle r they make the objects you look at appear think that over for moment in terms of confrontingness and it will amuse you of course the world isnt quite as formidable if it gets that small eyesight and glasses 3 pab 111 1557 trs reference pack 7 trs very highpowered pair of glasses redu ces the size of the face you are looking at by about half people who are weari ng glasses are very often not aware of this but if you put new pair of glasses on somebodys nose and put hi m in car and tell him to drive he does some of the most fantastic things in other words confrontingness is altered by glasses i dont know that sight or lines or clarity of vision is altered but certainly confrontingness is altered by pair of lenses the moment i found that out i was vastly am used because i didnt want things to be that small and my eyes were simply recovering from having been torn up which was an interesting state of affairs i got some processing ran out lot of these things and my eyes came back up and flickered all over the place th ey got anywhere from 1520 to 2520 which means they were above normal sometimes and way below normal at other intervals i found one day whilst reading report that i couldnt make out anything the printing was all blurry and going askew there were ghost letters riding above every line and i just couldnt make head or tail of the report i was thinking that id better use monocle or magnifying glass i suddenly realized that i was reading an ama re port with total unwillingne ss to confront it i threw it aside picked up novel and the print was perfect so i can sympathize with those who wear gl asses because i have been over the jumps i have been all the way at the bottom of not ev being able to find the door to almost being able to find the door on up to being able to find two doors where is the havingness of the person located in terms of the body scholar has fixed vision point at certain distance from hi s eyes he has had havi ngness in that point and then he hasnt had havingness if you make somebody keep book from going away at that distance his eyesight will change all over the place just have him open book and keep it from going away now leave it uncontrolled now keep it from going away he gets headaches eyeburn his eyes practically bleed before you get through because you are restoring the havingness at the exact distance where it was fixed and lost you get all sorts of phenomena of this char acter but it isnt really problem of how good are the optic nerves of course you shove an icepick through persons eyes like the psychiatrists do he is not going to be able to see well because he has already got now i am not supposed to see with the thing i have an awfully hard time with blind pe ople on this now i am supposed to i can get them to see get them to do everything then they suddenly realize that they were not sup posed to be able to see and they shut off their sight again but you process some more and so on but any time you have vagary in the adju stment of sight it is vagary in the ad justment of havingness there must be something there to observe the havingness goes by quantity dont get the idea that people are afraid of seeing anythi ng youre figuring right along with the type of figurefigure that has never worked for anybody in any time or place he is just afraid to look at things so we will take him out and make hi m confront things if by some necromancy he is able to have that thing or some part of it th he will be able to s ee it and will not be afraid of it if we can get him to confront then hi s fears will change people know this but this ther thing that people are afraid of things that they have irrational terrors and all that is all eyesight and glasses 4 pab 111 1557 trs reference pack 8 trs pretty well resolved on just this one basis th ere is something there to confront then there isnt anything there to confront this is loss of havingness if their havingness goes down far enough ie their idea of quantity falls far enough out of adjustment they will begin to detest seeing it they wont quite like to see it now there can be too much of it or too little of it in either case the scarcity or importance or responsibility factors alter and they get so that they cannot confront it they are perfectly willi ng to listen to radio but are they willing to listen to radio 24 hours day they finally sa this is too much i cannot confront it and they turn off their hearing in some fashion you can actually fool your considerations to this degree you say look at all the books ive got to write or read look at that tremendous number of them there you got one little book which is not going to last you tw hours actually you can have much too little to read it is quite fascinating the variations in confronting are tremendous study astigmatism distortion of image is only an anxiety to alter the image you get an astigmatic condition when person is trying to work it over into substitute if he possibly can here again it is case of not enough he didnt have enough some mens wives just disappear right in fr ont of their faces just black statue will be standing there thats visual occlusion or the woman will disappear entirely she will have midriff or something like that only they dont tell anybody about it for this means of course that they are mad or something wrong there with his havingness of his wife and his willingness to confront or not to confront that girl there is another factor that enters in he w ould actually be in love with martha but be married to jane so jane gets blurry because he is trying to see martha and he will do it on an axis he will twist all things over there is another whole class of sight disa bilities which are not allowed by or listed by the bulk of ophthalmologists these people do not r eally go in for these things they say these are bizarre effects and they doubt that anybody really sees them which is fascinating way of dodging out from presented phenomena thetan with buffer in front of him feel s that he cannot receive various wavelengths and he knows there are some dangerous ones he thinks they are dangerous to him and he has tremendous number of considerations about this the considerations are utterly fabulous in quantity concerning the amount of protecti on one has to have the conditions under which one can do things this degenerates to point where man can only see well when he is wearing certain pair of carpet slippers it can get this far removed i got this from writer on

confronting l ron hubbard that which person can confront he can handle the first step of handling anything is gaining an ability to face it it could be said that war continues as threat to man because man cannot confront war the idea of making war so terrible that one will be able to fight it is the exact reverse of fact if one wishes to end war the invention of the longbow gunpowder heavy naval cannon machine guns liquid fire and the hydroge n bomb add only more and more certainty that war will continue as each new element which man cannot confront is added to elements he has not been able to confront so far man engages himself upon decreasing ability to handle war we are looking here at the basic anatomy of all problems problems start with an ina bility to confront anything whether we apply this to domestic quarrels or to insects to garba ge dumps or picasso one can always trace the beginning of any existing problem to an unwil lingness to confront let us take domestic scene the husband or the wife cannot confront the other can not confront second dynamic consequences cannot confront the economic burdens and so we have domestic strife the less any of these actually are confronted the more problem they will become it is truism that one never solves anyt hing by running away from it of course one might also say that one never solves cannonballs by baring his breast to them but i assure you that if nobody cared whether cannonballs were fi red or not control of people by threat of cannonballs would cease down on skid row where flotsam and jetsam exist to keep the police busy we could not find one man whose basic difficulties whose downfall could not be traced at once to an inability to confront criminal once came to whose entire right side was paralyzed yet this man made his living by walking up to peopl in alleys striking them and robbing them why he struck people he could not connect with his paralyzed side and arm from his infancy more confronting 2 ability 54 september 57 trs reference pack 12 trs he had been educated not to confront men the nearest he could come to confronting men was to strike them and so his criminal career the more the horribleness of crime is deif ied by television and public press the less the society will be able to handl crime the more formidable is made the juvenile delinquent the less the society will be able to handle the juvenile delinquent in education the more esoteric and difficult subject is made the less the student will be able to handle the subject when subject is made too formidable by an instructor the mo re the student retreats from it there were for instance some early european mental studies which were so complicated and so incomprehensible and which were sown with such lack of understanding of man that student could possi bly confront them in scientology when we have student who has been educated basically in the idea that the mind is so formidable and so complicated that none could confront it or perhaps so bestial and degraded that one would want to we have student who cannot learn scientology he has confused scientology with his earlier training and his difficulty is that he cannot be made to confront the subject of the mind man at large today is in this state with re gard to the human spirit for centuries man was educated to believe in demons ghouls nd things that went boomp in the night there was an organization in southern europe whic h capitalized upon this terror and made demons and devils so formidable that at length man c ould not even face the fact that any of his fel lows had souls and thus we entered an entir ely materialistic age with the background tea ching that one can confront the invisible vengeful religions sought to move forward into foremost place of control naturally it failed to achieve its goal and irreligion became the order of the day thus opening the door for co mmunism and other idiocies although it might seem true that one cannot confront the invisible who said that spirit was always invisible rather let us say that it is impossible for man or anything else to confront the nonexistent and thus when nonexistent gods are invented and are given more roles in the society we discover man becomes so degraded that he cannot even confront the spirit in his fellows much less become moral confronting as subject in itself is intensel interesting indeed there is some eviden ce that mental image pictures occur only when the individual is unable to confront the cir cumstances of the picture when this com pounds and man is unable to confront anything nywhere he might be considered to have pict ures of everything everywhere this is proven by rather interesting test made in 1947 by myse lf when it was discovered that if an individu could be made to run lock of somethi ng he had just seen run another lock on so mething he had just heard and run an additional lock on something he had just felt he would at length be able to handle much more seri ous pictures in his mind i discovered although i did not entirely interpret it at the time that an individual has further pictures when he can confront all pictures thus being able to conf ront everything he has done he is longer trou bled with the things he has done supporting th is it will be discovered that individuals who progress in an ability to handle pictures eventua lly have pictures at all this we call clear more confronting 3 ability 54 september 57 trs reference pack 13 trs clear in an absolute sense would be so meone who could confront anything and eve rything in the past present and future unfortunately for the world of action it will be discovered that one who can confront everything does not have to ndle anything in support of this is offered that scientology process problems of comparable magnitude in this particular process the individual being processed is asked to select terminal with wh ich he has had difficulty in that the definition of terminal is live mass or something that is capable of causing receiving or relaying communication it will be seen that terminals are quite ordinarily people in the problem category of anyones bank the person is then asked to invent problem of comparable magnitu to that person he is asked to do this many many times it will be found midway in the process that he is willing to do something now about the problems he is having with that person but at the end of the process new and st range thing is found to occur the individual longer feels that he must do something about th problem indeed he can simply confront or regard or view the problem with complete quanimity now an almost mystic quality enters this when it is discovered that the problem in the physical universe about which he has been worried often ceases to exist out there in other words the handling of problem seems to be simply the increase of ability to confront the problem and when the problem can be totally confronted it longer exists this is strange and miraculous it is hard to believe that an individual who has drunken husband could cure that in dividual of drink simply by processing out th problem of having drunken husband and yet this has occurred i am not saying here that ll the problems of the world could be vanquished simply by running problems of comparable magn itude on few people but neither am i say ing that all the problems of the world coul d not be handled by problems of comparable magnitude on few people and indeed i am at this time undertaking an experiment in this direction on the subject of the atomic bomb it is an oddity that the longer this experiment is continued the less responsive these bombs are to test firing perhaps it could be said however that if there existed one person in the entire univer who could confront all of the universe the problems of the universe for all would deinten sify enormously mans difficulties are compound of his coward ices to have difficulties in life all it is necessary to do is to start running away fr om the business of livingness after that prob lems of unsolvable magnitude are assured when individuals are restrained from confronting life they accrue vast ability to have difficulties with it there are many other things about confronti ng which are intensely interesting but the we will take up in later issue an earlier issue of ability carried in it full resume of training 0 the name of which is confronting this drill done for great ma ny hours will be found intensely efficacious in the handling of life wife and husband w hose way has not been too smooth would find it extremely interesting in terms of resolution of domestic difficulties to coaudit with this trai ning drill alone each one running it upon the other fo r at least 25 hours this would have to be done of course on turna bout basis of not more than 2 hours on one and then switch from coach to auditor more confronting 4 ability 54 september 57 trs reference pack 14 trs to run confronting in this fashion and with considerable gain it would be necessary to have some understanding of what coach is and in one of these coauditing teams what an auditor is much fuller understandi ng of this will be contained in the student manual the team sits in straightbacked preferably uncomfortably upright chairs the coach and auditor sit facing each other short distance apart it is the task of the coach to keep the audi tor on the ball the auditors feet must be fl at on the floor his hands must be in his lap his head must be erect and he must not use ny system or method but must simply confront twitching muscle jittering finger alike would be reproached by the coach the coach has several terms he uses the first of these is start at which moment the session begins every time the auditor falls from grace does not hold his position slumps goes anaten conscious twitches starts his eyes wandering or in any way demonstrates an incorrect posi tion the coach says flunk and corrects the di fficulty he then says start again and the session goes on when the person in the role of auditor has been extremely successful over period of time the coach can say win and then again start when the coach wishes to make some comments or give some advice the co ach says thats it straightens up this point and then again says start in the coaching itself only these terms are employed start flunk win thats it anything else the coach does or says is disregarded by the auditor unless the coach has said thats it and has then advised on point and then has started again the coach would be at liberty to do anything he wished short of physical violence to make the auditor nervous or upset him the coach coul d say anything he wished between start and another com mand as above and the auditor would flunk if he paid any attention or did otherwise than simply confronted ordinarily all the coach does is make sure that the auditor goes on confronting howe ver it should be understood that the drill can be toughened up considerably the coach can do anything to throw the auditor off the simple busin ess of confronting if the auditor so much as twitches smile looks embarrassed clears his throat or in any other way falls off from plain and ordinary confronting it is of course always flunk it should be understood that drill sessions are not auditing sessions in drill session the entire session is in the hands of the coach who is only in vague way the preclear of the session in an auditing session the entire session is in the hands of the auditor there is basic rule here anything which the auditor or student as he is called in the drills is holding tense is the thing with which he is confronting if the auditors eyes begin to smart he is confronting with them if his stomach begins to protrude and becomes tense he is confronting with his stomach if his shoulders or even the back of his head become tense then he is confronting with the shoulders or the back of his head coach who becomes very expert in this can spot these things at once and would in this case give thats it straighten the auditor out on it and would then start the session anew it is interesting that the drill does not consist of confronting with something the drill consists only of confronting therefore confronting with is flunk various nervous traits can be traced at once to trying to confront with something which insists on running away nervous hand fo r instance would be hand with which the more confronting 5 ability 54 september 57 trs reference pack 15 trs individual is trying to confront something th forward motion of the nervousness would be the effort to make it confront the backward mo tion of it would be its refusal to confront of course the basic error is confronting with the hand the world is never bright to those who cannot confront it everything is dull gray to defeated army the whole tr ick of somebody telling you its all bad over there is contai ned in the fact that he is trying to keep you from confronting something and thus make you retreat from life eyeglasses nervous twitches tensions all of these things stem from an willingness to confront when that willingness is repaired these disabilities tend to disappear of course tumultuously married couples may encounter some knockdown and drag out moments in doing this confronting drill howe ver it should be kept in mind that it is the coach in these training drills who is bound by the instructors code and that the only harm that can result would come about if the audito r were permitted to blow leave the session without the coach even with manhandling getting the auditor back into the drill it will be found that these blows occur most frequen tly when the person being coached in other words the auditor is being given too few wi ns and is being discouraged by the coach of course things he does wrong s hould be flunked but it will be found that the way is paved to success with wins therefore when he does it well for period of time the auditor should be told so go into this drill expecting explosi ons and upsets and simply refuse to give up if they occur and you will have it whipped in short order go into it expecting that all will be sweetness and light and everyone should be little gentleman and little lady and disaster will loom neither i nor the

auditing command in unit of time as completed cycle of action he delivered an auditing command well now you have to get up to step 2 and ev step 3 before you can call it full cyc of action but as far as the auditor is concer ned in dear alice part only his job is done when he has delivered an auditing command to preclear he didnt deliver it over the hills and far away or to the window he delivered it to being and he delivered it from where he was to where the preclear was and its so easy communication course 2 pab 147 11158 trs reference pack 20 trs anyone to whom this was described briefl insufficiently out in the street would flunking it at the same time tell you of course i can communicate to people well yes theres nothing to it im salesman you know i run the atomic energy omission im big man of course i communicate to anyone we look in that mans vicinity and nobodys heard anything hes said since the days of noah s ark he never said it to anybody in the first place he sort of throws things out you know and he just hopes they land well thats what passes for communication and it isnt by long ways he throws out statement of some sort or another and he thinks hes communicating with somebody its great oddity but i must confess to you at this moment that the third dynamic is simply an agreement it is an agreement whic h people have agreed to and therefore it has an existence and we certainly cannot live in this world without it but it s violation of the communication formula violati on of it the only thing that you can talk to in the final ana lysis is living being and all third dynamics are composed of individual dynamics and you can summate them and you can say this is thir d dynamic and that is the agreement on which we go and it is quite factual and they are quite actual unless we stress them with the commu nication formula so that you dont talk to all preclears you talk to preclear there was fellow by the name of franklin delano roosevelt that never talked to the nation he never talked to the nation he talk ed to an individual citizen and therefore he communicated there was another fellow who spoke the most beautiful english i have ever heard almost incomprehensibly parsed perfect woul d have passed any oxford english professors most critical look and that was herbert hoover and i dont think herbert hoover ever said hello to dog i dont think in his whole life he ever said anything to anybody anywhere and when this man uttered pronunciamentos they pronounced nothing to anybody anywhere and therefore he couldnt lead nation out of pression he couldnt lead anything for an ex cellent reason he had concept in the final anal ysis of talking to an individual of getting his communication to land right there now this is touchy point that i open up you say well how about you ron you talk to an awful lot of people well thats th whole secret of scientologyi dont talk to an awful lot of people i talk to you i havent ny concept of large multitude that reads my books or listens to my lectures i can get multip concept of talking to great many at the same time by talking to every one of them i ndividually therefore i perhaps add little ceit to the line but i do communicate therefore someone wanting to know how to speak to crowd would first begin with dear alice part so it is very very far from an unimportant step it is not just the entrance step that you have to get through to get your communication course over so you can really learn something that is not what it is it is th first door that opens and that door opens when it opens and it opens when you can communicate statement from you to person we wont worry about preclear because really the pers on in dummy auditing who is sitting there as preclear is really coach you know but youve got to get something across from you to that person and it has to be from you to that person it has to be communication and when you can do that well youre all set communication course 3 pab 147 11158 trs reference pack 21 trs i once told somebody that if he had very difficult student not you but if he had very very difficult student the thing to do with this difficult student would be to put him through seven weeks of dummy auditing and then teach him in the last week to remedy vingness and turn him loose with certificate and it would be safe investment we would be perfectly safe in doing that but to give him one week when he needed two or three on dum my auditing and then try to cram him full of da ta and hope that the processes would carry him through somehow didnt make an auditor it ma liability both to himself and to prec lears so this first step is not just an easy one it is the toughest step youll perform in scientology and thats why its right at the be ginning its to say something to somebody with the full confidence that they will receive it and thats quite trick all right how exactly is this done we give person book the book is alice in wonderland why alice in wonderland well thats just because it is further significan ce we give him this book and he is supposed to find any sentence in that book that he cares to find these people who just want to read the book consecutively to the preclear are not doing dummy auditing they again are not in co mmunication with the preclear he is suppo sed to find line now he doesnt put alice said or the queen said or something like that on the line he just puts the statement itself you see why do they run so fast well the book says why do they run so fast the queen asked well we dont use the queen asked we just say why do they run so fast all right he picks that up out of the book why out of book why not out of his head oh remember remember something in using the english language you are not u sing your own ideas you did not invent the word s you only helped invent the words that compose the english language you are alrea dy using somebody elses ideas now there is nothing wrong with your composing these into new ideas of your own but remember you are already using somebody elses ideas when youre speaking english all right now lets get it little bit further we are given set pat process oh i know i dreamed it up i found it one way or the other but an awful lot of auditors worked with this its had lot of looking at and its become phrased in certain way and that certain way might very well be taken by you out of the xtbook and given to the preclear and it wont ever work if you do do fishes swim is not therapeutic procedure its not the repetiti on of it can be very good for an auditor but its not therapeutic procedure but the statement do fishes swim is not yours really at the be ginning is it you got it fr om the instructor or off of book and then you used it well when does it become yours well any idea is yours that you make yours we wont go along with dial ectic materialism and say that ideas are new because thats not true there can be new ideas but if you get an idea from someone else it is not still their idea its your idea there is nothing wrong with misowning ideas theres mass in them to get you confused you take an idea out of book it becomes your idea and then as your idea you relay it to the preclear and that is all there is to it it is coached this way it is not from the book to the preclear it is from the book to the auditor and then the auditor making it his own idea expresses that idea to the preclear in such way that it arrives at the preclear so its from the communication course 4 pab 147 11158 trs reference pack 22 trs auditor to the preclear but we give him the book as the third via because most of the material he is going to handle in communication is from source outside himself youve just got to get used to the idea that there is nothing wrong with using another persons ideas i always know what someones state of lear ning is in scientology when they speak of scientology as your ideas they say ive b een reading your ideas i know at once this person cant communicate its great oddity it s quite wonderful because they reveal at once that they cannot take this first basic step of taking an idea and then communicating it to someone else they are standing back looking at the world in some large sense and they are not any part of it because they cant own any of the worlds ideas if they cant own any of the worlds ideas then they wont own any of the world because the easiest thing to own is an idea mass to impede it so we coach just exactly in this way we want the person to find phrase in alice in wonderland and then taking that as his own idea co mmunicate it directly to the preclear and he can say it over and over the same phrase if he wishes in any way he wishes to say it until the preclear who is really coach tells him that he thinks it has arrived now sometimes the preclear the first day feels just little bit strange about these communication lines too and sometimes has hi s entire criticism based upon the erudition the pronunciation the way the auditor holds his little finger while he announces the phrase this has nothing to do with it it is the intention that communicates not the words and when you have the intention to communicate to the preclear and that intention goes across it will arri ve if you broadcast that intention matter if youre saying it in chinese if youre scien tologist it will arrive one of the steps of the much higher indoctrin ation level tone 40 8c consists entire ly and completely of saying things in funny voice tones while one is communicating an inten tion using very odd voice tones well this is not part of dear alice the voice tones are u nimportant pronunciation is unimportant its wh ether or not the person could take that idea out of that book own it and then communicate it and the intention must communicate and it must be communicated in one unit of time that is to say it isnt repeated from the last time it was repeated it is new fresh communicated in present time the fiftyfifth command of do fishes swim is the fiftyfifth not the fi rst repeated so we have one unit of time one command and the intention and when we have t hose things relayed across then he can find another phrase and communicate that and that is the way we do that and i hope you find it helps communication l ron hubbard pab 148 professional auditors

_____________________________________________________________________ 1 december 1958 dummy auditing step two acknowledgment compiled from the research material and taped lectures of l ron hubbard dummy auditing step two acknowledgment is the second part of the communica tion cycle now the actual fact is when you have gotten thought over to preclear it is customary to prove it the whole stress of acknowledgment is entirely and completely upon making sure that the preclear receives the auditors acknowledgment that is the entire stress now why all this stress on acknowledgment well acknowledgment is control fac tor ill just let you in on secret right here at the beginning if you acknowledge preclear well you will have the preclear under much better control now why the formula of control is start change and stop and thats just it an acknowledgment is stop if you said to him keep going or keep talking you would not be acknowledging him the perfect acknow ledgment communicates only this i have heard your communication thats all there is to it i have heard what you said it signalizes that the preclears or persons since scientology applies to life not just to an auditing r oom communication to you has been received but when you use it as an auditor you use it also as control factor and it says this your com munication has been received and that is all there is to it and that is the end of that cycle of action thank you thats what it says and you have to put that whole intention into yes or an okay or anything else you use it isnt the word its the intention that ends it your communication has been received and i have now decided to stop that cycle of communicati on and your communication is therefore under my control those things which you stop very crudely are things which you control you have to be able to stop things if you control them if you cannot control preclears communication line you cant control the preclear ill give you an example of this lets say were auditing mrs gotrocks the wife of the executive manager of fleabite dustpowder or something and she is bored the only thing wrong with her and shes crazy thats the onl other thing wrong with her and she never had anything to do and shes just been lyi ng around and she has ailments she comes into dummy auditingstep two 2 pab 149 11258 trs reference pack 24 trs the auditing room and she starts to talk to you she says oh ive been to this specialist and that specialist and it cost this much money and that much money and ive been here and ive been there and whats really wrong with nd what you really should take up is so and so rah rah rah its none of your business the longer you let such person talk the less havingness they have you can watch them go stra ight down the arc tone scale if you keep on letting them talk obsessive communication obse ssive outflow and the first major use that you will make of this the first time you really understand what this acknowledgment is all about is when somebody starts this on you and starts talking talking talking talking and you want to get session started and you get the intention real good and you say to them good and they stop talking your intention wa s such that they knew that you had received their communication and if you can do this ve ry well if you can get that acknowledgment just right and if it does exactly what it is s upposed to do very often the person will look at you fixedly and say you know i dont think anybody has ever heard before why is this person talking obsessively they are trying to make up in quantity what they lack in audience theres nobody listening to them they are not talking to anyone and you all of sudden come up with an acknowledgment and say hey i heard you i heard that you have communicated to and thats it now and they say wow i dont think ive ever talked to anybody before its quite amazing i have seen an auditor on an obsessi ve outflow case get down in front of the preclear fix him with an eye move his finger back and forth just in front of the preclears nose and say good i heard that and have the prec lear all of sudden say ooooh geeeeee you are there arent you so good acknow ledgment can actually wind up the entire goal of th process and find the auditor thats how important it is now that is specialized use stopping compulsive outflow its general use is put ting period to the communication cycle it nds the moment of time in which you gave the command you learned how to give we hope in dear alice part you said something the preclear heard it and we understood then that the preclear had heard it and we said good now the exact way dear alice part b which is dummy auditing step two is done is this the coach or person acting as preclear takes alice in wonderland and reads random phrases out of it and reading the phrase in any old way we dont car how were not dis ciplining the preclear you know we never do that we merely control them within an inch of their lives in this particular case this person says something out of alice in wonderland and the auditor has to say good fine okay i heard that anything in such way as actually to convince the person who is sitting there acting as the preclear that he has heard it now there is specific way to do this that is to intend that the communication cycle ends at that point and to end it there anythi ng that you do to make that come about is of course legitimate unless it utterly destroys arc but it finishes cycle of communication so what could the auditor in this case do you see there sits the auditor book there sits the preclear with book and the preclear is reading and the mad hatter dipped his watch into the teapot and the auditor says good bu t that ends that you see now in view of the fact that the preclear is reading conti nued story which goes on sentence after sentence after sentence the auditor will ve tendency to treat this as in passing and that is not an acknowledgment the auditor could say well read some more thats not an acknowdummy auditingstep two 3 pab 149 11258 trs reference pack 25 trs ledgment it didnt stop it did it continue go ahead thats not an acknowledgment at all an acknowledgment says stop whoa air brakes period end heard you youve communicated thats th end of that moment of time final cycle thats it youve had it you get that so the auditor has to say good fine kay in such way as to receive the communication in the preclears eyes the preclear has to know that the auditor has received the communication and thats the only point on which they are coached at first then we could start to bear down and say as an instructor well did you acknowled ge that preclears communication did you and the auditor says well uhh did you do perfect acknowledgment well certainly and the answer to that would be the preclear is still reading still got the book in his hands still going on with it still sitting in the chair and hes still not in this universe what is this all about what are we actually trying to do well were not trying to reach the ultimate in an acknowledgment because that would be the end of the universe if somebody could say yes good or okay with enough intention behind it all communications of this universe from the moment of its beginning would then be acknowledged totally except that this would violate the communication formula because they werent all addressed to him although lots of people think they were but what does the auditor actually feel called upon to do well he feels called upon to put period to that cycle of communica tion it actually started you see with the audito rs phrase to the preclear then the preclear signified with some kind of wince or grunt or something that it had been heard and then the auditor says well thats the end of that good fine that finished that you see but an acknowledgment ends the cycle of the communication which you read about in dianetics 1955 and that is the billjoe cycle good sa ys the auditor this is fantastic if you got good enough at this traffic cop would drive up and say something to you and you would acknowledge the fact that he had spoken nd he would simply get back on his bike or go back to the station house and turn in his badge and retire you see that would be the end of that that would be it as matter of fact it actually staggers people to have an acknow ledgment come to them it staggers them r eally to get it through people who are having hard time particularly its good thing and its very therapeutic for person to know that he has been acknowledged i know that you will be around in the local stores maybe stopping pedestrian on the street and suddenly l ooking at him and saying good acknowledging him and you will have some fantastic things occur if you do an acknowledgment is very very powerful sixteeninch gun in the communi cation formula and you shouldnt use it spa ringly you should use it to end cycles of co mmunication i hope you learn to do that very very well trs reference pack 26 trs pab 150 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron

compiled from the research material and taped lectures of l ron hubbard this interesting interesting dummy auditing step has villainous and vicious goal it makes somebody duplicate way back in 1950 we f ound out that auditors in order to be inte resting would vary their pattern and every tim the pattern was varied every time the audi ting command changed the preclear received little jolt there was an upset because of it long time ago we would have considered it fairly legitimate for an auditor using the auditing command do fishes swim to say by the way do finny creatures wiggle in the water and next time to say say does the funny tribe bathe and the next time to say what brands of fishes are there that progress from poi nt to point b in liquid habitats that pos sibly would have been legitimate then but we dont do that today we do horrible thing the auditor says do fishes swim and just to vary it he then says do fishes swim and just for good wild variation he then says do fishes swim this is where we learn why we were so insistent on one command in one moment of time back in dear alice part because we dont repeat the first do fishes swim another thousand times auditing command should ever depend for any of its meaning on any other auditing command ever uttered each one ex ists theoretically and purely in its own mo ment of time and is uttered itself in present time with its own intention now this is quite important do you know th at the basic auditing process of cch does not work unless each command is in separate unit of time if you run it this way give your hand thank you give your hand th ank you give your handthank you its not very therapeutic and nothing happens to the preclear why well weve got machine which is simply repeating the first give your hand over and over again were not say ing it theres intention there do you know that if you told somebody to give you his hand with enough intention behind it his body would respond without any via through the dummy auditing 2 pab 150 151258 step three duplication trs reference pack 28 trs thetan the body doesnt obey the words the body obeys the intention to extend hand the refore when you are asked to express an auditing command with the same words over and over and over each time you must express it in pres ent time as itself with its intention it isnt just long duplication of it just duplicating something over and over and over is sometimes so trying that people wonder how auditors ever arrive at all nobody could sit in chair and say each time with new intention do fishes swim for seventyfive hours its beyond human possibility according to some people but the trick is that if its always uttered in pre sent time it could be said for thousand and seve ntyfive hours its only when its repeated only when the first command is repeated over and over and when new intention arrives that it becomes very arduous only when it goe s on to machine does it become almost im possible to do communication is reached by control plus dup lication at first you find that to make each utterance of the command different in its own unit of time you use different voice inflec tions but as you come up the line on this you fi nd out that you actually can pattern the same tone and each time have it entirely new it would be very very incorrect to teach this to have the auditor each time duplicate his own voice tones as they were the last time because that is making an auditing command depend on the last auditing command we couldnt care less and after while you couldnt care less eith er what voice tone youre uttering but each intention is new and fresh the intention is to ask and get an answer to this question do fis hes swim and each time you utter it it is uttere d newly and in its own area of time thats really the only stress there is one command pe r unit of time each command separate and each command containing the words quite incidentally do fishes swim here we learn great deal about the dupli cative factors of communication we find out that in having to duplicate we think we actually lose some of the communication at first its utterly idiotic how could you possibly maintain arc and therefore of course interest asking person over and over again this silly question do fishes swim who could do this well interest in communication has everythi ng to do with the intention to be interesting and very little to do with text furthermore it is not the auditors job to be interesting being interesting is part of the communication formula but to an auditor the least possible part as far as the preclear is concerned hes not there to interest and intrigue the preclear right way people think they are place two people in chairs facing each other and each one of these two people feels the compulsion to be interesting to the other thats not auditing thats being interesting thats being social and so on so if person had any difficulty doing step three do fishes swim the instructor would be perfectly in order if he simply told the person to sit in that chair and told some other student who wasnt doing too well or just some other stu dent to sit in the other chair and told them just to sit there and look at each other without saying thing or being embarrassed or anything interesting drill if you think of it we do have variation and therefore interest in the first and second dummy auditing steps but now we reach this one and it is utterly devoid of interest were saying the same thing over and over and over and over and if person can t do this he probably has compulsion to vary to alteris to be interesting and he wouldnt find it easy just to sit in chair and face another human being and not say word and not do thing but just sit there and look at the dummy auditing 3 pab 150 151258 step three duplication trs reference pack 29 trs other human being and if i were coaching someone that had difficulty in repetition of steps i would do that for an hour or two that day all right it is absolutely necessary that an auditor be able to duplicate but answer this is person who is saying something in pr esent time each time really duplicating the last moment of time he really isnt is he nd so this duplication that we do in scientology means only the ability apparently to duplicate while being in present time the greatest motto of experience and the life we have lived is this i won t ever do that again this is the one thing your mama wanted you to promise if you did nothing else if you lived completely sinful life why mama still wanted you to learn by experience which is to say that when you did something wrong or did something you werent ever to do it again she hoped perhaps you would eat enough candy to ma ke you so sick that you wouldnt wolf candy again that you would eat enough ice cream so that ice cream would make you so green that you wouldnt make pig of yourself over ice cream again that you would become so embarrassed and lose so many friends that you w ould not do that evil thing again whatever it was you did and thus learn by experience never to do it again and th is is experience talking one thing you must understand that experience teaches you is never to do anything the second time this doesnt necessarily mean that all experience is painful but people who are having hard time tend to believe that it is and when they be gin to depend upon experience and stand by this lesson of never doing it again they can longer duplicate and what do you know they cant communicate also their bank jams all sort s of interesting things occur all moments become one moment one moment becomes all moments identification occurs all over the place and just the action of repeating something like do fishes swim as an auditor with full intention has tendency to unjam the time track you should know that this is what this step is up against it is violating all of that hard won experience that you have accumulated in the last seventysix trillion yearsif you believe an emeter youre seventysix trillion years ol d and all that hardwon experience all that wonderful wonderful lot of mess that you got into added up completely to never do it again and so youve been taught not to live which is what happens when you get experience and when you can duplicate an auditing command ove r and over again you will find out that au diting does not become painful experience person who can do this well by the way ne ver gets restimulated why should he hes not in the moment of time in which the restimula tion took place there is more basic step to this particular one by the way this is to pat the wall five times and then distinguish one of the pats from the rest an instructor can do that on student with some profit pretty soon the student can tell all five pats apart and when the student can tell them all apart even though they sounded ll the same he can also duplicate an auditing command in present time all the

communications office 3537 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 january 1959 dummy auditing step four handling originations compiled from the research material and tape lectures of l ron hubbard the fourth thing an auditor has to do in that order is to handle an origin from the prec lear it is actually true that when you are handling tone 40 processes you do not handle the preclears originations but if you will look on the hcahpa chart you will find that these tone 40 processes are in the minority amongst processes and in all processes not tone 40 preclears originations are handled remember that dont let nybody talk you out of it if you are handling tone 40 which is just pure positive postulating you of course are not worried about anybodys opinion origin condition or anything else you simply want him to do certain things and he finds out that his beingness can be controlled and therefore that he can control it what do we mean by an origin of the precl ear he volunteers something all on his own and do you know that is very good index of case whether the person volunteers anything on his own an oldtime auditor used this as case index he said this fellow isnt getting any better he hasnt offered up anything yet you see he didnt originate he didnt originate communication do you know that that is th hardest thing to get an organization to do to originate communication you actually could work in the direction of getting preclear to originate communi cation in spite of the fact that you just previously were running him on tone 40 processes he originated the communication that his arms and gs felt like they were just going to fall off and you said give your hand thank you preclear says my heads coming off now i know its going to fall on the floor auditor give your hand thank you good tone 40 but on control of person the first two pro cesses are tone 40 but book mimicry and the next process up the line from it hand space micry are not tone 40 and originations by the preclear are not only handled but encouraged dummy auditing 2 pab 151 1159 step four handling originations trs reference pack 32 trs so remember that we have not lost out of th galaxy of processes the fact that the prec lear is as well as he can originate communi cation that means he can stand at cause on the communication formula and that is desirable point for him to reach you see in controlling people we are really only showing them that they can be controlled that it is possible for their possessions to be controlled and then they even tually decide that these are controllable and that people are controllable and that things ar controllable and their bodies are controllable and they say wonderful look ill try and before that they didnt even try so we are controlling persons possessions or body only until this person then himself decides to take hand in it too and then he fi nds out that control is possible but most peo ple dont originate circuits originate comput ers originate compulsive outflows originate and when you first start to use tone 40 on pe rson you will apparently see originations but they are not originations they are restimulati ons being dramatized there is big difference between restimulation being dramatized and an origination its whether or not the thetan said it did he say it or was it just circuit starting up well you can start up circuits and actually throw them into being and you will see that these are not originations but when an origination appears in anythi ng but tone 40 process you handle it and you must handle it well and conclusively there are preclears who have had astonishing things happen to them who have tried to communi cate them to the auditor who have failed to do so and have then sunk into apathy and just gone right on out of session because their com munication origination was not handled properly by the auditor there are instances of this and many of them tone 40 processes do not pa rticularly violate this an understanding of what they are takes place rather rapidly with th preclear and he doesnt expect you to but if he has graduated into being human being nd hes getting up there and he originates so mething and you answer it now hes liable to sa the most astonishing things to you and if you dont handle them hes liable to drop into apathy about the whole thing so you must handle them well because theyre always unexpected i would say that u nexpectedness actually should be part of the finition of an origination because they are quite often completely off the subject they ta ke you completely by surprise they are appa rently not at all what you expected him to say the fellow says huh im eight feet back of my head well what do you do in the old da ys we might have gone right onto route one but we dont today we handle the origination b the way this used to be an old technical phrase he qandad in other words he did what the preclear di d any time the preclear changed the auditor changed that is the deadliest crime in auditing the preclear changes because he is being processed and the auditor changes the process qanda the preclear changed the auditor changed well that isn t what you do he says you know the whole back of my head feels like its on fire on ce upon time we might have handled this we might have gone right in there and said oh thats very good we had finally gotten so matic on this fellow and we would have handled it in some fashion or other and questioned him about it and audited it and so on but we found out that this stuck people on the time track therefore we do not do that any more so what do we do when he says the back of my head is on fire do we ignore it well if we are running tone 40 processes we ignore it but if we are auditing any other pro cess of which there are many in cch we handle the origin and an auditor who has not been trained to do this will often find himself very embar rassed dummy auditing 3 pab 151 1159 step four handling originations trs reference pack 33 trs but how about in the walkaway world th world that is ambulant and moving around and spinning quietly or noisily as the case may be do you ever have to handle an origin in it well i dare say that every argument you have ever got into was because you did not handle an origin every time you have ever got into trouble with anybody you can trace it back along the line you didnt handle if person walks in and says whee ive just passed with the highest mark in the whole school and you say im awfully hungry shouldnt we go out and eat youll find yourself in fight he feels ignored he originated communication to have you prove to him that he was there and he was solid most little kiddies get frantic about their parents when their parents dont handle th eir originations properly handling an origina tion merely tells the person all right i heard it youre there you might say it is form of acknowledgment but its not it is the communicati on formula in reverse but the auditor is still in control if he handles the origin othe rwise the communication formula goes out of his control and he is at effect point longer at cause point an auditor continues at cause point so lets look this over the handling of an origin has great deal of use and until re cently it was the least pat step in scientology how did you handle an origin and we finally found out i finally had cognition myself i trie d for long time to communicate this to peo ple and they still blundered on it occasionally and i finally found out something that did seem to communicate there are three steps in handling an origin he re is the setup the preclear is sitting in the chair and the auditor is sitting across from the preclear and the auditor is saying do fis hes swim or do birds fly and the preclear sa ys yes here is the factor now entering do fishes swim the preclear doesnt answer do fishes swim the preclear says you know your dress is on fire or im eight feet back of my head or is it true that all cats weigh 18 kilograms you see wog wog where did this come from well although it is usually circuitry or something like that at work when its that far off beam it is nevertheless an origin how do you handle it well you dont want the preclear to go out of session and he would if you handled it wrongly so 1 you answer it 2 you maintain arc you dont spend any time at it but you just maintain arc and 3 you get the preclear back on the process one two three and if you spend too much time in 2 youll be doing wrong what is an origin all right he says im ei ght feet back of my head its an origin what are you supposed to do with it well youre supposed to answer it in this particular case you would say to him something in the or der of you are you mean something like ive heard the communication its made an effect on now in maintaining arc you can skimp that second one if you handle the th ird one expertly enough the least important one is the second one but the most deadly th ing you can do is utterly to neglect the second one of maintaining arc thats deadly but you can skip it if you really punch it into the third one which is to say get him back into ssion so he says im eight feet back of my head and you say you are what he said really hit you know hes kind of wog wog about this hes not sure what this is all about you say you are and the fellow says yes well you say what did i say that made that happen dummy auditing 4 pab 151 1159 step four handling originations trs reference pack 34 trs oh you said do birds fly nd i thought of myself as bird and i guess thats the way it is but i am eight feet back of my head well thats pretty routine you say rea ssure him maintain the arc now what was that auditing question oh you asked do birds fly and you say thats right do birds fly back in session you see you cant do this you cant put it into can and put label on it and say this is how you do it always because its always something peculiar but you can say these three steps are followed i will give you another example you say do birds fly and he says i have blin ding headache you do you say is it bothering you thats th arc too much to carry on with the session and youve reached number three at once oh its pretty bad though well lets go on with this shall we you say maybe itll do something with it maintaining arc he says well all right and youre right back onto it again do birds fly one of the trickiest of these is what in my question reminded you of that the fellow says well so and so and he explains it to you and you say well good do birds fly and youre right back in session again three parts and that is the important thing you have to learn how to handle these things at the same time that we are doing this we can get much more complicated particularly toward the end of the session by just tryi ng out communication bridge communication bridge from do birds fly to do fishes swim and from do fishes swim back to do birds fly communication bridge is very easy thi ng it simply closes off the process you were running maintains arc and opens up the new pr ocess on which you are about to embark if you could look at it as two vs the points facing each other with line between the bottoms of the two vs you would see that one proce ss which you have been running is closed on down to nothing easily by gradients you say h ow about running this just three or four more times and then well quit okay we gi ve him warning you see that were closing the process off and we do run it three or four more times then we say how are you doing we never ask people by the way how do you feel this asises havingness we say how are you doing and he says h not too badly and so on well did nything happen there while we were running do fishes swim and he says i dont know i got little bit of reality i felt like fish for couple of moments there auditor says how do you feel about that and so on i s it okay are you doing all right now the preclear says not too badly you say well lets go over onto do birds fly its an intedummy auditing 5 pab 151 1159 step four handling originations trs reference pack 35 trs resting process and it just goes like this i ask you do birds fly and you answer how about running that and he says well all ri ght okay you establish agreement again and away we go actually it is three contracts in row the first contract is to stop the process we are running the next contract is we are in an auditing session binding this as continuing auditing session and the third contract is simply we have new process we would like to run and i want your signature on this dotted lin that you will run it that actually is com munication bridge the reason we do this is so preclear will not be startled by change for if we change too rapidly in session we stick th preclear in the session every time we give him some warning and that is what communication bridge is for the handling of origins however is most important learn how to handle origins and youll never be taken by surprise by preclear oull be right in there pitching and the ses sion will keep on i have seen an auditor sit with his mouth open for twenty or thirty seconds after some preclear said something fantastic he just didnt know what to make of it well you answer it you maintain arc and you get him back in session trs reference pack 36 trs pab 152 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 3537 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 15 january 1959 the five levels of indoctrination compiled from the research material and taped lectures of l ron hubbard i am now going to give you the five levels of indoctrination very rapidly we already have the five dummy processes which form the first level the five dummy auditing proces ses the second one up the line is 8 c plain 8c it is given without stress on control or anything of the sort you dont touch or handle th person it is an old process done this way the auditing commands of 8c in this particul ar instance have suffered change recently be cause auditing command must depend upon any other auditing command or it wont be in present time so each auditing command depends upon itself and the commands of 8c are look at that wall thank you walk over to that wall thank you with your right hand touch that wall thank you turn around thank you there is let go there or other direction if we have not directed him to do something and he does it if the way he does so mething is little different from what we expect ed we really have basis for objection and the training stress is only this to get pers on to walk another body than his own around the room there is nothing to this it is not high school indoctrination at this level he must be able to duplicate the command and it is run to point where person does not make mista ke on the commands and stops feeling nervous about walking persons body around that is the training stress now we move up to the next level of indoc trination which might look like 8c at the first glance but is not this is high school indoctrination the commands of high school indoctrination are the same as those for plain 8 c but this is entirely and completely trai ning process and it is only run for this reason to keep an auditor from being stopped by preclear by devious and diverse statements and actions the preclear we cant really call him preclear at all for he is actually the co ach runs on this auditor anything he can think the five levels of indoctrination 2 pab 152 15159 trs reference pack 38 trs of to stop him and the auditor must at time permit himself even to be halted or falter in any way he must be able to continue clear freeflowing 8c on this person who is getting down on the floor and barking like dog he mu stnt be permitted to go down on the floor you let man get below the level of your shoulde rs and he is going to get down on the floor thats for sure you have to catch him before that he is going to try not to walk across the room he is going to try and run across the room he is going to try and do anything you told him to walk walking fast is allowable but r unning is definitely not allowable the training stress is entirely upon getting an auditor to persevere against any trick mechanism anybody could think of or react to or any circuitry or dramatization in 8c it is total auditor persistence we dont ask the auditor to do it smoothly we only ask him to do it constantly and sistently that is high school indoctrination one of the great steps of scientology if we had had this few years ago it would have made th world of difference in several cases i can think of fellow would sit dow n in the middle of the floor and he wouldnt do anything we depended totally on our voices and these people werent in communication the coach in this case has role to play he is the preclear he has two signals one flunk and the other thats it which are effec tive anything else he says does not count of course he says start and they go on with it but when the coach who is the final judge considers that the auditor has blundered has been stopped and has waited too long then the coach says flunk what happens when the coach says flunk they go back to the beginning of the nearest cycle of action of 8c they do not take it from where they were but go back to the beginning they leave that cycle incomplete the auditor in this case is not permitted to over ride flunk when the coach says thats it he means we are through we are going to take breather what i say now counts and that ends it it doesnt begin again until the co ach says start this is 8c done on very heavy body c ontact the coach being lugged around and doing anything he can think of to stop this fellow it is interesting what will stop some audi tors if you understand your business as coac h you will understand that it is the soft ones and the unexpected ones that count it isnt th heavy ones it isnt the preclear just lying down on the floor and refusing to budge and exer ting every muscle and having to be dragged from there on this is perfectly allowable but it is nt the one that catches the auditor it is the subtle unexpected actions that flunk an auditor high school indoctrination is marvelous training process several hours should be spent on this and one shouldnt run it just with one coach but with two or three others as well because everybody develops his own abreactive pattern it is wonderful opportunity to abreact your insanities an auditor will very sw iftly learn how to stop one preclear but take two or three more swapping teams around and he eventually gets smooth look at the whole thing there isnt such thing as being too tiny to handle too big preclear the next level of indoctrination is tone 40 on an object actually all these are groups and number of techniques of indoctrinati on could be evolved from each one of these i am simply giving you those that have to be passed in this tone 40 on an object you can the five levels of indoctrination 3 pab 152 15159 trs reference pack 39 trs have number of commands and variations of one kind or another but the one we use is this you take an object small doll ashtray coke bottle and the auditor tells it to sit down in that chair or sit on the table and thanks it then he tells it to stand up and thanks it sit down on the chair or sit on the tabl then the auditor moves it with his own hands he does all this while the coach is just standing there heckling him and he has to do it so that his intention is so good that he gets perpetually surprised that the thing the object didnt sit down in the chair or s it on the table or didnt stand up the furthermost extremity of this would be that the object would do so without any further contact with the auditor than his intention that point may be reachable i must tell you that person does this until his tone in giving the commands is tone 40 there are many little drills that come into this one is to make him put the intention into it and squeak and not say word at the same time but put the inte ntion into it and alter his voice all over the place until he finds out that his intention doesnt have anything to do with his voice or tone he will eventually discover what tone 40 is tone 40 is positive postulate with counterthought expected anticipated or anything else that is total control actually today we use the word control very loosely what we really mean is positive postulation what the world means by control is if he doesnt do it shoot him not tone 40 but tone 4 in order to get tone 40 on person going you can continue tone 40 on an object but whether this belongs to tone 40 on person or belongs to the last end of tone 40 on an ob ject doesnt much matter it is not separate level but it is separate command you give the 8c commands to an object and lug it around for little while ie having the object move over and touch the wall etc but that is onl getting the person used to these commands in that tone that is the only reason there is fo r it we dont use the 8c commands to get his drill in because he is going to get heckled what does the coach do on tone 40 on an object at first he is really helpful and tries to get the auditor to get the intention in ther until he can put the intention in without spea king when the fellow is getting too good the coach must remember that this tone 40 on person is going to be up against somebody with counterthought countereffort and counter action of one kind or another and the coach fu rnishes it he doesnt do it loudly or obstrepe rously but he does furnish it is that tone 40 are you absolutely sure that was tone 40 what do you mean by tone 40 etc this is wh the coach isnt being helpful the coach is supposed to furnish randomity as substitute for the randomity of the environment the person can do this in spite of the fact that something or somebody is resisting him heckling him and messing him up you could go much furt her with this as i say one can go much further with each one of the five levels of indoctrination but i dont advise it on tone 40 on person we do 8c at tone 40 and that is total accurate estimation of effort with halts or jagged motions that is smooth your estimati on of effort must be absolutely perfect your estimation of intention must also be perfect which is sometimes rather hard on coach because somebody can get so good that coachs body starts to walk around and obey the commands rather easily and you find almost all coaches on tone 40 on person are much more docile than on high school indoc they really want to be rougher but the technique is rather overweighing this is too strong the five levels of indoctrination 4 pab 152 15159 trs reference pack 40 trs those are the five levels of indoctrinati on and they are only doing this placing an au ditor into frame of mind and an ability wh ere his postulates can be positive and his com mand is longer diffident where he can cont rol and handle somebody where he can assume the attitude that is necessary to an auditor and person is all through with these when the instructor is sure that the auditor in training can do this hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of

desperate by now good pc enough to go fishing auditor well okay all right now pc is not always sure he has answered the question so he often changes his mind if the auditor gives him tone 40 or any acknowledge ment at all in between pcs reply the au ditor is wrong you just dont encourage pc with lot of agreement oks and yess in the middle of answers the pc answers the pc is sure he has answered and the auditor then acknowled ges after all it is the pc that must be satisfied there are many ways to misacknowledge pc but any misacknowledgement is only and always failure to end the cycle of command auditor asks pc replies and knows he has answered auditor acknowledges pc knows uditor has acknowledged that is full audi ting command cycle dont forget it and expect process to work it wont

the pc is not re he has answered and that the auditor has accepted the answer the pc will get benefit from the auditing and thats how important that is mood can be expressed by an acknowledgeme nt evaluation can also be accomplished by acknowledgement depending on the tone of voice with which it is uttered there is nothing bad about expressing mood by acknowledgement except when the

the cchs were run without 2way comm and with militant even vicious attitude see hco bulletins of april 5 and 121962 emeter needle drills which caused the stude nt to believe that every action of the needle was read and prevented threequarters of all sc ientologists from ever getting rudi ments in or questions cleared see hco bulle tin of may 251962 and 2 saint hill lectures of may 24 1962 in the matter of the cchs we were deprived of their full use for 5 years and extended the time in processing 25 times more than shoul d have been consumed for any result this came from trs 69 which are hereby scrapped in the matter of the emeter it is probable that all auditing failures and widely exten ded false ideas that scientology did not work st em from the improper conception of what ac tion of the needle one cleaned up this came fr om needle reading trs where instructors had students calling off every activity of the needle as read whereas only the needle action at the exact end of the question was used by the uditor auditors have thought all needle ac tions were reads and tried to clean off all need actions except in some cases the end ac tions this defeated the meter completely and upset every case on which it was practised this accounts for all auditing failures in the past two years cchs must be taught exactly as they are used in session complete with twoway command comm

compartmenting questions only teach proper use only use trs whic h exactly parallel use of scientology in session and do not give an impression that something else is used i have seen clearly that scientologys eff ectiveness could be destroyed by teaching via trs which can be interpreted by student as the way to audit when in fact one does not audit that way or use the data in auditing there

matter of good form the reason some students do not accomplish aud iting is that they become so oriented on form alone that they forget the purpose of the form good auditing form and correct sessioning obt ains many times the result of bad form and incorrect sessioning but total form and effo rt to do something for the pc results in auditing the result comes before the form in importa nce

fo r the state of the pc during and after sessi ons and made to know that as an auditor he is there to get fast good result the student should then be taught that he can get better faster result with better form after that the student should be taught that scientology results are only obtained by correct and exact duplica tion of scientology processes not by off beat variations the student wants to know how to do this or that refer him to his materials on how to do the most fundamental actions but make him or her do it and keep up running refrain that you want results results results on his pc the student will be all thumbs and faint th supervisor may be horrified by the goofs but dont bother with the goofs just demand resu lts on the pc results on the pc results on the pc this action by

know these are the barriers to training and good auditor the gradient approach to the mind is vital clearing will not occur without it but the gradient approach to auditing can be overdone to point where the student completely loses sight of why he is auditing 1 first and foremost the auditor accomplishes something for the pc and without that the re is neither sense nor purpose to auditing 2 excellent form accomplishes more for the pc faster and 3 exact duplication of processes alone returns standard high level results on all pcs the student thrown in over his head learns results in the pc depend on the auditor and auditing and that results are expected from auditing b that results can be obtained in auditi ng and the better the form and duplication the better the results and c that the student has more to learn about auditing and that the student doesnt yet know therefore the supervisor must teach the student that he or she is supposed to get results in auditing b that scientology can obtain results and c that better form and duplication obtain better faster results ___________________ i dare say many students learn things just because they are told to and find

he says in his texts gha on search we find this means g reenwich hour angle on further search we find this means what angle some heavenly body fo rms when related to greenwich as zero on further

appears at an increasing number of degrees from greenwich england as the day advances because he starts from noconfront of ship or plane position he then carries confront through the whole subject if man isnt lost as he begins to navigate he very of ten is when he finishes actually ship or plane is ever lost as to position one knows he is on earth and in what ocean and on what side of what ocean and the subject really should be one which merely lets one correct his position bit man in this subject of navigation even scor ns direct observation confront and calls it jackass navigation in actual

found that any complexity stemmed from an initial point of nonconfront this is why looking at or recognizing th source of an aberration in processing blows it makes it vanish mental mass accumulates

execute the commands he gives under the head ing of training stress is included the various ways and means of getting the student to achieve the goals of this training step during the early part of this drill say in the first coaching session the student should be coached in the basic parts of the drill one at time first locate the space which includes himself and the ashtray but not more than that much second ve him locate the object in that space third upper indoc trs 3 hcob 7568 trs reference pack 71 trs have him command the object in the loudest possi ble voice he can muster this is called shou ting the coachs patter would run something lik this locate the sp ace locate the object in that space command it as loudly as you can acknowledge it as loudly as you can command it as loudly as you can acknowle dge it as loudly as you can that would complete two cycles of action when shouting is completed then have student use normal tone of voice with lot of coach attention on the student getting the intention into the object next have the student do the drill while us ing the wrong commands ie saying thank you while placing in the object the intention to stand up etc next have the student do the drill silently putting the intention in the object without even thinking the words of the com mand or the acknowledgement the final step in this would be for the coach to say start then anything else he said would not be valid on student with the exception of flunk and thats it here the coach would attempt to di stract the student using any verbal means he could to knock the student off tone 40 physical heckling would not be greater than tapping the student on the knee or shoulder to get his ttention when the student can maintain tone 40 and get clean intention on the object for each command and for each acknowledgement the drill is flat there are other ways to help the student ong the coach occasionally asks are you willing to be in that ashtray when the student has answered then are you willing for thought to be there instead of you then continue the dr ill the answers are not so important on these two questions as is the fact th at the idea is brought to the students attention another question the coach asks the student is did you really xpect that ashtray to comply with that com mand there is drill which will greatly increase the st udents reality on what an intention is the coach can use this drill three or four times during the training on tone 40 on an object as follows think the thought i am wild fl ower good think the thought that you are sitting in chair good imagine that thought being in that ashtray good imagine that ashtray containing that thought in its s ubstance good now get the ashtray thinking that it is an ashtray good get the asht ray intending to go on being an ashtray good get the ashtray intending to remain where it is good have the ashtray end that cycle good put in the ashtray the intention to re main where it is good this also helps the student get reality on placing an intention in something apart from himself stress that an intention has nothing to do with words and has nothing to do with the voice nor is it dependent upon thinking certain words an intention mu st be clear and have counterintention in it this training drill tone 40 on an object us ually takes the most time of any drill in upper indoc

whether or not he wants to if the stu dent is really getting the intention across after the coach is satisfied with the students ability to get the intention across the coach should then do all he can

coach just dont do it with r eason with purpose have the purpose in mind for the student to get better understanding of th training drill and to do it to the best of his ability 2 coach with reality be realistic in your coaching when you give an origination to student really make it an origination not just something that the sheet said you should say so that it is as if the student was having to handle it exactly as you say under real conditions and circumstances this does not mean however that you really feel the things that you are giving the student such as saying to him my leg hurts this does not mean that your leg should hurt but you should say it in such manner as to convey to the st udent that your leg hurts another thing about this is do not use any experiences from your past to coach with be inventive in present time 3 coach with an intention behind all your coaching should be your inte ntion that by the end of the session your student will be aware that he is doing better at the end of it than he did at the beginning the student must have feeling that he has accomp lished something in the training step matter how small it is it is your intention and always should be while coaching that the student you are coaching be more able person and have greater understanding of that on which he is being coached 4 in coaching take up only one thing at time for example using tr 4 if the student arrives at the goal set up for tr 4 then check over one at time the earlier trs is he conf ronting you does he originate the question to you each time as his own and did he really in tend for you to receive it are his acknowledg ments ending the cycles of communication etc but only coach these things one at time never two or more at time make sure th at the student does each thing you coach him on correctly before going on to the next training st ep the better student gets at particular coaching 2 hcob 24568 trs reference pack 74 trs drill or particular part of drill you should demand as coach higher standard of ability this does not mean that you should be never sa tisfied it does mean that person can ways get better and once you have reached certain plateau of ability then work toward new plateau as coach you should always work in the direction of better and more precise coa ching never allow yourself to do sloppy job of coaching because you would be doing your student disservice and we doubt that you would like the same disservice if you are ever in doubt about the correctness of what he is doing or of what you are doing then the best thing is to ask the supervisor he will be very glad to assist you by referring you to the correct ma terials in coaching never give an opinion as such but always give your directions as direct statement rather than saying i think or well maybe it might be this way etc as coach you are primarily responsible for the session and the results that are obtai ned on the student this does not mean of course that you are totally responsible but that you do have responsibility toward the student and the session make sure you always run good control on the student and give him good directions once in while the student will start to rationa lize and justify what he is doing if he is doing something wrong he will give you reasons why and becauses talking about such things at great length does not accomplish very much the only thing that does accomplish the goals of the tr and resolves any differe nces is doing the training drill you will get further by doing it than by talking about it in the training drills the coach should coach with the material given under training stress and purpose on the training sheet these training drills occasionally have tende ncy to upset the student there is pos sibility that during drill student may become angry or extremely upset or experience some misemotion should this occur the coach must not back off he should continue the training drill until he can do it without stress or duress and he feels good about it so dont back off but push the student through what ever difficulty he may be having there is small thing that most people forget to do and that is telling the student when he has gotten the drill right or he has done good job on particular st ep besides correcting wrongnesses there is also complimenting rightness you very definitely flunk the student fo r anything that amounts to selfcoaching the reason for this is that the student will tend to introvert and will look too much at how he is doing and what he is doing rather than just doing it as coach keep your attention on the student and how he is doing and dont become so interested in what you yourself are doing th at you neglect the student and are unaware of his ability or inability to do the drill correctly it is easy to become interesting to student to make him laugh and act up bit but your ma in job as coach is to see how good he can get in each training drill and that is what you should have your attention on that and how well he is doing coaching 3 hcob 24568 trs reference pack 75 trs to large degree the progress of the student is determined by the standard of coa ching being

1974 basic auditing series 4r communication cycles within the auditing cycle taken from the lrh tape comm cycles in auditing 25 july 1963 the difficulty that an auditor gets into is normally found in his own auditing cycle there are basically two communication cycles between the auditor and the pc that make up the auditing cycle they are cause distance effect with the aud itor at cause and the pc at effect and cau distance effect with the pc at cause and the auditor at effect cause distance effect auditor pc effect distance cause these are completely distinct one from th other the only thing that connects them and makes an auditing cycle is the fact that the auditor on his communication cycle has calculatingly restimulated something in the pc which is then discharged by the pcs commu nication cycle what the auditor has said has caused restim ulation and then the pc needs to answer the question to get rid of the restimulation if the pc does not answer the question he doesnt get rid of the restimulation that is the game that is being played in an auditing cycle and that is the entirety of the game some auditing breaks down because the auditor is unwilling to restimulate the pc there is little extra communication cycle on here the auditor says thank you and you have this as the acknowledgement cycle trs reference pack 86 trs c command auditor answer c pc c acknowledgment now there are some little inner cycles that can throw you off and make you think that there are some other things to the auditing cycle there is another little shadow cycle it is the observation of has the pc received the auditing command this is such tiny cause that nearly all auditors who are having any trouble finding out whats going on with the pc are missing this one does he receive it actually there is another cause in here and youre missing that one when youre not perceiving the pc you can tell by looking at the pc that he di dnt hear or understand what youd said or that he was doing something peculia r with the command he was receiving whatever that message is in response it rides on this line did pc receive understand and c answer command c command auditor pc answer c c acknowledgment an auditor who isnt watching pc at all never notices pc who isnt receiving or understanding the auditing command then all of sudden somewhere along the line there is an arc break and then we do assessments and we patch up the session and all kinds of things go wrong well they actually neednt ever have gone wrong in the first place if this line had been in what is the pc doing completely aside from answering well what he is doing is this other little subcause distance effect line another of these tiny lines is the cause distan ce effect line of is the pc ready to re ceive an auditing command this is the pc causing and it rides up the line across distance is received at the auditor and the auditor perceives that the pc is doing something else it is an important one and you find that audito rs goof that one very often the pcs at tention is still on prior action trs reference pack 87 trs now heres another one has the pc received the acknowledgement sometimes you violate this one you have been acknowledgi ng but youve never seen that he didnt re ceive the acknowledgement that perception has another little tiny one in it that actually co mes on this line it is has the pc answered everything the auditor is watching the pc and the audito r sees that the pc has not said all that the pc is going to say you sometimes get into trouble with pcs that way everything at cau hasnt moved on down the line to effect nd you havent perceived all of the effect and you go into the acknowledgement one before this line has completed itself thats chopping the pcs communication you didnt let the communication cycle flow to its complete end the acknowledgement takes place and of course it cant go through as its an inflowing line and it jams right there on the pcs incomplete outflowing answer line is the pc ready for the command c did pc receive understand and c answer command c command auditor answer c pc c acknowledgment did pc complete the answer and receive c acknowledgment so if you want to break it all down there are six communication cycles which make up one auditing cycle six not more than six unless you start running into trouble if you violate one of these six communication lines you of course are going to get into trouble which causes mishmash of one kind or another there is another communication cycle inside th auditing cycle and that is at the point of the pc its little additional one and its between the pc and himself this is him talking to him youre listening to the inside of his skull when youre examining it it actually can be mul tiple as it depends upon the complications of the mind this happens to be the least important of all the actions except when it isnt being do ne and of course its the hardest to detect when it isnt being done pc says yes now what has the pc said yes to and sometimes you are insufficiently curious and that in essence is this internal perception of line it includes this cause distance effect backflash here is the pc answering the command i gave him so with this there are seven communication cycles involved in an auditing cycle it is multiple cycle communication cycle consists of just cause distance effect with intention attenti on duplication and understanding how many of these are there in one auditing cycle trs reference pack 88 trs youd have to answer that with how many principal ones there are because some auditing cycles contain few more if pc indicates that he didnt get the command cause distance effect the auditor would give repeat of it cause distance effect and that would add 2 more communication cycles to the auditing cycle so youve got 9 because there was flub so anything unusual that happens in session dds to the number of communication cycles in the auditing cycle but they are still all part of the auditing cycle repetitive commands as an auditing cycle is doing the same cycle over and over gain now there is completely different cycle inside the same pattern the pc is going to originate and its got nothing to do with the auditing cycle the only thing they have in com mon is that they both use communication cycles but this is brand new the pc says so mething that is not germane to what the aud itor is saying or doing and you actually have to be alert for this happening at any time and the way to prepare for it is just to realize that it can happen at any time and just go into the drill that handles it dont get it confused with the drill that you have as an auditing cy cle consider it its own drill you shift gears into this drill when the pc does something unexpected and by the way this handles such thing as the pc originates by throwing down the cans thats still an origin it has nothing to do with the uditing cycle maybe the auditing cycle went to pieces and this origination cycl came in well the auditing cycle cant comple because this origin cycle is now here that doesnt mean that this origin has precedence or dominance but it can start and take place and have to be finished off before the auditing cycle can resume so this is an interruptive cycle and it is cause distance effect the pc causes so mething the auditor now has to originate as the auditor has to understand what the pc is talking about and then acknowledge and to the degree that it is hard to understand you have the cause distance effect of the auditor trying to clarify this thing and every time he asks question hes got new communication cycle you cant put machine action at that point because the thing has to be understood and this must be done in such way that the pc isnt merely repeating his same origination or the pc will go frantic hell go frantic because he cant get off that line hes stuck in time and it really upsets him so the auditor has to be able to understand what the devil the pc is talking about and theres really substitute for simply trying to understand it there is little line where the pc indicates he is going to say something this is line cause distance effect that comes before the origination takes place so you dont run into jam and you dont give the auditing command the effect at the auditors point is to shut up and let him there can be another little line cause distance effect where the auditor indi cates he is listening then there is the origination the auditors acknowledgement of it and then there is the perception of the fact that the pc received the acknowledgement thats your origination cycle an auditor should draw all these communication cycles out on scrap of paper just take look at all these things mock up session and all of sudden it will become very straight how these things are and you wont ve couple of them jammed up whats mainly trs reference pack 89 trs wrong with your auditing cycle is that you have confused couple of communication cycles to such degree that you dont differentiate that they exist thats why you sometimes chop pc who is trying to answer the question you know whether the pc has answered the question or not how did you know even if its telepathy its cause distance effect it doesnt matter how that communication took place you know whether hes answered the command by communication cycle i dont care how you sense this if you are nervy on the subject of handling the basic tool of auditing and if thats gi ving you trouble and if you get into trouble by suddenly breaking it down and analyzing it then it should be broken down and analyzed at time when youre auditing something nice and simple ive given you general pattern for an uditing cycle maybe in working it over you can find couple of extra communication cycles in the thing but they are all there and if you made someone go through each one painstakingl you would find out where his auditing cyc is jammed up it isnt necessarily jammed up on his ability to say thank you it may very well be jammed up in another quarter l ron hubbard lrhntjh founder trs reference pack 90 trs

confronting the first requisite of any subject is the ability to confront the various components things parts divisions of the subject itself all misunderstoods confusions omissions alterations of subject begin with failures or unwillingness to confront the difference between good pilot and bad pilot depends of course on consistent study and practice but underlying this determining whether the person will study and practi ce is the ability to confront the components of study and airplanes quick study by which is meant stude nt who learns rapidly or person who grasps subject quickly has high ability to confront that subject in dramatic profession the wild animal tr ainer who could confront wild animals re mained alive the one who couldnt confront was too slow of perception to live long in more common line of work the fast typist could confront study and typing in the first place and the slow typist couldnt and cant the confusions about talent and native ability and such are resolved to small extent when one recognizes the role played by the ability to confront basically if one can just be there with it he can then achieve the skill of communica ting with whatever it is and handling it thus before communicating with the components of subject can properly begin one must be able to be there comfortably with the components of the subject all power depends upon the ability to hold location to communicate one must be able to hold to location this is even true in the physical universe you cant move chair unless you can hold position yourself near the chair if you dont believe it try it confronting 2 hcob 2671 i trs reference pack 92 trs thus the ability to communicate with precedes the ability to handle but before one can communicate with something one must be able to be in location near it the ageold puzzle of how some scholars can get on subject they have studied and then not be able to apply even scrap of the data is resolved by this fact of confronting they can confront the book the class and the t hought but they havent attained the ability to confront the physical objects of the subject at least such glib students can confront the book the paper the thought they are partway there now all they need to do is confront as well the physical things to which the subject is applied and they would be able to apply what they know some people are not so lucky as to be glib students they have to work up to being there with the book paper classroom and teacher thus confronting is actually the ability to be there comfortably and perceive amazing reactions occur when conscious effort is made to do this dullness percepti on trouble fogginess sleep and even pains emotions and convulsions can occur when one knowingly sets out to be there and comfortably perceive with the various parts of subject these reactions discharge and vanish as one perseveres continues and at last some times soon sometimes after long while one can be there and perceive the component as one is able to confront one part he then finds it easier to confront other compo nents people have mental tricks they use to get around actual confrontingto be disinte rested to realize its not important to be sort of half dead etcbut these discharge run out as well eventually and at last they can just be there and comfortably perceive eye blinks swallows twitches aches pains are all systems of interrupting confron ting and are the symptoms of discomfort there are many of these if they are present then one is not just being there and perceiving confronting on via using relay point is another method of ducking out of it the worst off cannot even tolerate the id ea of being there and perceiving anything they run away even go into emo tional fits rather than be there and perceive such peoples lives are system of interruptions and vias ll substitutes for confronting they are not very successful for success in life depends not on running away from it but by

the student must give every command sounding exactly like the last command is false datum and only serves to mistrain the student into robotic delivery the student must learn to give command and receive an answer and to acknowledge it in one unit of time the student is flunked if he or she fails to get an answer to the question asked if he or she fails to repeat the exact ques tions if he or

right one to face without flinchi ng or avoiding an example in sentence the test of free society is its capacity to confront rather than evade the vital questions of choice there is another meaning to stand facing or opposing especially in challenge defi ance or accusation english is pretty limited language in many ways i imagine the thought of facing something which is what the word came from and originally meant way back front being face was so horrifying to the types who write dictionaries they knew it would be bad in essence it is an action of being able to face if one cannot if he avoids then he is not aware awareness is the ability to perceive the existe nce of in the dictionary it also fails to confront that and says awareness the quality or state of being aware and aware means marked by realization perception or knowledge so these chaps couldnt confront and so conceived awareness to be figurefigure we are moving out of the range of language when we want to say he could stand up to things and wasnt ways shrinking back into himself and avoi ding so he could be fully conscious of the real universe and others around him and thats what confront means if one can confront he can be aware if he is aware he can perceive and act if he cant confront he will not be aware of things and will be withdrawn and not per ceiving thus he is unaware of things around him thats the

in that tone then up to the next tone and the next ie tr 1 done over and over at dying then at the tone of useless and so on up the scale the coach simply has the student do tr i at the partic ular tone level so that the coach and the stu dent are both satisfied that the student has conveyed that tone and the student has win technical fact is that moods or emoti ons are usually automatic which means they are not necessarily under control but tend to contro l the person himself it is as if he is under otherdeterminism technically you can take over the automaticity and put it under beings control just by having him consciously do it over and over you can also change chronic tone level by shifting persons atte ntion from it by making him do something else reference ability 36 and

he sounds more angry coach thats it it sounded more angry but you smiled do it again you feel angry start student gives the line again this time frowning fiercely and in very snarly tone of voice

to do should be spotted by the coach and repeated until the automaticity is broken if mood is too hard for the student to master have him do tr 1 in different beingnesses eg timid student who is trying to sound antagonistic could be asked to do tr 1 as panther lion villain etc if you had him do it as timid bird or some such timid thing that would never be antagonistic you woul d probably have your student where he lived again do such things to student win and dont use it to harass him the whole point is to get him to do tr 1 antagonistically these shifts of beingness help to shift his attention off repulsion to an emotion he cannot easily do once begun mood drills should be continued until the whole scale is flat so the audi tor doesnt get stuck on the tone scale but can do any mood easily and without strain when an auditor is upset about his voice you can ve him try speaking melodiously boringly thusiastically until he can change his voice mood about at will mood drills

sussex hco bulletin of 3 february 1979 issue ii confront tech has to be part of the tr checksheet the inability to confront is basically cau sed by withholds and where person cannot be drilled into confronting he has to have his withholds pulled that he has committed overts and doesnt wa nt them exposed apparently causes him to withhold his attention and the result is his ability to confront is lessened also where person has overts on subject and is withholding he has tendency to complicate that subject and cannot get down to its basic simplicities the world looks very complicated to him probably because his atten tion is wrapped up in his withholds instead of on his real problems or the subject the new discovery here is that person who has overts and withholds on subject cannot perform in that area and introduces complex ities for of course they cant confront it where person cannot take responsibility for his withholds and he is not benefiting casewise from giving them up he is half dead as being it is vicious circle he began to commit overts because he couldnt confront thi ngs and then withheld what he had done be cause he had withholds and could not confront he began to take heavy drugs and alcohol these pushed him toward deadness and further wo rsened his ability to confront and even cau sed him to commit further overts which he then w ithheld and this further deteriorated his abi lity to confront and all this traces back to the fact that he couldnt confront in the first place there is nothing more irresponsible than dead man and when confront drops and withholds enter in one has entered the death slide as being this vicious circle can be handled in pro cessing at various levels and will unsnarl and the person will become alive and able to confr ont

could go out overnight and youd have to get them in again the next morning once an auditors trs are in they are in the way to get your trs in is to do the trs course this doesnt mean that you cant do trs again it is usual to check an auditors trs in cramming and handle any outnesses but once trs have been done fully and honestly they are in and they stay in from there on out 7 hcob 7 apr bra rev

to get through trs course and we re sticking students in on one tr cycling through the trs remedies that but one must as k what it is remedying its remedying bunch of knuckleheadedness and invalidation in the first place cycling through the trs has been given new definition and action the student goes up through the trs until he or she sticks and then starts back at the beginning of the trs it is technical fact that when one cannot do lower level tr one is not likely to do an upper level tr get the student through the trs the hard way each one to pass one at time if the student hangs up or fails on later tr start him or her from the beginning of the trs again 8 hcob 8 dec 74 tr 0 notes on blinking this issue has been misinterpreted by so who figured that because the coach doesnt flunk the student for blink that it was then ok for the student to blink excessively in distracting manner this issue also point s out that the person is thetan and not body but that doesnt mean that it is ok for the st udent to writhe nervously in the chair and call that tr 0 the coach does not flunk person because he blinked nor does he flunk the person because he breathed but theres big differe nce between someone who cant confront who blinks excessively and squirms around nervously and an auditor who can comfortably be the re without flinching or being distractive in ny way to the preclear wh ich would be an audi tor code break good auditor is never distrac tive to pc and person who can confront doesnt have excessive body motion of any kind he can be there comfortably confronting blinkless tr 0 needs to be defined it m eans that when persons tr 0 is in he doesnt exhibit any manifestation of inability to confront including blinking nervously flin chingly or doing anything else

79 ii how to defeat verbal tech trs have been under study and pilot for the past year as just about this time last year it became all too obvious through review of the vi deotaped trs of special corps of auditors as well as those from piloted trs courses that students seemed to have become incapable of mastering the trs this presented mystery as i have always b een able to teach trs effectively in about weeks time give or take few days once th student has his basics in its done by simply getting the student to do it as trs are not think action nor subjective action theyre practical drills on the comm cycle there s nothing subjective about them trs are doingness but we suddenly had entire corps of student auditors unable to master these drills what had happened to the teaching of trs good many months were spent in isolati ng exactly what had gone wrong and it has now all been boiled down to very few factors 1 hard trs had been dropped out 2 doing the communication formula in clay had been omitted those were the two major points of change and when these two were omitted that was it that was the end of anybody being able to do trs one cant master trs without familiarity with the comm cycle one cant master trs with permissive patacake drilling trs are gotten in by drilling them hard trs basics resurrected 2 hcob 241279 trs reference pack 148 trs it is one thing to try to teach hard trs to raw public and it is quite another to make an auditor people studying to become auditors have to be made into auditors its all right to teach mild trs course in division 6 and one should but when it co mes to making auditors there is substitute for hard trs somewhere along the line doing the communication formula in clay as the beginning part of the trs course was dropped out this left the student with slightest concept of why he was doing trs the communication formula is scientology discovery and when you mit teaching it the student suffers from outb asics so the omission of doing the communica tion formula in clay on trs course was fatal there were also three additional factors found to be further influencing the scene 3 student auditors had real understandi ng of the arc triangle thus their commu nication was stuck because their affinity nd reality and therefore their understan ding were deficient 4 the lack of bona fide trs checksheet d opened the way for all kinds of false data to be entered into the subject 5 ignorance of the end phenomena of trs course or why they were doing trs the result of this past years study and pilo ting and the isolation of these factors has now culminated in full and final trs course which will be issued very soon in unalterable book form meantime this bulletin is being issued as holding action to make these errors and omissions in the teaching and drilling of trs broa dly known so that they can be remedied at once wherever auditor trs are being taught omitted checksheet and false data since the cancellation of hco pl 24 may 71 the professional tr course there has been real trs checksheet complete with the basics of communication and the theory of communication which underlie the trs that was huge outbasic right there trs as drills appeared on various checksheets so metimes with several accompanying bulletins but omitted was any thorough preliminary insequence study of the theory upon which the trs are based here we had course without checksheet which made it possible for false data to spring in from various quarters and so it did it wasnt that people were willfully entering false data into the subject it was simply that there was standard checksheet which took the student through the true data and only the true data on the simple basics the arc triangle and the communication formula underlying the trs and then the trs drills themselves with that situation you can get all kinds of false data coming into an area and that is exactly what was found almost one for one the students co ming onto the special piloted courses conduc ted this past year were ridden with false data various types of thi nk and figurefigure and alteris of the tech of the trs trs basics resurrected 3 hcob 241279 trs reference pack 149 trs number of btbs and bpls on the subject c ontributed to this scene and actually per petrated outtech in the area and these ve now been canceled by specific title by hcob 23 sep 79 cancellation of destructive btbs and bpls on trs which lists and corrects the outnesses these issues introduced further handling is to give the student the true data on communication and trs as covered in the chapters on arc in problem s of work and fundamentals of thought the chapters on communication in dianetics 55 and hcob 16 aug 71r trs remoderni zed as he studies this one then digs up and strips off the false data accumulated on the sub ject or drill using hco pl 7 aug 79 false data stripping where false data on subject exists it hits immediately and directly up against the true data and until this conflict is blown by false data stripping the person can be untrainable on the subject thus this brand new tech tool false data stripping is and has been tremendously use ful in correcting tr outnesses and ensuring correct training on the trs it might be noted in passing that the most false subject on the planet at this time is psychology because the mission of psychologist is government one to make the popula tion into controllable zombies the subject is being taught earlier and earlier in schools and lot of your students and even supervisors have been subjected to this propaganda and false data about man and the mind i recall that the people it took longest to get through trs cour ses were professional psychologists the basis of this is false data they are loaded with it it is not that psychology teaches anything about co mmunication they never heard of the subject until we came along but that they simply have so many false data about life that they actually cant study or drill in life subject such as scientology and you may find it necessary to clean this up this prevents horrible slows on tr s courses its not an action that would be done in the course of course but would be done in review the communication formula in clay the trs are drills on the various parts of the communication formula this basic datum seems to have become obscu red in recent years it appeared that to many trs were considered to be drills that we re done for the sake of doing drills with only some vague accompanying idea of their actual use or application or how they related to auditing and an auditing session the truth of the matter is that trs are simp ly the drills that enable person to polish and perfect his comm cycle but if one doesnt know what the cycle of co mmunication is to begin with if one isnt totally familiar with the various parts of the communication formula the trs as drills are not going to make much sense to him drilling beco mes struggle because he doesnt even know what it is hes trying to handle so one of the first things trs student needs is sound understanding of the commu nication formula trs basics resurrected 4 hcob 241279 trs reference pack 150 trs the way to learn the communication formula is to do it in clay that defines it puts it there in the physical universe for him by demonstrating the communication formula all of its parts in clay he will actually see how it works it becomes real to him now he knows what it is hes drilling unfortunately with the cancellation of th 24 may 71 trs checksheet the basic ac tion of demonstrating the communication formula in clay was dropped out and with that real understanding of the use of trs was obscured for many representing the comm formula in clay is now reinstated firmly as vital preliminary step to drilling trs use of the arc triangle even below an understanding of the comm unication formula comes an understanding of the arc triangle now we are getting more basic this turned up as very interesting techni cal factor in reviewing countless tr video tapes this past year it was actually very interesting technical bug i studied and studied these flunked video tr sessions to find the common denominator of all of them and i finally nailed it what i found was that they were specializing in c communication on the arc triangle they were specializing in c but what was out was their affinity and r reality and their c was being pegged it woul d go up just so far because they werent anywhere up the line on their and r as result they couldnt understand anything the other guy wa s saying most of the flubs were on this basis they didnt have any pc there they werent listening to what the pc said the arc was out the bottom the person gets stuck without full use of the arc triangle you can raise the commu nication level but then you have to raise the rea lity and then you have to raise the affinity and then you get some understanding only then can you continue to improve each point of the triangle on most of those videos they were stuck with the communication being raised just bit and that was that because they werent rais ing the affinity and reality levels along with it so they did not advance or improve handling is to make sure the student gets very sound understanding of the arc triangle and its use before he tackles the trs this can be accomplished by having him repr esent it in clay using the chapters on arc in fundamentals of thought and problems of work and chapter vii of dianetics 55 when he knows how and r and c interrelate and how theyre used to bring about understanding hes then prepared to really grasp the communication formula and when he has good familiarity with the communication fo rmula he can drill the trs and polish up his own communication cycle and improve with comparative ease trs basics resurrected 5 hcob 241279 trs reference pack 151 trs trs the hard way when trs the hard way slipped out of use and permissive trs entered the picture the results were less competent auditors and less case gain for pcs auditor trs must be taught rough tough and hard this does not mean invalidative drilling or coaching or supervision it does mean you get the student to do the trs hes got to drill the trs not figurefigure on them or dive into his case to avoid them trs the hard way means stringent spot on coaching and supervision on the proper gradient each button found on the student is fla ttened before it is left flunks are given when the student flunks and when he flunks he goes ri ght back in again and he drills it until hes got it the trs are taught and drilled per the 16 aug 71r bulletin training drills remodernized and per the advices in hcob 23 sep 79 cancellation of structive btbs and bpls on trs the student is coached to wins not losses you make sure he understands the drill and after that its matter of his doing it its matter of keeping him at it getting him through it regard less of what buttons crop up to be flattened until hes mastered each tr and can handle any comm cycle with ease permissive nambypamby patacake trs have place in the training of an auditor or on bona fide trs course student who hasn t mastered his trs wont master any of the training that follows them the way to master trs is to drill them the hard way it is hard trs that make an auditor more gradient approach to trs would be taken on the has course where the ne w scientologist is getting his first taste of how to handle communication in his everyday life and livingness given sound training on the basics arcu and the formula of communication with any false data stripped off and the student then drilled on trs the hard way to perfection youll find he comes through with flying colors to smooth flubless comm cycle and it doesnt take year or even months to accomplish it end phenomenon of trs as the students really had idea of the communication formula as such due to the omission of the requirement that they do it in clay and learn it they of course didnt know where they were going surprising number of students were heard making stupid remarks like i would never use the trs in auditing wh ich is about the same as saying i would ne ver use food when i eat practically students on trs courses d any idea why they were doing trs or what had to be achieved in order to be fini shed product on trs course this unfortunately included the supervisors and of course the coaches so one got all sorts of silly invalidative evaluative teaching and coaching if they didnt know where they were goi ng and what the end phenomenon of trs course was of course they couldnt train student toward it and so trs courses which trs basics resurrected 6 hcob 241279 trs reference pack 152 trs would only involve week or two turned in to months and months of floundering around due to miscoaching and mainly destructive criticism which had purpose instruction and coaching are not based on opinion they should be based on producing the end phenomenon the primary valuable final product of trs is professional auditor who with comm handling alone can keep pc interested in his own case and willing to talk to the auditor the secondary valuable final product of trs is person with the session and social presence of professional auditor and that pre sence can be summed up as being who can handle anyone with communication alone and whose communication can stand up faultlessly to any session or social situation matter how rough the end phenomenon of trs is being who knows he can achieve both of th above flawlessly and from here on out thats the ep and thats the direction all instruction and coaching must take each tr must be in against the standard above as we know the communication formula and as the trs are parts of it the end phe nomenon can be achieved relatively rapidly it is that we know for the first time in mans history the communication formula that make s it possible to drill people on it and produce the above end phenomenon this was major point that was being missed that one was trying to produce something if you dont know what youre trying to produce it can take fore ver cant it prerequisite there is one factor that would effectivel block smooth run through this training ba sics or basics youre not going to get person who has been loaded up with drugs to grasp this data and come out the other end as any kind of product until hes had his drugs handled you now have the purification rundown to ndle that along with objectives and the drug rundown with this fantastic new rundown which is an undercut to all training and processing we have the means to make even the seemingly untrainable trainable summary i wanted to let you know what has been ppening
