bridge publications inc newsletter date using force to create morality now the operating thetan would be the ability also to operate in this universeto operate as thetan to exist as thetan to observe and cause effects in this universe as thetan what effects well fortunately one couldnt get up to the point of causing effects until he got up to an ethic level which would inhibit his causing very bad effects its just like the question of morality you take away all the factors all of the duress threat and force which are supposed to keep somebody intensely oh just intensely moral and where do we find them we find them down in the boys home for immoral and depraved youths well why is it that we find the preachers the worst example in the community why is this this is interesting isnt it tells you that the use of force to create morality does not apparently do so in fact the use of force doesnt create much of anything except more force well person has to be up above the level of penalty to attain state where he can be ethical very well l ron hubbard from the lecture sop 8 contained in the factors admiration the renaissance of beingness lectures the hidden influence an article by l ron hubbard from the factors admiration the renaissance of beingness lectures now would you specialize in live things or mest universe things well the mest universe falls under this classification it is in the category of giving attention receiving attention and not noticing any attention and therefore it is the terminal which the individual will fight unsuccessfully every time theres only one direction in absence of processing that person can go in the mest universe and that is out the bottom and that is because it does not give him the attention which he gives it so therefore he sticksthe mest universe sticks everybody on oneway flow of attention and the attention is never given back and this stuff is just like sponge you put admiration into this stuff and it just goes slurpreal hungry and youd have to be able to make an awful lot of admiration to make very much of this stuff disappear i imagine if you sat still for year or so and poured admiration through here you could probably have fourinch hole bored through the wall but youd have to be pretty good at it you see now to stay out of flows to stay out of this manifestation known as communication lines get him into present time as best you can and handle him from there this technique is definitely recommended and it is technique which apparently is almost nonsense as technique and its terribly simple but itand nail this down know this nowthat by changing his beingness you will change his communication level youre trying to produce change in preclear arent you well youre trying to change his being then arent you the best test of changing his being is did he get communication change you can measure that easily you can say well he sees better that tells you that youve improved his beingness and you walk little bit further down and you fell in hole and that wasnt snake that hit you in the head because the one thing that will always get you in the end is the mest universe and therefore you have to be able to love it very dearly if you dont love it very dearly you cant control it worth darn because its something that is composed of fighting terminals and it is composed to deny you any possible admiration while you give it all guys will get fixed on this universe and theyll look at nothing else but this universe and this very very very horribly sad factterrible fact that life in as high form as man gets so aberrated by the presence of mest that man hasnt got enough sense to realize that his dramatizations against man are immediately derivable from his reactions from the mest universe in other words the reason he hates man is because the mest universe hates him who can salvage man man can so hes running aroundso hes running around hating and spitting and having an awful time and giving admiration like mad well whats the contagious factor it would be the source of all hidden influences which is itself the hidden influence its the sixth dynamic the mest universe youeverybody knows its people that aberrated them everybody knows its people that did this well if everybody knows that you can be darn sure it isnt true why do they work like this well they work like this on homo sapiens because hes on flatplane surface on earth hes on sphere here and hes concentrated this way in other words to turn on this sort of thing you getyou find out the sun doesnt admire you it sunburns you and you find out the earth doesnt admire you it kicks you in the feet sometimes it gives you good hard slap the tools dont admire you and yet youre working from them below and youre expecting something to look up at you or back again and it never does and so you just work more and more and more and get less and less admiration for it and eventually why you just sort of spin in and if this preclear gets that starved for attention he is practically on his way to becoming piece of the mest universe because the mest universe got there by being starved for attention l ron hubbard from the lecture present
