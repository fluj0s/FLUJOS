constitutional principles and federal statutes by henry cohen 3 413 us at 24 citation omitted in pope v illinois 481 us 497 500 1987 the supreme court clarified that the first and second prongs of the miller test appeal to prurient interest and patent offensiveness ar issues of fact for the jury to determine applying contemporary community standards however as for the third prong the proper inquiry is not whether an ordinary member of any given community would find serious literary artistic political or scientific value in allegedly obscene material but continuedchild pornography constitutional principles and federal statutes constitutional principles the first amendment provides congre ss shall make law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press1 in general the first amendment protects pornography with this term being used to mean any erotic material the supreme court however has held that the firs t amendment does not protect two types of pornography obscenity and child pornography consequently they may be banned on the basis of their content and federal law prohibits the mailing of child pornography as well as its transport or receipt in interstate or foreign commerce by any means including by computer obscenity2 most pornography is not legally obscene to be obscene pornography must at minimum depict or descri be patently offensive h ard core sexual conduct miller v california 413 us 15 27 1973 the supreme court has created three part test known as the miller test to determine whether work is obscene the miller test asks whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work taken as whole appeals to the prurient interest b whether the work depicts or describes in patently offensive way sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law and c whether the work taken as whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value3httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95406crs2 3 continued whether reasonable person woul d find such value in the material taken as whole 4 subsequently however the supreme court rejected the claim that under stanley there is constitutional right to provide obscene material for private use united states v reidel 402 us 351 1971 or to acquire it for priv ate use united states v 12 200ft reels of film 413 us 123 1973 the right to posse ss obscene material does not imply the right to provide or acquire it because the right to possess it reflects more than the laws solicitude to protect the privacies of the life within the home id at 127 5 federal law now prohibits some child pornog raphy that was produced without the use of actual minors but the supreme court has declar ed that such child pornography is protected by the first amendment see the disc ussions of section 2252a and section 2256 below 6 in ferber the court noted that trier of fact nee d not find that the material appeals to the prurient interest of the average person it is not required that sexual conduct portrayed be done so in patently offensive manner and the material need not be considered as whole 458 us at 764 7 or federal law for the federal statutor definition of child pornography see section 2256 belowthe supreme court has allowed one ex ception to the rule that obscenity as defined by miller is not protected under the first amendment in stanley v georgia 394 us 557 568 1969 the court held that mere private possession of obscene material is prot ected the court wrote whatever may be the justifications for other statutes regulating obscenity we do not think they reach into the privacy of ones own home if the first amendment means anything it means that state has business telling man sitting alone in his house what books he may r ead or what films he may watch id at 5654 b child pornography child pornography is material that visually depicts sexual conduct by children below specified age5 new york v ferber 458 us 747 764 1982 emphasis in original it is unprotected by the first amendment even when it is not legally obscene ie child pornography need not meet the miller test to be banned6 however the court held in ferber that as with obscenity the conduct to be prohibited must be defined by the applicable state law7 as written or authoritatively construed the category of sexual conduct proscribed must also be suitably limited and described id at 764 in massachusetts v oakes 491 us 576 579 1989 the supreme court considered massachusetts statute that made it crime knowingly to permit child under 18 to pose or to be exhibited in state of nudity for purpose of visual representation or reproduction in any bo ok magazine pa mphlet motion picture f ilmhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95406crs3 photograph or picture the defendant in the case had been convicted for taking topless photographs of his 14yearold ste pdaughter but the massachusetts supreme judicial court reversed on the ground that the statute was overbroad because it would make criminal of parent who takes frontal view picture of his or her naked one yearold running on beach or romping in wading pool id at 581 while the case was pending before th supreme court the statute was amended to allow convictions only where nude pictures are taken with lascivi ous intent this amendment made moot the question of wh ether the statute under which the defendant was convicted was overbroad however it left open the question whether the statute under which the defendant was convicted c ould constitutionally be applied to him ie whether his conduct was protected by the first amendment the supreme court remanded the case for this to be decided in osborne v ohio 495 us 103 1990 the supreme court held that the stanley v georgia right to possess obscene material in ones home does not extend to child pornography the difference is that in stanley georgia primarily sought to proscribe the private possession of obscenity because it was concerned that obscenity would poison the minds of its viewers we responded that whatever the power of the state to control public dissemination of ideas inimical to th public morality it cannot constitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of controlling persons private thoughts id at 109 citations omitted in osborne by contrast the state does not rely on paternalistic interest in regulating osbornes mind rather ohio has enacted its st atute prohibiting possession of child pornography in order to protect the victims of child pornography it hopes to destroy market for the exploitative use of children it is surely reasonable for the state to conclude that it will decrease the production of child pornography if it penalizes those who possess and view the product thereby decreasing demand other interests also support the ohio law first as ferber recognized the materials produced by child pornography permanently record the victims abuse the pornographys continued existence causes the child victims continuing harm by haunting the children in years to come the states ban on possession and viewing encourages possessors of these materials to destroy them second encouraging the destruction of thes materials is also desirable because evidence suggests that pedophiles use ch ild pornography to seduce other children into sexual activity id at 109111 citations omitted in ashcroft v free speech coalition 535 us 234 2002 the supreme court held that child pornography that is pr oduced without using an actual minor is protected by the first amendment we discuss this case in the section below titled section 2256httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95406crs4 8 the summaries and quotations of the statutes in this section of the report include amendments made to the first four of them by the effective child pornography prosecution act of 2007 title i of pl 110358 and by the enhancing the effective prosecution of child pornography act of 2007 title ii of pl 110358 pl 110358 was signed into law on october 8 2008federal child pornography statutes federal child pornography statutes are codified at 18 usc 22512260 these sections including selected c ourt cases that have ruled on their constitutionality or interpreted them are summarized in numerical order after that the childrens internet protection act and the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico are considered to the extent that they incorporate child pornography crimes 18 usc 225122608 section 2251 sexual exploitati on of children subsection of this section makes it crime to use minor in child pornography if the pornography has one of three specified connections to co mmerce the phrase use minor in child pornography in the preceding sentence is synopsis of the following statutory language employs uses persuades induces entices or coerces any minor to engage in or transports any minor in or affecting in terstate or foreign commerce or in any territory or possession of the united states with the intent that such minor engage in any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct subsection b makes it crime for ny parent legal gu ardian or person having custody or control of minor know ingly to permit such minor to engage in child pornography that has one of thr ee specified connections to commerce subsection d makes it crime for an person knowingly to publish notices or advertisements for child pornography or for participation in any act of sexually explicit conduct by or with any minor for the purpose of producing visual depiction of such conduct if such person knows or has reason to know that such notice or advertisement will be transported using any m eans or facility of interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means including by computer or mailed or if such notice or advertisem ent is transported using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means incl uding by computer or mailed section 2251a selling or buying of children this section imposes minimum 30year sentence on any parent gal guardian or other person having custody or control of minor who sells or otherwise transfers custody or control of such minor or offers to sell or otherwise transfer custody or control of such minor 1 with knowledge that as consequence of the sale or transfer the minor will be portrayed in child pornography or 2 with in tent to promote the participation of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95406crs5 9 pl 105314 203a changed 3 or more to 1 or more and added the affirmative defense 10 prior to pl 110358s amending 2252a to change in interstate or foreign commerce continuedminor in child pornography it imposes the same sentence on the person who purchases or otherwise obtains custody or control of the child for one of these purposes custody or control is defi ned to include temporary supervision or responsibility for minor whether lega lly or illegally obtained 18 usc 22567 in order for person to be guilty under 2251a there must be nexus with interstate or foreign commerce namely that in the course of the offense either the minor or the defendant have tr aveled or be transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce the offer for transf er of custody or control have been communicated or transported using any mean s or facility of interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means including by computer or mail or the offense have been committed in territory or possession of the united states section 2252 certain activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors this section unlike 2252a app lies only to child pornography that depicts actual children it makes it crime 1 knowingly to transport or ship child pornography by any means including by computer or mail 2 knowingly to receive or distribute child pornography that has been transported or shipped in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means including by computer or mail and 3 knowingly to reproduce child pornography for distribution in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means including by computer or mail section 2252 also makes it crime in two situations knowingly to possess or to access with intent to view 1 or more books magazine s periodicals films video tapes or other matter which contain any visual depiction of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct it shall be an affirmative defense however that the defendant possessed ss than three matters containing such visual depiction and promptly and in good faith and without re taining or allowing any person other than law enforcement agency to access any such visual depiction took reasonable steps to destroy each such visual depiction or b reported the matter to law enforcement agency and afforded that agency access to each such visual depiction 18 usc 2252c9 the two situations in which the crime of knowing possession and the affirmative defense apply are 1 in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states or on any land or bu ilding owned by leased to or otherwise used by or under the control of the governme nt of the united states or in the indian country as defined in section 1151 of this title and 2 if the material has been mailed or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce or was produced using materials which have been mailed or so shipped or transported by any means including by computer 18 usc 2252a410httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95406crs6 10 continued to in or affecting interstate or foreign co mmerce federal court of appeals reversed conviction under 2252a because the provis ions requirement that child pornography move in commerce signifies movement be tween states and mere connection to the internet would not provide the interstate move ment required by the statute rather the government must prove that an internet tran smission traveled across state lines the court added that in congresss use of the in commerce language as opposed to phrasing such as affecting commerce or facility of inters tate commerce it elected not to reach all the conduct it could have regulated under 2252a united states v schaefer 501 f3d 1197 1201 10th cir 2007 11 977 f2d 815 3d cir 1992 vacated and remanded 510 us 375 1993 32 f3d 733 3d cir 1994 cert denied 513 us 1109 1995 for additional information on the knox case see crs report 94753 the knox clothed children child pornography case and the congressional response by henry cohen out of print available from authorin the most natural grammatical reading of 2252 the word knowingly applies to transporting shipping receiving or distributing child pornography but does not require that the person doing thes things know that the material is child pornography nevertheless in united states v xcitement video inc 513 us 64 1994 the supreme court held that the stat ute must be read to require that the defendant knew that the materi depicted sexually explic it conduct and that at least one of the performers was minor the court read the statute this way because of anomalies that would result from the most natural grammatical reading of the statute and because of the respective presumptions that some form of scienter knowledge is to be implied in criminal statute even if not expressed and that statute is to be construed where fairly possible so as to avoid substantial constitutional questions id at 6869 as for anomalies that would result fro m limiting the application of knowingly to the acts of transporting shipping receiving and distributing the court observed that doing so would make the statute pply to retail druggist who returns an uninspected roll of developed film to customer and would make it apply to new resident of an apartment who receives the mail for the prior resident and stores it unopened as for constitutional stions to be avoided in smith v california 361 us 147 153 1959 the supreme court held that the first amendment prohibits prosecution of b ook distributor for possession of an obscene book unless the distributor has knowledge of the contents of the book in united states v knox the defendant was convict ed of violating 2252 for possessing videotapes that focused on the genitalia and pubic ar ea of minor females even though those body parts we re covered by opaque clothing11 the court of appeals for the third circuit affirmed and the supreme court agreed to hear the case but the solicitor general filed brief for the united states agreeing with the defendant that the statute did not apply to depictions of clothed children in november 1993 the supreme court sent th case back to the third circuit for reconsideration in light of the solicito r generals opinion the third circuit nevertheless in j une 1994 reaffirmed knoxs conviction knox again asked the supreme court to hear the case and this time the solicitor general agreed with the third circuit that the statute applied to pictions of clothed children the supreme court however declined to review th case and knoxs conviction standshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95406crs7 12 as amended by 502b of the protect ac t pl 10821 the phrase exhibition of the genitals or pubic area now appears in 18 usc 22562av 13 18 usc 2252 note congresss expression of the intent of an earlier congress has legal effect as statutory interpretation is the province of the judiciary congress may of course amend statute prospectively but it does not often do so by declaring the intent of congress with respect to statute rather it changes the language of statute one might argue therefore that in this instance cong ress was merely advising the courts as to how to interpret the earlier statute and was not ame nding it however for two reasons the better view seems to be that it was amending the statute first in stockdale v insurance companies 20 wall 87 us 323 331 332 1874 the supreme court addressed statute that provided that an earlier statute shall be construed to noting that there would be resistance to the statute but for the unfortunate and unnecessary use of the word construe the court wrote legislative body may by statute declar the construction of previous statutes so as to bind the courts in reference to all transactions occurring after the passage of the law where it can exercise pow er by passing new statute the form of words which it uses to put this power in operation cannot be material if the purpose is clear and that purpose is w ithin the power are we captiously to construe the use of the word construe as an invasion of the judicial function where the effect of the statute and the pur pose of the statute are clearly within the legislative function second the subsection in question in the 1994 legislation subsection of section 160003 is headed declaration whereas the follo wing subsection subsection b of section 160003 as well as the previous section section 160002 are headed sense of the congress court therefore would likely hol d that congress would have used the phrase sense of the congress in subsection of section 160003 as well if it had not meant to amend the statute because the two provisions that were head ed sense of the congress concern child pornography we quote them in their entirety here continuedbetween the supreme courts two acti ons congress appare ntly amended the statute to apply explicitly to depic tions of clothed children pl 103322 160003a 1994 states the congress declares that in enacting sections 2252 and 2256 of title 18 united states code it was and is the intent of congress that 1 the scope of exhibition of the genitals or pubic area in section 22562e12 in the definition of sexually explicit conduct is not limited to nude exhibitions or exhibitions in wh ich the outlines of those areas were discernible throug h clothing and 2 the requirements in section 2252 1a 2a 3bi and 4bi that the production of visual depiction involve the use of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct of the kind described in section 22562e are satisfied if person photographs minor in such way as to exhibit the child in lascivious manner13httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95406crs8 13 continued sec 160002 it is the sense of the cong ress that each state that has not yet done so should enact legislation prohibitin g the production dist ribution receipt or simple possession of materials depictin g person under 18 years of age engaging in sexually explicit conduct as defined in section 2256 of title 18 united states code and providing for maximum imprisonment of at least 1 year and for the forfeiture of assets used in the commi ssion or support of or gained from such offenses sec 160003b it is the sense of the congress that in filing its brief in united states v knox 921183 and thereby depriving the united states supreme court of the adverseness necessary for full and fair presentation of the issues arising in the case the department of ju stice did not accurately reflect the intent of congress in arguing that the videotapes in the knox case constitute lascivious exhibitions of the genitals or pubic area only if those body parts are visible in the tapes and the minors posed or acted lasciviously 14 federal court of appeals held that use of the internet satisfies the interstate commerce element of the federal law prohibiting the receipt of child pornography 18 usc 2252aa2b united states v mace wan 445 f3d 237 3d cir 2006 the court held in other words that the statute re quires only that the defendant had used an instrumentality of interstate commerce not that the images had crossed state lines pl 110 358 2008 subsequently added the phrase using any means or facility of interstate commerce to the provision 15 in united states v williams 128 s ct 1830 2008 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of 18 usc 2252aa3b it noted that under the provision an internet user who solicits child pornography fro m an undercover agent violates the statute even if the officer possesses child pornography likewise person who advertises virtual child pornography as depicting actual children also falls with in the reach of the statute id at 1839 the court found that these ac tivities are not constitutionally protected continuedsection 2252a this section was created by the child pornography prevention act of 1996 cppa pl 104208 110 st at 3009 26 and amended several times including by the pro tect act pl 10821 2003 the cppa added definition of child pornography to 18 usc 2256 and this definition was also amended by the protect act as so amended it prohibits any digital image computer image or computergenerated image that is or is indistinguishable from that of minor engaging in sexua lly explicit conduct even if actual minor was used to produce the image this defi nition before and after its amendment by the protect act is disc ussed below under section 2256 with respect to child pornography as so defined 2252a as amended by the protect act imposes essentially the same prohibitions as 2252 which were described above specifica lly 2252aa makes it cr ime knowingly to 1 mail transport or ship child pornography in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means including by computer 2 receive or distribute child pornography that has been mailed shipped or tran sported in violation of 114 3a reproduce any child pornography for distribution in viola tion of 1 3b advertise promote present distribute or solicit any material in manner that reflects the belief or that is intended to cause another to believe that the material is child pornography that is obscene or that depicts an actual minor15 4 sell or possess with the intent to sellhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95406crs9 15 continued because offers to engage in illegal tr ansactions as opposed to abstract advo cacy of illegality are categorically excluded from fi rst amendment protection even when the offeror is mistaken about the factual predic ate of his offer such as when the child pornography that one offers to buy or sell does not exist or is constitutionally protected id at 1841 1842 1843 16 federal court of appeals upheld conviction under 2252aa5b finding that congress has the power to proscribe pur ely intrastate possession of pornography regardless of whether the pornography had traversed interstate over the internet united states v sullivan 451 f3d 884 dc cir 2006 17 these circumstances are the same as those applicable to knowing possession of child pornography under 18 usc 2252a4 and are spelled out above in the third paragraph under section 2252 18 pl 105314 203b changed 3 or more images to an image section 2252a4 by contrast outlaws knowing possession of 1 or more books etc see note 9 supra 19 the conference report explains that the affirmative defense does not apply to the pandering provisions 2252aa3b or the morphing 22568c provisions hrept 10866 108th cong 1st sess 2003

to minor any visual depiction that is or appears to be of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct for purposes of inducing or persuading minor to participate in any activity that is illegal section 2252ad allows the same affirm ative defense as 2252c to charges of knowing possession ie to charges of violating 2252aa5 in addition the protect act amended 2252ac to allow an affirmative defense to charge of violating 2252aa1 2 3a 4 or 5 that the material was produced using actual persons each of whom was an adu lt or the material was produced without using an actual minor the affirmative defense is not available to charge of violating 2252aa3b or to prosecuti ons that involve child pornography under 22568c which is the portion of th definition of child pornography that covers images that were modified to make it appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct19 this portion was not struck down by ashcroft and was not amended by the protect act section 2252af as added by 510 of the protect act authorizes civil actions by persons aggrieved by viol ation of 18 usc 2252aa or b or 1466a section 2252b misleading domain names on the internet

that the provision does cover namely obscenity nd material that is harmful to minors we note it here because it is codified among the child pornography statutes it makes it crime to knowingly embed words or digital images into the source code of website with the intent to deceive person into viewin g material that cons titutes obscenity or with the intent to deceive minor into viewing material that is harmful to minors it defines harmful to minors as defines in section 2252b section 2253 criminal forfeiture this section provides for criminal forfeiture in child pornography cases

as if the children are engaged in sexually explicit conduc t were not in issue paragraphs b and d by contrast cove r pornography that was produced without the use of actual children in ashcroft the supreme court observed that statutes that prohibit child pornography that use real children are c onstitutional because they target the production of the work not its content 535 us at 249 see also id at 242 the cppa by contrast targeted the content not the means of production virtual child pornography is not intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children as were the materials in ferber id at 250 see also id at 249 the governments rationales for the cppa included that pedophiles might use the materials to encourage children to participate in sexual activity and might whet their own sexual appetite s with it thereby increasing the sexual abuse and exploitation of actual children id at 241 the court found these rationales inadequate because the evil in stion depends upon the actors unlawful conduct conduct defined as cr iminal quite apart from any link to the sp eech in questi on the g overnment cannot constitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of controlling persons priv ate thoughts the government may not prohibit speech because it increases the ch ance an unlawful act will be committed at some indefinite future time without significantly stronger more direct connection the government may not prohibit speech on the ground that it may encourage pedophiles to enga ge in illegal conduct id at 253254 the government also argued that the existence of virtual child pornography can make it harder to prosecute pornographers who do use real minors because as imaging technology improves it becomes more difficult to prove that particular picture was produ ced using actual children id at 242 this analysis the court found turns the first ame ndment upside down the government may not suppress lawful speech as mean s to suppress unlawful speech the possible harm to society in permitting so unprotected speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that protect ed speech of others may be muted id at 255 the court also noted that because child pornography unlike obscenity may include material with serious literary artistic political or scientific value it includes any depiction of sexually explicit ac tivity matter how it is presented the cppa therefore applies to picture in psychology manual as well as movie depicting the horrors of sexual abuse teenage sexual activity and the sexual abuse of children have inspir ed

struck down the ban on virtual child pornography justices rehnquist wrote dissenting opinion joined by justice scalia arguing that the cppa should be construed to apply only to computergenerated

any person is exhibited ii graphic or lascivious simulated i bestiality ii masturbation or iii sadistic or masochistic abuse or iii graphic or simulated lascivious xhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person23 the most significant change in the definition of child pornography from the cppa to the protect act as the term pplies to material produced without the use of an actual minor is that instead of in cluding any visual depiction that is or appears to be of minor engaging in xually explicit conduct it now includes only digital image computer image or computergenerated image that

nevertheless the inclusion of digita l image computer image or computer generated image that is or is indistinguishable from that of minor engaging in sexually explicit c onduct is apparently unconstitutional under ashcroft unless the protect acts expanded affirmative defense can save it25 but whether it can seems questionable because defendant who is not the producer of the work may have way of establishing the identity or even the existence of the actors the statute moreover applies to work creat ed before 1996 and the producers themselves may not have preserved the records n ecessary to meet the burden of proof26 these aspects of the cppa which the court in ashcroft called serious constitutional difficulties were not changed by the protect act27 the court in ashcroft did not decide however whether the govern ment could impose this burden of proving that his speech is not unlawful on speaker28 section 504 of the protect act created 18 usc 1466a29 which makes it crime knowingly to produce distribute r eceive or possess with or without intent to distribute visual depi ction of any kind including drawing cartoon sculpture or painting that depicts minor enga ging in sexually explicit conduct and is obscene or lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value this provision applies whether an actual minor is used or not but covers only depictions of minors engaged in specified sexual activities and not in lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area section 1466a allows the same affirmative defense to charges of knowing possession without intent to distribute that appears in 18 usc 2252c and 2252ad it does not however allow the same affirmative defense that appears in 2252ac that the mate rial was produced using actual persons each of

the crimes specified in 18 usc 2260 to the definition rico makes it crime for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce to participate in the affairs of the enterprise through pattern of rack eteering activity 18 usc 1962c pattern of racketeering activity means at least two acts of racketeering activity within ten years excluding any period of imprisonment 18 usc 19615 thus if person engages in two such activities which may include the child pornography offenses specified he is subj ect to prosecution under rico in addition to or instead of prosecution for the particular activities rico also provides for criminal fo rfeiture 18 usc 1963 in fort wayne books inc v indiana 489 us 46 1989 the supreme court held that pretrial seizure under the indiana rico statute of books or other expre ssive materials was unconstitutional although probable cause to believe that person has committed crime is sufficient to arrest him probable cause to believe that there are valid grounds for seizure is insufficient to inte rrupt the sale of presumptively protected books and films id at 66 this presumption of first amendment protection is not rebutted until the claimed justification fo r seizing books or other publications is properly established in an adversary proceeding id at 67 the federal rico statute in any event does not provide for pretrial seizure41 in fort wayne books the court did however uphold the constitutionality of including obscenity violations among the predicate offenses under rico statute the court rejected the argument that the potential punishments available under the rico law are so severe that the statute lacks necessary sensitivity to first amendment rights id at 57 further the court held that such obscenity violations need not be affirmed convi ctions on successive dates in the same jurisdiction as that where the rico charge is brought id at 61 the fact that the violati ons need not be affirmed convictions means that the obscenity violations may be proved as pa rt of the rico prosecution warning shot in the form of prior conviction fo r obscenity is required as long as the standard of proof is the pr oper one with respect to all the elements of the rico allegation including proof beyond r easonable doubt of the requisite number of constitutionally proscribable predicate acts all of the relevant constitutional requirements have been met id there appears to be reason why the principles the court stated in fort wayne books with respect to obscenity violations under rico would not apply equally to child pornography violationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95406crs19 42 18 usc 1957a see crs report rs22401 money laundering an abridged overview of 18 usc 1956 and re lated

limitations to rico forfeitures of assets that consist of expressive materials that are otherwise protected by the first amendment the defendant in the case had been found guilty of selling four ma gazines and three videotapes that were obscene and on that basis had been c onvicted under rico he was sentenced to six years in prison fine d 100000 an d ordered to pay the cost of prosecution incarceration and supervised release he wa s also ordered to forfeit all his wholesale and retail businesses including more than dozen stores and theaters dealing in sexually explicit material all the assets of these businesses ie expressive materials whether or not obscene and almost 9 milli on the government chose to destroy rather than sell the expressive material the supreme court rejected the argument that the forfeiture of expressive materials constitutes prior restraint as the forfeiture order does not forbid petitioner from engaging in any expressive activities in the future nor does it require him to obtain prior approval for any expressive activities id at 550551 emphasis in original consequently the court an alyzed the forfeiture under normal first amendment standards and could see reason why if incarceration for six years and fine of 100000 are permissible form s of punishment under the rico statute the challenged forfeiture of certain assets directly related to petitioners racketeering activity is not the first amendment does not prohibit either stringent criminal sanctions for obscenity offenses or forfeitu re of expressive ma terials as punishment for criminal conduct id at 554 the court did however remand the case to the court of appeals to decide whether the forfeiture constituted an exce ssive fine under the eighth amendment the same day in austin v united
