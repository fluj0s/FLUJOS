frank morales towardfreedomcom this article was originally published by towardfreedomcom october 26 2006in stealth maneuver president bush has signed into law provision which according to senator patrick leahy dvermont will actually encourage the president to declare federal martial law 1 it does so by revising the insurrection act set of laws that limits the presidents ability to deploy troops within the united states the insurrection act 10 usc331 335 has historically along with the posse comitatus act 18 usc1385 helped to enforce strict prohibitions on military involvement in domestic law enforcement with one cloaked swipe of his pen bush is seeking to undo those prohibitionspublic law 109364 or the john warner defense authorization act of 2007 hr5122 2 which was signed by the commander in chief on october 17th 2006 in private oval office ceremony allows the president to declare public emergency and station troops anywhere in america and take control of statebased national guard units without the consent of the governor or local authorities in order to suppress public disorderpresident bush seized this unprecedented power on the very same day that he signed the equally odious military commissions act of 2006 in sense the two laws complement one another one allows for torture and detention abroad while the other seeks to enforce acquiescence at home preparing to order the military onto the streets of america remember the term for putting an area under military law enforcement control is precise the term is martial lawsection 1076 of the massive authorization act which grants the pentagon another 500plusbillion for its illadvised adventures is entitled use of the armed forces in major public emergencies section 333 major public emergencies interference with state and federal law states that the president may employ the armed forces including the national guard in federal service to restore public order and enforce the laws of the united states when as result of natural disaster epidemic or other serious public health emergency terrorist attack or incident or other condition in any state or possession of the united states the president determines that domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the constituted authorities of the state or possession are incapable of refuse or fail in maintaining public order in order to suppress in any state any insurrection domestic violence unlawful combination or conspiracyfor the current president enforcement of the laws to restore public order means to commandeer guardsmen from any state over the objections of local governmental military and local police entities ship them off to another state conscript them in law enforcement mode and set them loose against disorderly citizenry protesters possibly or those who object to forced vaccinations and quarantines in the event of bioterror eventthe law also facilitates militarized police roundups and detention of protesters so called illegal aliens potential terrorists and other undesirables for detention in facilities already contracted for and under construction by halliburton thats right under the cover of trumpedup immigration emergency and the frenzied militarization of the southern border detention camps are being constructed right under our noses camps designed for anyone who resists the foreign and domestic agenda of the bush administrationan article on recent contract awards in recent issue of the slick insider journal of counterterrorism homeland security international reported that global engineering and technical services powerhouse kbr kellog brown root announced in january 2006 that its government and infrastructure division was awarded an indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity idiq contract to support us immigration and customs enforcement ice facilities in the event of an emergency with maximum total value of 385 million over five year term the report notes the contract is to be executed by the us army corps of engineers for establishing temporary detention and processing capabilities to augment existing ice detention and removal operations dro in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the us or to support the rapid development of new programs the report points out that kbr is the engineering and construction subsidiary of halliburton 3 so in addition to authorizing another 5328 billion for the pentagon including 70billion supplemental provision which covers the cost of the ongoing mad military maneuvers in iraq afghanistan and other places the new law signed by the president in private white house ceremony further collapses the historic divide between the police and the military telltale sign of rapidly consolidating police state in america all accomplished amidst ongoing us imperial pretensions of global domination sold to an emergency managed and seemingly willfully gullible public as global war on terrorismmake mistake about it the defacto repeal of the posse comitatus act pca is an ominous assault on american democratic tradition and jurisprudence the 1878 act which reads whoever except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the constitution or act of congress willfully uses any part of the army or air force as posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years or both is the only us criminal statute that outlaws military operations directed against the american people under the cover of law enforcement as such it has been the best protection weve had against the powerhungry intentions of an unscrupulous and reckless executive an executive intent on using force to enforce its willunfortunately this past week the president dealt posse comitatus along with american democracy near fatal blow consequently it will take an aroused citizenry to undo the damage wrought by this horrendous act part and parcel as we have seen of long train of abuses and outrages perpetrated by this authoritarian administrationdespite the unprecedented and shocking nature of this act there has been outcry in the american media and little reaction from our elected officials in congress on september 19th lone senator patrick leahy dvermont noted that 2007s defense authorization act contained widely opposed provision to allow the president more control over the national guard adopting changes to the insurrection act which will make it easier for this or any future president to use the military to restore domestic order without the consent of the nations governorssenator leahy went on to stress that we certainly do not need to make it easier for presidents to declare martial law invoking the insurrection act and using the military for law enforcement activities goes against some of the central tenets of our democracy one can easily envision governors and mayors in charge of an emergency having to constantly look over their shoulders while someone who has never visited their communities gives the ordersa few weeks later on the 29th of september leahy entered into the congressional record that he had grave reservations about certain provisions of the fiscal year 2007 defense authorization bill conference report the language of which he said subverts solid longstanding posse comitatus statutes that limit the militarys involvement in law enforcement thereby making it easier for the president to declare martial law this had been slipped in leahy said as rider with little study while other congressional committees with jurisdiction over these matters had chance to comment let alone hold hearings on these proposalsin telling bit of understatement the senator from vermont noted that the implications of changing the posse comitatus act are enormous there is good reason he said for the constructive friction in existing law when it comes to martial law declarations using the military for law enforcement goes against one of the founding tenets of our democracy we fail our constitution neglecting the rights of the states when we make it easier for the president to declare martial law and trample on local and state sovereigntysenator leahys final ruminations since hearing word couple of weeks ago that this outcome was likely i have wondered how congress could have gotten to this point it seems the changes to the insurrection act have survived the conference because the pentagon and the white house want itthe historic and ominous rewriting of the insurrection act accomplished in the dead of night which gives bush the legal authority to declare martial law is now an accomplished factthe pentagon as one might expect plays an even more direct role in martial law operations title xiv of the new law entitled homeland defense technology transfer legislative provisions authorizes the secretary of defense to create homeland defense technology transfer consortium to improve the effectiveness of the department of defense dod processes for identifying and deploying relevant dod technology to federal state and local first respondersin other words the law facilitates the transfer of the newest in socalled crowd control technology and other weaponry designed to suppress dissent from the pentagon to local militarized police units the new law builds on and further codifies earlier technology transfer agreements specifically the 1995 dodjustice department memorandum of agreement achieved back during the clintonreno regime4it has become clear in recent months that critical mass of the american people have seen through the lies of the bush administration with the presidents polls at an historic low growing resistance to the war iraq and the democrats likely to take back the congress in midterm elections the bush administration is on the ropes and so it is particularly worrying that president bush has seen fit at this juncture to in effect declare himself
