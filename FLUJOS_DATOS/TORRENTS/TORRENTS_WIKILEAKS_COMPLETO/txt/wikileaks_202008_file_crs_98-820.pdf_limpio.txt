yankees inc 346 us 356 357 the court reaffirmed its position although it did note that if there are evils in this field which now warrant application to it of the antitrust laws it should be by legisl ation and not by judi cial action by 1972 the courts expanding interpretation of the comme rce power led it to state unequivocally that professional baseball is business engaged in interstate commerce

considered the antitrustexempt status of professional baseball an anomaly and an aberration in the application of the antitr ust laws both to business generally and to professional sports particularly

st louis cardinals player traded to the philadelphia phillies against his wishes 5 in its final report the house select committee on professional sports 94th congress concluded that adequate justification does not exist for baseballs special exemption from the antitrust laws and the exemption should be remo ved in the context of overall sports antitrust reform inquiry into professional sports january 3 1977 at 60 among the first responses to the committees report was hr 2129sports antitrust reform act of 1979 introduced by representative seiberling the bill was prompted inter alia he indicated upon introduction by the invitations to congress from both the supreme court and the committee on professional sports to legislatively repeal the antitrust exemption enjoyed by baseball alone among professional sports see 125 cong rec 2521 february 13 1979 in the 103rd congress 1 the senate judiciary committee voted not to report s 500 metzenbaum professional baseball reform act of 1993 2 hr 108 bilirakis measure to make the antitrust laws applicable to profe ssional baseball teams and the leagues of which they are part remained pending in the economic and commercial law subcommittee of the house judiciary committee 3 several measures each titled baseball fans protection act to encourage serious negotiation between the major league baseball players and the owners of major league baseball by amending the clayton act to make the antitrust laws applicable to unilateral terms or conditions imposed by any party that has been subject to an agreement between the owners of major league baseball nd labor organizations representing the players of major league baseball were introduced immedi ately prior to or at the beginning of the 1994 baseball strike 4 house laborspecific measures were the focus as group of september 1994 hearings before the economic and commercial law subcommittee or the house judiciary committee 5 hr 4994 synar baseball fans and communities protection act which continuedbackground professional base ball alone among professional sports has traditionally been considered to enjoy complete exemption from the antitrust laws in 1922 when the national league was sued in an action which alleged that the league had acted in contravention of the antitrust laws to destroy the rival federal league the supreme court ruled that the business of giving exhibiti ons of baseball coul d not be considered commerce for purposes of federal antitrust jurisdiction3 the court has never reversed its position that the antitrust laws may be made applicable to baseball only by congress although it has had the opportun ity several times to do so4 in the years since the flood decision see note 4 congress had made several attempts to act on the courts invitation but until s 53 in the 105th congress none was successful5 in addition to clarifying thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98820crs3 5 continued specifically exempted from its coverage nonmajor league baseball clubswas reported by the judiciary committee hrept 103871 but not acted upon and 6 s 2380 metzenbaum baseball fans protection act of 1994 which did not contain the minor l eague exemption was placed on the calendar but not acted upon by the full senate more than dozen measures to make the an titrust laws either unqualifiedly applicable to professional baseball generally or applicable only to specific issues eg playermanagement relations were introduced in the 104th congress which was also energized by the 1994 strike but it too adjourned without having enacted an of them for example senator hatch sponsor of s 53 in the 105th congress sponsored s 627 major league baseball antitrust reform act of 1995 substantially similar to s 53 which would have exempted from otherwise inclusive antitrust coverage for professional baseball the draft any matter related to the minor leagues franchise relocation or the sports broadcasting act of 1961 pl 87331 15 usc 12911295 which allows professional sports t eams to pool their rights to sponsored telecasting of their games without violating the antitrust laws and to pool the revenues received from such telecasts professional baseball is cu riously among the team sports enumerated as enjoying the protection of the act although the thinking when it was enacted in 1961 was that professional baseball did not need the exemption from the antitrust laws because it was not covered in the first place legislation to exclude professional baseball from the antitrust exemption provided by the sports broadcasting act was in fact introduced in both the 103rd hr 1549 bilirakis and 104th hr 105 bilirakis congresses 6 piazza at 421 435 436 the flood court had state d at 407 us 282 it seems appropriate now to say that with its reserve system enjoying exem ption from the federal antitrust laws baseball is in very distinct sense an exception and an anomaly emphasis added 7 644 so 2d 1021 fla s ct 1994the bill was not intended to apply in any way to the minor league arrangements between major league baseball and its farm system the bill also made specifically clear that it did not apply to 1 any activity relating to or affecting the franchise activities of professional baseball eg relocation expansion ownership transfer etc 2 any sportsbroadcasting activities protected under the sports broadcasting act see note 5 or 3 relationships between professional baseball and persons w ho are neither major league baseball players eg umpires nor not in the bus iness of organi zed professional major league baseball while the fact of an antitrust exemption for professional baseball has been recognized since 1922 the extent and scope of baseballs antitrust exemption have been the subject of some recent judicial discussion in the state and lower federal courts for example the piazza court supra note 3 stated in 1993 that the exemption created by federal baseball supra note 2 is limited to baseballs reserve system in each of the three cases in which the supreme court directly addressed the exemption the factual context involved the reserve clause between 1922 and 1972 baseballs expansive view of the scope of its exemption may have been correct in 1972 however the court in flood v kuhn stripped from federal baseball and toolson supra note 3 any precedential value those cases may have had beyond the particular facts there involved ie the reserve clause6 piazza was discussed and its c onclusion endorsed by the florida supreme court in butterworth v nati onal league of professional baseball clubs7 and followed in httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98820crs4 8 663 so 2d 653 fla dist ct app 1995 9 644 so at 1025 10 911 fsupp 454 wd wash 1995 11 id at 457 12 eg connell construction company inc v plumbers steamfitters local union 100 421 us 616 622 1975 the court has recogniz ed that proper accommodation between the congressional policy favoring collective bargai ning under the nlra national labor relations act and the congressional policy favoring free competition in business markets requires that some unionemployer agreements be accorded limited nonstatutory exemption from antitrust sanction meatcutters v jewel tea co 381 us 676 1975 13 66 f 3d 523 2d cir 1995morsani v major league baseball 8 even though the butterworth court recognized that the piazza conclusion is against the great weight of federal cases regarding the scope of the exemption9 on the other hand the united states dist rict court for the western district of washington in mccoy v major league baseball10 rejected the reasoning and results of piazza and butterworth that while the result of federal baseball and toolson that the reserve clause is exempt from the operation of the antitrust laws remains valid the rule of those cases that baseball is totally exempt from the operation of the antitrust laws was fatally undermined by the courts statement in flood that professional baseball is in fact business engaged in commerce the washington court preferred to defer to the courts reiteration in flood 407 us at 285 of its statement in toolson 346 us at 357 that it was sustaining and approving federal baseball so far as that decision determines that congress had inte ntion of including th business of baseball within the scope of the federal antitrust laws11 conclusion despite the enactment of the curt flood act to assure th at major league baseball players will have the same rights under th antitrust laws as do other professional athletes the ability of professional baseba ll players to prevail in court has not been assured and there has not been single cas interpreting 15 usc 26b reported in the annotations to that provision although play ers longer face the possibility of having their cases summarily dismissed because th court cannot exercise jurisdiction over claim which states an antitrus t count another judicially cr eated exemption may not allow the cases to proceed to conclusion the laboran titrust exemption holds that when legitimate conditions of empl oyment are contained with in genuinely negotiated collective bargaining agreement the antitrust laws do not apply to either side of the labor management equation nd may not be used to challenge term or condition even where the antitrust laws might otherwise be utilized to challenge similar term or condition12 for example in caldwell v american basketball association inc13 when professional basketball player attempted to bring an antitrust action against the basketball association its commissioner former team and owners charging that he had been blacklisted and prevented from playin g professional basketba ll as result of his activities as president of players union the court denied his challenge noting that whenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98820crs5 14 id at 527 528there is players union involved the player employee loses the right to bargain for the best price for his or her labor the court also stated that we will assume for purposes of analysis that absent collective bargaining relationship the conduct alleged by caldwe ll would state claim under the sherman antitrust act 15 usc17 nevertheless because caldwells antitrust claims would subvert fundamental princi ples of federal labor policy wood v national basketball assn 809 f2d 954 959 2d cir 1987 they are barred by the socalled nonstatutory exemption the court also noted emphatically that to be sure in sports leagues unionized players generally engage in individual bargaining w ith teams however it must be emphasized that such individual bargaining is not an ex ercise of right to free competition under the antitrust laws rather it is an exercise of right derived from collective bargaining itself14 the stillremaining unanswered question therefore is whether and how the non statutory labor exemption will ffect the efficacy of pl 105297
