acquisition of nns brought to an apparent conclusion 5year process of consolidation in the ownership of the 6 privatesector shipyards that build the navys major ships the 6 yards are now owned by two firms noc which owns 3 of the yards and gd which owns the other 3 in theory the 6 yards might have been consolidated under 3 owners rather than 2 although the consolidation of the owners hip of the 6 yards now appears complete there may be further mergers and acquisiti ons involving shipyards that perform work for the navy dod concluded that the c onsolidationrelated savings of the noc nns merger would be comparable to those of gdnns merger noc stated that these savings might amount to 19 billion to 26 billion over the next 10 years critics of the nocnns merger can argue that it might pose competition concerns in areas such as construction of aircraft carriers and largedeck amphibious ships supporters of the merger can argu that doj and dod reviewed these issues and did not object to the merger on competition or other grounds shipyard mergers are unlikely to lead to significant changes in the total number of bluecollar production workers employed at the yards but can alter the distribution of the total number of bluecollar workers among the yards shipyard mergers may increase the strength of the shipyards and shipbuilding in the competition for limited dod procurement dollars the mergers may raise questions concerning the treatment of shipbuilding in industry proposals for large dod systemofsystems acquisition efforts the mergers may also raise ques tions concerning the movement of senior officials particularly those with back grounds in shipbuilding between dodnavy and industry the debate over the merger proposals invol ving nns raises question regarding the adequacy of the savingsvscompetition framework for describing the merger review process it also poses pot ential question for congress regarding the executive branch view that dod rather than congress or the taxpayers is the sole or primary customer for firm whose products are purchased solely by dod lastly the nocnns merger raises potentia l question regarding the technology

c onstruction contracts th reduction in navy ship procurement that began in the early 1990s reduced work loads employment levels and total profits at several of the yards increased business pressures faced by the yards since the early 1990s appear to have been major factor behind the consolidation in ownership of the yards that has occurred since 1995 the consolidation in ownership among the na

justice today filed an antitrust lawsuit to block the proposed acquisition of newport news shipbuilding inc by general dynamics corporation the department said that if the merger were allowed to proceed it would eliminate competition for nuclear submarines weapon platform of vital importance to the security of the united states resulting in monopoly additionally the department said the proposed acquisition would harm competition for other military ships conventionally powered surface combatants and for the development of electric drive an emerging technology for powering nuclear submarines and surface combatants the department of defense coordinate d with the department of justice in the investigation that resulted in the laws uit and advised the department that it had significant competitive concerns with the transaction this merger would give general dynamics permanent monopoly in nuclear submarines and would substantially lessen competition in surface combatants said charles james assi stant attorney general in charge of the departments antitrust division our arme d forces need the most innovative and highest quality products to protect our county this mergertomonopoly would reduce innovation and ultimately the quality of the products supplied to the military while raising prices to the us military and to us taxpayers general dynamics and newport ne ws are the only manufacturers of nuclear submarines and two of only three companies that build large ships of any kind for the us navy the companies are also leaders on the only two teams working to develop electric drive technology for nuclear submarines and surface combatants we greatly appreciate the assistance of the department of defense in investigating this matter added james justice and defense are united in the view that the proposed merger should not go forward and that competition plays an important role in ensuring that the united states can purchase the best platforms and

avondale and ingalls16 issues for congress previous potential for consolidation to three owners was consolidation of the 6 shipyards under 2 owners inevitable as result of the postcold war downtur n in defense procurement that began in the early 1990s many segments of the defense industry went through process of mergers and acquisitions that consolidat ed ownership under two firms or in some cases under single firm production of tactical aircraft for example was consolidated under two firms boeing nd lockheed martin while production of tanks was consolidated unde r single firm gd not all segments of the defense indus try however have been consolidated under two firms or single firm for ex ample at least thr ee firms are commonly cited as major combat system integrator s boeing lockheed martin and raytheonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs9 17 for discussions of these merger proposals see crs report rl30251 navy major shipbuilder ownership consoli dation issues for congress by ronald orourke washington 1999 may 27 1999 p 410and at least three firms are commonly cited as major military radar makers lockheed martin noc and raytheon in the case of the 6 shipyards consolidation to three firms rather than two may also have been possible following gds acquisition of biw in 1995 which created firm that owned 2 of the 6 yards eb and biw the 4 remaining shipyards might have organized themselves into two add itional 2yard organizations avondale for example might have merged with littoningalls merger that did occur while nns merged with nassco merger that did not occur alternatively avondale might have merged with nns something the two companies proposed but did not implement while littoningalls merged with nassco the possibility of consolidating the 6 shipyards under 3 firms however may have been made less likely by gds n ovember 1998 acquisition of nassco which created diversified shipbuilding organization that owned 3 of the 6 yards and accounted for 40 to 45 of the navys shipbuilding programs on dollar basis this development may have prompted th owners of the 3 remaining yards to question the viability of attempting to continue as smaller and less diversified single yard firms something that at least one of these 3 yards would need to attempt following gds acquisition of nassco if the 6 yards as group were to continue being owned by more than 2 firms events following gds 1998 acquisition of nassco appear to reflect the pressure this acquisition created among the 3 remaining yards to seek mergers with other yards within 6 months of the gdnassco merger the 3 remaining yards became involved in 4 merger proposals nnsavondale proposed in january 1999 gdnns proposed in february 1999 littoningallsavondale proposed in may 1999 and implemented in august 1999 and littonnns proposed in may 199917 in light of this potential pressure to consolidate it may have been unlikely for nns the sole remaining singleyard firm as of august 1999 to remain singleyard organization indefinitely current potential for further shipyard mergers will there be further mergers and acquisiti ons involving shipyards that perform work for the navy with ownership of the 6 yards consolidated under 2 firms the process of consolidation in the ownership of these 6 yards now appears complete given dods and dojs rejection of the proposed gd nns merger on antitrust grounds it appears unlikely that the dod or doj would approve further consolidation in the ownership of all 6 of these yards under single firmhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs10 18 the

alternatives to the diesel engine such as fuel cells and stirling continuedthis does not however mean that there is potential for further mergers and acquisitions involving shipyards that perform work for the navy various possibilities for further mergers and acquisitions remain noc or gd could seek to acquire other shipyards in the united states that overhaul and repair navy ships or build smaller ships for the navy and coast guard so as to gain greater share of these markets nns for example acquired continental maritime san diego shipyard that overhauls and repairs navy ships in december 1997 shipyards that overhaul and repai r navy ships or build smaller ships for the navy and coast guard could merge among themselves for example bollinger shipyards gulfcoast shipyard organi zation in

being built in equal numbers by nassco and avondale as result of decisions by the navy to exercise options to construction contracts for these ship s that the navy awarded to the two firms in 1993 the current limited active use of competition in navy ship construction appears to be largely consequence of two key fact ors the relatively low rate of navy ship procurement since fy1993 and an apparent unwillingness of policymakers to take steps that might force any of the six shipyards out of the navy shipbuilding business44 together these two conditions make it difficult for the navy to create

resulted from the gdnns merger proposal that was rejected by dod and doj in october 2001the potential for resuming competition in navy ship construction in the future particularly if the navy ship procurement rate in future years is increased from current levels competition implications of nocnns merger45 potential factors to consider in examining the effect that the recent series of shipyard mergers culminating in the nocnns merger might have on ship design and ship technology developm ent and on the potential for resuming competition in navy ship construction po licymakers may consid er several factors including the following creation of sole sources resulting market share resulting number of independently owned shipyard inhouse design and engineering staffs resulting share of shipyard inhouse designers and engineers resulting share of navy research and development funding provided to shipyards and resulting degree of vertical integration creation of sole sources the existence of at least two independently owned sources for an item is usually requirement in instances where the government wants to make use of competition in the acquisition of that item merger that results in the creation of sole source for an item can thus reduce perhaps dramatically the potential for using competition in the acquisition of that item in expressing its opposition to gds 1999 and 2001 proposals to acquire nns dod and for the 2001 proposal doj noted th at such merger would combine the nations two submarine construction shipyards under common ownership creation of sole source does not eliminate entirely the governments ability to use competition in the acquisition of that item the government can mandate the use of competition among supplier firms in the acquisition of materials and components that are incorporated into th end item manufactured by the sole source prime contractor the government can also make it clear to the sole source that its end item in this case particular kind of ship will compete for scarce defense procurement dollars against other defense end items such as other types of ships aircraft missiles ground combat systems space systems and command and control systems in the view of some observers creation of sole source in addition to reducing the potential for using competition in the acquisition of that item can also weaken or distort competition for other items made by the sole source under this argument the sole source can levera ge its monopoly pos ition on certain item to negotiate contracts for that item with high profit margins which can then be used to crosshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs20 46 the potential for avondale or ingalls with capital improvement to build largedeck conventionally powered carriers wa s

competitors several years ago for example some supporters of eb but not gd or eb itself argued that nns had in the past used its solesource status on aircraft carriers to negotiate high profit margins on carrier construction contr acts that were then used to crosssubsidize bids it submitted in competition against eb for submarine construction contracts the nocnns merger preserved two inde pendently owned sources with recent experience in the design and constructi on of submarines gdeb and nocnns surface combatants gdbiw and nocinga lls and auxiliary and sealift ships gdnassco and nocavondale the nocnns merger also did not affect the situation for lpdlsdtype amphibious ships where nocavondale is the one established source and gdbiw if it par ticipates in lpd17 construction would become second source the nocnns merger however combined nns the longstanding sole source for largedeck nuclearpowered aircraft carriers with nocs avondale and ingalls shipyards which as discussed in 1996 crs report are the only two yards other than nns that could build largedeck conventionally powered aircraft carriers46 it also combined nocs ingalls shipyard the effective sole source for largedeck amphibious assault ships with nns the onl other shipyard then outside noc ie other than avondale that as also discussed in the 1996 crs report47 could build largedeck amphibious assault ships w ithout need for making major capital improvements to the yard the nocnns merger may thus pose an issue regarding the number of potential future sources for aircraft carriers the number of potential future sources for largedeck ie lhal hdtype amphibious assault ships and the potential for solesourcerelated crosssubsidization of bids48 each of these areas is discussed below aircraft carriers supporters of the nocnns rger can argue that any loss of potential competition in aircraft carrier construction resulting from the merger is insignificant because carriers have b een solesource item since fy1958 because carriers in future decades as in recent decades will not be procured at rate sufficient to support meaningful compe tition between two sources because the navys plans for carrier procurement call for future carriers to be nuclearpowered ships which avondale and ingalls cannot bu ild and because even if the navy were to procure conventionally powered carrier s avondale and ingalls would not have been competitive in bidding for such ship s against nns because of their lack ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs21 recent experience in building such ships and the technical challenges specific to building carriers such as installing aircraft catapults critics of the nocnns merger can argue that the loss of potential competition in carrier construction is possibly significant because the navy at some point might decide to shift carrier c onstruction from largedeck nuc learpowered designs to non nuclearpowered designs that could be bu ilt by avondale or ingalls but not by gds two surfaceship yards biw and nassco the concept of building smaller and potentially nonnuclearpowered carriers has been examined by dod in the past and could be examined again in the future the nocnns merger critics can argue will preclude the navy from using competition in the construction of such ships largedeck amphibious assault ships supporters of the nocnns merger can argue that any loss of potential competition in the construction of amphibious assault ships is not significant because these ships like carriers have effectively been sole source item for many years for at least two reasons first these ships like carriers in future years as in past years will not be procured at rate sufficient to support meaningful competition between two sources second nns would not have been competitive in bidding for such ships against ingalls due to nnss lack of recent experience in building them and the overhead costs associated with maintaining nnss nuclear shipbuilding capability these overhead costs would make it difficult for nns to compete effectively for nonnuclear powered ships against yards like ingalls th at do not have to incorporate the overhead costs of maintaining nuclear shipbuilding capability into their bids they can also argue that either of gds two surfaceship yards biw or nassco can be made capable with capital improvements of building such ships critics of the nocnns merger can argue that the potential loss of competition in the construction of amphibious assault ships is possibly significant because future plans for the navy might call for building such ships in greater numbers or to new and significantly different design for wh ich ingalls prior experience in building amphibious assault ships would not be an advantage and because the amount of capital improvements that would be needed at biw or nassco to make these yards capable of building such ships would dissuade them from competing against ingalls for such ships which would have left nns as the most likely potential competitor they can argue that in spite of its nuc learrelated overhead costs nns has been successful in recent years in competin g against nonnuclear yards for nonnuclear work such as the conversion of existing merchant ships into us military sealift ships crosssubsidization of bids critics of the nocnns merger can argue that noc can use its newly acquired solesour ce status on aircraft carriers and its previous effective solesource status on largedeck amphibious assault ships to leverage construction contracts for aircraft carriers and largedeck amphibious assault ships with high profit margins that can then be used to crosssubsidize bids that noc makes in competitions against gd for contracts relating to submarines which nns could do

navy shipbuilding work in turn accounts for an estimated 85 to 90 of the total revenues of these six yards49 an examination of the total revenues of these six yards can thus provide an approx imation of these yards market shares for navy shipbuilding information on total revenues for each of the six yards is incomplete for some years due in part to merger activity wh ich interrupted the sequence of corporate annual reports for some years but data for the years where information is available for all six yards 19911995 and 2000 plus da ta available for some of the yards in 19961999 and 2001

tended to account for roughly 5560 of the tota l revenues of the six yards the division for 2000 the most recent year for which revenue data is available for all 6 yards was 432 for the three gdowned

ould argue that such division of revenues though not exactly 5050 is not so lopsided as to pose concern they could also argue that share of revenues doe s not by itself mean anything and that dod and doj tacitly acknowledged this by not mentioning market share in its analysis of the 1999 and 2001 gdnns merger proposals gd they could argue already builds surface combatants auxiliary ships and sealift ships and thus does not face choice of whether to ter the market to build ships of this kind since it does not face this choice supporters of the noc nns merger could argue the question of whether the nocnns entitys market share would discourage gd from entering the market for these ships would be moot critics of the nocnns merger could argue that something like 4060 division of revenue could be lopsided nough to pose concern since nocs share under such division would be half again as large as gds they could also argue that market share is potentially important indicator because it indicates firms potential relative to its competitors to achieve improved production economies of scale and obtain materials nd components from supplier firms at lower costs large market share they could argue might also make it easier for the firm to secure financing from lending organizations or enable the firm to secure it on more favorable terms firm with largee nough share of the market it can be argued could make it more difficult for the government to achieve meaningful competition because that firm might be able to generate sizerelated cost advantages that could not be matched by other firms with sma ller share of the market firm with dominant share of the market it can also be argued might be better able to attract the best managers and engineers because those individuals might conclude that the firm with the dominant share of the market d better longterm business prospects and could thus offer them better longterm career opportunities over time it could be argued such an advantage in recruiting the best managers and engineers could add to the competitiveness of the firm with the dominant share of the market making it more difficult for the government to achieve effective competition critics could also argue that if biw does not participate in the production of lpd17 class amphibious ships possi bility then gd could face choice of whether to attempt to enter the mark et against noc for production of other amphibious ships making the question of whether nocs market share would discourage gd from entering the market for these ships potentially relevant number of shipyard inhouse d esign and engineering staffs in addition to building ships the six shipyards maintain inhouse design and engineering staffs that design navy sh ips and develop new technologies for navy ships maintaining competition in this area may be of greater importance now than in the past since the navy in recent years has shifted more of its ship design andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs24 engineering work out of its own publicsector shipdesign and engineering organizations and to the privatesector shipyards since innovations in given area ar sometimes made more likely when separate organizations working in llel are available to conceive of and experiment with new strate gies for addressing common challenge reduction in the number of independently owned shipyard inhouse shipyard design and engineering staffs might make it more di fficult to promote innovation in navy ship design and technology partic ularly for specific ship type s or in specific technology areas alternatively it can be argued that merger of previously separate inhouse design and engineering sta ffs could for time at least improve innovation in ship design and ship technology development by creating an enlarged engineering staff that encompassed greater diversity of talents and ideas new technologies and innovations it can be argued can sometimes be spurred when members of previously separate organizations are brought to gether under common ownership and as consequence are permitted to share ideas bounce thoughts off one another cross fertilize their thinking and combine separately conceived and isolated concepts into testable new approach shipyard mergers in this view may create larger critical mass of design and engin eering talent for generating innovations in this sense depending on how the merged firm mana ges the flow of promising ideas and concepts between their constituent yards shipyard mergers might for time at least increase the likelihood for innovations in ship design and ship technology development if the navy perceives that the potentia l for innovation in ship design and ship technology development has been reduced by the reduction in the number of inhouse design and engineering staffs it could attempt to compensate by placing shipdesign and ship technologydevelopment contr acts with independe ntly owned naval architectural firms and other entities suc h as universities and technology companies that engage in activities relating to ship design and ship technology development the nocnns merger reduced the numbe r of independently owned shipyard inhouse design and engineering staffs from three to two but preserved the two independently owned inhous design and engineering staffs with experience in submarines and nuclearpowered ships supporters of the nocnns merger can argue that two independently owned staffs are sufficient for competition and th at any loss associated with the reduction in the number of staffs would be offset by the creation of larger noc design and engineering staff that will be able to ge nerate significant innovations by combining people and ideas that were previ ously separate from one another critics of the merger can argue that having three independently owned staffs would have been better for competition than having two because having three permits competition to occur on program even if one staff decides not to compete they can also argue that the benefits for ge nerating innovations of combining previously separate people and ideas are likely to be

ingalls maintain smaller but still substantial inhouse staffs and avonda and nassco maintain relatively small inhouse staffs the staffs at eb and nns are the only two among the six yards that have extensive experience and resources in the sign and engineering of submarines and nuclearpowered ships53 as can also be seen in the table the nocnns merger produced firm that accounts for about 56 of the six yards in house designers and engineers while gd accounted for the remaining 44 excludi ng the 8000 nuclearship engineers and designers at nns and gd nocnns merger produced firm that accounts for 54 of the inhouse designers and engi neers in 2001 2150 of 4000 while gd accounted for the remaining 46 1850 of 4000 supporters of the nocnns merger c ould argue that 5644 division of inhouse designers and engineers though not exactly 5050 split is not lopsided enough to pose concern they can also argue that gd can supplement its own in house staff of 5250 shipyard designers and gineers by drawing on the talents of the designers and engineers that exist in gd s information systems and technology and aerospace divisions gds ability to do this they can argue has grown in recent years as result of its recent nonshipbuild ing acquisitions incl uding aircraftmaker gulfstream and could grow further in future years if gd acquires additional non shipbuilding firms as some observers anticipate supporters can also argue that gd can further supplement its inhouse design and engineering staff by contracting with some of the 6000 privatesector ship designers and engineers that exist in the united states outside the six shipyards hiring outside designers and engineers they can argue is an established practice for shipyards working on navy nonnuclear shipbuilding programs supporters could also argue that the to tal number of designers and engineers is not that important because the potential fo r innovation in firm often resides within small core of very experienced designers the bulk of the designers and engineers at the firm they could argue perform routine design and engineering work although the total number of designers and engineers are not evenly divided between gd and noc they could argue both gd and noc possess capable core groups of very experienced designers and engineers this point of view they can argue is supported by dods interest in recent ears in small business firms as sources of innovation critics of the nocnns merger can argue that the total number of designers and engineers can indeed be important because ships are composed of tens of thousands of components and the shipdesig n process gives individual designers and engineers throughout the firm the opportun ity and responsibility to seek out improvements for the part of the ship they are working on even small improvementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs27 54 letter from secretary of defense to senator trent lott april 15 1999and innovations if applied to sufficient number of the ships components can add up to significant amount of totalship i nnovation they can argue firm with larger share of designers and engineers they can argue will be able to carry out more thorough investigation of the potential for making numerous small improvements and innovations acr oss the entire ship this point of view they can argue is supported by dods reference to the share of designers and engineers in its decision on the 1999 gdnns merger proposal critics of the merger can argue that in the 5644 division understates the imbalance because noc can combine the talents of 6750 inhouse shipyard designers with those of the designers nd engineers in nocs large and technically advanced aerospace and electr onics divisions the resulting combination of nuclear and nonnuclear shipbuilding technologies aerospace technologies including stealth design and materials technology and electr onics technology they could argue could give noc technological edge over gd critics of the nocnns merger can also argue that it would be difficult to transfer designers and engineers from gd s information systems and technology and aerospace divisions into shipbuilding progra ms since these designers and engineers are fully committed to non shipbuilding prog rams and lack experience in shipbuilding design and engineering issues critics of the nocnns merger can also argue that noc can contract for the services of ship designers and engineers that work outside the six yards just as easily as gd could and that outside designers nd engineers might not be able to achieve as much for gd as nocs inhouse design ers and engineers could achieve for noc for two reasons first nocs inhouse staff works at noc continuously across range of projects rather than intermittently on projectbyproject basis as would be the case for outside designers and engi neers working on contract at gd second nocs inhouse staff could have more co mplete access to nocs most proprietary concepts and technologies than contract signers and engineers would have to gds concepts and technologies share of navy research and development funding dod in explaining its opposition to the 1999 gdnns

its nuclear shipyards ie general dynamics sic electric boat di vision and newport news if general dynamics and newport news were to rge we would see concentration of that engineering talent and the

of the total number of inhouse designers and engineer s rather than focusing on personnelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs28 55 horizontal integration in contrast refers to the existence within single firm of operations in certain stages of the producti on process for producing significantly different end products in simplified example firm that takes raw materials in one end and produces fully complete end items such as ships at the other end performing all the manufacturing assembly integration and tes ting steps in between is said to exhibit complete vertical integration while firm that specializes in certain stages of the production process for significantly different products such as manufacturing of components for or final assembly of ships aircraft and land vehi cles is said to exhibit horizontal integrationhowever this concern appears to relate to research deve lopment and design facilities and technology that may have accumulated at eb and nns over the years although dod in 1999 stated that more than 95 of the navy research and development investment that goes to the six shipyards would exist in combined gdnns entity it did not say how much of this 95 came from gd as opposed to nns since dod did however say that the navy has historically maintained large rd program funded through its nucl ear shipyards ie general dynamics sic electric boat division and newport ne ws it might be reasonable to conclude that significant share of this 95 came from nns if so then the nocnns merger might have produced division of the navy research and development funding directed to the shipyards that w ould be much closer to 5050 split than to 955 split supporters of the nocnns merger coul d argue that the resulting division of shipyarddirected navy research and velopment funding is relatively balanced between noc and gd critics of the nocnns merger could argue that the resulting division understates the advantages for noc because noc will benefit from the very large amount of research and development funding that dod has directed over the years to aerospace firms like noc in the case of noc they could argue this includes large investment in stealth design techniques materials production tooling and test facilities established for the b2 bomber which noc designed and built vertical integration vertical integration refers to the existence within single firm of operations pertaining to di fferent stages of the production process for particular item process that in its entirety begins with raw materials and component manufacturing tinues through assembly of subsystems systems and other intermediate component s and finishes with fina l assembly and totalsystem integration and testing55 the potential concern is that vertically integrated firms can undermine competition in various stages of the production process by relying on their own inhouse capabilities for performing work rather than bidding the work out to other firms engaged in that stage of the production process noc is one of dods leading radar makers and combat system integrators and competes against other radar makers and combat system integrators such as lockheed and

extended this question to the two remaining major categories of navy ships aircraft carriers and submarines critics could argue that nocnns merger created firm with an undesirable degree of vertical integrati on noc opponents could argue could decide to install its own radars and combat systems on the ships it makes rather than competing its inhouse capabilities in this area against th other radar makers and combat system integrators such as lockheed and rayt heon this opponents could argue would make it difficult for the navy to achieve effective competition in the acquisition of ship radars and combat systems weakening of competition between system integration firms they could argue would be particularly significant in light of the governments increasing reliance on systemintegrator firms as sources of design and technology innovation in navy shipbuilding supporters of the nocnns merger coul d argue that it is unlikely that noc would exclude lockheed and raytheon from noc shipbuilding projects because radars and combat systems on ships are di fferent in many ways from radars and combat systems on aircraft and nocs experience in radars and combat systems is associated more with aircraft while lockheed and raytheon are the two leading makers of radars and combat systems for navy ships supporters could argue that it would be selfdefeating for noc to ex clude both lockheed and raytheon from its bid in competitive shipacquisition program since that would leave gd free to include one or even both of these firms in its own bid making it much more likely that the navy would judge the gd bid s uperior in terms of proven experience in shipboard radars and combat systems potential for bundled competitions the formation through mergers of two shipbuilding organizations that are each capable of building various kinds of navy ships may create potential for the na vy to use bundled competitions to restore the use of competition in the awarding of navy shipconstruction contracts even during times when the procurement rates of individual shipbuilding programs are insufficient to permit meaningful competition on an individualprogram basis under the concept of bundled competitions the na vy would group together some or all of the ships procured in given year or two compete the bundle between gd and noc and award larger share of the bundle to the winning bidder even during periods of relatively w rates of ship procurement bundled competitions could permit the government to restore some uncertainty in its contract award decisions key requirement for meaningful competition ie competition that generates bargaining leverage for the government in particular bundled competitions could help ensure that gd and noc make maximum use of crossyard efficiencies in their shipbuilding operations56httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs30 57 source telephone conversation with senior noc official may 16 2001shipyard employment what effect will shipyard mergers have on shipyard employment levels members of congress are often interested in the effect that defense mergers and acquisitions might have on local or regiona l employment levels shipyard mergers particularly if they are to produce savings can lead to reductions in the total number of whitecollar workers ie headquarters and central administrative workers and possibly designers and engineers empl oyed at the yards being brought under common ownership as mentioned in the s ection on potential savings bringing more than one shipyard under common ownershi p can provide opportunities to the parent firm to combine and streamline the total number of workers in these areas shipyard mergers are unlikely to lead to significant changes in the total number of bluecollar production workers employed at the yards since that number is determined primarily by th total amount of production work being done at the yards shipyard mergers however can lead to changes in the distribution of work being done at the yards being brought under common ownership which can in turn alter the distribution of the total number of bluecollar workers among the yards the managers of multiyard organization can rephase work at certain yards or shift work from one yard to another so as to avoid or minimize potentially expensive fluctuations in the workload at individual yards or ta ke advantage of the ability of one yard to perform certain elements of work at lower cost for shipbuilding organizations with facilities in multiple localities or regions which both gd and noc are such changes in the dist ribution of bluecollar workers across the yards can lead to local or regional increases or reductions in bluecollar shipbuilding employment in discussing the potential local employment impacts of shipyard mergers the potential employment impact of not having participated in merger arguably should also be considered it is possible for ex ample that not merging might have left yard in weakened competitive position relative to other yards that did merge in the long run this weakened competitive positi on could have reduced the amount of work awarded to that yard and thus the number of employees sustained there nearer term reduction in employment that might result from merger might not be as significant as longerterm reduction th at might have resulted from not

aircraft missile s landwarfare systems and defense communications and electronics shipya rd mergers since 1995 by incorporating shipyards into larger defense firms with business activities in multiple defense sectors can affect shipbuildings place in this competition in at least two ways overall strength of repres entation and systemofsyste ms acquisition programs overall strength of representation in the competition for limited defense procurement funds the six ship yards individually are not the largest competitors as can be seen in tabl 2 the six yards in december 2001 employed total of 51463 people or an average of about than 8600 people per yard in most cases at one primary site two sites in the case of eb in contrast boeing employs more than 180000 people in its military and civilian business activities in 26 states64 while lockheed martin employs total of 125000 people in its military and civilian business activities at 939 facilitie s in 457 cities and 45 states65 shipyard

about 52000 people including about 19000 at its three shipyards66 at several locations wh ile noc currently employs about 100000 people including about 32000 at its three shipyards in 44 states67 other things held equal this can strengthen the position of the shipyards relative to other defense contractors in the political process shipyard mergers can also lead to mo re unified and coordinated lobbying and publicrelations efforts among the yards which can also strengthen the position of the yards in the political process when the six shipyards were owned by six separate organizations the lobbying and publicrelati ons efforts of some of the yards might contradict or undercut some efforts of other yards now that ownership of the six yards has been consolidated under two firm s this

mergers best summarized as one that weighs the potential savings of mergers against their potential affects on competition discussions of dods review of the 2001 nocnns merger proposal and other defense merger proposals some times described that process as one that weighed the consolidationrelated savings that could result from the proposed merger against the effects the merger might have on comp etition the notion of savingsvs competition review framework might have arisen from the language of dod directive 500062 or from the inclinations of some participants in the debates over proposed mergers to focus on one of thes factors or the other supporters of proposed mergers for example often focu s on the savings that they say will result while opponents often focus on the effects on competition the savingsvscompetition framework for summarizing dods merge rreview process though concise may not be the mo st accurate or useful framework for two reasons first it tends to separate the idea of savings from that of competition and put the two ideas in to opposition with one another even though competition can itself be powerful source of savings second savings are only one of several ends that the government seeks to achieve in defenseprocurement programs and competition is only one means of achieving those ends in addition to cost constraint the government in defense procurement seeks to achieve produc t quality product innova tion and production schedule adherence and in addition to competition the government can employ regulation audits and incentive payments to achieve these ends the savingsvs competition framework can obscure these other ends and means for these reasons dods mergerreview process might be characterized not simply as one that weighs savings against competition but rather as one that assesses how proposed mergers might affect the ab ility of the government to achieve cost constraint and other desired defenseprocurement goals through use of competition or other available means71httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs37 71 continued that is on balance anticompetitive will not generally be saved by claimed or actual efficiencies nor likely be

alternative view that congress and not dod is the primary agent acting on behalf of us taxpayers in the purchas of defense products raises the following potential questions for congress how if at all

were built at yards that were also building the navys nuclearpowered subm arines eb and nns for this reason supporters of the idea of building nonnuclear powered submarines in us yard for export to foreign buyers have focused on the possibility of building them in another yard particularly ingalls supporters of the idea of building nonnuc learpowered submarines at ingalls for export to foreign buyers had argued befo re 2001 that ingalls is not involved in the navys nuclearpowered shipbuilding prog ram and longer retains any sensitive us navy submarine design and constr uction knowhow that could be transmitted to foreign buyer but has facilities that are capable of building nonnuclearpowered submarines that are based on foreig n eg european nonnuclearpowered submarine designs incorporating us submarine design knowhow the question is how these arguments may have been affected by the nocnns merger as result of this merger nns and ingalls now have common owner and following the initial period ending around october 2003 during which noc will continue to operate nns as separate division noc will integrate nns into its ship systems division which includes ingalls and avondale in addition noc in 2001 argued against the gdnns merger proposal in part on the grounds that the merger would deny noc access to nnss submarine related technologies some of these technologies noc argued will become mo re important in the future for surface combatants and noc therefore needed to have access to them to ensure the competitiveness of its future surface comb atant designs against designs developed by gd one implication of this argument is that noc may transfer submarine related technologies from nns to ingalls opponents of building nonnucl earpowered submarines at ingalls for export to foreign buyers could argue that nocs ac quisition of nns and particularly nocs plan to integrate nns into nocs ship systems division reduces the separation of ingalls from the navys nuclearpoweredsubmarine shipbuilding activities at nns and thereby increases the risk that nonnuclearpowered submarine building program at ingalls could even if only inadvertently transmit us submarine design and construction knowhow to foreign buyer supporters of building nonnuc learpowered submarines at ingalls for export to foreign buyers could argue that the technol ogy transmission issue can be addressed by establishing firewall ie an administrative separation between ingalls and nns on all issues and personne l relating to submarine construction they can also argue that some

ship acquisition the arguments presented here can be compared with thos presented in the department of justices october 2001 court filing re printed in appendix potential factors to consider as mentioned earlier in this report in examining the effect that shipyard mergers might have on competition in na vy ship acquisition policymakers may consider several factors including the following creation of sole sources resulting market share resulting number of independently owned shipyard inhouse design and engineering staffs resulting share of shipyard inhouse designers and engineers resulting share of navy research and development funding provided to shipyards and resulting degree of vertical integration creation of sole sources the gdnns merger proposal would have transferred the existing sole source for aircraft carriers nns to gd and created second sole source by bringing the nations two submarine shipyards under common gd ownership competition in submarine construction supporters of the gdnns merger proposal could argue that competiti on has not been used in the awarding of contracts to build submarines since the navy awarded to eb the contract to build ssn22 the second seawolf ssn21 cla ss submarine which was procured in fy1991 since eb had previously been awar ded the contract to build the lead ship in the class ssn21 many observers believed that eb could use its experience in building ssn21 and ssn22 to outcompete nns for the contract to build the third seawolfclass submarine ssn23 and an subsequent seawolfclass boats of which there were none supporters of the gdnns merger proposal could argue that this facto suspension in the use of competition in the awarding of submarineconstruction contracts was reinforced by congress decision in 1997 to approve plan proposed by the navy eb and nns to have eb nd nns build the first 4 virginia ssn774 class submarines under jointproduction rrangement and further reinforced by congress decision in 2000 to extend th jointproduction arrangement to the following 5 ships in the program ie through the ninth ship these decisions to adopt and extend the jointpr oduction arrangement they could argue

continuedsome point in the future because doing so would require separating the now entangled submarine construction activities at eb and nns from one another and possibly reestablishing certain elements of the submarine production lines at one or both yards opponents of the gdnns merger proposal could argue that although the joint production agreement would make it more difficult to resume competition in submarine construction gdnns merger would further reduce the chances of resuming competition at some point in the future because doing so would likely require gd to sell either eb or nns to another company something gd might not be willing to do the potential for resuming competition would also depend on future submarine production rates the current production rate of 1 boat per year is insufficient for achieving meaningful competition between two independently owned submarine builders opinions differ on the minimu m procurement rate needed to support meaningful competition in 1996 however the navy testified to congress that rate of 15 boats per year would be sufficient fo r staging biennial competitions at this rate the navy explained the navy every ot her year could combine two years worth of procurement 3 boats allocate one boa t to each yard and have the two yards compete for the third the navy in its testimony presented three options for conducting biennial competitions at annua l rates of 15 or 2 boats per year78 higher procurement rate such as 3 boats per year would be needed to support competition on an annual basis supporters of the gdnns merger c ould argue that future submarine procurement rates might not increase significantly from the current rate of 1 boat per year particularly given the relatively hi gh procurement cost of submarines and competing demands for defense procur ement funding opponents of the gdnns merger proposal could argue that rates of 2 or more boats per year are very possibly if not likely in coming years given the need to maintain the submarine fleet at levels set forth by dod officials79httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs60 79 continued subcommittee on military procurement hearing on the navys proposed

that it would be acceptable from competition standpoint b ecause eb and nns would continue to compete for secondary navy contracts for submarine design and submarine technology development work the use of competition between the two firms they argued would thus be preserved in the important area of generating new ideas and technologies for future submarines for example at march 18 1997 hearin g before the military procurement subcommittee of the house national security committee80 that focused on the acquisition strategy for the virginia class then known as the new attack submarine john douglass thenassistan t secretary of the navy for research development and acquisition the navy s acquisition executive discussed the navys plan for inserting new technologies into the virginiaclass design and stated we use the term technology opportunities because we wanted to make sure that our contractors understand this is not done deal we want them to compete for these technologies we want their engineering teams which are hungry for work to know that we are go ing to take the best engineering ideas from either yard and try to inject them into the boats as soon as possible and part of this competition for ideas competition for technology is based on some of the principles that this committee has put forward but this is our commitment mr chairman81 and as long as i am there i am going to do the very best that i can to get us to stick to it82 the issue came up again later in the hearing in this exchange representative patrick kennedy i want to just ask perhaps one question with respect to how we get rd into the process and that is how secretary douglass do you plan to encourage competition between the yards with respect to new technology and how also can ou explain what role newick sic83 will have in that process as well and how they would be kept in the loophttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs61 84 ibid p 298299 85 ibid p 328 86 testimony of captain burgess ibid p 244secretary douglass well from the in the first part of your question how do we plan to get the yards involved and stimulate technology and engineering work we are making the yards fully aware of how much money we are requesting from the congress not only next year but in the out years and we have asked them to go and look at that budget and give us their pr oposals for what they think their research and development involvement should be now within the theme that our subcommittee chairman congressman duncan hunter is going to put on this competition for ideas the prize is that if we select the technology suggestion of one yard or the other yard they get to do the engineering work to flesh that id ea out and turn it from just an idea into real piece of equipment or change to the submarine and then it gets incorporated into that central design and then both builders will build it and incorporate it in the submarines from what ever point that is injected into the production line forward84 secretary douglasss written statement for the hearing similarly stated new innovation will not be stifled but encouraged as more open lines of information exchange are developed be tween the two shipbu ilders and between the shipbuilder team and government the teaming arrangement has specific provisions to enhance and upgrade future new attack submarines these efforts may be joint or developed individually by the shipbuilders our process is designed to allow industry and the shi pbuilders to compete for research and development funds based on innovative ideas for improving the virginiaclass designs capability producibility and affordability85 earlier at the same hearing another na vy witness captain involved in the management of the virginiaclass acquis ition program in explaining the various reasons why the virginia class would be affordable talked about how the modular construction process for the virginiacla ss design would allo w new technologies to be inserted into the design over time now one of the things that this m odular construction process affords us is the opportunity as we go along to adju st the design of these individual modules as the two companies compete for technol ogy insertion to bring that additional innovation to bear as we complete the construction of the submarine86 similarly at an april 8 1997 hearing be fore the seapower subcommittee of the senate armed services committee on submarine programs secretary douglass in his opening presentation to the subco mmittee discussed the proposed teaming arrangement for the virginia class stated it is also important to remember that if you want to keep your industrial base viable as you put it sir you must do more than just build things you have to have an engineering force that can l ook forward into the future and constantly improve the product this teaming arrangement is going to make thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs62 87 dr kaminsky was then the under

189190substantially easier to do in competitive construction environment it is extremely difficult to get the two comp etitors to share their best ideas regarding this teaming arrangement th ere is evidence that they are already over that hurdle and are sharing thei r ideas we have common technology insertion plan that will come into effect as i will show you on the next couple of charts in which we are allowing th shipbuilders to become involved in the future designs of these submarines in way we have never done before they sit on submarine technology oversi ght council that dr paul kaminsky87 and i cochair the presidents of the two ship yards sit with us there is very strong and keen competition for ideas about how to improve these submarines for example whichever yard brings us the best technology ideas will be the yard to take that idea and get it into the detaile d design process then they will both build to that new innovative design88 the issue came up again later in the hearing in this exchange senator joseph lieberman but my question is this some have raised this question about the teaming concept which is that we lose all the benefits of competition as result of the teaming i wonder if one of you maybe secretary douglass would answer that or begin to answer that which is does the teaming agreement eliminate all competition from the submarine construction program mr douglass sir it does not eliminate all competition there is still considerable competition down at the subc ontractor level at the second third and fourth tiers of the industrial base in which we have two or more suppliers who have other businesses that they do in addition to supplying us so that we could compete between them also while you were out i discussed the competition of ideas that will be in effect in which the engineering team s at both shipyards will be in sense competing against each other to keep th emselves in business we are going to pick from the ideas that come out of t hose two shipyard engineering teams the very best ones to insert into future boa ts so there is technology competition there as well89 supporters of the gdnns merger propos could argue that competition in submarine design and technology devel opment could still take place within combined gdnns entity through the creati on of two or more industry teams under gds supervision that are firewalled ie administratively separated from one another and contain team members from othe r firms under this arrangement the other firms would each belong to one t eam and not the other thus although gdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs63 90 the two teams were led by lockheed and raytheon 91 for brief mention of the navydarpa s ubmarine payloads project see statement of ronald orourke specialist in national defe nse congressional research service before the house armed services committee subcommittee on military procurement hearing on submarine force structure and moderniza tion june 27 2000 p 20 the second phase of the project now under navy rather than jo int navydarpa supervision is progress would have engineers on both teams and w ould stand to gain whichever team wins the competition other firms contributing to th teams would stand to gain only if the team to which they contributed engin eers wins the competition the concept is somewhat similar to using compe tition among suppliers and component manufactures when competition at the leve l of the finalassembly firm is not possible this kind of arrangement supporters of the gdnns merger proposal could argue was r ecently used with success in the navydefense advanced projects research agency darpamanaged submarine payloads project which was aimed at generating new and innovative ideas for significantly increasing the number and variety of weapons and sensors carried by the navys attack submarines gd participated on both of the industry team s that were organized to compete under navydarpa supervision but the teams were firewalled and except for participants from gd and couple of other firms consis ted of members of firms that provided participants to only one of the two teams90 this project supporters could argue succeeded in generating ideas that if developed and implemented could completely transform the design and capabilities of the navys attack submarines91 opponents of the gdnns merger propos could argue that nns has done substantial work on submarine design and technology development since 1997 as part of the ongoing effort to improve the virginiaclass design and that gdnns merger would prevent the navy from maintaining full competition in this area they could also argue that using firewalled teams might not be as effective as an arrangement using teams whose members included participants from two separate submarinebuilding firms particularly for generating innovations such as those that might permit submarine missions to be performed by significantly fewer submarines or by platforms other than submarines that might threaten the value of gdnns status as the sole source for building submarines crosssubsidization of bids opponents of the gdnns merger proposal could argue that gdnns entity could use its solesource status on aircraft carriers and submarines to leverage carrier and submarine construction contracts with high profit margins that could then be used to crosssubsidize bids that gdnns would make in competitions against noc for c ontracts relating to surface combatants amphibious ships and auxiliary and sealift ships supporters of the gdnns merger propos could argue that the government would be fully capable of negotiating profit rates and auditing gdnnss construction costs so as to ensure that pr ofits on this work were not excessive and that crosssubsidization would not take placehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs64 92 as discussed earlier available data sugge sts that gds three yards account for roughly 4045 of the total revenues of the six yards the data also suggest that nns accounts for 2631 of the total revenues giving merged gdnns entity combined 6676 share and that ingalls and avondale together account for 2732 of the total revenuesmarket share using the available figures on shipyard revenues discussed earlier combined gdnns entity would account for about 70 of the combined revenues of the six major navy shipbuilders noc would have the remaining 3092 supporters of the gdnns merger proposal could argue that share of revenues does not by itself mean anything and that dod tacitly acknowledged this by not mentioning market share in its analysis of the 1999 gdnns merger proposal noc they could argue already builds surface co mbatants amphibious ships and auxiliary and sealift ships and thus does face choice of whether to enter the market to build ships of this kind since it does not f ace this choice supporters of the gdnns merger proposal could argue the questi on of whether the gdnns entitys market share would discourage noc from entering the market for these ships would be moot opponents of the gdnns merger proposal could argue in turn that market share is potentially important indicator because it indicates firms potential relative to its competitors to achieve improved production economies of scale and obtain materials and components from supplier firms at lower costs large market share they could argue might also make it easier for the firm to secure financing from lending organizations or enable the fi rm to secure it on more favorable terms firm with dominant share of the market they could be argue could make it more difficult for the government to achieve meaningful competition because that firm might be able to generate sizerelated cost advantages that c ould not be matched by other firms with smaller share of the market firm with dominant share of the market it could also be argue d might be better able to attract the best managers and engineers because those individuals might conclude that the firm with the dominant share of the market had better longterm bus iness prospects and could thus offer them better longterm career opportunities over time it could be ar gued an advantage in recruiting the best managers and engineers could add to the competitiveness of the firm with the dominant share of the market making it more difficult for the government to achieve effective competition number of shipyard inhouse design and engineering staffs gdnns merger would have reduced th number of shipyard inhouse design and engineering staffs from three to two supporters of the gdnns merger proposal could argue that two independe ntly owned staffs are sufficient for competition and that any loss associated th reduction in the number of staffs would be offset by the creation of larger gd design and engineering staff that would be able to generate significant innovations by combining people and ideas that were previously separate from one anotherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs65 critics of the merger propos could argue that ving three independently owned staffs would have been better for competition than having two because having three permits competition to occur on program even if one staff decides not to compete they could also argue that the benefits for generating innovations of combining previously separate people and ideas are likely to be temporary rather than permanent share of shipyard inhouse designers and engineers gdnns merger would produce firm th at on the basis of the data shown in table 3 would have more than 80 of the six yards inhouse designers and engineers noc would have less than 20 supporters of the gdnns merger proposal could argue that the 80 significantly misrepresents the situa tion because 8000 of the 9850 designers and engineers at combined gdnns entity the 3400 designers and engineers at eb and the 4600 designers and engineers at nns would have been nuclearship designers and engineers dedicated exclusively to nuclear shipbuilding and overhaul programs at eb and nns these nuclears hip designers and engineers they could argue would not have been available to work on nonnuclear shipbuilding programs where combined gdnns would face co mpetition from noc any transfers of nuclearship designers and engineers fro m nuclear to nonnuclear shipbuilding programs they could argue would have been rare and insignificant occurrences subtracting out these 8000 nuclearship desi gners and engineers they could argue would leave gd with 1850 designers and engineers to work on nonnuclear shipbuilding programs figure somewh at smaller than nocs 2150 inhouse ship designers and engineers supporters of the gdnns merger proposal could also argue that noc could if it desired supplement its own inhous staff of 2150 shipyard designers and engineers by contracting with some of the 6000 privatesector ship designers and engineers that exist in the united states outside the six shipyards and by drawing on the talents of the many inhouse designers and engineers that exist in the aerospace and electronics di visions of noc supporters could also argue that the to tal number of designers and engineers is not that important because the potential fo r innovation in firm often resides within small core of very experienced designers the bulk of the designers and engineers at the firm they could argue perform routine design and engineering work although the total number of designers and engineers are not evenly divided between gd and noc they could argue both gd and noc possess capable core groups of very experienced designers and engineers this point of view they can argue is supported by dods interest in recent year s in small business firms as sources of innovation opponents of the gdnns merger proposal could argue that the total number of designers and engineers can indeed be important because ships are composed of tens of thousands of co mponents and the shipdesign process gives individual designers and engineers throughout the firm the opportunity and responsibility to seek out improvements for the part of th ship they are working on even

and engineers in its decision on the 1999 gdnns merger proposal opponents of the gdnns rger proposal c ould argue that designers and engineers involved in nuclear shipbuilding programs at eb and nns can be and have been made available for temporar assignment to nonnuclear shipbuilding programs where their experience in working on shipbuilding programs and their general design and engineering skills can be of value opponents could point to press report which stated gd electric boat spokesman neil ruenzel said that some of the eb engineering staff has work ed from time to time on surface combatant tasks on behalf of gds bath iron works of bath maine93 they could also note that nns in the 1990s signed contracts to design and build several conventionally powered 46000deadweightton doublehulle d commercial petr oleum tankers94 opponents of the gdnns merger proposal could also argue that even if nuclearship designers and engineers are not reassigned to nonnuclear shipbuilding programs some of the technologies th ey might develop in support of nuclear shipbuilding programs could still be app lied to nonnuclear shipbuilding programs to gain competitive advantage in those programs the ability to apply technology developed at eb and nns by nuclearship designers and engineers to nonnuclear shipbuilding program they could argue was recently demonstrated in connection with the navys program for developing ectric driveintegrated power systems technology that can be applied to eith er nuclear or nonnuclearpowered ships when the navy in the second half of th 1990s began to express growing interest in the idea of shifting from the use of tr aditional mechanicaldrive systems for its ships to advanced electricdriveintegrat ed power systems beginning with the planned dd21 destroyer c onventionally powered ship95 the only two us firms of any kind that mounted efforts to pro pose designs for fully integrated electrichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs67 96 for more on the

65 pdriveintegrated power systems as opposed to specific components of such system were gd including eb and nns96 opponents of the gdnns merger propos could argue that it would be difficult for noc to transfer designers and engineers from these divisions into shipbuilding programs since these designers and engineers are fully committed to nonshipbuilding projects and lack experien ce in shipbuildingrelated issues they could argue that it is inconsistent to maintain that it would be difficult for gdnns to temporarily transfer nuclear ship designers and engineers to nonnuclear shipbuilding programs but that it would not be difficult for noc to temporarily transfer aerospace designers and gineers to shipbuilding programs opponents of the gdnns merger propos could also argue that gdnns entity could contract for the services of ship designers and engineers that work outside the six yards just as easily as noc could and that outside designers and engineers might not be able to achieve as much for noc as gdnnss inhouse designers and engineers could achieve for gdnns for two reasons first gd nnsss inhouse staff would work at gdnns continuously across range of projects rather than intermittently on projectbyproject basis as would be the case for outside designers and engineers wo rking on contract for noc second gd nnss inhouse designers and engineers c ould have more complete access to gd nnss most proprietary concepts and tec hnologies than the contract designers and engineers would have to nocs concepts and technologies share of navy research and development funding as noted earlier dod in 1999 noted in expressing its opposition to the 1999 gdnns merger proposal that over 95 of the navy rd investment would exist in combined generaldynamicsnewport news entity and that this could result in concentration of the technology adva ntages that may have resulted from navy funded research and devel opment investments in both firms over the years supporters of the gdnns merger propos could note that dod in 1999 did not define in its public statements what it meant when it referred to navy rd investment or what basis it used to calcula the 95 figure they could also argue that the 95 figure if accurate in 1999 coul d now or in the future be lower as the navy shifts significant rd funds into nonnuclear shipbuilding programs such as the dd21 now ddx surface combatant prog ram and as design activities related to the virginiaclass submarine program begin to wind down now that the virginia class design has entered production supporters of the gdnns merger propos could also argue that the navy research and development funding that goes to the six yards is only small portion of the total amount of research and deve lopment funding that the navy spends each year the vast majority of the navys annual research and development budget theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31400crs68 could point out goes to entities other than the six shipyards such as aerospace firms electronics firms laboratories and universities for research and development on things other than ships such as aircra ft missiles electroni cs and basic science and technology to name just few opponents of the gdnns merger proposal could argue that even if the 95 figure from 1999 is longer accurate combined gdnns tity would still account for very large share of the to tal amount of the navy research and development funding that goes to the six shipyards they could argue that the gd nns entity could receive significant sh are of dd21 now ddx research and development funds they could also argu that submarinerelated research and development funding might increase if th navy decides to implement submarine design proposals generated under the navy darpa submarine payloads project and that research and developmen t funding related to aircra ft carriers could increase as the navy continues to develop its ne xtgeneration cvnx aircraft carrier opponents of the gdnns merger proposal could also argue that it is of little significance that the navy research and velopment funding that goes to the six shipyards accounts for only small share of the navys total research and development budget because the issue is how navy funding provided to the yards sustains the activities of designers and engineer s at the yards if most of that funding whatever share it might constitute of the navys total research and development budget goes to combined gdnns tity they could argue then the gdnns entity would be better able than noc to ge nerate new inhouse ship design concepts and technologies that could be incorporated into bids the firm submits for future ship acquisition programs vertical integration supporters of the gdnns merger proposal could argue that it did not raise any significant issues concerning vertical integration since both gd and nns are involved in the same stages of the sh ipbuilding process ship design and engineering as well as construction final assembly integration and testing of ships at the shipyard level gdnns merger they could argue would not combine shipyard with either major supplier of basic shipbuilding materials and components or major supplier of ship combat system equipment combined gdnns entity would continue to get these items from other firms opponents of the gdnns merger proposal could argue that although gd is not currently major provider of shipbuilding materials or major combat system supplier for navy ships gd does make few navy ship components such as part of fire control radar insta lled on aegis ships and includes in addition to its marine systems ie shipbuilding division an armaments division that makes guns and ammunition an information systems and technology division that makes communications equipment and an aerospace division gulfstream that makes corporate jets opponents could argue that in the future gd might seek to expand its role as supplier of components for navy ships
