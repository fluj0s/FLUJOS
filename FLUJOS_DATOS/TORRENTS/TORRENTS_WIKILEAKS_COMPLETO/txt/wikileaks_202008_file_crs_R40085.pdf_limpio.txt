regarding the consideration of budgetary measures g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 when new congress convenes in january one of its first orders of business is to receive the annual budget submission of the president for the upcoming fiscal year which begins later in the session 1 the presidents budget consists of set of proposals pertaining to spending revenue and debt levels in the course of responding to the presidents budget congress may accept reject or modify the proposals as it sees fit while much of the spending and revenue in the federal budget is derived automatically each year from existing law the remainder is provided through the enactment of legislation the deadline for submission of the budget has changed several times over the years as is discussed in more detail below currently the deadline is the first monday in february following receipt of the presidents budget congress begins the consideration of the budget resolution and other budgetary legislation the budget resolution which takes the form of concurrent resolution reflects the agreement of the house and senate on budgetary blueprint that guides and constrains the subsequent consid eration of individual spending revenue and debt measures the consideration of significant spending revenue and debt measures by the house and senate during session may entail action on dozens of separate measures in establishing and revising the deadline for submission of the presidents budget congress has sought to reconcile two conflicting objectives first congress is motivated to set the deadline as early as possible in order to maximize the time available to it for completing action on the budget resolution and other budgetary legislation before the new fiscal year begins although the completion of some budgetary legislation typically carries over into the period beyond the start of the fiscal year the goal is to enact as much significant budgetary legislation as possible in timely manner second congress also is impelled to afford the president as much time as necessary to finalize his budget submission following the completion of legislative action in the prior session in recent decades the house and senate sometimes have not completed action on significant budgetary 1 for more information on federal budgeting see crs report 98721 introduction to the federal budget

spanning hundreds of pages have been finalized in the last few days of the year seeking to draw balance between the two competing motivations congress has set the deadline as early as the first week in january and as late as the first week in february under current law the president may submit the budget as early as the first monday in january but he must submit it later than the first monday in february beginning with the fy1992 budget presidents have taken advantage of the full amount of time afforded them under law and submitted their budgets on the first monday in february the congressional budget act of 1974 as amended establishes an annual timetable for congressional action on budgetary legislation beginning with the adoption of budget resolution by the house and senate later than april 15 2 in an effort to provide congress with more time to process budgetary legislation during the session section 501 88 stat 321 of the act moved the start of the fiscal year from

new congress to convene on january 3 unless the date is changed by the enactment of law and provides january 20 beginning date for new presidents fouryear term of office therefore under the legal framework for the beginning of new congress the beginning of new presidents term and the deadline for the submission of the budget all outgoing presidents prior to the 1990 change were obligated to submit budget4 all incoming presidents before 1990 except for roosevelt truman and johnson modified their predecessors policies by submitting budget revisions within few months after taking office the 1990 change in the deadline made it possible for an outgoing president to leave the annual budget submission to his successor

during the period covering the past five presidential transitions the three outgoing presidents required to submit budget during this period ford carter and reagan did so on or before the statutory deadline two of the incoming presidents during this period carter and reagan submitted budget revisions and one george h w bush did not the fy1978 revisions by president carter 101page document were submitted on february 22 1977 and the fy1982 revisions by president reagan an initial 159page document and subsequent 435page document were submitted on march 10 and april 7 1981 respectively because president george h w bush chose not to submit budget for fy1994 and was not obligated to do so president clinton submitted the original budget for fy1994 rather than budget revisions similarly the budget for fy2002 was submitted by the incoming president george w bush rather than by outgoing president clinton presidents clinton and george w bush submitted the original budgets for fy1994 and fy2002 on april 8 1993 and april 9 2001 respectively the experience with transition budgets during the period that the congressional budget process has been in operation is roughly comparable in terms of timing with the experience of earlier years presidents eisenhower kennedy and nixon submitted their revised budget messages to congress on april 30 march 24 and april 12 of their first year as president respectively although presidents reagan clinton and geor ge w bush did not submit detailed budget proposals during their transitions until early april each of them advised congress regarding the general contours of their economic and budgetary policies in special messages submitted to congress in february concurrently with presen tation made to joint session of congress on february 18

year the unfolding of the federal budget process reflects both instances of cooperation and instances of conflict between the president and congress as well as between the house and the senate and between factions with in each chamber cooperation promotes timely and successful action on budgetary legislation while conflict leads to delay and ultimately may prevent the enactment of such legislation in order to fully advance his budgetary agenda president must reach agreement with congress on legislation in several different phases of the budget process congress responds to the presidents budgetary proposals by adopting an annual budget resolution and then implements budget resolution policies through the enactment of separate spending revenue and debt legislation president can be judged to be successful with respect to his budgetary agenda unless the house and senate complete action on the requisite legislation with timely rather than tardy enactment of legislation usually signifying greater success table 1 summarizes legislative action on the major phases of the budget process during the past five transition years as table 1 shows congress and the president

1974 pl 93344 as amended requires that the house and senate reach agreement each year on concurrent resolution on the budget5 originally the act set deadline of may 15 for completion of action on the budget resolution in 1985 the deadline was revised to april 15 during the period from 1984 through 1990 actions on several budget resolutions was not completed until august or october in four instances the house and senate were not able to reach agreement on budget resolution6 as table 2 at the end of the report shows the house and senate reached final agreement on budget resolution in each of the five transition years in four years final agreement was reached in may later than may 21 during the first year of the clinton administration the two chambers reached agreement even earlier on april 1 in this case the agreement on the budget resolution was reached week before president clinton submitted his budget to congress but extensive negotiations between congress and the president ensured that the budget resolution accommodated his major budgetary proposals g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g20g142g140g152g151g140g146g149g146g138g157g146g152g151g561g3g140g157g156g561 the budget reconciliation process is an optional procedure under the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 that operates as an adjunct to the annual budget resolution process the chief purpose of the reconciliation process is to enhance congresss ability to change current law in order to bring revenue nd spending levels into conformity with the policies of the budget resolution accordingly reconciliation probably is the most potent budget enforcement tool available to congress for large portion of the budget reconciliation was first used by the house and senate in calendar year 1980 for fy1981 as an optional procedure it has not been used every year during the period from 1980 to 2008 19 reconciliation measures were enacted into law and three were vetoed 5 during the early years of the congressional budget process the house and senate were required to adopt second budget resolution in the fall the practice was abandoned during the 1980s this report excludes house and senate action on second budget resolutions in 1977 for fy1978 and 1981 for fy1982 6 for more information on this topic see crs report rl31443 the deeming resolution budget enforcement tool by robert keith

deadline for completing action on any required reconciliation legislation but there is explicit requirement to that effect the record of experience with all 22 reconciliation measures passed by the house and senate since 1980 indicates considerable variation in the time needed to process such measures the interval from the date the reconciliation instructions take effect upon final adoption of the budget resolution until the resultant reconciliation legislation is approved or vetoed by the president ranged from low of 27 days for the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 to high of 384 days for the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 on average the process was completed in nearly five months more than twice the amount of time contemplated by the congressional budget process timetable with respect to the five transition years table 3 at the end of the report shows that reconciliation was used in four of the five instances reconciliation was not used during the carter transition in three instances an omnibus budget reconciliation act was enacted into law between the spring and the summer recess in 1989 an omnibus budget reconciliation was enacted late in the session on november 22 g3g151g151g158g138g149g561g3g153g153g155g152g153g155g146g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g3g140g157g156g561 total federal spending encompasses discretionary spending which is provided in annual appropriations acts under the jurisdiction of the house and senate appropriations committees and mandatory spending which stems from substantive law under the jurisdiction of the legislative committees of the house and senate this section provides information on the three categories of annual appropriations legislationregular supplemental and continuing appropriations acts information on mandatory spending legislation is excluded under the congressional budget process timetable the house and senate begin consideration of the regular appropriations acts following the ad option of the budget resolution with the aim of completing action on them by the start of the fiscal year on october 1 in addition the two chambers act on at least one supplemental appropriations act typically before consideration of the regular appropriations acts begins finally the house and senate usually consider at least one continuing resolution to provide stopgap funding after the start of the fiscal year until action on all of the regular appropriations acts is completed during the period that the congressional budget process has been in effect the house and senate have completed action on the regular appropriations acts before the start of the year only four times for fy1977 fy1989 fy1995 and fy1997 ac tion on unfinished regular appropriations acts usually is completed by the end of the calendar year but sometimes carries over into the following session accordingly multiple continuing resolutions are enacted in typical year table 4 table 5 and table 6 at the end of the report provide information regarding congressional action on supplemental regular and continuing appropriations acts respectively table 4 shows that total of 15 supplemental appropriations acts were enacted during the five transition years ranging from two to four such acts each year all but four of the acts were enacted between february and july one was enacted in august and three were enacted in september table 5 shows that while all thirteen of the regular appropriations bills were enacted during the transition years of the carter george hw bus h clinton and george w bush administrations

revenue bills received from the house most laws that establish revenue sources are permanent and continue each year without legislative action but in most years presidents propose changes in revenue law to alter tax rates modify the distribution of the tax burden or make other changes in revenue policy revenue acts can also be initiated through the reconciliation process provided for in the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 the act provides for the adoption of budget resolution discussed above which may contain reconciliation directives instructing the relevant congressional committees to report changes to existing revenue legislation to meet the recommended levels of revenues the reconciliation process was used to enact revenue legislation under the ghw bush clinton and gw bush administrations the timing of action on major revenue legislation may vary considerably from one measure to the next some revenue measures may be enacted afte r only few months of consideration while the enactment of other revenue measures may not occur until well into the following year this pattern also holds true for revenue measures considered under the reconciliation process table 7 illustrates that major revenue measure was enacted into law during the transition year of each of the five administrations three of these revenue acts under g hw bush clinton and g w bush were reconciliation measures congressional action was fairly timely in four instances with enactment occurring between may and august but the 1989 legislation under president g hw bush was not enacted until november 22 g6g142g139g157g556g14g146g150g146g157g561g3g140g157g156g561 almost all borrowing by the federal government is conducted by the treasury department within the

public debt limit for each fiscal year covered by the resolution because budget resolution does not become law congress and the president must enact legislation in order to implement budget resolution policies the house and senate may develop and consider legislation adjusting the debt limit in any one of three ways 1 under regular legislative procedures in both chambers either as freestanding legislation or as part of measure dealing with other topics 2 pursuant to house rule xxvii the socalled gephardt rule or 3 as part of the budget reconciliation process provided for under the congressional budget act of 1974 during the period from 1940 to the present congress and the president have enacted total of 88 measures adjusting the public debt limit70 under regular legislative procedures in both chambers 14 under the gephardt rule and 4 under reconciliation procedures the timing of legislative action on measures adjusting the debt limit is not as predictable as the timing of action on other types of budgetary legislation legislative action can occur at any point in the session as the need to adjust the debt limit requires table 8 shows that between one and three debt limit measures were enacted during each transition year except during the g w bush administration all three methods of adjusting the debt limit were employed but only one of the measures in 1993
