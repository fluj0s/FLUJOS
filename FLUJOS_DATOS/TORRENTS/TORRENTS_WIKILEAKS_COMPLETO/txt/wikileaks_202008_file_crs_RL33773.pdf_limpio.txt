cases in greater detail pacific mutual life insurance co v haslip i n pacific mutual life insurance co v haslip the us supreme court upheld jurys punitive damages award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages and in so doing began its examination of when punitive damage awards violate the fourteenth amendments due process clause20 the court held that the punitive damages award did not violate the due process clause21 finding that traditional common law jury instructions on deterrence and retribution enlightened the jury as to the punitive damages nature and purpose identifie d the damages as punishment for civil wrongdoing of the kind involved and ex plained that their imposition was not compulsory22 according to the court alabama also had substantive and

excessive and therefore did not violate the due process clause26 the plurality opined that the dramatic disparity between actual and punitive damages was not controlling in case of this character by which it meant case i nvolving bad faith fraud and deceit by wealthy defendant as well as slander of the plaintiff companys title to oil and gas27 after declining to create comparative test for when

straightforward compar isons because they are the product of numerous and sometimes intang ible factors and because of the differences among punitive damages cases29 when calculating punitive damages the plurality said that the jury could take into account the potential harm that the defendants conduct would have caused to its in tended victim if the wrongful plan had succeeded as well as the possible harm to other victims that might have resulted if similar future behavior were not deterred30 justices scalia and thomas concurri ng found not only that violation of substantive due process occurred but believed that punitive damages can never violate substantive due process31 in separate concurrence justice kennedy disagreed with the pluralitys holding th at punitive damages awards should be subject to the courts concern for reasonableness when it determines whether punitive damages award is grossly excessive and th erefore violates substantive due process32 he also suggested that the court concern itself with the reasons that jury awarded punitive damages if as kennedy found to be the case in txo the jury was concerned with deterrence and retributi on then constitutional violation would exist however if the jury was concerned with bias passion or prejudice the resulting punitive damages award would violate the constitution33 honda motor co v oberg in honda motor co v oberg the court for the first time held that the due process clause imposes substantive limit on the size of punitive damages awards34 the court in honda motor also held that the due process clause guarantees judicial review of punitive damages awards or another safeguard to protect against arb itrary deprivati ons of property35 contrary to all other federal and state courts wh ich allowed judicial review of the amount of punitive damages award oregon did not and had not substituted safeguard in place of judicial review of punitive damages awards claimed to be excessive or arbitrary36

north america v gore established three standards or guideposts to identify constitutionally excessive punitive damages awards40 the jury had awarded actual damages of 4000 and punitive damages of 2 million because of bm ws having repain ted damage on new cars without disclosing the repair to cons umers according to the 54 majority stevens oconnor kennedy souter and breyer the punitive damages award violated the due process clause because at 500 times greater than the plainti ffs actual damages the amount was grossly excessive41 the court reasoned that the due process clause protects against j udgments without notice of the unlawful conduct and the verity of the penalty that state may impose42 justice breyers concurrence joined by justices oconnor and souter stated that the award also violated the due process clause because 1 the state court interpreted legal standards intended to constrain punitive damages awards in such way as to risk arbitrary results by failing to constrain such awards and 2 the award was grossly excessive because of the severe lack of proportiona lity between the size of the award and the underlying punitive damages objectives43 the majority then prescribed three guideposts by which punitive damages award should be judged to determine if it is grossly excessive 1 the degree of reprehensibility of the defenda nts conduct 2 the reasonabl eness of the ratio of the punitive damages award to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff and 3 comparability ie the difference between this remedy and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases44 noting that trickery and deceit is more reprehensible than negligence the bmw court held that the degree of reprehensibility is the most important i ndicum of the reasonableness of punitive damages award the court also determined that high degree of culpability was necessary for substantial punitive damages45 additionally the court reiterated the pluralitys statement in txo that the proper inquiry is whether there is reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and the harm likely to result fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33773crs7 46 id at 581 citing txo

thomas dissented in an opinion written by scalia in which he labeled the courts punitive damages jurisprudence an unjustified incursion into the province of state governments48 scalia and thomas asserted that the courts guideposts provide real guidance at all and that the courts holding that the due process clause guarantees that punitive damages awards are reasonable is constrained by principle other than th justices subjective assessment of the reasonableness of the award in relati on to the conduct for which it was assessed49 justices ginsburg dissented joined by thenchief

farm mutual automobile insurance co v campbell in state farm mutual automobile insurance co v campbell the company had taken an automobile accident case to trial as part of an alleged nationa l strategy to limit its payments on claims refusing to settle ev though as the jury found state farm put the insured at risk of being personally liable for verdict higher than the policy limit56 the court overturned the 145to1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages holding that few awards ex ceeding singledigit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages will satisfy due process57 the court also elucidated its punitive damages jurisprudence58 by delineating five reprehensibility factors from its discussion in bmw of the first guidepost the state farm court expanded its previous holding and then determined that the presence of only one of the five may not be sufficient to sustain punitive damages award and the absence of all five factors renders any award suspect59 criticizing how the companys handling of the auto accident case was used as nati onwide condemnation of state farm the majority held that lawful outofstate conduct must ve nexus to the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff in order to be probative in the state where the conduct is unlawful and enable the jury to punish the defendant for its conduct in the unlawful state only60 though it declined to limit comparisons of punitive and compensatory damage awards to singledigit ratio th court also emphasized that in order to comport with due process awards will likely not be in excess of such ratio61 the court retreated from the use of criminal penalties in the comparable sanctions guidepost noting that the imposition of criminal penalties would occur only after criminal trial which has greater standard of proof than civil trial62 ultimately the state farm court remanded the case indicatin g that the award amount should behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33773crs9 63 id at 429 64 id at

the widow of jesse williams and the personal representative of his estate sued philip morris for negligence and fraud65 jesse williams had died of lung cancer and the suit alleged causal connection between jesse williamss smoking habit and his death66 the jury found for the plaintiff on both the fraud and negligence claims but found that williams was 50 percent responsible as to the negligence claim and therefore awarded punitive damages for philip morriss negligence67 the jury did grant 795 million in punitive damages for the fraud claim in addition to 2148580 in economic compensatory damages and 800000 in noneconomic compensatory damages68 the trial court limited the nonec onomic compensatory damages to 500000 because of oregons statutory limit but the ratio of punitive to

holding in state farm that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects against grossly excessive punitive damages awards74 on remand the court of appeals affirmed its previous decision williams i to uphold the jurys 795 million award of punitive damages philip morris then appealed again to the oregon supreme court the oregon supreme court decision the oregon supreme court began its opinion by reviewing the alleged 40year campaign by philip morris and other tobacco companies to distort information bout the health concerns associated with smoking through scientific research lobbying and public relations efforts this campaign formed the basis of williamss fraud claim75 the oregon supreme court held that philip morris and the tobacco industry intended to deceive smokers like williams and it did in fact deceive him and other oregon smokers76 the court then addressed the following questions did the trial courts denial of the requested jury instruction violate due process after discussing the us supreme courts holding in state farm the oregon supreme court addressed the first issue posed by philip morris on appeal whether as philip morris d requested the jury should have been instructed that the punitive damages award must bear reasonable relationship to the harm caused to the plaintiff and th at punitive damages cannot be imposed for alleged harm to nonparties77 agreeing with the court of appeals decision in williams i that philip morriss proposed jury instruction was incorrect the oregon supreme court held that under oregon case law the jury could consider the harm that the defendant inflicted on past present and future customers because the defendants tortious conduct was routine part of its business practice that it was unwilling to change78 the oregon supreme court then rejected philip morriss argument that under state farm punitive damages are not meant to punish defendants for harm to nonpar ties in making this dete rmination the court explained that state farm prevents courts from punishing fendants for harm to nonpartieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33773crs11 79 id 80 id at 1176 81 id 82 bmw of north america inc v gore 517

dissimilar acts independent from the acts upon which liability was premised79 given this standard the court stated that similar conduct by defendant may be relevant to punitive damage award80 philip morriss proposed jury instructi on would have prevented the imposition of punitive damages for the tobacco companys conduct that affected other oregonians in the same manner as williams81 did the punitive damages award violate due process the oregon supreme court then began its analysis of whether the punitive damages assessed in the case were unconstitutional because they were grossly excessive and therefore in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment the court used the three bmw guideposts in its analysis 1 reprehensibility of the defendants conduct 2 the reasonableness of the ra tio of the punitive damages award to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff and 3 comparable civil and criminal penalties82 turning to the first guidepost the court found that philip morriss conduct met four of bmw s five reprehensibility factors the harm to williams was physical lung cancer cost williams his life philip morris showed indifference to and reckless disregard for the safety not just of williams but of countless other oregonians when it knowingly spread false or misleading information to keep smokers smoking philip morriss actions were isolated incident but carefully calc ulated program spanning decades and philip morriss wrongdoing certainly involved trickery and deceit we concluded then that the first bmw guidepost favors very significant punitive damage award83 the fifth reprehensibility factor the target of the c onduct had financial vulnerability did not apply in williamss case because evidence was presented that demonstrated he wa s financially vulnerable84 but noting that bmw appears to indirectly suggest that vulnerability is not merely financial in nature the court concluded that it would awar d punitive damages nonetheless85 postponing its analysis of the sec ond guidepost the oregon supreme court skipped to the third guidepost comparable civil or criminal sanctions consideration of whether less drastic remedies coul d be expected to deter misconduct in the future while giving subs tantial deference to legislative sanctionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33773crs12 86 bmw 517 us at 58384 87 williams 127 p3d

comparable sanctions for its c onduct because the existence of oregons punitive damages law would then always provide notice and always validate the third guide post rather the oregon supreme court laid out three steps to follow in analyzing the comparable sanctions guidepost 1 identifying such sanctions 2 consider ing the serious nature of these sanctions compared to the totality of sanctions authorized by the legislature and 3 comparing the punitive damages awarded to the relative severity of the comparable sanctions87 comparable civil sanctions exist in oregon however comparable oregon criminal sanctions included mansla ughter and seconddegree manslaughter class b felony after listing the possibl class b felony punishments and fines for both individuals and corporations the oregon supreme court concluded that philip morris had notice that its conduct could result in severe sanctions and thus that the third guidepost favored the large amount of punitive damages awarded by the jury88 finally examining the second bmw guidepost the oregon supreme court found that the ratio of punitive damages to the actual and potential harm suffered by the plaintiff was not reasonable89 williams incurred less than 25000 in economic damages but died of cancer soon after be ing diagnosed the court found that had he lived longer williams could have faced more than 10 times that amount in economic damages the oregon supreme court suggested that williamss case fit one of the us supreme courts possible exceptions to the singledigit ratio in state farm plaintiff who received small compensatory damages award but experienced extreme egregious conduct by defendant because williamss short bout with cancer resulted in few medical bills and economic da mages of less than 2500090 the oregon supreme c ourt concluded that the williams case met two of the three guideposts reprehensibility and comparability because the guideposts are not brightline tests the oregon supreme court held that these guideposts could outweigh the us supreme court s due process clause concerns about reasonable ratios and grossly excessive punitive damages91httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33773crs13 92 petition

ins co v campbell 538 us 408 419 continuedii us supreme court review this section discusses the parties arguments in their briefs to the us supreme court on the two questions that the court granted certiorari to consider 1 whether in reviewing jurys award of punitive damages an appellate courts conclusion that defendants conduct was highly reprehensible and analogous to crime can override the constitutional requirement that punitive damages be reasonably related to the plaintiffs harm and 2 whether due process permits jury to punish defendant for the effects of its c onduct on nonparties92 then this section examines the decision dissents and potential future issues in punitive damages cases equality or independence of the three bmw guideposts with regard to the first question presented philip morris contended that the oregon supreme court erred when it upheld the 795 million punitive damage award based on only two of the three bmw guideposts reprehensibility and comparable sanctions philip morris read the supreme courts past holdings in bmw and state farm as saying that each guidepost has distinct role and that the three guideposts are all necessary to constrain punitive damages and prevent arbitrary awards that violate the due process clause93 williams responded that oregons substantive and procedural protections both constrain punitive damage awards and necessitate deference to the jurys verdict94 philip morris also argued that the reasonable ratio guidepost has three functions not served by the other two guideposts 1 proportionality in terms of ensuring punitive damages are not excessive because of the jurys potential punishment of nonpa rties 2 objectivity and equal treatment of similarly situated plaintiffs as opposed to the reprehensibility guidepost which philip morris asserted is subjective and 3 deterrence or ensuring that punitive damages awards are not greater than th states interest in punishment and deterrence95 williams noted however that oreg ons interest in deterrence should be at its apogee in this case of decadeslong consumer fraud96 according to williams the oregon supreme court did not for three reasons err in its reliance on only two of the three gu ideposts first the us supreme court has held that reprehensibility is the most important indicium of the reasonableness of punitive damages award97 and the oregon

third philip morriss argument would establish the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages as the most important guidepost in determin ing an awards reasonableness and would prevent punitive damages from serving deterrent function99 philip morris for its part concluded on the basis of various us supreme court decisions that only singledigit ratio s would satisfy the due process clause williams responded that an emphasis on ratios would preclude adequate punitive damages in cases that would merit greater than singledigit ratio types of cases that the us supreme court identified in state farm 100 nor williams argued would limiting punitive damages according to ratio formula allow for fact sensitive considerations or ta ke adequate account of the potential harmfulness of the defendants conduct101 philip morris contended that under state farm the permissible ratio of punitive to compensatory damages diminishes as compensatory damages increase102 disagreeing williams stated that this approach would foreclose oregons emphasis on deterrence and guarantee regime of underdeterrence103 finally philip morris submitted that in this case the amount of punitive damages should be at or near the compen satory damages amount in support of this claim philip morris stated that there is prospect that the conduct in question will be repeated104 as it is currently monitored by congress and regulated by both the federal trade commission ftc and the master settlement agreement msa between the company and 46 states105 williams countered that the purpose of punitive damages is not only to dete r philip morris from misconduct whom williams asserted has not been deterred by congress the ftc or the msa but also to deter others106 when attempting to dete r conduct that warrants punitive damages the court should also consider pr ofits and other benefits that the tobacco company derived from its fraud according to williams such as philip

nonparties the second question presented in williams was whether the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment allows jury to punish defendant for the effects of its conduct on parties not before the court philip morris argued that according to state farm the focus of punitive damages shoul d be on the harm inflicted on the plaintiff and that historically defendant s could not be punished in an individual action for harms to persons other than the plaintiff108 williams responded by noting that punitive damages traditionally have been awarded for injuries or potential injuries to others in addition to the plaintiff and have more than mere compensatory purpose109 contrary to philip morriss view that cases decided prior to the ratification of the fourteenth amendment did not include punitive damages for actual or potential harm to nonpartie s williams argued that cas from that era did weigh the impact on the public when they awarded punitive damages williams also cited the supreme courts holding in bmw that punitive damages awards can be supported by the states interest in pr otecting its own consumers and its own economy110 next the tobacco company warned of risk of multiple excessive punishment because the outcome of one case does not rest rict future plaintiffs from filing suit in oregon111 philip morris contended that oregon s allowing punishment for the effect of the defendants conduct on non parties will enable plaintiffs to sue repeatedly and that one plaintiff may eventually prevail w ith one jury even though many other juries rejected the identical argument when made by other plaintiffs112 in response williams discussed oregons statutory safeguards that protect against multiple punitive damages awards such as required consideration of th amount and deterrent effect of other punitive damage awar ds imposed for the same misconduct113 at oral argument some justices seemed inc lined to avoid the multiple punishmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33773crs16 114 record at 2223 philip morris usa inc v williams 051256 october 31 2006 justice ginsburg said that oregon adjusts awards based on the results in prior

petitioners brief at 4 williams 051256 120 id at 8 121 id at 25argument raised by philip morris noting that if second suit were brought on the same issue the court would then decide how to handle the issue114 furthermore philip morris argued that th plaintiffs attorneys did not identify nonparties or provide evidence that they suffered from the defendants misconduct115 according to philip morris haslip s guarantee of procedural due process safeguards to ensure the reasoned imposition of punitive damages was violated in williams because the company could not defend itself against potentially invalid nonparty claims116 williams c ountered that bmw suggested that compensatory damages could be multiplied by the number of affected consumers in oregon to determine the punitive damage award117 according to williamss interpretation of state farm and bmw the jury when determining the amount of punitive damages could consider evid ence of the defendants misconduct on non parties if it was similar to that which harmed the plaintiffs118 philip morris then argued that the due process clause required limiting jury instruction at the trial court level to reduce the chance that the jury would assess punitive damages for the comp anys harm to nonparties119 the due process clause requires such an instruction according to philip morris for several reasons individual plaintiffs are not prevented from filing similar lawsuits the defendant cannot respond to claims of parties not befo re the court and there is historical precedent for permitting collective punish ment in an individual action120 n t having received the proposed jury instruc tion was so prejudicial according to philip morris that the court should or der new trial as remedy121 williams

supreme court decision on the ground that due process does not permit punishment for the effects of defendants conduct on nonpa rties the court vacated and remanded the oregon supreme court decision the c ourt first noted that punitive damages could properly be imposed to further states legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition123 but ruling in favor of philip morris the court then found that the due process clause does not per mit state to use punitive damages award to punish defendant for injury that it inflicts upon nonparties for three reasons124 first the court found that an individual ca nnot be punished by state for an injury to nonparty victim without an opportunity to present every available defense125 such as showing that nonparty vict im knew that smoking was dangerous126 second the court found that allowing fendant to be punished for harming non party victim would add near standard less dimension to the punitive damages equation in that the trial would not likely be able to resolve potential questions about the nonparty victims127 third the court found support for the concept of using punitive damages awards to punish defe ndant for injuring nonparty victims128 despite these limitations the court stated evidence of actual harm to nonparties can help to show that the conduct that harmed the plaintiff also posed substan tial risk of harm to the general public and so was particularly reprehensibl although counsel may argue in particular case that conduct resulting in harm to others nonetheless posed grave risk to the public129 in other words evidence of harm to others or of grave risk of harm to others can be considered for the first guidepost of bmw which is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendants conduct130 the court did not explain its basis for this distinction noting only that for the above three reasons jury could not go further than this and use punitive damages verdict to punish defendant directly for alleged harmhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33773crs18 131 philip morris usa v williams 549 us __ 2007 127 s ct 1057 1064 2007 132 id at 1065 emphasis added 133 id at 1062 1064 134 id

using evidence of injury to nonparties to asse ss defendants reprehensibility and using it to punish see the following section finally the court held that states must provide constitutional protections that will prevent jurors from consider ing harm to nonparties when punishing defendant132 states must properly guide juries and limit their discretionary authority according to the court or there is risk of 1 arbitrariness 2 deprivation of adequate notice to defendant of the sever ity of states penalty and 3 the imposition of one states or one jurys policies upon other states133 these concerns have led to the s upreme courts determinations in past cases that the constitution limits punitive damages award procedures and amounts134 the court declined to consider the second question for which it had granted certiorari whether the 795 million award exceeded the cons titutional requirement that punitive damages be reasonably related to the plaintiffs harm135 the dissents justice stevenss dissent focused on the difference between compensatory and punitive damages he opined that th court had imposed novel limit on the states power to impose punishment in civil litigation136 he noted that punitive damages are sanction for the public rm the defendants conduct has caused or threatened and serve to ter and provide retribution137 justice stevens reasoned that jury could increase punitive da mages award because injuries to third parties enhanced the repreh ensibility of the defendants conduct thereby punishing the defendant for injuries to third parties138 for example murderer who killed one victim but injured many bystanders mig ht be punished more severely than murderer who only harmed one victim139 similarly justice ginsburgs dissent emphasized that punitive damages punish defendants reprehensible conduct that risks injuring many individuals140 joined by justices scalia and thomas she also criticized the court for its treatment of the state courts attempts to

that the constitution does not impose limits on the amount of punitive damages award142 future issues the us supreme courts holding that evidence of actual harm to nonparties can help to show that the conduct that harm ed the plaintiff also posed substantial risk of harm to the general public nd so was particularly reprehensible143 has been viewed by the dissenting justices and ma ny commentators as indistinguishable from punishing defendant for harm to nonparties through an increased punitive damages award because injuries to third pa rties enhanced the reprehensibility of the defendants conduct144 also the courts distinction has been seen as potentially confusing to the average juror145 in the future the court may encounter cases that reflect some justices concerns that ju ry may consider the alleged harm to non parties in punishing defendant146 the opinion specifically prohibits such considerations by jury147 after remand the williams case could arrive back at the us supreme court with an award of punitive damages that is similar to the award in the first decision on the issue of whether the award granted was grossly excessive the court could find that such large ratio of punitive to compensatory damages 97to1 in williams was unreasonable in state farm the court opined in statement favoring the ratio guidepost that more modest punishment for this reprehensible conduct could have sa tisfied the states legitimate objectives148 the court could also use reasoning similar to the reasoning that it used in state farm in which it reversed the utah supr eme courts decision

for an act of fraud149 in williams the oregon supreme court noted that there were comparable civil sanctions and that comparable criminal sanction for corporation for manslaughter is 50000 fine or payment of up to twice the amount that the corporation gained by committing the offense150 therefore if the court used the 50000 figure then under state farm punitive damages award of 795 million would be excessive in contrast the court could uphold larg ratio comparable to the 97to1 ratio in williams one way the court could uphold the award would be to base it on the oregon criminal manslaughter statutes provi sion for penalty of up to twice the amount the corporation gained by committing the offense151 twice philip morriss profits from its misleading campaign could be calculated to exceed even the 795 million punitive damages award the court may determine that such an award is not grossly excessive152 second way that the court could uphold the punitive damages award would be to distinguish williams from the business dispute cases state farm and bmw in which the court held that the punitive damage awards were grossly excessive and compare it to haslip and txo in which the court upheld punitive damages awards where the defendants had made deliberate false statements engaged in affirmative misconduct and concealed evidence of improper motive153 the justices could justify large punitive damages awards by using rationale similar to the one justice kennedy used in his concurrence in txo in kennedys txo concurrence he indicated that because the company acted with malice he could not say with sufficien t confidence that the award 526 times the amount of actual damages wa s unjustified or improper154 kennedy recited the west virginia supreme courts discussion of the case as one in which the defendant txo used unsavory and ma licious practices and engaged not in an isolated incident but rather pattern and practice of defrauding and coercing those in positions of unequal bargaining power155 applying this reasoning to the williams case if it returns to the supreme court after remand the justices could uphold ratio similar to the one in the oregon supreme court decision by comparing txos practices to philip morriss in williams including philip morriss alleged fraud in its alleged decadeslong campaign to distort information on the medical dangers of smoking additionally in txo justice kennedy found that the jurys large punitive damages award was motivated by leg itimate concern for puni shing and deterring txo156 the court could uphold the lower c ourt decision after remand and find that the jury was similarly motivated when it decided on large award amount
