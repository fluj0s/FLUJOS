transaction the law is in effect for transactions entered into on or after october 1 2008 enactment of the law does not mean that sellers may not provide downpayment assistance to borrowers obtaining fhainsured home loans it will simply mean that any contribution by the sellers will not count towards the 35 contribution required of the borrower as noted below current hud rules provide that the seller or other interested third parties may contribute up to 6 of the propertys sales price toward the buyers actual closing costs nonprofits may still provide gifts that would pay borrowers required contributions but the source of these gifts may not be the sellers this might have negative consequences on those nonprofits whose primary function was to act as middlemen in providing assistance to borrowers that would otherwise be prohibited by hud rules present regulation except for veterans or for borrowers replacing homes that have been damaged or httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22934 destroyed by presidentiallydeclared disasters the hud regulation provides that borrowers are required to contribute at least 3 in cash or its equivalent of the cost of purchasing home when the home is financed with an fhainsured loan2 the regulation provides that for borrowers aged 60 or more or for certain homes provided through the homeownership and opportunity through hope act3 42 usc 1437aaa the 3 contribution may be obtained through loan from corporation or other person under terms and conditions prescribed by hud for veterans or for borrowers replacing homes that have been damaged or destroyed by presidentiallydeclared disasters only 200 investment is required4 the regulation is silent regarding prohibited sources of funding administrative provisions revision 5 rev5 of hud handbook 41551 contains the underwriting guidelines for single family mortgage loans insured under the national housing act5 although the regulation and prior law were silent regarding prohibited sources of funding for the 2 24 cfr 20319 this is based on prior law note that the law is amended to require 35 contribution and the regulation will likely be updated to reflect this change 3 title iv of the cranstongonzalez national affordable housing act pl 101625 the title authorizes hud to make grants under the homeownership and opportunity for people everywhere hope programs to enable grantees to carry out homeownership programs in public and indian housing and in other multifamily housing projects 4 please note that this description is based on the regulation as published on april 1 2007 which differs from the regulation as published on april 1 2008 as will be discussed below the 2008 version of the regulation includes language from an amended regulation published on october 1 2007 but the october regulation has been set aside by the court and remanded to hud for further action this likely means that the 2008 version of the regulation is not in effect 5 mortgage credit analysis for mortgage insurance one to four family properties handbook 41551 rev5 october 2003 httpwwwhudgovofficesadmhudclipshandbookshsgh 4155141551hbhsghpdf crs3 borrowers required contribution the handbook establishes that hud does not permit the contributions to be made by the sellers of the property6 handbook 41551 rev5 provides that the seller or other interested third parties such as real estate agents builders developers or combination of parties may contribute up to 6 of the propertys sales price toward the buyers actual closing costs prepaid expenses discount points and other financing concessions7 these provisions may be included in the sales contract negotiated between buyers and sellers by the real estate agents though the handbook permits third parties to make contributions towards the buyers costs the handbook repeats the provisions of the regulation regarding the 3 required contribution from the borrower contributions from third parties do not count towards the buyers required contribution the handbook states however that an outright gift of the required cash investment is acceptable if the donor is 1 the borrowers relative 2 the borrowers employer or labor union 3 charitable organization 4 government agency or public entity that has program to provide homeownership assistance to low and moderateincome families or firsttime homebuyers or 5 close httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22934 friend with clearly defined and documented interest in the borrower8 the handbook goes on to state that the donor may not be anyone with an interest in the sale of the property such as the seller real estate agent builder or any entity associated with the above hud considers gifts from these sources to be inducements to purchase and the amount of the gift must be subtracted from the sales price and this reduces the maximum loan that fha will insure on that property an fhainsured loan on which the buyer has received gift of the required funds must be documented with socalled gift letter the letter must meet certain requirements 1 be signed by the donor and the borrower 2 specify the amount of the gift 3 state that repayment is required 4 show the name address and phone number of the donor and 5 state the nature of the relationship between the donor and borrower downpayment assistance programs sponsored by nonprofits as noted above handbook 41551 rev 5 provides that borrowers must contribute at least 3 toward the purchase of the home and that nonprofit may provide gift of the required contribution as long as the funds are not provided by the sellers in the 1990s several nonprofits developed form of sellerfunded downpayment assistance dpa program that worked around this hud restriction on seller funding the seller funded dpa programs were structured as follows 1 the nonprofit would provide the borrower with gift of the required funds 2 after completion of the home sale the seller of the home would make donation to the nonprofit and 3 the amount of the donation 6 handbook 41551 rev 5 p 18 7 handbook 41551 rev 5 p 18 8 hud handbook 41551 rev5 p 224 crs4 would be the amount the nonprofit had paid on behalf of the borrower plus processing fee for the nonprofit since the borrowers costs had already been paid by the nonprofit technically the contribution from the seller was not paying that borrowers costs it was replenishing the funds of the nonprofit and enabling the nonprofit to contribute to the downpayment of some future borrower structured in this manner the transaction did not appear to be prohibited by huds policy against having the borrowers required contribution paid by the sellers hud however did not agree with this interpretation the nehemiah progressive housing development corporation nehemiah of sacramento ca was given approval of its dpa program by local hud office the hud national office reviewed the paperwork and concluded that gifts to borrowers by nehemiah would longer be counted as meeting the borrowers contributions nehemiah filed suit over huds decision9 settlement agreement was reached in 1998 whereby nehemiah was permitted to continue operation of its dpa program and hud reserved the right to take regulatory actions with regard to dpa programs the agreement also provided that if hud took httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22934 regulatory action regarding huds treatment of dpa providers the applicability of the changes to nehemiah would occur six months from the effective date of the new rule the nehemiah program has expanded nationally and become the largest provider of downpayment assistance for borrowers obtaining fhainsured home loans number of other nonprofit organizations have followed the nehemiah pattern and offer similar downpayment assistance programs current issues with downpayment assistance irs ruling in may 2006 the internal revenue service irs published revenue ruling 200627 which provides guidelines on organizations that may provide downpayment assistance to homebuyers and qualify as taxexempt charitable or educational organizations under internal revenue code irc section 501c3 and those that do not qualify for this taxexempt status in its press announcement of the ruling the irs stated that funneling downpayment assistance from sellers to buyers through self serving circularfinancing arrangements is inconsistent with operation as section 501c3 charitable organization10 the ruling provides that an organization providing downpayment assistance does not qualify as 501c3 organization if 1 to finance its downpayment assistance activities the organization relies on sellers and other realestate related businesses that stand to benefit from the transactions the organization facilitates 2 in deciding whether to provide assistance to lowincome applicant the organizations staff knows the identity of the home seller and may also know the identities of other interested parties and is able to take into account whether the home seller or another interested party is willing to make payment to the organization 3 the organizations receipt of payment from the home 9 nehemiah progressive housing corp v andrew cuomo et civ s971817gebpan ed cal 10 httpwwwirsgovnewsroomarticle0id15667500html crs5 seller is corresponding to the amount of the downpayment assistance in substantially all of the transactions 4 the organizations reliance on these payments for most of its funding indicates that the benefit to the home seller is critical aspect of the organizations operations 5 the organization is structured and operated to assist private parties who are affiliated with those who fund the organization11 the irs noted that it is examining 185 organizations that operate downpayment assistance programs in addition the agency noted that it has denied applications for tax exemption from over 20 organizations that seek to provide this service revisions to the hud regulations over the years thousands of families have become homeowners through fhainsured loans using nehemiahtype dpa programs proponents of the programs point to these numbers and argue that without cost to the taxpayers the programs have been able to provide homeownership opportunities to low and moderateincome families hud argues however that the success of these sellerfunded dpa programs has not come without cost hud suggests that the programs have provided homeownership but httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22934 they have not provided sustainable homeownership in too many cases12 hud notes that the rates of defaults foreclosures and claims have increased so dramatically that the sellerfunded dpas jeopardize the solvency of the fha insurance fund13 losses to the insurance fund could possibly be sustained if mortgages involving sellerfunded dpas were small part of the insurance pool but borrowers receiving gifts of the required funds have increasingly become larger part of the fha insurance pool in fy1996 borrowers who received gifts were 29 of fhainsured loans by fy2006 such borrowers had grown to nearly 42 of fhainsured loans14 about 50 of the gifts received by borrowers in fy2006 and fy2007 were those from the sellers of the property15 hud finds the default rate on loans with gifts from sellers to be nearly twice the default rate on loans with gifts from family members16 primary concern of hud is that the sales price is often increased on homes financed through sellerfunded dpa programs inflated sales amounts result in inflated mortgage amounts and this increases the size of claims against the fha insurance fund when the loans default17 for these reasons hud has sought to curtail the sellerfunded dpa programs 11 irs revenue ruling 200627 at httpwwwirsgovpubirsdroprr0627pdf 12 72 fr 27047 13 73

establish that prohibited source of downpayment assistance is payment that consists in whole or in part of funds provided by any of the following parties before during or after closing of the property sale 1 the seller or any other person or entity that financially benefits from the transaction or 2 any third party or entity referred to as donor that is reimbursed directly or indirectly by any of the parties listed in clause 118 only organizations that qualify as taxexempt charitable or educational organizations under internal revenue code section 501c3 would be eligible donors this regulation was made final on october 1 2007 and had an effective date of october 31 200719 for nehemiah the effective date was march 31 2008 because of the terms of the 1998 settlement agreement between nehemiah and hud nehemiah and several other organizations whose nonprofit status might be challenged by the irs filed suit to block huds implementation of this new rule the united states district court for the district of columbia issued ruling on november 1 2007 temporarily enjoining hud from implementing the downpayment assistance rule on march 5 2008 the court vacated the final rule and remanded it to hud for further processing consistent with the courts opinion20 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22934 on june 16 2008 hud published new proposed rule which reopens the comment period on the may 7 2007 proposed rule as revised by the october 1 2007 rule21 current legislation as introduced on july 31 2008 hr 6694 would amend the new law to provide exceptions to the prohibition on seller contributions sellers would be permitted to contribute to the borrowers required funds on certain mortgages 1 mortgages under which the borrower has credit score in excess of 680 2 mortgages under which the borrower has credit score between 620 and 680 and upon which the borrower is charged mortgage insurance premium that is high enough to permit the loan to be insured without the need for an appropriation of credit subsidy and 3 mortgages insured in fy2010 or thereafter under which the borrower has credit score of 619 or less but only if hud certifies that such loans can be insured without the need for an appropriation of credit subsidy hud would be authorized to use riskbased pricing of mortgage insurance for borrowers with lower credit scores downpayment assistance entities would be required to offer to make counseling available to the borrower regarding the responsibilities and financial management involved in homeownership and to provide such counseling if the borrower accepts the offer 18 72 fr 27047 19 72 fr 56002 20 ameridream inc et v jackson 071752 ddc march 5 2008 and penobscot indian nation et v hud 071282plf ddc march 5 2008 21 73 fr 33942
