1mr ferguson its about 130 and weve got packed agenda this afternoon so in the interest of staying on time we want to get started the first session is montgomery county they have five presenters who come from the district representing different roles that they play they are going to go for about 45 minutes as group and then well have the discussants and the discussion so i guess frieda lacey are you going to go first you can introduce the others ms lacey all right thank you good afternoon im frieda lacey deputy superintendent of montgomery county public schools and we are just delighted to be here with you this afternoon you are going to hear from first then you are going to hear from dr heath morrison community superintendent dr morrison has 36 schools that he is charged with oversight for after that you are going to hear from mr adrian talley he has 39 schools in our district you are going to hear from mr jamie virga we were talwe think its critical as was stated this morning that we have that in place in any school district and then you are going to hear from mrs carole working one of our stellar principals high school principals in montgomery county public schools 2 im going to rush through this because i have lot of say and short period of time montgomery county has 200 schools we have approximately 138000 students and its the sixth largest district in the country the sixth largest now lot of people think that we are wealthy school district and yes we are but we also have lot of poverty and lot of diversity i came to montgomery county in 1971 so you look up there you can see what it looked like in 1971 and you can see how its changed over period of time so what do you do when you have something that looks like this and its changing rapidly when you see that the poverty is increasing that you are seeing that you are getting more african american and hispanic students you cant do the status quo you have to do something drastically different and so what we did was to divide up our district into the red and green zones take look at that thats reflective of our elementary schools in the red zone you see approximately 29000 kids 80 percent minority 50 percent farms 28 percent esl the green zone you can see whats on the chart so we knew we had to do something differently if we were going to make difference it was like we had two districts in one from the floor can you tell us what the farls is 3 ms lacey free and reduced lunch sorry about that you can see from 1990 to 2007 what the free and reduced price meals program looked like what it looked like then and what it looks like now when you look at our esl enrollment when you look at where it was in 1990 and where it is today looking at our elementary schools because we have lot of youngsters coming into montgomery county that dont speak english or english isnt spoken in their homes so you can see how that has changed over period of time one of the things in any school district you want to have very tight strategic plan and we have just that we have strategic plan we have initiatives we have data points we have milestones we have so much data that you have to have some type of coherence as it relates to the data because we give it to our principals they get the strategic plan what do they know to really concentrate on so our superintendent im sorry he isnt here because he is quite unique individual laughter ms lacey if you havent met him you are in for an experience he said we have to we owe our schools some way of letting them know whats important how we are college ready how we shoot for the north star so he started with seven key data points and youll see them reflected here im going to rush 4through this very quickly because i really want you to hear from the folks that have come with but we started with the reading bench marks in grades k through two and one of the things dr weist did was he put all the energy in the red zone how do you do that when i say he put the energy in the red zone we went from half day kindergarten to full day kindergarten in the red zone we went from class size of 28 to class size of 15 we phased in 15 schools and we put the energy there thats where we started did it make difference yes it did look at the data we heard tom payzant talking about standardsbased reform and we said that we wanted kids to read in kindergarten that was unheard of in montgomery county in 1999 kindergartners are supposed to develop social skills social skills and jerry weist said they will learn to read so 93 percent of our kids are engaged in text reading they are reading books we talked about the achievement gap 87 percent of our kindergartners that are engaged in text reading are hispanics 90 percent for african american and 93 percent for the district we call it level three benchmark reading we are so high that we have to change the benchmark this fall to level four because one of the things we have found out is that you always have to 5push not over the brink but you can never be satisfied we also one of the data points you saw listed was rigorous math fifth grade couple of years ago we had 196 kids taking higher level math today we have close to 5000 we had to train the teachers because they didnt know how to do it and if you look at this we disaggregate lot by race and ethnicity but we also do it by red zonegreen zone because we have benchmark and we want to at least get all kids to standard but we have to also have the rigor there we have benchmark by 2010 80 percent of our kids will be successful in algebra i at the eighth grade you see where we were in 20002001 and you see where we are today 20072008 that is 68 percent of our kids are taking algebra i or higher and they are being successful here it is disaggregated and you see the gap what we look for are incremental gains over period of time and when we see it leveling off or starting to go down what do we do we have to do something different we have to diagnose and problem solve we have to have strategy so as long as we see the incremental gains we are reasonably comfortable with what we are doing our superintendent likes to say we are the cream of the crap 6laughter ms lacey theyre his words not mine laughter ms lacey but i think it conveys powerful message because we can never be satisfied with the work that we are doing ap exams when dr weist first came kids of color not african american and hispanic kids were in those classes and we had teachers to tell us they cant do it well we put more kids of color into ap classes and so we dont pay for the ap exams but if you look at the data you see 60 percent of our kids take one ap exam look at how we compare african americans and hispanic kids compare to the rest of the nation and oh yes we put race on the table there is way you can close the achievement gap in the 21st century without talking about race you cant do it more than triple the national average in terms of scoring three or better six of our high schools were in the top 100 we have 25 high schools six of them were in the top 100 but thats not good enough because next year we need to have eight again you see our data we have many many challenges we can never be satisfied we have to have passion about the work that we are doing we have to talk about race we have 7to disaggregate the data we have to have initiatives and we have to have tools at this time im going to have dr heath morrison to come up and talk to you about many of our challenges and some initiatives and strategies and tools we put in place in montgomery county public schools mr morrison thank you dr lacey ms lacey thank you mr morrison okay as dr lacey so eloquently stated we have very high performing school district and we are very very fortunate to have that that comes with lot of work but how do we sustain that culture of continuous improvement how do we remain committed to making sure that we constantly look at data to inform our instructional practice our teaching and learning and our professional development and then how do we ensure that we are not school system that is about closing the achievement gap but that we are school system deeply and fundamentally dedicated to the idea of eliminating the achievement gap as our diversity in our school district is getting increasingly more diverse and we want to do that by raising the bar and so we constantly look for new ways to go about doing our business and what we want to share with you today is our work and something that we call mstat now mstat im very pleased to say actually go 8its roots in montgomery county through our partnership with tufts and team that dr lacey was involved with came to harvard and came back with some fantastic learnings where they had been exposed to particular way of looking at data through the new york city police department that they called comstat looking at trends looking at data through their different precincts trying to figure out where they were doing good job and where they could do better this really excited us as way to take our work to the next level and we reinvented it and labeled it mstat and it really is way for us to continue that work to engage in open honest conversations to look at our data and put race clearly on the table it is not about gotchas it is not about finding out who is not doing it to blame its about finding out who is not doing it to support but its also about finding out who is getting the results that really can yield best practices to inform all of our schools within the district we were having conversation at lunch around lunchtime today and we were having conversation with some folks in the audience about how school districts dont share from school district to school district well its truism that many schools within school district dont share and mstat is way for us to really glean who has story to tell and how 9do we translate that and scale up as we talked about today in the conference so far and it is really an exciting work because it involves our central office it involves our executive staff it involves our outstanding principals and we have brought teachers to the table so that whole conversation about listening to teachers we have listened to our teachers and they have truly informed our work so why do we use mstat in montgomery county public schools we use mstat really as way to take our work to the next level as we look at our data compared to state and national results as dr lacey said our superintendent does refer to our results as the cream of the crap he is absolutely opposed to two words good enough he hates the word complacency it is all about doing our important work because as we have increases we are truly doing good things for students and so we look at our data versus the state and nation and we are very fortunate it often looks better than the state and the nation and so what gets us to do the work at higher level as we look at our mcps trend data over time it is very fortunate and through the hard work of our employees and our business partnerships that our data looks better year to year and definitely the data from before dr weist became superintendent to now is just extraordinary but mstat 10allows us to compare our data to our rigorous data points and that is where we see our work that is where we look at it and we are not pleased to say we still see prevalent achievement gap that we are committed to absolutely doing something about our mcps data points are all about rigor and dr lacey was absolutely 100 percent accurate when she started talking about kindergarten today we are going to share with you some of our mstat work through the data team that i lead on psats and sats and my friend and colleague mr talley does with honors ap but we could take these data points all the way down to kindergarten because thats really where it really belongs when we go to kindergarten benchmark reading to level four next year its because thats whats going to lead our students particularly our minority students to be college ready to point to that north star we know that as we get more students in to take the psat that that will give us better data to get more and more students particularly african american and latino students into honor and ib courses that will raise our sat scores and that will allow us to have more students walking across the stage to have colleges and options mstat really allows us to aspire to create school system where student achievement will 11longer be predicted by race that sounds so lofty but that is what we are absolutely committed to and its the difference between where we are which is high performing school district and where we want to be and where we want to be is where we can show this graphic and have you not be able to say that the bars on this graph you can identify by race now right now i would say what does this graph mean to you and right now you would say its bar graph but if i said this is for school in our district and its for sats and each of the bars represents one bar per african american one for latino one for white one for asian i think we can all probably do good job of saying which two bars represent white and asian and which represent latino and african american that is true in our school district which i said it wasnt but it is and im sure it is absolutely true in your school district as well if we reverse that and say these data are about suspensions then you also will be able to do pretty good guesstimate about which of these bars represents what group mstat is about trying to change that make mistake it is about the elimination of the achievement gap in the interest of time i want to take you right to what we do with mstat and what we do with mstat we have different mstat teams based around our 12data points and we start again this graphic from one of our more recent mstats on psatsats it shows how we are comparing with districts across maryland there is nationwide psat data for tenth grade again we are doing much better than all other districts in maryland when we compare our trend data over time for psat participation again we are doing much better than we were and we are having fast acceleration with our african american and latino students again thats great but its when we compare our data to our targets and in this case our psats we had goal this year of having 93 percent of our students taking the psat this year and target goal of having 17 schools meet that benchmark district then we look at it through our mstat process and we find out that we didnt get there we only had 13 of our schools reach that target only seven reach it in african american participation and seven in hispanic we can and must do better this is our premier way that we display our mstat data to our schools this lists every montgomery county public school and it looks confusing but its really not we put the data out there and we put race on the table we say how are you in with all african american hispanic white and asian and we say its only success if all students are doing well we are not going to hide behind averages in montgomery county public schools and so as we look at these data its 13color coded if you are color coded in green you met this years benchmark for 93 percent if you are coded blue you actually met next years benchmark target of 95 percent if you are color coded yellow it means you met last years target and if you are color coded red you are two years behind and what we find out again remember when you use mstat to base our work on targets we have substantive work to do particularly with our african american and hispanic students we put out there the schools that meet and exceed the targets we talk about the schools that are doing it with african american students schools that are doing it with hispanic students but then we also put out the schools that are doing well but then we also point out the schools that have work to do again not to embarrass not to put out negative stigma but to say what are the schools getting back to the earlier conversation where we can grant some autonomy who has best practices to share that we can share and scale up systemically across 200 schools and who has schools that we must support for them to reach our targets here are the four schools used in our mstat last year that we identified that needed to improve and as you can see compared from last year to this year we had substantive improvement in each of the 14groups yes they still may not all be making the target but there is improvement and then two schools northwood and sherwood went from the worst performing schools on our psat initiatives to two of our best performing schools what i would like to do now is to bring up my colleague and friend mr adrian talley who will go through more of the mstat process particularly as it relates to apib participation mr talley dr morrison talked about the process of mstat i want to talk about the power of mstat with you today and the power of mstat gives us the opportunity to have conversations with our principals dr morrison talked about that its not gotcha its the opportunity to talk with principals about whats happening in the schools its to determine what we are doing well and also to determine where we need to improve its also to create opportunities for open and honest dialogue and its also to use data as an entry port about discussions about race and equity within our schools in december we held an mstat on honors and ap enrollment enrollment is one of our targets that we have and at the time we had targets as well for all of our schools at the time though we had only twelve schools that met or exceeded our countys target for enrollment of all students in an honors or ap course 15and our target is enrollment in at least one honors or ap course we had only one school that met the target for african american students and we had five schools that met the target for hispanic students remember again as dr morrison said and dr lacey said our target is higher than the national target we had principals discussions in december principals met they talked with each other about how they can improve enrollment of their african american and hispanic students and the reason we chose december was there was still time to affect change because you go into the second semester in january therefore you could go ahead and move more children into honors and ap based upon some of the strategies that were discussed at our december mstat in your powerpoint youll see some of the questions that were discussed and asked of the principals during the discussion section of the mstat and then we had the answers that the principals were able to take from the mstat meeting and then take back to their schools and their leadership team and you can see some of the responses that they provided what happened we now have june mstat coming up in two weeks which im looking forward to are we making target across the board but we did see improvement what we have now are fifteen schools that are making target for all students we have three 16schools that have shown improvement or are making target for african american students and seven schools that are making target for hispanic students in enrollment but whats also important dr lacey talked about continual improvement and what we saw or what we have seen is we have twelve schools that show double digit increases in the enrollment of students in honors and ap of african american students and we have eight schools that show double digit improvement in the enrollment of hispanic students in honors and ap courses again we are not making the target but we are seeing the improvement and we put this on the table and one of the things thats most important in the school improvement plans one of the things that we really stress with our principals you need to set goal thats specific for african american and hispanic students if you arent making the target that should be goal put in your school improvement plan another thing thats important is to look at the schools over time that are showing improvement because those are your benchmark schools and we put that out there for everyone to look at because if im principal i need to know who are the schools that are doing it another thing thats important is if im principal i want to know what are the schools that are similar to and so weve also included scatter plots to help us understand what are the schools that are 17doing it and therefore if im school with 20 percent enrollment in african american students i can then see where i am and where schools are above the line and those are the schools i need to speak with but if im also school with for example we have one school here whitman which is less than 10 percent enrollment of african american students and you can see that they are way below the line but we have poolesville way above it as principal of whitman you know exactly where im going to go im going to poolesville to find out what they are doing and how they are doing it the other side of it is not only enrollment because we not only have to put the children in we have to have them perform very well we have to have them take the exam there was an article in the paper about principal in new jersey who is forcing every child to take the ap exam and the controversy that has created and so we also have targets for participation and targets for performance on the exam what have we found well we have ten schools that have met the target for participation on the exam for all students and only seven schools have met the target for performance thats scoring 3 or higher on ap and 4 or higher on the ib exam what about for our hispanic students we have six schools that have met the target for 18participation and we have four schools that have met the target for performance our african american we have zero schools that have met the participation target and zero schools that have met the performance target that we are looking for in our june mstat this is what we are going to spend our time talking about we are setting time aside for principals to come together to look at what they can do because they have their leadership team meetings this summer to plan on how to address the issue of african american students performance on exams hispanic students performance on exams and also test participation what we are hoping for in our county because what we have is if you look at us from the standpoint of national average we are looking at high enrollment high test participation and high performance the upper box but when we think about it for ourselves we are really not there yet and for our african american students we really are low enrollment low participation and low performance we want to move back up to the top box and thats going to take thats where the mstat is coming in and its seeing difference with what we are doing the power of mstat leads to reflection on instructional practices what are they doing in the classrooms what are they doing to help the children 19achieve it also leads to discussions about what is and is not working it leads to staff development to broaden skills and aptitudes because if they have low expectations then they arent going to do what they need to do and it leads to change in expectations and behaviors now coming up is jamie virga who is our director associate superintendent for the office of organizational development mr virga thank you adrian as adrian said one of the keys is staff development we are gathering all this information how do we move from data to information to knowledge and then to action that will produce results so our overall strategy for professional development in mcps is that it needs to be based on compelling student data and the needs of staff and we have to be very strategic we cant do everything we have to focus we really believe in job embedded professional development and one of the first things dr weist did when he came to the district was put fulltime staff development teacher in every school i can tell you being principal at that time it changed my life its ongoing and its agile because we have to respond to the different needs of our students we are going to come back to this slide again because this really is the focus and as associate 20superintendent for organizational development i have to be able to connect the dots between all the training and all the professional development that we are doing in helping students to meet these targets to do that we really see that our work is with teachers its with administrators its with our support professionals weve really taken focus in the last couple of years in working with teams schools and offices as group and as individuals but its about that knowledge sharing and best practices and how can we take knowledge that weve gained in schools that have been successful and use it to help the district one of dr weists ideas couple of years ago going back to 2004 or so was he noticed in the data analysis of schools that there were three elementary schools very different schools that had gotten student results and been able to sustain them over time at that time i was principal at viers mill elementary school and you can imagine coming to principals meeting and saying were your ears burning i said well dr weist was just talking about you and your school and the idea was to use again borrowing from pelp to use case study process to do case study on these schools and then use that as professional development tool for the district thats where the professional learning communities institute or plci came from 21 this is ongoing professional development for school leadership teams when we say the team its big team we are talking 15 to 18 people from each school because its the principal the assistant principal the staff development teacher the reading specialist grade level team leaders support services staff parents its the folks who are empowered at the school to go back and actually make change happen and the goal of plci is to eliminate the achievement gap in the schools that are participating so how do we do that well its kind of threepronged approach first its structured professional development using case study approach so what happens is the plci schools the teams from the plci schools come out five or six times year the morning is structured professional development case studies working on what is plc how do we work together how do we create collaborative teams how do we do datadriven decision making and then the afternoon is their time to do their school improvement work and thats been critical element of this then following that structured professional development there is followup from people in my office to go in and meet with the leadership team to meet with the whole staff to do presentations to parents whatever is needed for that individual school 22to make the next steps in their journey and we do provide schools for the two years that they are in plci as you mentioned that this is two year commitment to support interventions for students or to create collaborative planning time for teachers but then after the two years they have to be able to sustain that without that extra funding i dont have time to show you clip here from plci and the participants but if you go to our website you can see that and its part of again of our overall strategy about supporting teams schools and offices we also have staff development specialists who work to support the staff development teachers that are in each school we have kind of mini plci called school leadership institute thats more focused on particular topics and we are really committed to baldridge guided school improvement because we believe if we build the capacity of staff and the teams and the entire schools thats going to lead to increased student achievement but the proof is in the pudding did it work well this is data for plci and you can see that when in terms of baseline data when we first started with plci the gap that existed in the cohort one schools this was the eleven schools that were our original cohort the gap was around 22 points between african american hispanic and white and asian students 23and over the two years in the program that gap narrowed at the same time the performance for white and asian students was increasing the performance of african american and hispanic students was increasing but at greater rate and we see the same thing not only in reading but also in mathematics so the work is not done but its promising the work tells us that if you empower school teams that they can make differences happen in student achievement and i think you know thinking about some of the comments this morning one of the things that weve really learned through plci is the importance of teacher leadership and what weve seen in the two years that the schools are participating that teacher leadership really emerges and through the time and the training that we give the teams we really see teachers empowered and then they go back and make actual things happen in their schools weve seen schools really modify their master schedule so that there is collaborative planning time for teachers weve seen them change their approach to what interventions are for students and increase their parent outreach so we are very excited by lot of the work thats happening and we have focused lot of the work on our leaders in moment you are going to hear one of our wonderful principals but i would as an introduction 24of ms working i would say one of the other things weve done as systems strategy is we have superintendents and s meetings which is all principals all central office directors five times year for the last three years the content of those meetings has been race and equity weve had pedro nogero weve had glen singleton weve really focused on courageous conversations because we believe we have to get the leaders to do it first before we can ask everything to happen at the school level you cant lead where you havent been so we are working on individual transformation of those leaders and thats going to be individual transformation of our system so with that i will turn it over to ms working who is going to tell you the story of quince orchard high school ms working so now that youve heard all that how do we at the school level get our teachers to really embrace with their hearts and their minds this work that youve just heard talked about and how do we get them to roll up their sleeves and really engage in trying to close the achievement gap in our schools i have been at quince orchard high school for two years and when i walked in the door there we go 25 quince orchard is comprehensive high school fouryear high school of about 1750 students and it had done pretty good job of maintaining the status quo for the last few years and while that was going on it was becoming increasingly diverse when i first began researching the school it had school improvement plan that wanted to improve school climate and it actually had as its second goal that it would identify and monitor the 40 lowest performing students in the school and that was the springboard for in my first meeting with leadership team i asked them to tell about quince orchard and in doing so i had put all around our leadership room lot of data that i had studied and at the end of that day they said to we are walking advertisement for the achievement gap and we were and from that selfrecognition we had to say how do we take this to our teachers we needed to examine our belief system we needed to examine our decision making process we needed to examine the way we work so the first thing that we thought we have to get our teachers to look at this data too but we want to do it in way that is understandable to them so we began by personalizing the data and im going to show you an example of how we did that whenever we talked about data and i am in high school we used pictures of our students because we wanted our teachers to 26understand we are not talking about numbers we are talking about the success of our students these are our students and so this slide that im showing you now is an exercise that we did with our instructional leadership team to talk about whats going on with our minority students what kind of classes are we placing them in at this particular time quince orchard high school had 28 percent of its african american students in an honors class and about 28 percent of its hispanic students in an honors or ap class and so we had our leadership team take look at 25 kids and their schedules and the grades that they were making gene was one of these students he was straighta student and everyone was completely content to let him stay there this initiated real discussion among our leadership team and our staff about who is responsible for looking at whats going on with the kids and making recommendation then we sent our leadership team out into the departments and asked them to replicate the exercise and to come back at the end of the first semester with 25 kids from each department they did that we moved up 150 kids at the semester and we learned through data analysis both soft data we had people who would come through and go gosh how is gene doing in honors algebra ii and the teacher would go well you know 27its really struggle when you get one of those students and they would say well lets look at the grade book and people would go but you know hes got b and we learned that 80 percent of the kids that we moved up moved up without much difficulty at all they adapted to the class they adapted to the instruction they were supported by their classmates they didnt need heavy intervention from teachers and 20 percent needed our help so after learning that i think it kind of reframed for the school what was going to happen and at the end of the first year we moved large numbers of students who had indicators that they were capable of doing much more rigorous work into honors and ap classes and we entered last year with 59 percent of our african american students in honors and ap and 57 percent of our hispanic kids moving into honors and ap so this is just an example of the kind of data work that we did with our teachers when i went to the school i had been in red zone school for quite few years and i had been heavily engaged in the work of bringing school out of school improvement and was thinking that was not going to be work that i had to do at quince orchard high school but within month of landing there i found out that my school had not made the target and so once 28again i was explaining to teachers why the school had not met the target even though if you just looked at the average data it looked like we did so i was explaining about disaggregated cells and once again we did it with pictures of our students we put up big pictures of our graduating class and then in vertical lines labeled english as second language special ed free and reduced lunch hispanic african american white asian we put up the pictures of the students who needed our help to get to graduation and it was very powerful tool i did training sessions with that that members of the faculty did not get up at the conclusion of the session and go up and actually find their students on the board and although it was not an intended outcome i actually had made it visual which students were really high impact they could see which students appeared in cell after cell and we really needed to help pass the test and so their ability to see it and visualize who needed our assistance drove how we created our intervention programs and the school was able to pass and make ayp this year and actually make great gains in all of our disaggregated areas we also personalized the data with our teachers at quince orchard high school we actually look at data with teachers names on it in our team alike groups and in department meetings 29 and lot of people have said to you know your data is very public and i think i dont really appreciate that now as much as i probably should because its become the way we work one of the things we studied on our leadership team was the adaptive leadership challenge and weve worked very hard to make safe place where we can look at individual teacher data and recognize this is our data its the data of our school we are all engaged in helping our colleagues work on the data and identify whats not going right in class so as you can see the third person down is clearly struggling with poor children special ed children and african american it turned out to be boys in particular and we were able to do some restructuring things in that class but also take look at the way the instruction was being delivered to help make it better the second thing we really worked on was our leadership team because i recognized very early on that they were going to be asked to do more things than order textbooks or be responsible for administering end of semester tests in their department so we really began to study together and this was new for them and the first time that i introduced that we would read together and we were going to read about goal setting and how goals impacted 30the kind of team that was created they actually said to in the meeting you know carole if we wanted to read something we could do it at home after school and i realized that i was going to have to you know work on how we did this but before long we were actually reading together books about professional learning communities books about how to structure intervention systems in schools we have been spending the last three months reading how do you improve thinking in adults in your building how do you lead teachers to process the things that we want them to process and to make good decisions because we are talking about now widening our circle and turning this work over to teachers we also did lot of data work together and all of my instructional leadership team i think feels much more comfortable about working with data and then we have worked on empowering staff we waited year before we really took heavy work out to the faculty we spent the first year kind of doing tipping point projects specifically identified groups of kids and smaller groups for high school 75 kids 150 kids and showing that if we targeted the work we could make difference but this year we began rolling the work out to staff and the first thing we did was use document called equitable instructional practices or its about culturally competent teaching and we are 31lucky because our county actually gives us this as part of our study of race and equity and we took it to our teachers and had them reframe it through the lens of relationship rigor or relevance and then all of the teachers formed cohort groups and began peer observing at how competent we were at using the strategies that improved student relationship or rigor or relevance now i work in high school where stand and deliver is prevalent model and some of the instructional conversations or pedagogical conversations that have come out of this are amazing weve proved that you cannot capture wait time in the wild in high school and we even went people are coming and saying im going to be observing you and your use of wait time and so that took us to place where we actually went back studied it learned to use it more effectively began documenting what was the impact on our classes when we first started with relationships we proved that we think we affirm when we went in and really tip marked it we werent nearly as affirming and friendly as we thought so weve tried to empower staff and weve seen some pretty good results we work our ninth grade through statistical model and last year worked on what we call level three students students who enter high school with grade point average of 18 to 22 our model 32says that they should spend at least part of the year ineligible for extracurricular activities which means they have below 20 and by following our data work we were able to hold them eligible grading period to grading period between 82 and 91 percent and doing the work that i told you about before you can see the jump in honors and ap enrollment for our whole school for african american students and for our hispanic students the thing that we want our teachers to know is that when we work together when we work in targeted way when we use the data to inform our decisions that we can help create better school we can help make our students successful so thats the quince orchard story its good work i love doing it applause mr ferguson could i ask everybody to come to the table ms pollock so im mica pollack john diamond and i decided we flipped coin and ill go first i was really taken by this presentation thank you very much for giving it to us i was thinking in terms of connecting it to our conversation this morning i hear on the table the question of who needs to have which conversations about improving student achievement and at the district level we heard here we need you know sort of 33conversations about commitment we saw outcomes analysis we saw we need to have sort of the level of seven benchmarks for this districts precise schools but then we saw the school level needing to zoom in much further than that and have conversations i was very taken by the pictures of the young people zooming into actual children and youth and saying what exactly does gene actually need and so the sort of connecting these levels of which conversation is where i think is very important i wanted to sort of ask my work is about trying to sort of get people to zoom in on those everyday interactions and so i wanted to know sort of how what if any resistance you encountered in getting people to zoom in there because ive seen couple of things in doing professional i saw you said number of times today we put race on the table we dont sort of ignore issues of race we put it on the table i wanted to know sort of what kinds of conversations you put on the table and exactly if and how you dealt with resistance that you encountered ive done now i used to work at the civil rights office in the department of education ocr and i have book coming out this september where i look at four kinds of resistance that people raised that educators raised when they were accused by parents by advocates of denying opportunity to kids of color 34 you guys have more positive spin in your district where you say who can we support how these are people who felt blame for denying opportunity they raised resistance to zooming in on opportunity provisions they said we didnt intend to harm anyone that was one big form of resisting they said we are not racist we have best our intentions are the best for young people they resisted sort of very specific remedies coming from the outside in any way what you seem to have done in your district is sort youre developing and devising remedies from the inside which might sort of mitigate some of that tension there was lot of lack this is coming from sort of federal government coming in to improve school district its very different dynamic but sort of problems with lack of sort of inspiration sense of possibility and will it seems that you have managed to inspire people in montgomery county and i want to hear more about how were the cream of the crap probably is not how you inspired people in montgomery county laughter ms pollock it sounds like youve moved beyond close the achievement gap to eliminate it that seems to be inspiring people but i heard this morning and im wondering from montgomery county is even closing or eliminating the achievement gap really whats inspiring people to do the work whats inspiring 35people in montgomery county and have you encountered any resistance and then finally im wondering if youve encountered any resistance that i saw working at ocr about saying you know this is the making mountain out of molehill the everyday things teachers do really dont matter that much its structures its poverty its stuff outside the district im sure youve all heard this resistance in your districts so im wondering if youve encountered any such resistance in montgomery county or if somehow magically you got everybody on the same page and working towards this so im wondering about those questions of will inspiration how you have built it there but also im very taken by this sort of what one superintendent recently called sort of granular level of analysis he managed to get people doing going far beyond we will get everybody even beyond we will get kindergartners reading to how do we get gene doing x and z ms lacey ill start first i would have to say i started with jerry weist august the 2nd 1999 and it was life changing experience for because what i most admire about him is he is not afraid to be honest he is not afraid to disclose data here today you saw that we have long way to go when we say we arent meeting those targets but he really started 36by having all of us read the book results we knew exactly what he wanted he said let tell you one thing as rapidly as we are changing we wont have these wealthy homes we wont have these fine businesses so he hooked up with the politicians our community and he said if you want to create change then you are going to have to put the resources in the most impacted area now that was about race we just didnt call it race so he started with reading results he talked about the red and the green and was there pushback when he started talking about the red and the green and putting the resources in the green area you betcha what i observed is that he is very strategic he would just add on once he got the concept of the red and green people accepted that once we went to full day kindergarten in the red zone smaller class sizes but we got the what we got the results and if you get the results you are going to get the funding so it started small and he kept building upon it until we were at and stacey is in the back we were at pelp and this was three years ago we had eight superintendents there and he stood up before the group and he said im going to put race on the table every superintendent looked at him like he had lost his mind they were numb they were speechless they couldnt say thing we came back the next year and we talked about 37what we had done and they stood up and applauded but it started you talked about the resistance he just kept chipping away at it and he kept being honest we had said at pelp when we put race on the table that he had to talk with his entire leadership team and the question is how did he do it we were all at an as meeting we were all very nervous because our boss the man that we admire was engaging in risky behavior by putting race on the table he held up the newsweek about katrina and there was an african american child with round face and tear rolling down her eye and he said to that audience what is this about is it about poverty is it about race is it about access is it about equity and he then showed us our data and he said we will have katrina here in montgomery county looking at the different demographics if we dont do something differently so we got results he scared our politicians we got pushback from our principals weve been on the mstat when we started showing the data and called in all the high school principals all the middle school principals all the elementary principals and showed them the data if you think that wasnt buzz about they didnt want it but it was the right thing to do when you use data how can you argue with it we are proud to say for those data points we have 38crafted these books so for every time we have an m stat we give them these books but these books outline best practices they can go they can look at their data they can compare their schools but we have principals there like carole working thats how we know what carole is doing talking about what she has put in place jerry has been talking about putting face on every child for nine years she did it she put face on every child so its been process weve gotten the resistance but did we pushback we kept persevering there is common language in our district district with 200 schools we all talk the same talk walk the same walk youll hear carole say things that we say in central office there is common language there we have courageous conversations we talked about datadriven decision making every principal has had the mstat experience but when we give them book and give them help that also helps too its one thing to have resistance but if we say were here to help you that helps as well ive done lot of talking and i could go on and on i want some of my colleagues to elaborate as well ms working i would say that actually the culture of the central office over nine years of building momentum for this work does support the 39building principle but when you go in of course there is resistance because you are challenging the status quo and so you have to help people understand the work and we use phrase in our instructional leadership team doable and inviting how do we make the work doable how do we make it inviting and we do try to hold the big picture every so many months for our teachers ive actually done faculty meetings where i go in and whats behind on the screen is picture frame and then we put different things in it that we are trying to accomplish as group together so i think there is moral ground in this work we have actually in my school now gotten to where we are discussing whiteness because we are reading glen singleton and the first time that we did it the dialogue was almost explosive i had teacher say to i will not defend my whiteness and i responded back one is asking you to do that we are asking that we understand that some of us have whiteness and it may impact the learning of some of our students and we need to be conscious of that well year later i now have faculty saying to we need to know more about whiteness because they are coming to understand that they are asking peoples parents to behave way that may not be their culture and they are beginning to recognize they 40need to learn how to communicate how to provide education to everyone matter what everyone all of our students and that sometimes they have in their heads the students must act certain way or do their homework certain way or go home and sit at kitchen table certain way and eat cookies and not all of our students are in that position mr virga so there is big professional development piece to that how do we work with our leaders and with our teachers to build some awareness of that so that that can be incorporated into their interaction with students before i was in this job i was director of the professional learning communities institute and i remember attending leadership team meeting and they had done an amazing job of collecting data about office referrals of students kids sent down to the office for poor behavior they knew what time of day it was they knew where they were sent from they knew which teacher had sent them they had all these patterns and everything and i was just sitting there and i just raised my hand and said have you thought about looking at this by race because they hadnt they had gathered all that data but they hadnt looked at it in terms out of all these kids who were being sent to the office how many of them are african american how many are latino 41how many are white how many are asian well when they went back and looked at that there was really disproportionate number of african american kids being sent to the office so that became something that we worked with them through plci just another kind of lens that people can put on they also noticed well you know right before winter break there is spike in office referrals and right before spring break there is spike and that must be because the kids are really stressed then and i said do you think maybe the teachers are little stressed then too laughter mr virga that might have something to do with it and i think one of the big ahas that we are gradually introducing folks to is the whole concept of color blindness you have lot of teachers who believe in the its what they were brought up believing about teaching and about how you treat people teach everybody the same well if you are working with school of kids or district of kids where the demographics are rapidly changing and you are not seeing color and you want to work with everybody the same and really you are expecting all of those kids to act like you are and thats disconnect and that leads to office referrals and it leads to poor student 42achievement and some of those other things weve talked about so weve really been working through our leaders we have lot of work to do to bring it down to the classroom level its happened in some schools you see how visionary principals can take that forward but our next challenge is how do we do that systematically every school every classroom ms lacey i would just like to say the whole notion about resistance is huge though every time weve introduced strategy weve had to do this pushpull when we started with the kindergarten literacy initiative all of our kids are tested three times year by teacher using palm pilot recording the data and it scores the data the teachers resisted that so there was huge resistance there we get resistance from the teachers but we knew it was the right thing and we just kept on and kept on now you cant take the palms away from them so you do get it from staff but you know whats right you do get it from your community you get it from your politicians but they cant argue with the data one of the stories that i would like to share with you just very very quickly is what happened at bethesda chevy chase high school this particular principal had an assembly every year for african american and latino students it was just to get them to 43sign up for ap and ib classes he was hugely successful and at our mstat process he met every target he met the district target the school target the target for african american and hispanics on ap honors so he told he said well i dont know what to do frieda he said there is segment of my community that says its reverse racism and i said well let handle it so i called our attorney and our attorney said is it an underrepresented group and i said yes we crafted the communication to that segment of the population and they quieted down but you have to be unrelenting when you know you are right and you are on the right course you cannot stop and thats jerry weist you cannot stop theres the book blink when you know youre right you have to act on it and i think that accounts for portion of our success mr talley i also just want to say i think one of the things that dr morrison and i do as community superintendents not only do we supervise principals but we help them into integrating the concept of race and equity in what they are doing by our conversations with the principals by working with the principals to help them understand different ways to address the pushback from staff we create opportunities for the principals not to work in silos 44but to work as clusters to work and learn from one another and i think thats whats so important we have conversation about when you have individual schools which we dont have but if you are district with only one school you have difficulty talking with other colleagues about what they are doing in their buildings we address that issue by providing those opportunities for our cluster principals to come together to have the conversation about how they are dealing with that pushback another thing we did in our office we just did our book study even though glen singleton has been coming to our district our office the office of school performance did book study on his book and that has really opened our eyes about more ways to help our principals to deal with and handle the conversation about race and equity mr morrison the last comment on this is in terms of the supervision and collaboration with our schools its really important that you get all your systems and processes lined up to reach those leverage points and in school district of 200 schools that look very dissimilar its important that adrian is not having different conversations than i am its the same message it just gets delivered in different ways we created monitoring protocol calendar that is distributed to our schools so our principals know the 45questions that we are going to ask they are very aligned to race equity the mstat type of questions that we ask and then our principals have many of them have taken those same questions that we go out to have with them and they have started to address them with their leadership teams like carole has at qo and i think that the other part thats really important in terms of your original question is it gets back to the conversations this morning about does the accountability precede the trust and there really is trust to verify and thats what mstat is about when we mstat we see the schools that get it we see the schools that are making substantive progress and so for those schools they really become the story for us to tell others and then we also see the schools that are struggling and our superintendent always says were not trying to get them we are just trying to get them to do better for our kids and so it focuses our work the same way that carole can look at her data and see which teachers are clearly getting it and which teachers need some additional support so it really is about identifying where the areas of growth are the opportunities and they are all based around conversations of race and equity ms pollock and what im hearing then is that you set the target you say that you you do allow 46for autonomy and sort of inquiry of how do we at the school level how do we actually how do we actually lower our suspensions here and if you find good strategy then you disseminate it to the rest of the district mr morrison i would like to say i dont know lowering suspensions what we want to say the conversations we want to have is what are the behaviors that we are seeing that lead to suspensions and create better learning and teaching environment so that students arent engaged in the kind of behaviors that are resulting in suspensions mr diamond all right so i will be hopefully relatively brief with my questions this was very impressive presentation what really struck is the sort of moving segueing from this morning to this afternoon to be able to sort of think about the sort of theoretical and this has something to do with the planing on the conference itself sort of the theoretical framing led nicely into this discussion but what was really fascinating for is thinking about the district level and then moving to the level of the school and all of the sort of structures that you put into place to make the changes happen in your district but also the recognition that with all the success that you have had there is still long way to 47go and so that the expectations dont just become well we are going to reduce the gap were going to make incremental change its really about eliminating it its really about not being able to recognize that bar graph in terms of race and ethnicity the few questions i have really relate to not so much these sort of broader the broader issues that youve been talking about but sort of starting at the classroom level and trying to think about the ways that you understand whats happening inside particular classrooms or in classrooms across your district ive been working for several years on trying to understand how teachers actually change their instructional practices what are the processes that they go through who influences them what kind of interactions are they having that are sort of informing how they teach and recent book that i published with jim spillane talks about the concept of distributed leadership about how leadership is distributed throughout the organization how we can think about teachers changing their practice starting with teacher practice and moving back to the multiple influences that you talked about and so one of the questions that i have for you is how do you know whats happening in classrooms one of the questions earlier was about teachers and 48instruction so the question i have initially is how do you know whats happening in classrooms and secondly knowing whats happening in classrooms are you thinking about the changes that you make as based on certain model of whats supposed to be happening instructionally is it based on empowering teachers to teach in ways that they think are best for them or empowering teams to figure out what to do in their particular schools or particular classrooms and then sort of what is the way that you think about teachers changing the way that they teach obviously you have some ideas about instruction as being important to whats happening but how do you think about teachers changing over time and what the sort of theory behind those kinds of changes are for people in your district and then the oh okay go ahead ms lacey i think mr virga and the community sups can certainly answer the question but i would like to also tell you another story based on the mstat of how we were able to use mstat to identify some stellar teachers we were having an mstat meeting on higher level math in the fifth grade we were not meeting the target for african american and hispanic students and so we problem solved after mstat and said there ought to be some way there ought to be some teachers out there that are doing it that are making difference with african american and hispanic students 49 so couple of us got together and got with the research department and said find us some teachers look at the data and find us some teachers they came forth with ten names three were in bold i called the first principal and i said tell about natalie howard true story and he said she is the best teacher ive ever seen in my life ive been around for 15 years ive never seen anyone like her before she greets the kids by name at the door when they dont learn she is upset with herself and she says how can i do better job so for each one of those data points we shared with you we have project where we are trying to identify exemplary teachers and we are figuring out what we do to showcase those teachers to help other teachers but on daily basis i would like them to talk little bit about your question mr virga well one of the things that was very interesting when we had the mstat where we had these three elementary teachers who had demonstrated success with african american and hispanic kids in advanced math one of the questions that was asked of them tell us about how you got there how did you develop the skills and the knowledge one thing that all three teachers mentioned was program that we have in our district in terms of studying skillful teaching 50and you might be familiar with jonathan sefere and research for better teaching and we use the studying skillful teacher research as the basis of what we believe good teaching looks like one of the other things that dr weist did when he came into mcps was he said we need common language about what good teaching looks like so all of our incoming teachers take studying skillful teaching i and ii our administrators are required to take observing and analyzing teaching i and ii also the staff development teachers who are in each school are taking those courses so we really have established pretty clear common language about what we believe good teaching looks like how do we then work on implementing that in the classroom well in addition to the principal who has obviously had the teaching and this instruction and the staff development teachers we have staff development specialists who also work with the staff development teachers and everybody is pushing that same message so different schools are going to do it different ways there might be walkthru process there might be peer observation theres different things and the community superintendents work with individual schools about how they are going to implement that 51 but there is real focus on we just believe good teaching is going to get results so how do we clarify what that is for teachers and then support them in it i think real important part of that too and then ill stop is that those concepts are clearly reflected in what we call our teacher professional growth system we dont have teacher evaluation system anymore we have teachers professional growth system based on six standards that are again researchbased and aligned with studying skillful teaching and thats the document those are the standards that we use to observe and analyze and give teachers feedback one of the things that we havent really talked about during our presentation today is our employee organizations and i think another thing you really have to give dr weist credit for is the relationships he established with our principals union our administrators union teachers union and support services because we have professional growth systems for all three employee groups that were developed in collaboration with those employee groups to the point that we have par panel process where teachers are involved in the decision to nonrenew the contract of the teacher who is working below standard and you can imagine the pushback that our teachers union president gets when she goes around and 52talks about that but it is about system vision of excellence and what professional growth and good teaching should look like ms lacey and i would like to say we have that for principals too so its not that we are singling out teachers mr morrison and support services ms lacey and support services and principals so if you are not doing your job then you can be referred to par and your peers have the authority to say lets continue to support or dismiss and they do dismiss mr morrison we call ms lacey the right people on the bus mr morrison we invite you to find your happiness elsewhere laughter mr morrison but that only comes after that only happens with folks who dont accept and respond to the support its year or two years of targeted support every new teacher is assigned consulting teacher whose job it is to help them through that first year to help them meet the standards ms lacey and every new principal is assigned consulting principal so we do want to support them 53 mr morrison couple of other things that i think is very important when dr lacey mentioned natalie howard natalie howard chose to teach the advanced math class for the students who were being accelerated into advanced math and just getting an opportunity to be in her classroom our strathmore elementary school is one of the schools that i have the pleasure of supervising as community superintendent we had that earlier conversation today about classrooms that are just beating the odds and you can see the skills that she is bringing is she heroshero perhaps but what she is doing on daily basis can be scaled up and so part of our mstat process is as we identify these schools as we identify these principals as we identify these teachers we are actually taking our learnings and not only putting them into the booklets that dr lacey spoke to but we are also putting them onto our website so that people can work towards their own professional development teachers and educators who really care they are the most able to know what they need and so they can access they can hear about natalie howard and through our website actually see whats going on in that classroom to see what they can bring in terms of their own professional development and enhance their own teaching and learning 54 i was struck earlier by the comment about most professional development just stinks and thats probably very true across many districts in the nation and i was particularly struck by the conversation about how our teachers come in not being able to differentiate not being able to meet our students needs in reading and not being able to deal with the behaviors in school district that is changing as rapidly as montgomery county that is increasingly being populated by students who public education has underserved if it wasnt for professional development and that systemic commitment to it we couldnt maintain the results that weve had prior to dr weist but we would be falling rapidly and so its that investiture in professional development its the differentiated resources educational equity really is the same for all based on need and when we have areas of montgomery county all of the schools that i supervise i have the pleasure of suping those schools that are in the red zone and so we are truly blessed to have these differentiated resources but it really is that staff development teacher in each school after the principal i really believe that that staff development teacher has the greatest opportunity to move that school forward because as teachers there is trust 55 they can come and they can say well this is where im seeing my needs how can you help i happen to be married to staff development teacher at one of mr talleys schools and so on nightly basis i see her accessing doing his work laughter mr morrison ive got to say laughter mr morrison which is good its all good but i see her trying to meet the needs of her teachers and i actually yesterday she was on our data warehouse and she was looking at the different certifications of all the teachers at her school because she was planning for summer leadership week and it was that differentiation that she knows that our teachers need at one of mr talleys schools that is changing rapidly thats going to be able to sustain the results that we are having and take us to that next level mr talley i just want to say one more thing to respond to the question about how we see that the same type of instruction or good instructional practices are occurring our office of curriculum and instructional programming working not in isolation but working with other offices ood being one the office of organizational development created lookfors they have lookfors for the what you should find when you go 56into math class what you should find when you go into reading class equitable classroom practices lookfors were created by the office of organization development and so principals teachers have common language that they are using as to what should be happening within their classrooms and these are really part of the curriculum guides that have been created for our teachers and therefore if im going into classroom and observing math lesson if teacher is spending 30 minutes on the warmup we know something is wrong if they arent using equitable classroom practices then we know something is wrong and i think those lookfors help to develop that common language that we need ms lacey i would also like to say think about how powerful it would be if principal put face on every teacher every building service person in the building and each teacher put face on every child in the classroom suppose teacher our teachers put face on every child in that classroom starting at the elementary level and we say you talk about autonomy study your own data figure it out and when i meet with you tell tell your classroom plan you talk about school improvement plan so there is more work for us to do mr ogletree ron is going to ask question in just second but let just ask small 57question that i hope will be answered in the affirmative on this datadriven system two questions related one i assume that the ap classes are all comparable there is not range of classes so you are in ap physical education they are comparably rigorous number one and the second question that i didnt ses is there any sense that the improvements is result of the bottom dropping out lot of schools have suspensionsexpulsions so the worst kids arent there so the numbers look better over period of time is that not the case in montgomery county mr morrison absolutely not again going back to as dr lacey quoted our superintendent our graduation rates both in the traditional way of looking at graduation rates and the new mechanism from the time when they are in ninth grade either way you look at it they are better than just about any other large school district in the country ms lacey the third highest of the largest school districts mr morrison but that being said they are still not where they need to be but every school in montgomery county is getting increasingly diverse every school in montgomery county is being impacted by poverty and so thats why we will be starting two new mstat teams next year one will be on suspensions and one will be on eligibility and actually the work that 58our superintendent has tasked our team going to pelp this year is to deal with expectations and so i think they all come together to ensure that as we have these data points that we look at that we are not gaining these data points they really are reaching to broader group of our students and to group of students that traditionally have been underserved in public education ms lacey many of times i think you have to have protagonist in the school district and sometimes i serve in that role while we are putting kids of color in ap classes when we peel back the onion guess where we were putting kids of color african american kids guess what ap class what ap class psychology something is wrong with that picture and so thats been my message you know why psychology what is it about what do you want us to figure out the achievement gap ourselves laughter ms lacey they are putting kids but that bothers and so what they do is they say well we have more kids in ap classes but then you peel back that are they in math are they in science they are in psychology is that safe is that not as rigorous as the others so thats why you just have to be unrelenting about the work that we do mr ogletree professor ferguson 59 mr ferguson ron ferguson i needed to say my name let suggest that we had half an hour break scheduled from 300 to 330 im suspecting im not the only person with questions so why dont we take ten minutes of that break and take fifteen minute discussion now if somebody has to go out please feel free to get up and go out but well maybe go until ten after the hour and then go from there to 330 and start the other session at 330 mr ogletree and you were going to ask question too mr ferguson yeah i do have question too mr ogletree i was going to say just make sure the questions are pretty precise given the time to get as many on the table as possible mr ferguson okay question there has been resistance to things like mstat thats what you call it right there has been resistance to mstat because it makes people uncomfortable to have to sit and be held accountable for the numbers in their room and for the people in other school systems who might have considered it but not done it because they didnt want to make people uncomfortable you might want to say word about mstat 60 second question the teacher what did you call them ms lacey exemplar teachers mr ferguson the teacher in each building that coaches the other teachers mr morrison staff development teachers mr ferguson the staff development teacher i assume thats very separate from the accountability system so people arent afraid mr virga they are not evaluated right mr ferguson they are not evaluated and finally just if you could make comment as you go along about the question that tom payzant raised this morning about balancing control and autonomy and how you figure out how much autonomy to give teachers as opposed to control and the fear that if you give lot of autonomy before you give training thats not good idea mr talley i just want to talk earlier this morning someone had mentioned i think it was kitty had mentioned something about fear of teachers not liking im not quoting her correctly and i apologize not liking their principals or fearing their principals or something to that affect with mstat and the question you had raised we had talked both heath and i talked about the fact its not gotcha its the relationship you have with your principals just like 61the relationship principals have with their teachers that allow you to have the mstat conversation before mstat even began we individually were having conversations about data mstat made it more district level conversation piece and i think by having those relationships with your principals you are able to talk about indepth about their data and not make them feel apprehensive our very first mstat we had were people somewhat apprehensive yes but when they left it they left energized and really quite excited about the process and now schools are doing it within their own schools and clusters are doing it within their clusters mr morrison one of my principals the first time we did mstat because not only did we do it on district level but then we do it within our clusters and our principals are doing it with the schools but one of my very high performing principals turned around and they had just gotten their red hat from the superintendent which is what he does at as to recognize when principals are doing exemplary things with our targets and so she was quite pleased with herself as well she should be but then when we did the afternoon with the mstat and she looked at the data and she turned around and she said heath youre going to put my business out there for everybody to see and im like wait second 62now i mean youre okay with your business being out there when you got the red hat and you know laughter mr morrison so yeah were going to look but actually one of my directors of school performance had just come from principalship and his school was one of the poorest performing schools in this particular mstat and he said folks this is not going to be easy he said but the data is what the data is and our superintendent says we need to take our students and schools from where they are and take them to where they need to be and thats what we are going to do and we are going to find out together in true learning community how that gets done so i think there was some initial apprehension but what we are finding is that as we identify schools that need support the next time we mstat because its rotating cycle all the times theres schools that we identified that need support and focus become our success stories and then they are sharing what they do ms lacey i would like to also say that maybe it was how we kicked it off because whey we did do our first mstat we had the governor of maryland and the county exec who were both interested in implementing some type of comstat on government level so i think our stakeholders realized that this was 63something we were doing that the governor and the county exec were also thinking about modeling that helped i think it also helped that when we connect the dots we have strategic plan it has the data points it has targets in it we hold you accountable to those targets it makes lot of sense doesnt it we identify exemplar teachers we identify best practices we give you those strategies we recognize you at the superintendents meetings and then the most important thing is we have to get our funding it is critical that we get our funding especially today if we dont get the results and we dont focus on those results and have process or tool that will help us get those results we will not be supported by our county exec we will not be supported by our county council we will not be supporting by our senior citizens seventy percent of the folks in our county dont have children in montgomery county public schools we have an over 2 billion budget our teachers got five percent cost of living increase that our superintendent and our unions at the table fought to have because they told the politicians if you want to be reelected we gave you these outcomes we want the money we were at the table together so its also very very critical through process like this that you reward your stakeholders our teachers got five 64percent increase in their salary but it was only because of the results ms working i had the pleasure to be in the first group of high school principals to get to do this and i have to tell you i was horrified i hated the thought of it i was phoning every middle school principal who had been through their i was really worried and i was called out on data point that i did not want to have to speak to at all but i need to tell you i learned so much from having to prepare for that meeting that i its valuable and i learned things that i was able to use at school this year mr ogletree first question ms ifekwunigwe good afternoon my name is ann ifekwunigwe im fourth year doctoral student in the urban superintendents program here my question is related to what you discussed about the teachers studying skillful or the studying skillful teachers program also i believe you have or you are in the top twenty of national board certified teachers in the nation and i was wondering what role national board certification plays in your teacher professional development programs mr morrison well we view national board certification as one of those pieces that supports individuals first because we really do provide lot of support at the district level in terms of financial 65support as well as coaching and instructors that are in place out of my office so yeah we are really pleased we are in the top twenty we have three times more than any other district in maryland and number of those folks who work in central office and number are doing great things in schools the studying skillful teaching course again is something that i would guess i would bet that most of the national board certified teachers have completed as well but it is courses that are offered during the school year and also during the summer its 36 hour course and its again researchbased and its very job embedded because part of what happens with the course is teachers are asked to take the strategies that they are learning whether its about mastery of objectives or attention moves or communicating high expectations and to go and implement them in the classroom do little action research and then come back and report on it so i think its very tight way of continuing to communicate that message about what we believe good teaching looks like mr ogletree next question mr ash thank you very much paul ash superintendent of schools in lexington massachusetts at asa dr weist gave presentation on the same topic he talked about data teams in each school and what struck that was very powerful about 66that and i would like to have question to you in regards to that he said its not enough to develop professional learning communities and have teachers with common planning time work by themselves but embedded in each school there was team of teachers that worked with principal and that they looked to the data of the school and that informed the plcs but then he stopped and i didnt have chance to ask him could you connect could you comment on that the power of those teams in each school and i also have idea how it would work in high school so its really i would appreciate your comments ms working well i have two teams i have the team that really creates the data and also loves to bring to your attention what they are seeing and then i have team of you want to know how we really know what goes on in classroom and then i have team of the core department chairs work with to really monthly we really really look at data and we talk about data what data pieces we want to really focus on with our full leadership team which is about 22 people and also we are always looking at whats happening with our school improvement plan i think in montgomery county we have 14 and about to be 15 data points that high schools work with but we have focus points within our school ones that we think we really need to move right now and thats its 67critical and so we really are looking at data very much around those but recently my team has been looking at lot of data around assessment and whats really happening between formative and summative assessment and where formative isnt aligning with summative assessment and what are the real implications for what is happening in our classrooms and we have moved into system of where the county now writes certain standardized tests for all the high schools to in core curricular area say like us history well when we see that the formatives are consistently nonaligning we are going to go in to find out why is this something out of file drawer from about six years ago or is this something that the teacher doesnt understand i mean you get lot of information from this that actually is about teaching and learning mr ferguson how frequently is formative at the high school ms working it depends different people do different things which is whole other discussion but we want them giving minimum of grade week we want at least three summatives in marking period and its there is like really big discussion about this because we are looking for way to get our faculty to understand that they will adapt and modify instruction depending on the learning and thats big concept in 68high school if significant portion of your faculty has said i deliver it you learn it youre responsible for learning it ive done my job mr ogletree we have about three minutes left so i would like to get both of the questions on now and then whoever is appropriate can respond to it so let start here and then get the questions from both of you ms ulrich my name is lisa ulrich im the chief learning office at citizen schools and i have two questions the first is what impact have you seen on the students who are doing less well having more students of color in ap is there higher culture of achievement higher motivation and the other question is does your strategy how have you involved parents in your improvement strategy mr ogletree and the last is there question ms ward good afternoon im dr wanda ward north park university and director of special education my question of course is related to youngsters with special needs i didnt hear any reference to those populations of students in your data i dont know if you disaggregated it or where they are i just looked at an article on the alt maryland 69assessment for that group of students where i had chance to speak with prince george county personnel who have the highest passage rate for special needs youngsters in the country so i would like to know where they fit into your work and i think its excellent ms lacey i can take on that altt point and just speak to that you mentioned the alt msa and for the audience it is the child left behind assessment for the extremely disabled youngsters that are not part of the regular curriculum montgomery county public schools had not been doing that well for that population because we found it is not test to determine how well the children are doing its how well the teachers are doing and it takes lot of time we have i have in my office white paper to the state superintendent for our superintendent to share with her because we have an issue with it we did accelerate our training this year the community sups know that the principals know that we really have to train our teachers the teachers have to write objectives and spend lot of time making sure well you seem like you know about it so we are concerned about that we do look at special education when we look at our data sets and one thing we have discovered isolation doesnt work integration infusion full 70inclusion whatever you want to call it so we are shutting down those isolated programs and putting kids with disabilities into their regular classroom and we have coteaching going on and the data indicates that the kids are doing much better in special ed ms ward were they included in the numbers that you guys had here ms lacey yes ms ward amen thank you laughter mr ogletree and the other two questions do you want to respond mr talley i want to you had mentioned about parent involvement every school in montgomery county has to have school improvement team part of the school improvement team and actually we are charged our office is to ensure that parents are involved on the team number of years ago involvement simply meant they signed on the line saying they approved the school improvement plan now the involvement must be more specific it must be more real mstat there are some schools that are using the data and presenting it at school improvement team meetings which at some schools is every month when i was principal i met once month with my school improvement team which included the parent and we looked at the data the problem some principals had 71to get over was how do you share the data with parents being there and as carole was doing giving names and faces to the data but when you work with your parents its about that relationship piece i talked about earlier you can have parents who can maintain confidentiality and support the practices because when you are trying to improve or engage parents because some of our schools are having difficulty engaging certain segments of their population but when you have parents who are part of your team who are from that segment of that population they can do the outreach that you as principal may not be able to do and that is where some of our schools are seeing their success by having their naacp parent rep which every school must have in montgomery county by having your hispanic parent rep call parents and get them involved one of the techniques used to increase enrollment in honors and ap was having your naacp rep call parents african american parents and talk to them about why your child needs to be in an honors and ap course or having some of the hispanic parents call other hispanic parents and get them involved in having the child engaged in enrolled in such courses so thats how we are doing it mr ogletree can someone respond to the other part of the question about whether or not more 72students of color taking ap courses has that impacted the larger group sense of pride about the success ms working that has not happened in our school although the teachers absolutely thought it was going to happen and we had moment where pretty much the leadership team had to recognize that our teachers were actually telling the students that thats what would happen but the scores it didnt happen in terms of the scores the other part that you were asking ive been in really fascinating dialogue with my parent community because they view ap participation as line on resume for getting into college and therefore there should be problem with you dropping it after youve been accepted laughter ms working the school much less take the test but weve been in dialogue with them as school saying we view this as preparation for independent and successful functioning in college and here are the skill sets we would like all of our children to have so we are starting to see more support from our parents mr morrison before carole became our principal she was an outstanding assistant principal for one of the schools i supervise and there was particular department resource teacher who was not happy 73about this push and talked about how it was going to end up watering down the expectations and standards for all students i ran into this person about month ago and we just chatted in the hallway of her school and she said you know dr morrison i have to say this she said what we are doing in ap i couldnt be prouder and she said it really makes think of that quote rising tide lifts all ships and she said thats really whats happening in our school and whats happening in montgomery county public schools mr ogletree we have 14 minute break there are books out there being sold so please thank our panelists and our discussants applause
