00001360 0012 of 004 1 sbu chancellor merkels new cabinet emerged early on october 24 after month of intense media speculation about its makeup it contained several surprises perhaps the most unexpected announcements were that of former interior minister schaeuble as finance minister and former economics minister karltheodor zu guttenberg as the new defense minister the christian democratic union cdu will run the chancellery as well as six ministries and have minister without portfolio the free democratic party fdp will hold five as well as the vice chancellorship and the christian social union csu three the ministerial competencies and their names remain unchanged following is short description of merkels new cabinet which was formally sworn in on october 28 chief of the chancellery and minister without portfolio ronald pofalla cdu pofalla 50 takes over from thomas maiziere as the chancellors chief of staff pofalla is lawyer and since 2005 served as cdu secretary general he is known as close confidant of angela merkel as secretary general he had been criticized as lacking public profile and not being aggressive enough from 20042005 he served as deputy caucus leader for economics and labor issues in the bundestag also within the chancellery merkels security and foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen remains as do maria boehmer as minister of state for migration refugees and integration and bernd neumann minister of state for culture and media eckart von klaeden cdu and merkel confidant becomes state minister in the chancellery for coordination with the federal states and parliamentary contacts foreign affairs guido westerwelle fdp westerwelle 47 becomes foreign minister and vicechancellor as expected economic assistance will not be included in the foreign office but the fdp will also control that ministry minister of state within the mfa will be werner hoyer who already served in that function under foreign minister klaus kinkel from 19941998 he also was westerwelles foreign policy adviser in the election campaign he will cover all divisions apart from culture and economics and sustainable development the other minister of state is cornelia pieper deputy fdp chairperson who has experience in this field and will reportedly focus on cultural and communication issues martin biesel westerwelles bundestag chief of staff will become state secretary within the mfa to coordinate the work of the fdp ministries with the chancellery westerwelle has described biesel as his closest advisor defense karltheodor zu guttenberg csu the csus rising star zu guttenberg 37 seemed certain to remain in the cabinet however there was speculation that his economics ministry seat would be up for grabs when economics went to the fdp and finance to schaeuble zu guttenbergs best fit was in defense the defmin job gives zu guttenberg the opportunity to work on foreign and security issues again which was his main area of interest as parliamentarian he is seen as good and capable replacement for jung who was widely criticized for being overly cautious and inarticulate in explaining security and defense issues to the german public zu guttenberg is expected to improve the defense ministrys image prestige and weight within the cabinet through his popularity and public relations talents his appointment has already boosted morale among working level officials in the mod who believe that zu guttenberg will make mod real player once again in german security policy debates he is transatlanticist and well known in washington he will likely give the defense ministry higher profile he will retain the current parliamentary state secretaries thomas kossendey csu and christian schmidt csu interior thomas maiziere cdu maiziere 55 lawyer is confidant of angela merkel and has served as her chief of staff in the chancellery for four years he had been mentioned as potential finance minister but reportedly his personal preference was interior he brings some experience to the job since he served as state interior minister in saxony 20042005 and as state minister of justice 20022004 however some of the issues he will face as federal interior minister namely international terrorism are topics he has less exposure to maiziere is known to be consensus builder who works the interagency process well and is good problem solver berlin 00001360 0022 of 004 finance wolfgang schaeuble cdu merkel wanted political heavy weight in this difficult position during the financial and economic crisis schaeuble 67 is an experienced strong and well established politician from germanys southwest who is expected to fill his new role quite well he has by far the longest federal government experience in merkels cabinet confined to wheel chair since he was shot during campaign rally in 1990 the conservative politician from the german southwest is not known as close friend of chancellor merkels member of the bundestag since 1972 he is pragmatic copes well with pressure and is known for his fierce loyalty he does not shy away from confrontation and will be ready to pursue unpopular or controversial measures in light of his age and his political standing he does not have to fear any consequences for his future career which younger candidate would take into consideration while he had to give up the interior ministry which he reportedly liked very much he is being compensated by running one of the most influential ministries in the cabinet while he cooperated well during the coalition talks political observers would have expected major clashes with fdp justice minister leutheusserschnarrenberger over domestic security issues if he had remained in the interior ministry economics and technology rainer bruederle fdp bruederle 64 has been deputy caucus chief and economic spokesman of the fdp in the bundestag he already served as economic minster in rhineland palatinate 19871998 where he strongly promoted winegrowers trade and small and midsize business since 1983 he has been state chairman of the fdp in rhineland palatinate and member of the national executive committee and since 1995 deputy national party chairman hansjoachim otto and ernst burgbacher both fdp will become state secretaries within that ministry labor and social affairs franzjosef jung cdu defense minister jung 60 was unexpectedly switched to the labor and social affairs ministry jung had fallen victim to much criticism during his tenure as defense minister and merkel had been pressured to replace him merkel however had to find another cabinet post for jung to maintain proportional regional representation in the cabinet jungs state of hesse had to be represented another reason for merkel to keep jung in the cabinet in spite of his weaknesses and previous failures is his loyalty as minister justice sabine leutheusserschnarrenberger fdp leutheusserschnarrenberger 58 is fdp chairperson and caucus chief in bavaria she successfully ran the 2008 fdp election campaign in that state where the fdp reentered the state parliament after 14 years of absence she was the fdps chief negotiator on justice in the coalition talks she previously served as justice minister under chancellor kohl from 19921996 but resigned in opposition to legislation allowing electronic eavesdropping of private residences which was planned by her own government she has strong focus on civil rights and data protection and has been critical of what she views are overly intrusive wiretapping and other electronic surveillance measures see ref c family affairs senior citizens women and youth ursula von der leyen cdu von der leyen 51 medical doctor and mother of seven had indicated strong interest in moving to the health portfolio and worked out that respective section of the coalition agreement for the cdu merkel reportedly was not interested however in the cdu controlling the health ministry in light of the necessary but unpopular reforms and increasing costs of health care for citizens since the health ministry went to the fdp von der leyen will remain in her current position in the past few years von der leyen has successfully modernized the family policy of the cdu and thus its image in this sector she is one of germanys most popular politicians according to public opinion polls health philipp roesler fdp roesler 36 is the youngest member of the cabinet and his nomination was surprise he is sharp and dynamic and rising star of the fdp he was state secretary general state party chairman and eventually economics minister in lowersaxony he was born in vietnam and was adopted by german family both roesler berlin 00001360 0032 of 004 and his wife are medical doctors which gives him some practical background for his new portfolio roesler negotiated the health section of the coalition agreement for the fdp environment nature conservation and nuclear safety norbert roettgen cdu roettgen 44 close confidant of chancellor merkel had also been named as potential chief of staff at the chancellery he has worked closely with the chancellor since her days as caucus chairman 20022005 merkel reportedly appreciates his loyalty and analytical talents during the financial crisis he became one of her closest advisors while he does not have reputation for expertise in his new portfolio merkel obviously wanted to position many of her confidants in the new cabinet environmental issues especially climate change will figure prominently for merkel education and research annette schavan cdu schavan 54 will keep her current cabinet position even though she did not have prominent record as confidant of angela merkel it was assumed that she would stay on as member of the cabinet transportation building and urban development peter ramsauer csu since november 2005 ramsauer 55 has served as head of the csu group in the bundestag and deputy cducsu caucus chief as minister for construction housing and transportation he will have huge budget to work with food agriculture and consumer protection ilse aigner csu aigner 44 only became minister for agriculture and consumer protection in october 2008 she came to this job as an expert on research issues and new to the realities of production agriculture in her tenure some parts of the german agriculture community have been critical of her performance particularly her close relationship to bavarian minister president horst seehofer the csu was interested in keeping this portfolio since agriculture continues to play an important and tactical role in bavaria economic cooperation and development dirk niebel fdp niebel 46 has been secretary general of the fdp since may 2005 and belongs to the inner leadership circle of the fdp he was named as potential minister since he made strong contributions to the electoral success of the fdp his actual expertise would have been labor and social affairs however that portfolio went to the cdu the fdp sought in the coalition talks to have the ministry of economic cooperation and development bmz merged with the mfa but failing that having control of both ministries goes long way to meeting its concern that bmz development policy be in line with mfa priorities especially on key issues like afghanistan media commentary has focused on niebels lack of previous experience in development assistance and how he may essentially serve as department head under foreign minister westerwelle comment 2 sbu with five ministries in the new cabinet the fdp is arguably one of the most powerful junior coalition partners in recent german history in terms of both the number and quality of their cabinet appointments the greens had three mostly junior ministries in their coalition with the social democrats from 19982005 the fdp has one more than it had during its last coalition with the cdu this is due in part to the election outcome in which the fdp had its strongestever performance with 146 percent of the vote cdu officials also describe the appointments as partial compensation for the policy concessions the fdp made during coalition negotiations the cducsu will have the popular and competent karltheodor zu guttenberg as defense minister balancing the fdps control over foreign affairs and development assistance zu guttenberg strong transatlanticist is wellconnected in washington and already has strong background in foreign and security policy there has been some criticism that the new cabinet does not have any representation from eastern states merkel responded to the criticism reminding that in fact the chancellor herself counts as representing the east end comment berlin 00001360 0042 of 004 3 u this cable was coordinated with consulates
