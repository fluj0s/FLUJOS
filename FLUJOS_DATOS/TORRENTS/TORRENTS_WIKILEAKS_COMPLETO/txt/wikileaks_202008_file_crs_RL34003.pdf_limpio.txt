on february 6 2007 the bush administration announced its intention to create new unified combatant command us africa command or af ricom to promote us national security objectives in africa and its surrounding waters prior to africoms establishment us military involvement on the continent was divided among three commands us european command eucom us central command centcom and us pacific command pacom the new commands area of responsibility aor includes all african countries except egypt africom was officially launched as s ubunified command under eucom on october 1 2007 and became standalone command on october 1 2008 in recent years analysts and us policymakers have noted africas growing strategic importance to us interests among those interests are africas role in the global war on terror and potential threats posed by uncontrolled spaces the growing importance of africas natural resources particularly energy resources and ongoing concern for africas many humanitarian crises armed conflicts and more general challenges such as the devastating effect of hivaids in 2006 congress authorized feasibility study on the creation of new command for africa to consolidate current operations and activities on the continent under one commander as envisioned by the department of defens dod africom will pr omote us strategic objectives by working with african states and re gional organizations to help strengthen regional stability and security through improved security capability and military professionalization if directed by national command authorities its military operations would aim to deter aggression and respond to crises dod signaled its intention to locate africoms headquarters on the continent early in the planning process but such move is unlikely to take place for several years if at all us officials are consulting with strategic partners in the region to determine what type of presence on the continent would be most appropriate and what location or locations are most suitable the new command will operate from stuttgart germany for the foreseeable future dod has stressed that there are plans to have significant troop presence on the continent the 1998 bombing of us embassies in east africa highlighted the threat of terrorism to us interests on the continent political instability and civil wars have created vast ungoverned spaces areas in which some experts allege that terrorist groups may train and operate instability also heightens human suffering and retards economic development which may in turn threaten us economic interests africas exports of crude oil to the united states are now roughly equal to those of the middle east further emphasizing the continents strategic importance this report provides broad overview of us

continent on february 6 2007 reflecting africas increasing strategic importance to the united states1 the department of defense dod organizes its command structure by dividing its activities among joint military commands based either on geographic or functional area of responsibility aor2 with the creation of the new command dod now has six geographic commands and four functional commands previously us military involvement in africa was divided among three geographic commands european command eucom central command centcom and pacific command pacom the new commands area of responsibility aor includes all african countries except egypt which remains in the aor of centcom africa co mmand africom was launched with initial operating capability ioc as subunified command under eucom on october 1 2007 and reached full operating capability foc as standalone unified command on october 1 2008 africoms first commander army general william kip ward former deputy commander of eucom was confirmed by the senate on september 28 2007 although the precise wording of africoms mission statement has evolved since the command was first announced dod officials have broadly suggested that the commands mission is to promote us strategic objectives by working with african partners to help strengthen stability and security in the region through improved security capability and military professionalization3 key aspect of the commands mission is its suppo rting role to other agencies and departments efforts on the continent but like other combatant commands africom will also be expected to oversee military operations when directed to deter aggression and respond to crises the administrations motivation for the creation of new unified command for africa evolved in part out of concerns about dods division of responsibility for africa among three geographic commands which reportedly posed coordination challenges although some military officials 1 the white house office of the press secretary president bush creates department of defense unified combatant command for africa february 6 2007 secretary of defense robert gates announced the commands creation to congress in testimony before the senate armed services co mmittee on the same day formal efforts to establish an africa command or africom began in mid2006 under former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld dod announced that it was considering africom in august 2006 and president bush reportedly approved the proposal on december 15 2006 africa command plans approved by bush dod officials confirm stars and stripes december 30 2006 2 unified combatant command is defined as command with broad continuing mission under single commander and composed of significant assigned components of two or more military departments that is established and so designated by the president through the secretary of defense with the advice and assistance of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff according to dods dictionary of military and associated terms 3 when first announced the draft mission statement was us africa command promotes us national security objectives by working with african states and regional organi zations to help strengthen stability and security in the aor us africa command leads the in theater dod response to support other usg agencies in implementing usg security policies and strategies in concert with other us government agencies and other international partners us africa command conducts theater security cooperation activities to assist in building security capacity and improve accountable governance as directed us africa command conducts military operations to deter aggression and respond to crises its current mission statement approved by general ward and secretary gates is united states africa command in concert with other us government agencies and international partners conducts sustained security engagement through militarytomilitary programs

crises highlighted the challenges created by seams between the cocoms boundaries one such seam was located between sudan then within centcoms aor chad and the central african republic then within eucoms aor an area of increasing instability the united states acting first alone and later as member of the north atla ntic treaty organization na to has provided airlift and training for african peacekeeping troops in the darfur region of sudan and although centcom had responsibility for sudan much of the airlift and training was done by eucom forces in addition close observers say that euco m and centcom had become overstretched particularly given the demands created by the wars in iraq and afghanistan the commander of eucom whose aor included 92 countries prior to africoms creation testified before congress that the increasing strategic significance of africa will continue to pose the greatest security stability challenge in the eucom aor the large ungoverned area in africa hivaids epidemic corruption weak governance and pover ty that exist throughout the continent are challenges that are key factors in the security stability issues that affect every country in africa 4 his predecessor general james jones pointed out in 2006 that eucoms staff were spending more than half their time on africa issues up from almost none three years prior5 africom has faced myriad challenges in its establishment and outstanding issues remain as the command moves forward some of these issues may be addressed by the 111th congress key oversight questions for congress relating to the command may include the following is an africa command necessary or desirable is its mission welldefined how are us strategic interests influencing the size and scope of the us military footprint on the continent and what effect will the new africa command have on future us military operations in africa how are africom and us military efforts in africa perceived by africans and by other foreign countries including china what are the costs associated with africom how are these costs affected by africoms chosen headquarters location what role if any will contractors play in africoms operations how closely do the state department and dod coordinate on plans for the command and on us military efforts in africa in general what are the obama administrations views on the development of africoms interagency process will africoms enhanced integration of nondod usg agency personnel into the command necessitate statutory changes how will africom address the intelligence communitys need to realign its resources directed toward the continent 4 testimony before the senate armed services committee september 19 2006 5 greg mills worlds biggest military comes to town business day

changes to the ucp are usually initiated by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff cjcs who presents recommendation to the secretary of defense after the secretarys review proposal is presented to the president for approval prior to the advent of africom the most recent unified command to be established was northcom which was created in 2002 after the september 11 terrorist attacks to protect the us homeland the ucp is reviewed at least every two years as required by the goldwaternichols dod reorganization act of 1986 pl 99433 the 2006 review recommended the establishment of an africa command and the 2008 review released in december 2008 codified the command new functional command medical command is reportedly also being considered congress has on occasion taken legislative action that has led to changes in the ucp g5g152g150g139g138g157g138g151g157g561g5g152g150g150g138g151g141g561g515g18g149g158g156g516g501g561 some dod officials have referred to africa command as combatant command plus8 this implies that the command will have all the roles and responsibilities of traditional geographic combatant command including the ability to facilitate or lead military operations but will also include broader soft power mandate aimed at building stable security environment and will incorporate larger civilian component from ot her us government agencies to address those challenges according to the 2002 us national security strategy america is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones the department of defense identifying instability in foreign countries as threat to us interests issued dod directive 300005 in 2005 defining stability operations 9 as core us military mission that shall be given priority comparable to combat operations10 the 2008 national defense strategy further argues that the inability of many states to police themselves effectively or to work with their neighbors to ensure regional security represents challenge to the international system and that if left unchecked such instability can spread and threaten regions of interest to the united states our allies and friends although us forces have traditionall focused on fighting and winning wars defense strategy is now evolving to look at conflict pr evention or phase zero addressing threats at their inception through increased emphasis on theater security

if us agencies both military and civilian are able to coordinate more efficiently and effectively both among themselves as well as with their african partners and other international actors they might be more successful at averting more complex emergencies on the continent africoms commander general kip ward views the department of defenses role in africa as part of threepronged us government approach with dod through africom taking the lead on security issues but playing supporting role to the department of state which conducts diplomacy and usaid which implements development programs ward does see africom playing greater role in development activities than other commands but has emphasized that its role will remain one of supporting usaids development and humanitarian objectives africoms proactive approach to deterring or averting conflict reflects an evolution in dod strategy that has been outlined extensively in government documents but operationalizing that broad mandate may prove difficult 13 as one foreign policy expert points out the mission of africom will necessarily require major break with conventional doctrinal mentalities both within the armed services themselves and between government agencies14 one dod official described the mandate in the following words we want to help develop stable environment in which civil society can be built and that the quality of life for the citizenry can be improved15 the prospect that the department of defense will focus less on fighting wars and more on preventing them engenders mixed feelings elsewhere in the government while many at the state department and the united states agency for international development usaid welcome the ability of dod to leverage resources and to organize complex operations there also is concern that the military may overestimate its capabilities as well as its diplomatic role in africa or pursue activities that are not core part of its mandate some argue that the highly unequal allocation of resources between the departments of defense state and usaid hinder their ability to act as equal partners and could lead to the militarization of development and diplomacy 16 the mission of africa command might be most clos ely compared to that of southern command southcom which is responsible for us military efforts in central and south america southcoms mission as defined by dod is to ensure the forward defense of the united states through security cooperation counternarcotics operations humanitarian assistance and monitoring and support for human rights initiatives in the region like southcom africom is expected to supervise an array of operations that relate to us strategic interests but are not combatrelated unlike eucom centcom and pa com which have traditionally been more focused on preparing for potential warfighting operations one dod official suggested that the us government could consider the command success if it keeps american troops

been traditional with other combatant commands those involved in the creation of africom aimed to build upon initiatives in northcom and southcom to im prove the interagency process but eucom commander general bantz craddock has suggested that this command could be the pioneer for new approach that the other commands might later adopt in the development of africoms theater campaign plan for example the leadership has sought to involve other us government agencies at the earliest stages of the planning process an effort that dod hopes to employ more broadly as its new planning approach 21 nondod civilian staff positions within africom include senior leadership positions senior advisors or liaisons including the foreign policy advisor senior development advisor an ofda liaison and senior treasury department representative and subjectmatter experts embedded with the headquarters staff during his confirmation hearing general ward testified that he did not believe any statutory changes were necessary to incorporate detailed nondod personnel into the command 22 nevertheless africom officials report that filling those interagency positions has been more challenging than first anticipated although lawyers from several of the departmentsagencies have worked to facilitate the assignment of nondod civilians to africom to date few have been permanently assigned following general wards confirmation senior us diplomat ambassador mary carlin yates was appointed as deputy to the commander for civilmilitary activities dcma new post equivalent to that of deputy commander yates who had previously served as us ambassador to burundi and ghana and most recently as the foreign policy advisor to eucom is the first nondod civilian to be integrated into the command structure of unified command the dcma directs many of africoms civilmilitary plans and programs as well as its various security cooperation initiatives and is responsible for ensuring that policy development and implementation are consistent with us foreign policy navy vice admiral robert moeller who led africoms transition team serves as yates military equivalent deputy to the commander for military operations dcmo the dcmo is responsible for the implementation and execution of the commands programs and operations to maintain the military chain of command one deputy commander position

is still under development some details regarding the commands structure and footprint are still being determined as mentioned above africoms final headquarters location has not been identified and move to the continent may not occur for several years if at all africom also has yet to determine the locations for sub regional offices that it originally sought to establish and there has reportedly

formerly under centcom has been transferred to africom and it will continue to be used as forward operating site 26 the us military has access to number of foreign air bases and ports in africa and

over where to base africom prior to africoms establishment eucom was the only geographic combatant comma nd with headquarters located outside of the united states given that the majority of countries in africoms new aor have been under the responsibility of eucom and that consequently majority of the personnel working on africa issues were already based in eucoms headquarters in stuttgart germany dod determined that africoms headquarters would be initially located at the american base in germany as well27 in november 2008 the secretary of defense announced that the decision on whether to move the command out of germany would be postponed until 2012 to allow the command to gain greater understanding of its longterm operational requirements prior to secretary gates announcement of the commands establishment there was speculation that an africa command might be permanently located in europe or in the united states like the other commands some dod officials have argued that africoms headquarters should be located in africa locating the headquarters within the aor would have several benefits in terms of proximity flight time from germany to nair obi kenya for example is approximately 8 hours and flight time from germany to johannesburg south africa is approximately 11 hours flight time from washington dc to the african union au headquarters in addis ababa ethiopia is

advocated locating africa comm and on the continent have faced some initial negative reactions from africans there are concerns both domestically and internationally that moving the command to africa might be the first step in an alleged us military agenda to establish larger footprint on the continent dod officials have stressed that the location in question would be staff headquarters rather than troop headquarters and have suggested that they may consider dispersed regional headquarters model with several small locations spread across the continent to lessen the us presence and burden in any one country 28 dod may eventually try to colocate those facilities with the headquarters of the continents regional and subregional organizations to link africom with the aus nascent regional security architecture see security assistance below africom already has military liaison officers lnos at the african union headquarters in ethiopia and with ecowas in nigeria as well as at the kofi

sought funding for limited presence on the african continent with the establishment of two of five regional offices although plans for those two offices have been postponed and funding for the offices was cut for the upcoming fiscal year29 the department of defense has developed criteria for determining the ultimate locations for africom in coordination with the department of state through regular consultations with african countries that have security relationship with the united states us officials have reportedly already received offers to host the command from several of these governments including most publicly liberia other strategic pa rtners such as south africa and algeria have expressed reluctance to host the new command possibly out of concern over permanent foreign military presence within their borders in north africa for example there are concerns that an american military presence might embolden domestic terrorist groups some african governments that consider themselves to be regional hegemons may perceive permanent american military presence whether staffed by civilians or troops to be rival for political or military power in their sphere of influence at the forefront of dod considerations in dete rmining host country or countries would be providing for the safety and security of over thousand american personnel who staff the command and their families should decision to move to the continent be made living standards in africa are among the lowest in the world and dod would be expected to choose politically stable location on the continent with good access to health care and schools and relatively low levels of corruption ease of access to regional and international transportation along with proximity to the african union african regional organizations and us government hubs on the continent would also be considered locating us soldiers permanently in foreign country would be predicated on the host countrys approval of

have not historically been identified as strategic priorities for the us military and us military engagement in africa has been sporadic 37 according to one defense analyst during the cold war united states foreign policy toward subsaharan africa had little to do with africa38 after the fall of the soviet union many us policymakers considered the us militarys role and responsibilities on the continent to be minimal in 1995 the department of defense outlined its view of africa in its us security strategy for sub saharan africa asserting that ultimately we see very little traditional strategic interest in africa 39 in 1998 following terrorist attacks on two us embassies in east africa the united states conducted retaliatory attack against pharmaceutical factory in khartoum sudan that clinton administration officials initially cont ended was producing precursors for chemical weapons for qaeda the embassy bombings and the retaliatory strike against sudan are considered by many analysts to be turning point in us strategic policy toward the region africa and the unified command plan africa was not include d in t he us mil itary command struct ure til 1952 w hen veral nort h

susceptible to illegal fishing illegal trafficking and piracy in recent years50 the inability of african governments to adequately police the regions waters has allowed criminal elements to smuggle

political conflict and instability in parts of africa have caused human suffering on massive scale and undermined economic social and political development54 although the number of conflicts in africa has decreased in recent years the continent is home to majority of the united nations peace operations with seven missions currently underway55 four african countries ghana ethiopia nigeria and south africa have cons istently ranked in the top 10 troop contributing countries to peacekeeping operations in rece nt years african militaries also contribute troops to peace operations conducted by the af rican union and regional organizations like ecowas despite willingness to participate in these operations many african militaries lack the command and control training equipment and logistics capability to effectively participate in such efforts instability in africa has demanded substantial humanitarian and defense resources from the international community and the united states and other

large part by counterterrorism efforts which the bush administration identified as top national security priority57 terrorist attacks on the us embassies in dar salaam tanzania and nairobi kenya in 1998 on targets in mombasa kenya in 2002 and more recently in algeria mauritania and morocco have highlighted the threat of terrorism in the region dod officials have emphasized the need to work with african governments to counteract the threat claiming africa has been is now and will be into the foreseeable future ripe for terrorists and acts of terrorism 58 of primary concern to policy makers is the possible challenge posed by ungoverned spaces defined as physical or nonphysical areas where there is an absence of state capacity or political will to exercise control59 the bush administration linked these areas indirectly to terrorist threats asserting regional conflicts can arise from wide variety of causes including poor governance external aggression competing claims internal revolt

africa has been largely positive although concerns have been raised89 in africa on the other hand perceptions of the new command are more mixed there is considerable apprehension over us motivations for creating africom and some africans worry that the move represents neocolonial effort to dominate the region militarily us military efforts on the continent have been seen as episodic leading some to question more sustained focus from dod now reports of us air strikes in somalia and us support for ethiopias military intervention there have added to those concerns many view us counterterrorism efforts in africa with skepticism and there appears to be widespread belief that the new commands primary goals will be to hunt terrorists and to secure us access to african oil 90 us foreign policy analysts have focused increased attention on chinas role in africa in recent years and such attention has led some to question whether an africa command might be part of new contest for influence on the continent91 among several african governments and militaries on the other hand africom has been received with cautious optimism92 they view increased american attention to the continents problems as positive move potentially bringing increased resources training and assistance us foreign military assistance has increased in recent years and military training programs in africa have steadily been on the rise dod and state department officials continue to consult with african nations to discuss their plans for the command those involved in the consultations have stressed that the goal of the visits has been to solicit african views and explain the rationale behind africoms creation rather than to find suitable location for its headquarters in april 2007 senior officials visited nigeria south africa kenya ethiopia ghana and senegal following their visit one dod official noted that despite some initial misconceptions they had not encountered any specific resistance to the idea 93 in june 2007 they visited algeria morocco libya egypt and djibouti and held discussions with african union officials the delegation also held meetings with 40 foreign defense attachés serving in

african regional security organizations and over 35 african governments in virginia to further explain its plans for the command and to solicit input from attendees similar event was held in april 2008 analysts suggest us officials should continue to closely consult with these governments to ensure that africom reflects mutual exchange of interests and is seen to foster closer alliance rather than serving as an avenue for the us to dictate policy to african governments africoms commander has acknowledged the need for his staff to continue their public relations campaign to allay concerns95 in october 2007 members of the panafrican parliament the legislative body of the african union voted in favor of motion to prevail upon all african governments through the african union au not to accede to the united states of americas governments request to host africom anywhere in the african continent96 west african military chiefs following november 2007 conference in liberia issued cautious response to us government plans saying that africom had not been fully understood by african countries and requesting further sensitization by the united states authorities at the highest political level ecowass commissioner for political affairs peace and security did suggest that everybody welcomes and supports the idea but we want that direction to come from the heads of state97 several african heads of state have issued preliminary statements about their views on the command some have advised dod to consider how africom could complement the aus regional security structure president umaru yaradua during his december 2007 visit to washington dc commented we shall partner wi th africom to assist not only nigeria but also the african continent to actualize its peace and security initiative which is an initiative to help standby forces of brigadesize in each of the regional economic groupings within the african continent 98 yaraduas statements were criticized by several nigerian opposition parties and civil society organizations in response nige rias minister of foreign affairs remarked nigerias position on africom remains that african governments have the sovereign responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security on the continent president yaraduas statement on the proposed africo m is consistent with nigerias wellknown position on the necessity for africa to avail itself of opportunities for enhanced capacity for the promotion of peace and security in africa99 during president bushs second official visit to africa in february 2008 ghanas president john kufour announced i am happy one for the president dispelling any notion that the united states of america is intending to build military bases on the continent of africa i believe the explanation the president has given should put fade to the speculation so that the relationship between us and the united states will grow stronger and with mutual respect 100 liberias

africom faces myriad challenges both in its establishment and its operation some of these challenges may be issues for congress several members of congress expressed interest in the creation of an africa command prior to the bush administration decision in 2006 senator russ feingold introduced samdt 4527 to the fy2007 national defense authorization bill s 2766 requiring feasibility study for the establishment of new command for africa s 2766 passed the senate in june 2006 in december 2007 representative ileana roslehtinen introduced hres 897 recognizing the strategic importance of the african continent and welcoming the establishment of africom senator james inhofe introduced similar legislation sres 480 in march 2008 these resolutions also urge the departments of defense and state as well as usaid to consult with african partners to address concerns regarding the commands mandate the africa subcommittees of the senate foreign relations committee and the house committee on foreign affairs both held hearings on africom in august 2007 following general wards confirmation as commander the house armed services committee held hearing to discuss the command in november 2007 congress has addressed issues associated with the commands development in report language accompanying several recent authorization and appropriations bills the senate armed services committee expressed its support for africom in srept 11077 which accompanied s 1547 the national defense authorization act 2008 the report did however raise questions regarding authorities needed to stand up and staff the command authorities and funding mechanisms for interagency staff location planned staffing levels and anticipated costs the committee repeated its support in srept 110335 which accompanied s 3001 the national defense authorization act 2009 but expressed concern that other us government agencies may not have the resources to support the commands whole of government approach the house armed services committee raised questions regarding africoms mission in hrept 110652 which accompanied hr 5658 the duncan hunter national defense authorization act 2009 the senate appropriations committee also noted its concern regarding unanswered questions surrounding the commands mission in srept 11085 accompanying hr 2642 the military construction and veterans affairs and related agencies appropriations act 2008 and in the conference report 110477 to hr 1585 the national defense authorization act 2008 such concerns were repeated in srept 110428 which accompanied s 3301 the military construction and veterans affairs and related agencies appropriations act 2009 hrept 110 775 accompanying the house version of that legislation hr 6599 raised specific concern with unanswered questions related to the permanent location of africoms headquarters reference to africom in the joint explanatory statement accompanying hr 2638 the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 pl 110339 has been discussed above see cost africoms mandate also was considered by the 110 th congress within the broader context of dods role in us foreign affairs africom was the focus of series of hearings by the house committee on oversight and government reforms subcommittee on national security and foreign affairs the command was discussed by the senate foreign relations committee in several hearings including one entitled implementing smart power setting an agenda for national security reform in april 2008 and another in july 2008 entitled defining the militarys role toward foreign policy during an april 2008 hearing on building partnership capacity the secretaries of state and defense both addressed africoms unique interagency

entitled foreign assistance reform rebuilding us civilian development and diplomatic capacity in the 21st century the house armed services committee has commissioned panel on roles and missions of not only the various military branches but also of the various civilian agencies involved in protecting american security among its initial findings was the notion that shortcomings in the interagency process have led the us military to take on missions that are not part of its core responsibilities the fy2008 national defense authorization act requires the military to examine its core competencies which may have implications for africom some observers have cautioned that africom could develop independent institutional imperatives that demand resources regardless of need rather than reflecting genuine strategic interests given that large part of africoms mandate will be to build the indigenous capacity of african defense forces the ease with which the command can conduct security cooperation programs will be key to its ccess dod officials suggest that inefficiencies exist in the authorities through which funding is provided for the militarys tsc activities 101 military officials have argued that the applicable laws need simplification to allow the combatant commands greater flexibility to respond to emerging threats and opportunities some have raised concerns though that modifying the administrative authorities could interfere with the department of states diplomatic decisions or bilateral relationships the us military faces other policy restrictions including article 98 restrictions in its operations with some african governments and militaries 102 at the same time dod is also concerned about possible gaps in servicemen protections for us troops operating on the continent see headquarters location above the government accountability office has noted in testimony to congress that uncertainties related to africoms presence hinder dods ability to estimate future funding requirements for africom and raises questions about whether dods concept of developing enduring relationships on the continent can be achieved the establishment of new unified command requires both financial and human resources although some of those are being redirected from the existing commands military resources have been stretched by major theater operations in iraq and afghanistan making troop readiness and costs associated with standing up new command critical issue for congress 103 staffing the command at the interagency level may also require additional resources from congresssome officials at the state department and usaid ve expressed concern about their departments inability to provide the number of civilian staff requested by the command and that concern that 101 authorities provided to dod under title 10 usc cannot be generally used for training or equipment programs whereas title 22 funds which are controlled by the stat department but which in clude some dodimplemented programs like fmf and imet cannot be used to fund milita ry operations in the fy2006 defense authorization act pl 109163 congress gave dod expanded funding and authorities under title 10 usc section 1206 and 1207 to address lengthy administrative and procurement delays section 1206 authorities allow dod to directly fund some security cooperation activities in fy2006 dod obligated 13 m illion in section 1206 funding to african countries in fy2007 over 47 million was obligated for african recipients and in fy2008 approximately 62 million was obligated at the request of senator richard lugar the gao compiled report section 1206 security assistance programfindings on criteria coordination and implementation in february 2007 102 in his testimony before the senate armed services committee on may 17 2007the eucom commander expressed concern that article 98 restrictions could affect longterm usafrican security relationships and hinder the logistical capability of countries that do not sign article 98 agreements to participate in regional p eacekeeping efforts 103 congress has in the past prohibited funding fo r combatant commands for example under the fy1982 dod authorization act pl 97252 congress prohibited the use of funds for the integration of the armys military traffic management command and the navys military sealift command into new unified transportation command at the request of the army and navy chiefs of staff

funding for fy2009 to increase the number of diplomatic and development personnel at state and usaid to allow the agencies to focus greater effort on meeting national security goals the secretary of defense has also advocated on behalf of the civilian agencies emphasizing that the state department is critically understaffed105 the development of africoms interagency staffing has been of particular interest to congress in the house report to accompany hr 2082 the intelligence authorization act of fy2008 the permanent select committee on intelligence expressed concern with interagency coordination on africa calling it flawed and suggesting that the intelligence community needed to realign its resources to better understand the threats emanating from this region dod officials point out that there are legally binding requirements for agencies to coordinate their activities which could make africoms pioneering interagency process more challenging should other agencies not have the resources to participate adequately 106 because the commands role is to support us foreign policy objectives in africa close coordination with the state department will be critical to the success of africom some have suggested that because the state department organizes its efforts bilaterally while dod organizes regionally that coordination may be challenging and may require some internal bureaucratic changes within the state department107 observers have expressed concern that us military efforts on the continent must not be allowed to overshadow us diplomatic objectives 2006 senate foreign affairs committee report found that as result of inadequate funding for civ ilian programs us defense agencies are increasingly being granted authority and funding to fill perceived gaps such bleeding of civilian responsibilities overseas from civilian to military agencies risks weakening the secretary of states primacy in setting the agenda for us relations with foreign countries and the secretary of defenses focus on war fighting 108 senator feingold in speech before the senate expressed his support for the africa command but cautioned that it must contribute to not fine the us governments overall strategy and objectives for the continent109 likewise senator richard lugar has suggested that africom could help the us military develop more sophisticated understanding of region that is everchanging and highly complex but has also cautioned with greater expertise created within new regional command the hope is that there would be few disagreements between the two 104 eucom commander bantz craddock told defense writers group forum on may 18 2007 it will be difficult to get subscription and participation by the interagency other concerns have been expressed to the author in interviews with administration officials 105 see for example the sp eech delivered by secretary gates to the us global leadership campaign in washington dc on july 15 2008 106 some of the challenges in coordinating more effec tive interagency process were outlined by john hamre president of the center for strategic and international studies csis in hearing organizing department of

maintained wheelus air base near tripoli libya from the 1940s until 1971 with an estimated 4000 american personnel111 wheelus served primarily as bomber base for missions to europe and as an air force training location although us forces from the base did provide emergency humanitarian assistance to earthquake and flood victims in libya and tunisia in the 1960s africa was not included in the us military command structure until 1952 when several north african countries including libya were added to the responsibilities of us european command because of their historic relationship with europe the rest of the continent remained outside the responsibility of any command until 1960 when cold war concerns over soviet influence in newly independent african countries led dod to include subsaharan africa in the atlantic command lantcom leaving north af rica in eucom the unified command plan was revised again in 1962 by president john f kennedy and responsibility for subsaharan africa was transferred to newlycreated strike command stricom which was responsible for operations in the middle east subsaharan africa and south asia and located at mcdill air force base in tampa florida stricom was redesignated as readiness command redcom in 1971 and its responsibility for africa was dissolved leaving subsaharan africa out of the combatant command structure until 1983 under the reagan administration us military involvement in africa was largely dominated by cold war priorities and the administrations containment policy led dod to divide responsibility for africa into its current configuration in the 1980s the us military was involved in repeated skirmishes with libyan jets in territorial disputes over the gulf of sidra and those engagements later escalated as libya was implicated for supporting international terrorism on april 15 1986 the united states initiated air strikes against multiple military targets in libya under the code name operation dorado canyon to inflict damage to qadhafis capability to direct and control the export of international terrorism several civilian targets including the french embassy in tripoli were also inadvertently hit 112 after the end of the cold war us policy toward africa was driven by president george h w bushs vision of new world order113 and later by president william j clintons policy of assertive multilateralism114 us military involvement in africa was dominated by the deployment of us forces to somalia to secure humanitarian operations first in 1992 under the usled unified task force unitaf also known as operation restore hope and later under the united nations operation in somalia unosom ii115 us military efforts in somalia were 111 other former us military installations in north africa included
