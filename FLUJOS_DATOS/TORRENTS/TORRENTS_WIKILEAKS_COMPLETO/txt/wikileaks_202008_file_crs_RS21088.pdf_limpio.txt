treaty on september 3 1972 and the treaty entered into force on oc tober 3 1972 in 1974 the parties agreed to an amendatory protocol reducing the numbe r of deployments of abm systems from two to one2 as amended the treaty bound each party not to deploy abm systems for fense of the territory of its country or for defense of an individua l region except as provided in article iii article i not to develop test or deploy abm systems or components which are seabased airbased spacebased or mobile landbased article vhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21088crs2 3 article iii as amended allowed each party to deploy one such system ar ound either its capital or an icbm complex the ussr chose to ploy its system around moscow while the us chose to defend an abm complex in north dakota but the us dismantled its system within few months of its deployment 4 see eg the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons 21 ust 483 1970 article x the convention on the prohibition of th development production

it bar the testing development and deployment of nonabm missiles launche rs and radars useful in defens against aircraft or against shortrange battlefield or theater ballistic missiles but it did bar the parties from giving such nonabm components and systems the capabilities to counter strategic ballistic missiles or their elements in flight trajectory and it did bar the testing of such components and systems in an abm mode these were the provisions that imposed the most serious constraints on the adminis trations proposed miss ile defense program treaty provisions regarding withdrawal article xv of the abm treaty stated that this treaty shall be of unlimited duration but it also provided for withdraw upon six months noti ce to the other party under certain extraordinary circumstances as follows each party shall in exercising its nationa l sovereignty have the right to withdraw from this treaty if it decides that extraordinary events re lated to the subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized its supreme intere sts it shall give notice of its decision to the other party six months prior to wit hdrawal from the treaty such notice shall include statement of the extraordinary ev ents the notifying party regards as having jeopardized its supreme interests such withdrawal upon notice provisions are common in treaties both multilateral and bilateral except in modern arms control treaties however it is not common for withdrawal to be conditioned upon extraordin ary events that have jeopardized supreme interests in arms control agreements that language appears to be fairly

confe rred by article xv and announced the intention of the us to w ithdraw from the abm treaty in diplomatic notes sent to russia belarus kazakhsta n and the ukraine the state department described the reasons for withdrawal as follows since the treaty entered into force in 1972 number of state and nonstate entities have acquired or are actively seeking to ac quire weapons of mass destruction it is clear and has recently been demonstrated th at some of these entities are prepared to employ these weapons against the united st ates moreover number of states are developing ballistic missiles including longrange ballistic missiles as means of delivering weapons of mass destruction th events pose direct threat to the territory and security of the united states and jeopardize its supreme interests as result the united states has concluded th at it must develop test and deploy anti ballistic missile systems for the defense of its national territory of its forces outside the united states and of its friends and allies pursuant to article xv paragraph 2 the ited states has decided that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of the treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests therefore in the exercise of the right to withdraw from the treaty provided in article xv paragraph 2 the united stat hereby gives notice of its withdrawal from the treaty in accordance with th terms of the treaty withdrawal will be effective six months from the date of this notice5 constitutionality of withdrawal by president bush 1 general although the constitution is explicit regarding how the nation enters into treaties it is silent with respect to th termination of or withdrawal from treaties as consequence debate arises from time to time regarding whether the president can unilaterally exercise the right of withdrawal w ithout the participation of the senate or the congress the restatement of the foreign relations law of the united states third6 concludes that the power to terminate or suspend treaty belongs to the president nonetheless it has so metimes been contended that b ecause the senate is joint participant in the making of treaty it also ought to be involved in the termination of the treaty it has also been contended that congress as whole ought to play role at times given congress constitutional authority to declare war it is said that is particularly the case with respect to terminations that create risk of war historically withdrawal from treaty has occurred most commonly as presidential initiative but both the senate

the presidents action after the fact7 2 goldwater v carter prior to the present circumstance this debate erupted when president carter terminated the mutual defense treaty with the republic of china taiwan in 197879 on december 15 1978 president carter announced that on january 1 1979 the united states would offi cially recognize the peoples republic of china prc as the sole government of china that simultaneously the us would withdraw recognition from the republic of china on taiwan roc as the legitimate government of china and that the us w ould give notice of its intention to withdraw from its mutual defense treaty with the roc in accordance with the terms of the treaty the treaty provided that withdrawal could occur one year after notice was given thus making the effective date of us withdrawal january 1 1980 the presidents action precipitated the introduction in the senate of severa l resolutions on the matter8 hearings by the senate foreign relations committee on the constitutional parameters governing the termination of treaties9 favorable committee report of resolution that detailed fourteen circumstances in which unilateral termination by the president is constitutionally permissible10 and the approval by vote of 5935 on the senate floor of substitute stating that the senate had to be involved in the terminati on of mutual defense treaties11 it also precipitated suit by senator goldwa ter rar and num ber of other senators and congressmen in federal district court claiming that the president has unilateral power under the constituti on to abrogate treaties and that termination of the mutual defense treaty required the approval of the senate or the congress the suit led to conflicting decisions by the trial and appellate courts and an eventual nondecision by the supreme court12 on october 17 1979 the trial court agreed with the plaintiffs contentions it held that the case did not presen t nonjusticiable political question that the plaintiff members of c ongress had standing nd that congressional participation was necessary to terminate the mutual defense treaty the court rejected arguments that the president can unilaterally terminate treaties on the basis of his constitutional power over foreign affairs and his power to recognize and withdrawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21088crs5 recognition from foreign governments instead it held that the mutual defense treaty was part of the law of the land that the presidents constitutional authority to take care that the laws be faithfully executed does not include the power to unilaterally repeal such law and that the doctrine of separation of powers and its corollary concept of checks and balances counsel against vesting such power exclusively in the president treaty termination is shared power whic h cannot be exercised by the president acting alone any decision of the united states to terminate the mutual defense treaty must be made with the advice and consent of the senate or the approval of both houses of congress the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia promptly reversed in an banc decision on december 5 1979 the appe llate court agreed with the trial court that the plaintiffs had standing and that the issue was justiciable but it reversed on the merits the majority rejected the arguments that the advice and consent role of the senate in the making of treaties necessarily implies similar role in their termination and that because treaty is part of the law of th land it requires at least statute to terminate it it emphasized instead the presidents broad constitutional authority with respect to foreign affairs and said that authority in cludes number of accepted functions regarding treaties which have the effect of either terminating or continuing their vitality the president the court said is responsible for determining whether treaty has been breached by another party whether treaty is longer viable because of changed circumstances and even whether to ratify treaty after the senate has given its advice and consent in contrast to the lawmaking power the court said the constitutional initiative in the treatymaking field is in the president not congress to require senate or congressional consent to the termination of treaty the appellate court stated would lock the us into all of its international ob ligations even if the president and twothirds of the senate minus one firmly believed that the proper cour for the united states was to terminate treaty and would deny the president the authority and flexibility necessary to conduct our foreign policy in rational and effective manner finally and of central significance the court asserted was the fact that the mutual defense treaty with the roc contained termination clause that clause it said is without conditions and spelled out role for either the senate or the congress as whole consequently it stated the power to act unde r that clause devolves upon the president on december 13 1979 the supreme court v acated the appellate courts decision and remanded the case with directions to dismiss the complaint but it did so for variety of reasons none of which garnered majority four of the justices chief justice burger and justices rehnquist stewart and stev ens contended that the case should be dismissed because it presented nonjustic iable political question justice powell disagreed and said that the political question doctrine posed constitutional barrier to judicial review of properly presented case but he concurred that the case should be dismissed he stated that the case was not ripe for judicial review because constitutional impasse d not been reached ie neither the house nor the senate had taken any action formally rejecting the presidents initiative justice marshall concurred in the result without opinion justices black mun and white said that because of the difficult procedural and substantive issues rais ed by the case it should be set for briefing and oral argument only justice brennan addr essed the merits of the case stating that he would affirm the judgment of the appellate court on the gr ounds that

was an aspect of the the presidents wellestablished authority to recognize and withdraw recogn ition from foreign governments the constitutional question raised here is prudently answered in narrow terms abrogation of the defense treaty with taiw an was necessary incident to executive recognition of the peking government b ecause the defense treaty was predicated upon the nowabandoned view that the taiwan government was the only legitimate political authority in china our cases fi rmly establish that the constitution commits to the president alone the power to recogn ize and withdraw r ecognition from foreign regimes citations omitted that mandate being clear our judicial inquiry into the treaty rupture can go further13 3 kucinich v bush on december 30 2002 federa l district court dismissed suit brought by 32 members of the h ouse of representatives challenging the constitutionality of president bushs withdrawal from the abm treaty and raising the same arguments that had been made in the goldwater case14 the court dismissed the suit on the grounds that the plainti ffs lacked standing under the standards set by the supreme court in raines v byrd15 and that the treaty terminati on issue is nonjusticiable political question on the standing question the court found that the injury alleged namely the divestiture of the senate nd congress from any involvement in the decision to withdraw was to the institution of congress and not to the individual members who brought the suit the court further noted that the plaintiffs had numerous political remedies available to them that neither the house nor the congress as whole had taken any action to register their disapproval of the presidents acti on or claim role in the termination of the treaty and that neither the house nor the congress had authorized the plaintiffs to institute suit on their behalf on the political question issue the court followed the pluralitys reasoning in goldwater it noted that the constitution is silent regarding the procedure to be followed in terminating treaty that constitutional authority over foreign affairs is largely relegated to the executive and legislative branches and not the judiciary that the termination of the abm treaty has already been accomplished and that judicial ruling is particularly inappropriate where congress itself has not even asserted that it has been deprived of constitutional right conclusion in sum then the abm treaty has been rminated by president bush in accordance with the terms of the treaty and neither congress nor the courts have acted to forestall or overturn that action moreover both goldwater and kucinich have raised substantial barriers to the prospect that individual mbers of congress can obtain judicial relief when they object to particular treaty termina tion by the president each of the courts in goldwater noted that the us has terminated treaties by variety of means over the course of american history and this history suggests that there may be variety of ways of terminating treatie s that are constitutionally acceptable nonetheless it remains the case that there has not been final judicial determination of the constitutional parameters governing the termination of treaties
