world economic slowdown might severely impact tajikistan the world bank warned that while tajikistan might benefit from lowered import costs for food and energy the country could suffer from lowered profits from cotton and other commodity exports from possibly sharply lowered remittances from migrant workers and lowered foreign aid and investment the world bank advised the tajik government to focus on essential health education and social protection services to people to ensure that temporary shock does not result in permanent loss of human capital and social welfare of poorer households while deferring lower priority expenditures it also advised regulatory and rule of law reforms to encourage entrepreneurial activity and diversification and modernization of the inefficient agricultural sector 1 russian ultranationalist website in october 2008 alleged that the islamic movement of uzbekistan and other terrorist groups were in filtrating turkmenistan with the goal of

development transport and communications border controls democracy and the creation of civil societies in the south caucasus and central asia us policymakers and others hold various views on the appropriate types and levels of us involvement in the region some have argued that ties with energy behemoth kazakhstan are crucial to us interests5 at least until recently others have argued that uzbekistan is the linchpin of the region it is the most populous regional state and is centrally located shaping the range and scope of regional cooperation and should receive the most us attention in general us aid and investment have been viewed as strengthening the independence of the central asian states and forestalling russian chinese iranian or other efforts to subvert them advocates of such ties have argued that political turmoil and the growth of terrorist enclaves in central asia could produce spillover effects both in nearby states including us allies and friends such as turkey and worldwide they also have argued that the united states has major interest in preventing terrorist regimes or groups from illicitly acquiring sovietera technology for making weapons of mass destruction wmd they have maintained that us interests do not perfectly coincide with those of its allies and friends that turkey and other actors possess limited aid resources and that the united states is in the strongest position as the sole superpower to influence democratization and respect for human rights they have stressed that such us influence will help alleviate social tensions exploited by islamic extremist groups to gain adherents they also have argued that for all these reasons the united states should maintain military access to the region even when afghanistan becomes more stable at

national security strategy of the united states which proclaims that central asia is an enduring priority for our foreign policy6 some views of policymakers and academics who previously objected to more forward us policy toward central asia appeared less salient after september 11 2001 but aspects of these views could gain more credence if afghanistan becomes more stable these observers argued that the united states historically had few interests in this region and that developments there remained largely marginal to us interests they discounted fears that antiwestern islamic extremism would make enough headway to threaten secular regimes or otherwise harm us interests at least until the coup in kyrgyzstan in march 2005 see below democratization and human rights these observers argued that the united states should not try to foster democratization among cultures they claimed are historically attuned to authoritarianism some observers reject arguments that us interests in antiterrorism nonproliferation regional cooperation and trade outweigh concerns over democratization and human rights and urge reducing or cutting off most aid to repressive states few observers point to instability in the region as reason to eschew deeper us involvement such as military access that might needlessly place more us personnel and citizens in danger appearing to indicate more negative assessment of developmental prospects in central asia the deputy director of national intelligence thomas fingar testified to congress in july 2007 that there is guarantee that elite and societal turmoil across central asia would stay within the confines of existing autocratic systems in the worst but not implausible case central authority in one or more of these states could be challenged leading to potential for increased terrorist and criminal activities 7 however in february 2008 the director of national intelligence j michael mcconnell seemed to deemphasize these threats stating that central asia remains fertile ground for radical islamic sentiment and movements due to socioeconomic and other factors but appearing to evaluate the regional governments as presently stable 8

2001 the administration has stated that us policy toward central asia focuses on the promotion of security domestic reforms and energy development according to th endeputy assistant secretary of state b lynn pascoe in testimony in june 2002 the september 11 attacks led the administration to realize that it was critical to the national interests of the united states that we greatly enhance our

radical antidemocratic regimes and terrorist groups from gaining influence all the central asian leaders publicly embrace islam but display hostility toward islamic fundamentalism at the same time they have established some trade and aid ties with iran although they have had greater success in attracting development aid from the west than from the east some observers argue that in the longer run their foreign policies may not be antiwestern but may more closely reflect some concerns of other islamic states some western organizational ties with the region have suffered in recent years in

authoritarian tendencies in russia during the presidency of vladimir putin 20002008 the bush administration has emphasized that russias counterterrorism efforts in the region broadly support us interests at the same time the united states long has stressed to russia that it should not seek to dominate the region or exclude western and other involvement virtually all us analysts agree that russias actions should be monitored to ensure that the independence of the central asian states is not threatened soon after the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 russia acquiesced to increased us and coalition presence in the region for operations against qaeda and its supporters in afghanistan besides russias own concerns about islamic extremism in afghanistan and central asia it was interested in boosting its economic and other ties to the west and regaining some influence in afghanistan more recently however russia has appeared to step up efforts to counter us influence in central asia by advocating that the states increase economic and strategic ties with russia and limit ch ties with the united states such stance appears paradoxical to some observers since russia and china benefit from antiterrorism operations carried out by us and na to forces in afghanistan during the 1990s russias economic decline and demands by central asia caused it to reduce its security presence trend that vladimir putin appeared determined to reverse during his presidency 20002008 in 1999 russian border guards were largely phased out in kyrgyzstan the last russian military advisors left turkmenistan and uzbekistan withdrew from the collective security treaty cst see below of the commonwealth of independent states cis in part because the treaty members failed to help uzbekistan meet the growing taliban threat in afghanistan according to uzbek president islam karimov however russia has appeared determined to maintain military presence in tajikistan it long retained about 14500 federal border guards in tajikistan most of whom were tajik conscripts and 7800 russian troops of the 201 st motorized rifle division17 russias efforts to formalize basing agreement with tajikistan dragged on for years as tajikistan endeavored to maximize rents and assert its sovereignty in october 2004 the basing agreement was signed formalizing russias largest military presence abroad besides its black sea fleet at the same time tajikistan demanded full control over border policing russia announced in june 2005 that it had handed over the last guardhouse along the afghantajik border to tajik troops reportedly some russian advisory border troops remain tajik president emomali rahmon or rakhmonov and others emphasize that growing drug production and

2000 russia called for the members of the cst to approve the creation of rapid reaction forces to combat terrorism and hinted that such forces might launch preemptive strikes on afghan terrorist bases

security ties with russia the memberstates of the cst agreed in june 2006 that basing agreements by any member with third party had to be approved by all members in effect providing supreme veto power to russia over future basing arrangements pointing to the deterioration of usuzbek ties many observers suggest that the appreciative attitude of central asian states toward the united statesfor their added security accomplished through usled actions in afghanistanhas declined over time reasons may include perceptions that the united states has not provided adequate security or economic assistance also russia and china are pledging security support to the states to get them to forget their pre september 11 2001 dissatisfaction with russian and chinese efforts russia also encourages the leaders to believe that the united states backs democratic revolutions to replace them lastly the security situation in afghanistan has seemingly deteriorated in recent months russias economic interests in central asia are being reasserted as its economy improves and may constitute its most effective lever of influence russia seeks to counter western business and gain substantial influence over energy resources through participation in joint ventures and by insisting that pipelines cross russian territory after an energy cooperation statement was signed at the may 2002 usrussia summit it appeared that russia would accept western role in the caspian region including construction of the bakutbilisiceyhan btc oil pipeline subsequently however russian officials urged the central asian states to rely on russian continued opium production declined slightly in 2008 after setting reco rd in 2007 but that afghanistan remained the source of most of the worlds opiates unodc estimated that about one

the states have made little progress according to the state department41 during nazarbayevs 1994 us visit he and thenpresident clinton signed charter on democratic partnership that recognized kazakhstan s commitments to the rule of law respect for human rights and economic reform during his december 2001 and september 2006 visits nazarbayev repeated these pledges in joint st atements with president bush in march 2002 usuzbek strategic partnership declaration was signed pledging uzbekistan to intensify the democratic transformation and improve freedom of the press during his december 2002 us visit tajikistans president rahmon pledged to expand fundamental freedoms and human rights until recently almost all the leaders in central asia had been in place since before the breakup of the soviet union the exception was the leader of tajikistan who had been ousted in the early 1990s during civil war these leaders long held onto power by orchestrating extensions of their terms holding suspect elections eliminating possible contenders and providing emoluments to supporters and relatives after this long period of leadership stability president akayev of kyrgyzstan was toppled in coup in 2005 see below and president niyazov of turkmenistan died in late 2006 marking the passing of three out of five sovietera regional leaders from the scene possible scenarios of political futures in central asia have ranged from continued rule in most of the states by elite groups that became ensconced during the soviet era to violent transitions to islamic fundamentalist rule relatively peaceful and quick transitions to more or less democratic and westernoriented political systems have been considered less likely by many observers while some observers warn that islamic extremism could increase dramatically in the region others discount the risk that the existing secular governments soon will be overthrown by islamic extremists 42 in the case of the three succession transitions so far tajikistans resulted in shift in the soviet era regionalclan elite configuration and some limited inclusion of the islamic renaissance party perhaps worrisome tajik president rahmon has written spiritual guide reminiscent of the one penned by turkmenistans late authoritarian president and has given orders on how citizens should live and dress kyrgyzstans appears to involve powersharing by sovietera regionalclan elites the kyrgyz government appears recently to be backsliding on democratization in turkmenistan it appears that sovietera elites have retained power following

the constitution that he claimed would increase legislative power and boost democratization he explained that after kazakhstan gained independence the need to build kazakh statehood and market economy from scratch demanded that i assume all the responsibility but today when the process of modernization of the country is irreversible the time has come for new system of checks and balances the legislature approved the changes the next day the changes include increasing the number of deputies in the majilis and senate permitting the president to be active in political party and decreasing the presidents term in office from seven to five years reversing 1998 change from five to seven years one change requires twothirds vote in each legislative chamber to override presidential alterations to approved bills another provision specifies that nine majilis deputies are appointed by the peoples assembly public body mentioned in the constitution for the first time an implementing constitutional act on elections approved in june 2007 provides for electing the other 98 majilis deputies by party lists some critics considered that many of the changes were superficially reformist and perhaps aimed at convincing the osce that kazakhstan was democratizing and should be granted its request to chair the osce in 2009 other observers praised some of the changes as progressive if fully implemented such as the requirement for court order in case of detention or arrest perhaps indicating another reason for the changes legislative initiative excluded nazarbayev from term limits visiting us assistant secretary of state richard boucher met with kazakhstani officials in june 2007 and stated that these constitutional amendments go in the right direction the overall effect over the long term could be to strengthen political parties and the power of parliament there have been concerns about the lifting of term limits on the president but it remains to be seen how that will work out in the longer term its good legal framework it points the way to stable democratic system 43 similar to the events of late 1993 deputies in kazakhstans majilis the lower legislative chamber in june 2007 ostensibly requested that president nursultan nazarbayev cut short their terms and hold early elections he acceded to the request the next day and the election was scheduled for august 18 2007 as per constitutional amendments and election law changes the size of the majilis increased from 77 to 107 members ninetyeight members are elected by party lists and nine by the peoples assembly which is headed by the president at the opening of the headquarters for the main progovernment party nurotan fatherlands ray of light on july 2 nazarbayev appeared to endorse predominant role for nurotan when he allegedly claimed erroneously that since world war ii japan has flourished under the one party rule of the liberal democrats seven parties were registered for the election six of which are progovernment and one of which is an opposition party local legislative elections also took place but these involved voting for individuals rather than party lists nurotan reportedly received 8805 of 887 million votes cast and won all 98 seats the other six parties running were unable to clear 7 threshold needed to win seats in preliminary assessment observers from the osce praised some positive aspects of the vote but judged it as falling short of free and fair race they were critical of irregularities in counting ballots high vote hurdle for parties to win seats the appointment of
