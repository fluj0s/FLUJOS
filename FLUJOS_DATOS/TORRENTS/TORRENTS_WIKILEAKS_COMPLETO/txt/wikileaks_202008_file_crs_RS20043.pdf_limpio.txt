fqpa will be fully realized since contentious implementation issues remain to be resolvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20043congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rs20043 updated november 4 2002 pesticide residue regulation analysis of food quality protection act implementation lindajo schierow specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry division summary the food quality protection act of 1996 f qpa amended the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra g overning us registration sale and use of pesticide products and the federal food drug and cosm etic act ffdca under which the environmental protection agency epa sets allowable pesticide residue levels for food tolerances the fqpa mandates reasonable cer tainty of harm from pesticide exposure and requi res reevaluation of tolerances against this standard by august 2006 the act directs epa to evalua aggregate exposure risks of individual pesticides and cumulative risks of various pesticides with similar toxic effects epa must modify tolerances that are not safe and amend registrations labels for the associated pesticides epa has reported that it is meeting statutory deadlines but this claim is disputed by environmental groups test case for fqpa implementation is evaluation of risks for organophosphate op insecticides used on many fruits vegetables and grains epa already has cancel ed registrations for some op uses epa has issued preliminary and revised cumulative op risk assessment and plans to complete evaluation of op risks in 2003 agricultural and public health groups have challenged the fqpa implementation pace nd process in court this report will be updated as events warrant introduction the 104th congress enacted significant changes to the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra governing regi stration sale and use of pesticide products and the federal food drug and cosme tic act ffdca under which the us environmental protection agency epa sets allowable pesticide residue levels for food and animal feed tolerances the changes were wrought by the food quality protection act of 1996 fqpa public law 104 170 which established new standard of food safety reasonable certainty of harm from any legally permissible pesticide residue on food while recognizing the benef its of pesticide use on food cropshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20043crs2 farmers chemical manufacturers envir onmentalists and othe r stakeholders have carefully observed and sometimes criticized epa implementation of the fqpa this report discusses the status of fqpa imple mentation and potential effects on regulation of pesticides used in f ood production and processing for background and detailed summary of the fqpa see crs report 96759 enr pesticide legislation the food quality protection act of 1996 public law 104170 for descriptions of recent legislative proposals to amend the fqpa see the pesticide section in crs issue brief ib10067 environmental protection issues in the 107th congress food quality protection act mandates key expressed purpose of the fqpa is to coordinate pestic ide registration under fifra with ffdca tolerances to ensure that any pesticide approved for use on food would leave only safe residue the ffdca as amended by the fqpa defines safe to mean that epa has determined there is reasonable certainty that harm will result from aggregate exposure including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliabl information the fqpa directs epa to reevaluate all existing tolerances for fooduse pesticides against this safety standard 33 by august 3 1999 66 by august 3 2002 and 100 by august 3 2006 the fqpa requires epa to consider tolerances for the riskiest pesticides first if epa finds that residues of pesticid used on food may pose risk greater than fqpa allows the act requires change in the ffdca tolerance level as well as in the fifra registration that is pr oduct label to restrict the number or manner of approved pesticide uses and so to reduce human exposur to safe level in assessing the risk of pesticide residues allowe d by tolerance the fqpa requires epa to consider childrens exposure to pesticides and susceptibility to health effects potential disruptive effect s on endocrine systems potential effects of in utero exposure aggregate risk from all sources and th rough all routes of exposure and cumulative risks due to exposure to all pesticides with similar toxic effects ie common mechanism of toxicity fqpa implementation epa has worked with stakeholders to implement the new law pesticide producers and users want assurances that the risks of popular pesticides will be evaluated by epa based on real data rather than worstcase ssumptions public hea lth and environmental groups want prompt action to reduce risks from pesticides progress toward milestones on the date of fqpa enactment there were 9728 residue tolerance levels and exemptions in effect fo r active and inert pesticide ingredients epa divided these into groups ba sed largely on relative risk to public health and published schedule for reeval uation of tolerances in the federal register on august 4 1997 the first group of pesticides subj ect to tolerance reassessment includes organophosphates carbamates and organochlorines probable and some possible human carcinogenshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20043crs3 1 reference dose estimates the daily exposure level that is likely to be safe over lifetime 2 amendments to fifra in 1988 directed epa base d on current safety standards to reregister products first registered prior to 1984 3 on the other hand the numbers released by epa do not include any op that has been reassessed and regulated eg methyl parathion unless its registration was cancelled all of these will be counted as reassessed when the cumulative reassessment is done for all registered ops 4 the consent decree originally was reached w ith the clinton administration and filed on jan 19 2001 the bush administration reviewed the consent decree and ratified it in march 2001 approval was delayed for several months due to legal challenge by pesticide and chemical trade groups separate settlement agreement filed on january 19 2001 requires epa to begin screening pesticides for endocrine disruption potential using validated nonanimal tests when they are available feasible and scientifica lly appropriate the settlement agreement is not legally enforceable but nrdc may reinitiate its litigation if epa fails to comply highhazard inert ingredients pesticides that exceed their reference dose rfd1 pesticides that epa will be considering for reregistration2 and pesticides whose tolerances nd exemptions are being revoked epa reevaluated more than 3000 tolerances before august 3 1999 the earliest statutory deadline thus the agency asserted that it achieved its first milestone for fooduse pesticide regulations on august 3 2002 epa announced that it had completed reassessments for more than 6400 toleran ces meeting the second statutory deadline including nearly twothirds of tolerances for foods commonly eaten by children epa has revoked more than 1900 tolerances however critics contend that epa has not evaluated the riskiest pesticides since many of the reevaluated tolerances posed significant risks to human health many were for residues on crops that did not occur because the crops were not treated with the pesticide or the pesticide was longer used3 environmental consumer and public health advocacy groups accuse epa of dragging its feet in implementing fqpa they believe that the new safety standard mandates reducing the use of many older pe sticides the natural resources defense council nrdc and six californiabased pub lic interest groups alle ged in lawsuits filed august 3 1999 in the us district court fo r the northern distri ct of california that delays caused epa to miss the first fqpa deadline for reassessment of onethird of existing tolerances for higherrisk chemicals by august 3 1999 natural resources defense council v whitman c993701cal the court approved consent decree to conclude litigati on on september 25 20014 the consent decree provides milestones for the review of certain pesticides gr eater opportunities for pub lic involvement and external peer review of cr itical decisions th agreement also requires an annual epa report on its progress in meeting the milestones epa has made progress in implementing the fqpa directive to assess cumulative risks of pesticides with common mechanism of toxicity in january 2002 the agency released final policy interpreting this fqpa requirement preliminary cumulative risk assessment for the organophosphates ops wa s issued in december 2001 and revised assessment was published in june 2002 howeve r the op risk assessment is not yet complete epa plans to release the fina l op cumulative risk assessment during 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20043crs4 5 65 federal register 35925 june 6 2000 6 for the most part arguments surrounding these issues are technical the impact of decisions may be substantial for example epa generate s risk estimates that are intended to protect 999 of the exposed population from pesticide xposure with potentially adverse health effects according to summary of march 1998 meeting of the fifra scientific advisory panel the continuedstakeholder involvement according to epa pesticide regulations directly affect approximately 30 major pesticide producers 100 smaller producers 2500 formulators 29000 distributors and retailers 40000 commercial pest control firms 1 million farms 35 million farm workers seve ral million industry and government users and all households within each of these gr oups distinct subgroups have diverse views of the federal role in pestic ide regulation handful of c ontentious issues has potentially farreaching impacts on the availab ility of pesticides for partic ular uses the cost of food and other consumer products and international competitiv eness of us agricultural products these issues are summarized below epa is seeking to resolve them through cooperative discussions nd negotiations involving the major stakeholders epa has worked with several committees since passage of the law to ensure an open decisionmaking process including the food safety advisory committee fsac the pesticide program dialogue committee the scientific advisory panel fifra mandated advisory body of inde pendent scientists selected by epa and the state fifra research and evaluation group despite these consultative efforts growers and chemical manufacturers expressed concerns about pe rceived lack of opportunities to comment on evolving epa implementation strategies in response epa committed itself to apply sound science employ an open process of decision making and ease any necessary transition to new rules so as not to je opardize agriculture and epa and the us department of agriculture usda jointly established the tolerance reassessment advisory committee trac on april 30 1998 during the first year of its existence the 45 committee members represented envi ronmental and public interest groups pesticide industry and trade ssociations users growers and commodity organizations pediatric and public health organizations federal agencies tribal state and local governments academia and consumer groups however the environmental working group consumer advocacy group resigned from trac in october 1998 claiming that the clinton administration had failed to protect children from pesticide risks the remaining environmental cons umer and public health advocacy groups resigned in april 1999 citing epas slow pace of tolerance reassessment epa formed new advisory group the committee to advise on reassessment and transition carat in june 2000 subcommittee of epas national advisory council for environmental polic and technology its purpose is to provide advice and counsel to the administrator of epa and the secretary of agriculture regarding strategic approaches for pest management planning and tolerance reassessment for pesticides as required by the fqpa5 carat is tackling some of the most difficult implementation decisions about which pesticides will re main available for use on which crops issues trac identified science policy issues affecting implementation of the fqpa with regard to tolerances most of these revolve around how to estimate levels of aggregate pesticide exposure or cumulative risk given exposure6 epa developed policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20043crs5 6 continued panel differed on whether setting criteria at the 999th percentile is conservative approach however if the 999th percentile is utilized percentage of the population eg 23000 children would still be exposed to acute effects some xperts argue that data are too sparse to calculate reliably the 999th percentile they would prefer to use more easily measurable 95th percentile which might increase the abundance and quality of f ood in childrens diets but that would leave larger group of children potentially xposed in addition to reliability of estimates and the benefits and risks of pesticide use additional f actors also may be relevant to the decision about which percentile to employ such as the conserva tiveness of other epa inputs to risk analyses 7 64 federal register 4294542947 aug 6 1999guidance documents for such issues pestic ide industry and agricultural organizations would like epa to use noticeandcomment rulemaking process to establish fqpa implementation procedures but epa has resisted that approach fearing loss of flexibility and delays consequently 18 organizations filed complaint june 7 1999 with the us district court of the district of columb ia challenging epas consultative process american farm bureau federation v us environmental protection agency 99 cv1405 ddc filed june 7 1999 according to the american farm bureau federation negotiate d settlement with epa is pe nding before the court particularly contentious implementation issue revolves around the fqpa directives to use available data and reliable data as well as the fqpa mandate to order testing if epa determines that data are reasonably required to support the continuation of tolerance or exemption that is in effect for pesticide chemical residue on food ffdca section 408f1 stakeholders disagree about what is an appropriate course of action for epa when there is insufficient reliable data to estimate risk pesticide producers ideally would like epa to delay estimating risk until reliable data can be collected public health advocates would like epa to estimate risk based on available data and to reduce the potential for human exposure to unacceptable risks members of the pesticide industry also want epa to call in data alt hough pesticide producers conduct toxic ity testing and they need not wait for epa to order data production an epa order provide s certain legal and financia l protections not otherwise available to those who perform toxicity studies epa failure to orde r data callin was another issue raised by the lawsuit filed j une 7 1999 but this claim was dismissed by the court however epa published callin notice for specific da ta on developmental neurotoxicity and pesticide residues on august 6 19997 food tolerances for organophosphate pesticide residues organophosphates ops are complex synthe tic compounds in agriculture ops such as methyl parathion and malathion are used as broadly effective insecticides for example to kill boll weevils or fruit flies various ops are used on fruit trees vegetables ornamental plants cotton corn soybeans rice and wheat and for mosquito control epa has determined that ops are among pesticides posing the greatest risks to human health and the environment ops ve highly variable toxic effect on the nervous systems of people and other animals some are acute ly toxic others much less so but because they exert the effect in the same way they are the first pesticides that willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20043crs6 8 epa office of pesticides p tolerance reassessment status httpwwwepagovpesticidestolerancepdf_filesopxtab8022002pdf visited nov 13 2002be considered as group in 1996 when fq pa was enacted there were 1691 tolerances for op residues on crops by august 2 2002 epa had assessed 1127 op tolerances about 67 and revoked 703 op tolerances8 growers and pesticide makers are cerned about the fqpa impact on future availability of widely used op pesticides epa already has canceled methyl parathion registrations for all fruit uses in j une 2000 epa and the manufacturer of the op chlorpyrifos dursban agreed to eliminat nearly all household uses and to reduce residues on several foods eat regularly by children in december 2000 epa announced plan to phase out all home uses of diazinon another widely used op pesticide in 2001 epa decided to cancel phase out or tinue under timelimited re gistrations the crop uses of azinphosmethyl and phosmet in ddition epa and the registrant have decided to voluntarily cancel certain uses of propargite the goal of these and other regulatory actions for individual ops is to reduce cumulative op risk to safe level as noted above epa released preliminary cumulative risk assessment for the ops in december 2001 and revised cumulative op risk assessment in june 2002 however the final op cumulative risk assessment is not yet complete as epa collects more data the revised cumulative op risk assessment might produce lower risk estimates indicating that pesticide residue levels are reasonably certain to be safe as farm groups and pe sticide producers contend on the other hand data might support the view of public hea lth advocacy groups that despite regulatory actions children are exposed to unsafe levels of ops on pears apples grapes and peaches risking damage to developi ng brains and nervous systems conclusion when congress passed the fqpa by nimous votes in both chambers many hailed it as an example of ra tional scientific and riskbas ed law that would be good for producers and consumers alike it estab lished new standard for food safety that recognized the benefits of pesticide use on food crops but also guaranteed pesticide residues almost certainly would be harmless six years after enactment epa claims to be meeting statutory deadlines but various interest groups have challeng ed that claim as well as the epa implementation process as food uses of some popular pesticides ve been canceled some policy makers have argued that fqpa needs to be amended or that epa needs to be restrained from going beyond what the act requires increased congressional oversig ht and support for legislative remedies might be expected as fqpa implementation proceeds in 2003 epa expects to complete cumulative risk assessment of op pesticide exposure and to make final decisions about remaining op pes ticide registrations the fqpa provides little guidance on how epa should weigh one pesticid use against another epa arguably has considerable discretionary power to decide which op uses to permit and which to eliminate some epa decisions almost certainly will be challenged in court quite possibly both by producers and by envir onmental or public health interests
