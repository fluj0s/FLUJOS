auditing not doingness and occlusion lecture given on 4 august 1961 okay we have this is what this is the 4th of august female voice yes havent got my sextant with how can i tell the date were going to lengthen this course to eight weeks im not going to do anything particularly to on the cost or anything like that we are lengthening it to eight weeks just basically because youre being pretty slow man i mean thats all thats being pretty crudely slow now that isnt actually in effect for anybody but people who arent here yet that is to say that would only be effect in effect on people who have not yet enrolled your course is still four weeks and youre still behind i figured out way to give you lose you see and i want to invite you to some attention to the checksheets make sure that you get those checked out and i would like to make this statement particularly to those people who are leaving it isnt the new technique or the new idea that is wanting it is sound technical application throughout the world scientology has here and there where it has fallen on its face solely because of lack of technical accuracy of application that is utterly fantastic its basic methodology of auditing is just not applied and in the absence of the basic methodology of auditing you cannot get result and thats it i make that statement categorically bum auditor never got good result he got sporadic one once in while and then tried to get it on the next pc and then he kept looking for new and startling ideas that would get this idea again on the next pc but of course it never did and he figures out theres something very inconstant about the ideas of scientology or the actual processes of scientology these must be inconstant he should look closer to home his application of processes is inconstant so therefore his results are inconstant what it takes to comprise blunder in the technical department is of such wild order of magnitude that you normally when youre supervising processing dont even bother to ask for it because nobody could be that dumb and yet that is the exact blunder that is made for instance you seldom ask well did you report for sessions you know you just dont go into that order of magnitude youre wondering whether or not the pc might not have had some tiny little arc break that held up his processing and all that sort of thing that is not the order of magnitude that causes technical results not to occur its the order of magnitude of did you report for the auditing session casual statements very often have very disarming effect and youre liable to get the sudden truth dumped in your lap you know you say well did you change the process often enough every hour yeah youve had wild nonresult profile see over twentyfive or fifty hours of auditing its this kind of thing that youre looking at you may have perfectly nice auditor reports but they havent anything to do with the sessions that were run its quite incredible quite incredible picking up this form 6 discloses this too you start running security check form 6 about what have you done to pcs you know and one of the questions on there is of course well in essence did you fake auditor reports you know and youd be surprised how many falls there are on that the auditor wants to look good so he writes down good auditors report it didnt have anything to do with the session it happens its happened over the years all too often so this of course has had the effect of making work three times as hard as i might have otherwise because i couldnt figure out what was happening because i myself was not looking for the gross error but the error that was gross is gross man i mean its really marvelously gross error and such question as well did you change the process often enough each hour is liable to get oh yes you see this preclear has to have new process every four or five minutes you see because he loses interest youll get some of the wildest rationales you know and most arc breaks that occasion auditing are actually an auditor simply bum trs thats all the auditor doesnt press on carry through bad model session that sort of thing and youd be surprised what that does you yourself i am sure have noticed with enormous relief on your own part while being preclear that an auditor who just ran on down the line with good model session he might not be very brilliant in the way hes handling the data you give him but hes giving you good model session and all of sudden your confidence gradually rises you noticed that audience yes and you noticed what happens to you when you run into several flubbed auditing commands and flubbed bridges and flubbed this and flubbed that and how your confidence deteriorates that is direct monitoring factor this by the way is new field brandnew field in the whole field of psychotherapy the application of the therapy to the person that has never had any slightest study not until scientology that sounds astonishing doesnt it but it never has oh im sure some old witch doctor has educated some kid that he was bringing up to be super witch doctor or something of this sort im sure hes educated him to the proper way to handle rattle you know and say boo and scream at the right places but ill also call to your attention that those barbaric and uncivilized practices when they are actually rendered according to rote and the way they are supposed to be done theyre quite astonishing they get pretty good percentage they at least get their twentytwo and half percent psychiatry doesnt man it doesnt get any twentytwo and half percent and boy they handle an electric shock one way one day and another way another day and then they change it all around and handle it some other way and they dont know what theyre doing but then you and i of course are apt to be bemused and amazed at the psychiatrist because we dont understand what his goals are and of course he doesnt have the same goals we do and you can ask him for his goals and hell give you some of the most incredible rattletrap bunch of nonsense sounds like nonsense to you what is your goal with regard to patients what are you trying to do with patients you see something like this and youre liable to get stuff that will curl your hair i mean it has nothing to do with your goals has nothing to do with helping people hasnt thing to do with helping people hasnt anything to do with curing insanity you can say well how can fellow be in the field of psychiatry if he has nothing to do with helping people and curing insanity and you could rattle off yourself the pattern goals which ought to exist in psychiatry and they dont exist in psychiatry and many of those goals are missing in medicine particularly in the field of surgery and you ask surgeon what are your goals with regard to patient and you of course could tailor make whole bunch of goals that surgeon should have well its seldom that surgeon has any of those goals and so youre very dismayed because you dont understand the man and in freudian analysis the methodology of application alone prevented freudian analysis from working im sure that freudian analysis can work because i can make it work in 1945 i ruined more cases for the united states navy i told you about that im sure i ruined cases left and right by finding guys out on park bench and pulling some seconddynamic traumatic experience you see and then they were keeping records on the effect of hormones on exprisoners of war and that sort of thing you know and of course i had access to their records so of course they were running wonderful test program for it must have cost the government hundreds of thousands of dollars and they would write down in the records how it affected the patient on this day and how it affected him on the next day and oh these were beautiful statistical records so all you had to do was alter the psychic attitude of the patient toward sex then go look at the records few days later and of course you had the direct test of what you were doing the government was very nice in view of the fact that they intended to do nothing for the fellow but were merely trying to find out see they were just trying to find out and you i asked old doc yankeewitz well what are you trying to find out for and he said for for for sounded like he was playing golf stopped him in his tracks evidently his thought processes had never gone beyond that point hed been well trained but his application of methodologies application of the theories of psychoanalysis are almost 100 percent the reverse mirror to the auditors code if you dont believe it look them over its almost 100 percent reverse picture and then is inconstant they didnt even employ it the way they might have done you see so maybe these theories would have worked but who would know because the theory was applied in such ruggedly random fashion from one practitioner to the next from one day to the next by the same practitioner and mostly reversed as to what would do anything for the patient but methodology its application and only then can you get consistent and constant result and it starts in with tr 0 and frankly person cant even read an emeter if hes so agitated about looking at the pc and you know hes got to sit in session but hes got to look at the emeter and by actual observation i have found out specifically that the person doesnt get the data on the needle or tone arm if his tr 0 is bad then his recording of the emeter and what it says is fantastic tone arm can be at 50 he says its at 20 you know i mean he just cant record he cant read the emeter now what do you do you sweat in going out and teaching other people and so forth perspiration is doing zambezi falls from your brow and your sleeves are rolled up and youre getting ready to call for the rack and whip you know youre getting to youre getting desperate see youve told some auditors that when the needle is tight like that and wont drop on can squeeze with high sensitivity knob that the case probably needs routine 1 see you keep telling them this you see and you get this case in and at sensitivity 0 on the knob and near clear needle and the tone arm with nice action in it you find out that this person has been run for three days on routine 1 so you say well now study your emeter and you get out emeter essentials and you put emeter essentials under the nose of this person and you say study that emeter essentials now study your meter get so you can read meter get so you can read meter and he reads it all through and he passes the examination about it and three weeks later does the same trick with another pc only this time the pc is totally stuck with sensitivity at 16 and cant even find him with the tone arm and all of sudden why well what are you doing well were running routine 3 and thats all were running and the pc has such long comm lags however that its impossible really to run routine 3 because we only get about one goal session well i think we think we found his goal we think we found his goal though already because the whole meter just stops moving whenever he mentions being in session so we found his goal all right which is to be in session obviously and you say wait minute now read this emeter essentials here read it read it would you please and you are just banging your head against the wall because that isnt whats wrong with the pc that isnt whats wrong with this auditor he ought to be pc but that isnt whats wrong with him whats wrong with him is he cant confront its one of these horrible wide wild fundamentals it upsets him so the idea of looking at pc that of course he can spare attention for the meter or if he looks at the meter he can spare attention for the pc and these two things attention on two places of course adds up to the definition of problem doesnt it and so youve got two counterpostulates which here youd have two counterobjects and youve got two things with which you are unfamiliar that you are looking at at the same time and of course it looks like problem and persons indecision rises if indecision could be measured in inches of mercury itd be the height of the empire state building and hasnt anything to do with being able to memorize meter by rote it has everything to do with being able to connect what the meter is doing with what the pc is doing and regard them as unit they actually are two things until he gets that connection straight got it so the advice i will give you is simply basically just this look for greater technical gains when you have achieved greater skill in application dont necessarily look for greater technical gains because you have given them some new ideas thats the thing to concentrate on and when youve got that concentrated on when youve got that smoothed out and squared away all of sudden this new factor ideas and the application of ideas and handling the pcs ideas and all of that that all ensues afterwards but as long as the person is upset and worried and maybe not even realizing hes worried about the mechanics of how he does this thing he of course has judgment and thats the basic stomp on judgment is the person has judgment as long as he himself is sitting in the middle of problem of cant apply well hes sitting in this problem of cant apply and you expect him to have judgment about this case well he cant do it so ideas come after even though they apparently come before handling the ideas the theories processes what process when that sort of thing comes after somebody knows emeter and trs and model session and the other things has these things pretty good can do an assessment on the prehav scale accurately and well and can do good security check when he can do all these things now he ought to be worrying about what makes people clear because of course this is the fundamental these are the building blocks on which this idea of clear is built and its like trying to build the top of skyscraper without even skyhooks to just get an idea about clearing and then without any methodology try to bring it about wont work i had lot of experience with this now i dont necessarily state that the trs are the most ultimate drill that will ever be invented or even perhaps the best drills that have ever been invented but they are very widely effective and they are very applicable and they are very useful and people will sooner or later get over the hump with them nor do i say that the last volume to be written on the emeter is contained in emeter essentials there still may be things to be known in that meter although some of the things i have found out about an emeter in the course of just the last year had astonished i didnt know there could be that much left in that meter and there was and this work is pretty well summated now in emeter essentials well that isnt the final text but it is certainly useful and usable text and serves our purposes at this time i dont say that the wording of model session is the best wording that could be devised for all countries all places and all preclears but its generally applicable and it works out good average and therefore is workable structure and therefore workable methodology now the basic laws of auditing unfortunately have never been stated on one sheet of paper i have never been this adventurous but there are certain definite laws that regulate the choice of the command how do you run commands or how do you figure out command how do you add up command there are some laws relating to that there are several laws relating to processes whether theyre good processes or bad processes you have the one good example of what im talking about in scientology fundamentals of thought if you were to run somebody on canthave on self and have on somebody else like this process what could you give somebody thank you what wouldnt somebody else give you thank you well hed go right into the ground right away you see so there are several process rules but these rules are relatively flexible they are not terribly fixed and most pcs that you try to run games condition process on are going to tell you sooner or later that it actually should be canthave on the other one have for self youll probably run into that yourself on the bank well thats youre being so hopeful about it that there it goes well this violates unfortunately another rule and that is that running have for self under long and arduous testing has yet to produce any gain it doesnt upset anybody it doesnt chew them up particularly but it doesnt improve them either and i have looked at an awful prolonged parade of cases on which that particular facet was established so that you would just be throwing away an auditing command if you said canthave for the other fellow then have for you you know his havingness you that command would be lost every time it would be meaningless command so you cant run it that way its canthave for self the other fellows canthave for you his canthave for another another canthave for him and so on that is your basic gamescondition proposition even though it might appear more comfortable to the pc to run it canthave and have for himself and so on that might look much better to him and it might feel much better but if it feels much better theres another little rule that comes up is the degree of reality of the pc and its so weird that pcs can run glibly processes they have business being able to run they can run them with great glibidity and they can just chatter off answers left and right they get better nothing happens well theyre working behind protective screen nothing is real and nothing means anything anyway so it doesnt matter what i do and these processes dont hit at that particular button so of course they just continue to run and the pc can run forever and hes running without comm lag hes running without difficulty running cch 2 hell walk around the room and touch walls and this was the first time this showed up wildly why hed just run 8c forever and just nothing happens nothing happens at all youve seen cases like this so you have the reality factor you have the reality factor which enters into commands and processes and that is to say person should have reality on what hes running and at this point with commands in enters the emeter so the emeter moves in because that thing which will cause the needle to change its pattern is real to the pc i know it doesnt sound real to you sometimes you say to this pc well have you ever had any difficulty with oceans or planets or something like that and all of sudden he falls sixteen dials youve run into the clam on the beach you see something of that sort its real to him it isnt very real to you but its real to him so your own unreality sometimes defeats you in admitting that somebody could have such good reality on being clam and such bad reality on being human being so your own reality factor doesnt have to get dismayed or pushed around youve got simple test called an emeter and so in putting together auditing commands actually the best way to put together an auditing command is to put it together with needle reaction and just choose your words of various kinds and so on well now this only has one limiting factor is after the pc has been run for relatively short space of time on any bracket process only then do some of the outer brackets become real to him so he can run it for himself run it for himself run it for himself it fell for himself you see but you couldnt get it to fall for the other fellow so you didnt run that other leg well after hes run it for himself run it for himself run it for himself for while all of sudden this other one shows up and we get the broadening effect of commands we get the broadening perimeter actually there hasnt been lecture on this since november of 1950 angeles its picture of the dynamics and theyre concentric theyre series of concentric circles i think its been sketched around someplace but there was full lecture on it back then series of concentric circles the first dynamic is the inner circle and then the next circle is the second dynamic and they go on out to eight circles well the pcs ability to reach is reflected directly in the pcs ability to conceive of somebody else having an idea or an action and so as you run command his ability to reach betters and the command you started with can become too narrow and now operates as restriction on the pcs gain there hasnt been much discussion of this last point at all but ive just run into it using pc giving somebodys or denying somebody the pcs interest and the then the other person denying the pc their interest after it had been run for quite while it started to become restrictive why well the pcs ideas now were reaching further so denying another the pcs interest could be dropped down to just denying another interest you see his could be dropped out or hers could be dropped out see pc identity could be dropped out of the auditing command because it was too restrictive the pc now could conceive of other zones and varieties of interest dont you see so the auditing command modified to denying another interest and another denying the pc interest you see and more legs could be added to the auditing command too and youll find this is very common in putting together commands that you get the first leg of the bracket is the most real and then the second leg of the bracket becomes real after while and then the third leg of the bracket shows up and becomes real you see how this works and out it goes and you get wider and wider and wider perimeter of application so that frankly there are some processes which are so steep run on certain pcs that they cannot conceive of bracket interchange between themselves and another they cannot conceive an interchange self can conceive of interest another could conceive of interest you get the idea but for self to conceive of interest for another thats impossible you get the idea so each leg of the bracket stands as an individuated unit without any interchange amongst these brackets well now if you tailored up the auditing command to run as totally individuated type of auditing command you see each leg of the bracket is totally individuated and there is interchange with another leg of the bracket itd be like shooting all right lets just use shooting here get the idea of shooting self thats fine get the idea of another shooting self well this becomes little hard to do you see and this is about all that you could get to fall on the meter but after youve run as much as you could get to fall youre going to get the rest of the legs of the auditing command showing up well in view of the fact that it really doesnt harm anybody to run an unreality it doesnt really harm anybody to run an unreality if theyre approaching reality from some other quarter why you could put all those brackets in right at the beginning and you could say well get the idea of shooting yourself good get the idea of shooting another good get the idea of another shooting you good get the idea of another shooting himself good you see this is kind of builtup bracket well now these commands at the beginning would not at all be real to the pc the pc would say get the idea of shooting self oh boy can he get that see it falls off the pin he thinks about it all the time thats marvelous yes and now get the idea of shooting another absolutely slightest reaction not bit he hasnt got clue shooting another nobody ever does that hes heard of wars hes been to the motion pictures hes even seen tv to get to the utmost in violence and still cannot really conceive of person shooting another and as far as another shooting him is concerned nobody ever would the world is full of kind people and its full of nice people and wars are fought with chessboards and carved men everybody knows this and theres just reality but after you run it for little while get the idea of shooting another youve been uttering the auditing command but get the idea of shooting another if youve been watching your meter you all of sudden see when you utter this command you get needle reaction pow he can conceive this now and you could ask him at the same moment well is that real to you oh man yes sir wow oh thats something i dont want to do yeah its pretty terrible doing something like that and then having to call the ambulance you know thats pretty bad and get an idea of another shooting himself oh yeah thats what everybody ought to do well all of sudden that particular aspect of the auditing command isnt quite so hot its not too hot but get an idea of another shooting you oh boy oh boy it starts to fall and youll notice that command gets hotter and hotter and hotter according to your needle reaction well its getting more and more and more real to the pc so if in doubt in putting up auditing commands choose if you possibly can bracket and command wordings that all fall on the meter see if you can do that why youre really cooking everythings fine but remember that if you choose very limited scope of application that the command itself is going to restrict sooner or later the pcs recovery now supposing all you could get to fall was pc shooting self another shooting himself well after youve audited this for twenty or thirty hours all of the you see in the meantime the other actions of it would have become real to the pc too and you get all these other things and theyll start stacking up as automaticities and hell start getting some kind of an automatic feeling like he ought to shoot everybody or something like this you know or has he shot people hell start to worry about it because you havent let the pc look at it dont you see so therefore an auditing command part of the rules of auditing commands is an auditing command can at any time be broadened and made more general and must never be made more particular you can broaden an auditing command dont ever make it more particular dont start out with get the idea of shooting another get the idea of another shooting you all of sudden find out it isnt working too well so add in get the idea of shooting yourself get another idea of another shooting himself boy have you goofed now that is making more restrictive auditing command and when youve developed an auditing command and youre going to change it in the course of processing you must never change it in the direction of making it more specific you must always change it in the direction of making it more general follow that and you follow why if in doubt take the broadest most particularized you know just the most possibly involved and form of the auditing command with eighteen legs to it and right run it from the outset if youre in doubt about it just start and run it from the outset then very often your pc in getting audited is getting they all of sudden start turning on set of familiar somatics or something of this sort well you can suspect of course withholds and youll probably be right you can suspect present time problems and you undoubtedly will be right but you should also add into your list of suspects even though it isnt terribly important the fact that the auditing command is too narrow and is too specific and has probably reached point where it ought to be generalized now when you generalize an auditing command you dont change it any more than you have to in other words you dont change woulds to coulds and other particularities of the auditing command you keep it in exactly the same verb form and so on you just change its targets so its always legitimate to change the targets or directions of an auditing command but its never legitimate to change the wording form of the auditing command you can add more legs in other words or you can add more directions for the auditing command to go or you can add more general way for it to go but the basic form which you had how you were using how you better not change it it better be how in other words dont change where to how or dont change what to who or something of this sort you see dont monkey with those mechanics you get what mechanics im talking about now you know youre running think well dont suddenly start running get the idea of because thats wild change you can say that you have not changed the auditing command if you have generalized the targets in the command and if you have not changed the verbalizations of the general command now for instance get the idea of shooting self get the idea of another shooting himself all right that was all we were running at first for some reason best known to us all right you cant now say well think of shooting yourself think of shooting another think of another shooting himself think of another shooting you youre running an entirely different process but you can just add more legs or add greater generality to it such as get the idea of shooting self get the idea of another shooting self get the idea of shooting another get the idea of another shooting you get the idea of another shooting another and get the idea of others shooting another see were just going out further and get the idea of others shooting themselves see all this is perfectly legitimate youre just adding adding adding but youre just adding scope and direction arent you now you can drop portions of an auditing command equally easily by saying get the idea of giving another your interest supposing you were running this one its wrong but supposing you were running it you get the idea of giving another your interest could be altered very easily get the idea of giving another interest youve dropped the pronoun which was more of particularization than all of sudden it was necessary to have maybe it was necessary at first but now it is not necessary to have this thing so you can drop it all right but get the idea of you started out with giving get the idea of denying oh man youve just changed the whole process from one end to the other because youve changed the verb you see now this process with all these legs goes eventually into this cycle the pc gets free enough on the whole process and all parts of the process the pc now gets free enough to be able to consider all of the various legs of the process and the pc isnt running motivator motivator motivator all the time and so forth and you could just say get the idea of shooting you get the reductio ad absurdum this would then cover youve accumulated up to this time let us say fortyfive legs to this auditing command about 45s and you its got more particularities youve got the thing involved out there until its running all over the pasture you know and this starts to go pretty null well if you wanted to polish it off get all the missing legs that youve missed and so on well just drop the whole lousy lot and go back into simplicity but use the same auditing commands such as get the idea of shooting period all of sudden why the pc will add the targets in and hell add everything else in but hes now capable of doing so dont you see this usually an aberration is located as total imprisonment and in total individuation auditing commands as you run them resolve the degree of imprisonment and individuation and as this degree lessens dont suppose because you have knocked out just the individuation on one leg that you have flattened the whole command yes youve ceased to have tone arm action on just one leg of it but there were many other legs which youve left untouched dont you see so you can always check out an auditing command which is another little rule that you should follow it isnt enough to say that the auditing command then im letting you in now on some postgraduate college auditing command mockup here it isnt enough to say that an auditing command is flat because the tone arm has ceased to move while it was being run that is only workable statement at hpa level its going to hang up some pcs here and there not seriously enough to really upset the game but give them headache once in while the tone arm ceases to move when the targets of the process have been flattened now the targets of the process mean self another let us say or something of this sort now the tone arm has ceased to move because those targets were exhausted it does not mean that the process is exhausted and so therefore this is the rule before leaving an auditing command regardless of the twentyminute rule which is only signal you should check out the auditing command this would be the very thorough auditor for all possible variations which might produce new action and you very often find that they all flatten off in fifteen minutes but it was good thing to do dont you see you check back over the process and you found out the one person that the command never applied to was mother for some reason or other this auditing command just isolated and made it impossible to use mother you can get auditing commands thatll do this you see and because it was his or some stupid pronoun or something of the sort and yet it was mother and mother kept cropping up and toward the end of the auditing process the pc is left there sitting with static picture of mother now you check out the command and youll say well now how do you feel about this is nice general statement but you should be much more interested you should say well do you have any still pictures now is there anything what do you think about the command in general is there anything to which it did not apply is there anything that it missed so forth bong all of sudden well you say what was that and the pc says well its its static picture could that be picture of my mother its right out in front of here and you say yes yeah what about this well what about this he says well you see the auditing ive been dodging this for the last hour or so because the auditing process doesnt touch that particular aspect of it and you can say doesnt touch what aspect of it well you said shooting himself see and actually mother is herself and so forth and she used to talk all the time thats all she ever said just morning noon and night im just going to shoot myself if your father keeps on the way he is going he is always here nagging at some dianetic phrase ending it up you know and all is now revealed remember that in dealing with reactivity youre dealing with simple simon type of intelligence on any point where the pc has been extravagantly reactive he has been extravagantly stupid and he can add up more horses in more beds in less time and on an auditing command is just walking in the middle of pieces of pie carefully you see you see you didnt say pies have you ever stepped in any pies so therefore when he was in the bakery that time when it caught on fire and walked over pies he cant find one pie that he stepped on you see theres nothing but pies that he stepped on so he cant answer the auditing command youve heard this kind of logic you yourself have faced up to it occasionally well it isnt that your pc in general is being exorbitantly stupid its just because on reactive point in the bank you get this simple simon totally identified idiotic nonsense and the pc is as unconscious of it as he will be when he says running engrams in the old days sometimes the pc would give you one word every ten minutes you know talking very low and very slow and the pcs totally convinced hes chattering like magpie you know giving you one word every ten minutes way to boot him out of it he eventually runs through it well he says that auditing session certainly went fast youve just sat there you know nothing but weights on the clock hands you know certainly went fast well reality factor enters the case as the case is being audited so therefore reality has to be kept pace with with an auditing command if you are really doing slippy job every once in while youll get pc who is bit hung up other processes will solve it itll work out in the long run on the crude basis so therefore we dont bring this up were just talking now about the very fine points of auditing itll sometimes though show up sufficiently seriously to cause the pc physical discomfort or something you know cant answer about mother shooting herself you see just cant do that because this quite escapes you how this generality of pronoun couldnt be adapted but it doesnt escape the pc its impossible all right the handling of pc the use of the methodology the slippiness with which you can do security check all these things add up to advancing cases and when these things are omitted the cases dont advance i dont care how clever the solutions are which are arrived at by d of p or an auditor or anything else if those solutions are terribly clever in the absence of methodology nothing will happen to the case that i guarantee once in blue moon fellow like this will have win one of the ways to have win is to stick the pc in manic pc gets in wild manic i feel wonderful i feel wonderful you know and it wears off in twentyfour hours and he goes into the depressive state all youve done is shove him over the hump of little bit of an engram and it looks like you had win you know to some auditor not using methodology this used to happen to all the time i never got so disgusted with anything in my life i finally got very used to this phenomenon of the pc telling rave rave rave i just feel wonderful i love the whole world and everything is fine and everything is wonderful and so forth and i would just say to myself well well find out in seventytwo hours we would too oh god why did i ever get audited you know is your next immediate sequitur response you just put him on little toboggan processes which were using these days dont turn on these manics the way running engrams and that sort of thing used to those used to turn on quite regularly but anyway in trying to convince somebody that its worthwhile knowing his tools you run into quite barrier sometimes because the fellows never sitting there looking at himself audit and if you run into this too badly remember the auditors code and the instructors code are two different codes theyre actually mirror faces theyre quite reversed never fail to invalidate the wrongnesses of student you know that sort of thing make the student in question or the auditor in question and borrow tape recorder and blank piece of tape and make him sit there and do all the trs 0 1 2 3 4 5 and then do model session from scratch to the end just do that you know under coaching basis but dont give him any flunks put it all on the table it makes very rapid short little piece of tape you see its one tr at crack you know three do fish swims and that sort of thing and go right on through to the end and then turn the tape on and say now what in all that would you flunk well you do something like this only of course at time when somebody believes hes doing it all letterperfect and doesnt believe he has to do any of the trs and believes hes got it all taped youve got to show him that he has something to learn in it and that the cruder course is usually the kinder one dont go 11ing about it and say well with little more practice youll come along all right id just say bluntly you stink get on the ball and if you dont believe it why well let you listen to yourself on piece of tape and wow you know its something on the order of the fellow knows that he sounds exactly like caruso in the bath something on that direct order and if you were ever to give him tape recording of all those flat notes well you have to bring it home to them methodology is quite important its the most important factor weve had and the only reason im stressing it is because there has been our greatest failures the greatest failures we have had in dissemination of scientology is failed methodology the methodology wasnt there it wasnt exact and it wasnt certainly wasnt being followed and as result processing and so on now its not an accident now that were making clears its not an accident were making clears because were pushing methodology pushing it very hard you wont make clears in its absence let tell you so thems the thems the words of advice i give to these dear departed you will be remembered however particularly on the dispatch lines well now very probably you would like to ask parting question or two so if you do wish to spit now or forever hold your speech any questions all right then we can assume now that you know your business you know your business thoroughly and backwards and any complaints i get i will notis because i know they are not true male voice ill take rain check on it female voice that will save you lot of work on your own dispatches well i would like to say just few words to you about this new development because i gave you lecture on it last night but you talk about new ideas dont downgrade new ideas theyre very important its just im telling you they dont get anyplace unless theyre applied now there is the biggest barrier in organizations and easily the biggest barrier in disseminations is the notdoingness of people and next in rank is the misdoingness of people but the notdoingness of people ranks above the misdoingness it isnt so much by their misdeeds ye shall know them its by their notdeeds and therefore im very very happy to be able to jump this barrier i can answer now bluntly an old philosophic question of the value and quality of notdoingness now this is very fundamental philosophic question that has been with man for lord knows how long to do or not to do it isnt the shakespearian be or not to be that worries man its the to do or not to do and it isnt really on specific instance of to do or not to do its the generality of to do and not to do that worries him is it better to lead an active life or to lead quiet one well for instance romping around france over here in the last few centuries i used to alternate rather consistently between two types of existence one and the other one was political soldiers existence rough tough fast and hard you see alternated with almost mathematical precision with philosophic existence almost sandwich one life right after the other life and in the same pages practically the encyclopaedia britannica talks about this quiet fellow who was well liked never got around very much wrote couple of books and so forth and you flip couple of pages and you find out about this rough tough character who chewed everything up in sight see same guy well this was basically an unresolved philosophic question just look at matisse is it better to do or not to do if you do of course you get into trouble you commit overts obviously spattered brains all over the place empires falling and thrones reeling you know and if on the other side of the picture you dont do thing you get into trouble and this is what makes it philosophic question because each is surrounded by considerable confusion those are two islands surrounded totally by confusions and it amounts to just this i had this demonstrated very clearly i used to be very very nasty to i put this in the first person so you wont feel pushed around on it i was young writer up around new york city i was just about the meanest young writer that ever lived if an editor rejected story he was in for it man id meet him at party id meet him at party and as one of my friends said my god the horrible things you do to people why i never treat people badly and he says ron i have seen you take the skin off of person square inch by square inch and make him like it and before the war it actually was almost traditional in new york city that youd better not reject one of rons stories and other writer ever dared criticize my stories or tell editors they were good they never dared chop up anything this was for sure they were scared just plain scared i dont say that i was putting up vicious mockup particularly but i could get very nicely sarcastic particularly at parties when there were lots of people around you know i never had any trouble at all and after the war i was very nice to everybody i was very pleasant and writers started criticizing like mad and editors every once in while would write nasty letters my rates were superior they were up my numbers of readers were up all these things were up well what had happened here you solve it it was an unresolvable problem to do in other words to just go out overtly and claw everybodys eyes out in order to protect and effect sphere of interest you see and sphere of economic interest or to be nice pleasant well liked and get along well in sphere of interest and economic interest look it over both answers were wrong obviously it did good at all to go around with that many overts its wonder i didnt become an editor editors you know are best defined are always defined by writers as failed writers what is an editor he is failed writer i never became one but there it was and on the other side of the picture lets look at the other side of the coin to get along well with your fellows that didnt work that was an unworkable doingness and so forth because obviously the clique that wanted my markets naturally would chop to ribbons because they knew there was danger involved so what did you do were you nasty in the field of the arts or were you pleasant in the field of the arts and there were all sorts of contradictory lessons in this zone very contradictory lessons such as in hollywood one time fellow criticized some scenes i wrote and they could make life hell for you you know i blew up in his face he was producer he says to he said ron he says i i think you must have had ghostwriter write these scenes because i dont think you can write that badly well that is the signal that you are now going to have an office in the basement dont you see and that is about the end of that so the way hollywood goes so i just said raow you know walked back into my office got blank copy of contract brought it back in the producers office tore it in about forty different pieces all small pieces threw it up in the air and it came down like snowstorm and i said you can go ahead and sue to get to finish my contract but it wont do you bit of good im through i went back in my office moved my receptionist and secretary aside and i started clearing things out of my desk you know left and right i wasnt even mad this was all just total phony i wasnt even upset i knew what i was doing his favorite yes man didnt take five minutes to be standing outside of my door and i can remember those words he looked at pathetically and he says lou likes you ron well of course they just wouldnt have it in any other way that i had to have better office and i had to have this and that and they pushed on upstairs as fast as possible and they were very careful not to invalidate any of my scenes and in view of the fact there wasnt tension in the air the scenes were pretty good and everything was running along beautifully so that was reward for total phony doingness totally rewarded well time marches on one time in the navy i quit one hundred percent i started telling people its been long war that was my pat phrase and i would tell admirals or anybody else its been long war and their immediate direct response was ah well you mustnt quit like that you know they had been the moment before just raving you know and you mustnt quit and so on and of course i had them backed up against wall theyd look at and here i had campaign ribbons all over and they just you know said well what do i do about this and it put them in total know it was notdoingness and nobody could get to do thing theyd post orders for on bulletin boards and things like that and id never report and read them and theyd tell to go here and do that and do something else id just never bother to do it theyd come around and beg to after while and so on and id in an offhanded sort of way go up and slouch through it one way or the other do it all right but now that was they just couldnt do enough for so that was total reward for notdoingness huh doingness gets total reward notdoingness gets total reward back on the other side of the coin being rambunctious being mean and cruel well that kept everything going all right the being nice and so forth and pleasant and quiet that didnt work at all but it didnt work at all being mean and cruel because look at the overts you stacked up you began to hate the whole world you know answers there see im just going over this stuff because you yourself can think of times when you have faced this particular problem im sure you can think of times should i do this thing or be this way or should i be quiet and nice and orderly you see or should i be chromiumplated bitch you know this is the question not the shakespearian soliloquy but to do or not to do that is the question well the reason you have answer to it is the basic datum is missing theyre both overts only the longest continuous overt is notdoingness and very far from escaping well my dear dear friend paul van niekerk down in south africa wrote all about the seychelles islands he is proposing notdoingness like mad he says these islands are paradise the greatest danger is the lush fruit falling off the trees and hitting you and he said all you have to do is walk uphill until you find climate that you like and then just sit down and relax whats he proposing hes proposing total notdo isnt he well thats great nothing wrong with it we can yearn in that particular direction and thats fine lets look it over here in my particular boots supposing i did go to the seychelles island and walked uphill and found climate and sat down just supposing i did right at this particular instant well just look at it in terms of overt look at it in the term of overt not term of responsibility or other thing yipyap or rights to do this or that because mans got himself all taped through this so that he guides himself with false beacons the whole way see just look at it for what it is its one godawful overt for instance im pulling an overt right this minute on east grinstead they gave us bunch of yakyak about death lessons and the newspapers up here were not particularly friendly or kindly theyre going to have lousy parade tomorrow theyre going to have lousy parade they have bank holiday parade its quite feat they were down here on their hands and knees trying to get us to cooperate they wanted to be parade marshal and they wanted mary sue to be hostess to their guests and lords and ladies and everything and i just said and because waddingham can make couple of quick quid out of driving the car for them why i said yes well he could borrow the car as long as they paid waddingham very well thats an overt because ill tell you if i hadnt been on deck last year they wouldnt have had any damn parade it wound around all the wrong streets and the wrong corners and tried to get itself wrapped around every available telegraph pole and even then wound itself up on the side streets five blocks away from where it should have been and probably would have been there till midnight i kept it from being total debacle but its an overt because of course saint hill is actually quite peg in this community but im not kidding myself i dont feel bad about this one way or the other but basically through the root of this were just to some slight degree getting even give it another month or so why ill start telling them well if you people had been little nicer about your death lessons and so forth we wouldnt now be trading at crawley and theyll say what death lessons dont you remember how mean you were to saint hill well grudge grudge grudge and well bring it all around the circle again but of course all this is totally knowing on my part theres nothing reactive about it its plot i wont take the blame for the rain now theres your do and your notdo your do and your notdo and the greatest overt that produces the greatest amount of confusion is of course omission have you ever noticed the randomity that can be produced by missing datum in any given problem you notice that right now i have some randomity with regard to this ship you see i dont have all the data and books on the performance of this particular type of hull and lacking them is making considerable confusion and they apparently exist but nobody is willing to answer up to them and i have to wander through lot of things but its causing lot of confusion false datum can cause some confusion but nothing compared to missing datum look at man with missing technology about the field of the mind if you want to know what missing data can do hes been staggering around for the last fifty thousand years running into blank walls hes involved himself in autosdefe and every other kind of weird oddball activity and civilization after civilization has perished one right after the other and civilization today is almost synonymous with weakness various other factors exist all because he didnt know any didnt have any instruction books of any kind he didnt know how the mechanism worked he didnt know what made it go together or anything else well that randomity is just produced by missing datum well how about missing beingness now the ultimate of course the near ultimate in notdoingness is missing beingness you can be there you see and just not do anything but at least youre there how about not being there you realize thatll produce more confusion all right now theres one more thats why this is only near ultimate theres not being there the near ultimate is that one but the ultimate of course is forgetting you not only are not there doing nothing but youre not there you see is the next step down doing nothing next step down not there to do anything and the next step down from that is to forget all about it and these one two three produce in that order increasing magnitude of confusion and this is the production of confusion do you realize there is probably some place in this universe power station right this minute where you are supposed to throw switches in and out and youre not there and youve even forgotten that it exists isnt that interesting huh i imagine theres some activity someplace some activity someplace that is just well did you ever look out across bunch of mounds which were once stone walls you know just utter ruin rome is wonderful place to look around but there are other countries have them too did you ever look out across that and did you ever have feeling rather pleasant feeling about it old ruins did you ever have rather pleasant feeling about it did you ever kind of like old ruins you know think isnt that nice look at that cloister you know i ran into one in spain one day i came running down hill on motorcycle and here was the most enormous arch in front of and boy was it had it been grand arch and man was it ruin and oddly enough it didnt even have an identity anymore nobody could even tell you what it was i remembered it very well it probably has great deal to do with my having difficulty sometimes speaking spanish but there is that action axiom 10 insistence upon thetan never never never never never this is the rule ceases to try to have an effect on anything he never ceases to try matter how he looks matter what he is doing he never ceases to try to get axiom 10 in effect he just never ceases to try matter how many trillenia have gone by he has not stopped trying and you are trying to process people who are in the middle of about hundred thousand continuous overts which they are doing right this minute how are they doing them well they may be in life here but theyre not doing anything in some direction that would be the least of them you see doing something is apparently the least overt its quite interesting isnt it and look at the success which you have in handling this in processing overt you know running overts but how about withhold withhold evidently produces considerable difference ah withhold apparently is little more so isnt it withhold seems to be the more therapeutic side of the ow situation produces the greater gains on the pc when you get the withholds off well what is that you can marry that up to this other thing of not being there its his notdoingness in some version or form or another that is weighing heaviest on his case his notdoingness is weighing heaviest on his case and there is picture of should i do or should i not do these are not data of comparable magnitude do and notdo are not data of comparable magnitude notdo is enormously greater and the fellow sitting down on the seychelles island having abandoned all the world you would say well he cant possibly weve all agreed that he couldnt possibly be committing any overt of any kind whatsoever then why does he go to pieces thats the question how has this businessman who has been in there gouging his competitors ruining his employees just raising hell in all directions pulling national security to pieces just you know anything he could do well lets make deal with the russians you know theyve got some material and so forth and we can black market it through switzerland you know he seemed to be fairly fairly bad shape but he was still functioning and then one day he listens to medico and the medico says you ought to retire and we see this bird in few years or year and sometimes in month or two and the guy is just collapsed mound of flesh hes gone dog hes carrion bait thats all well how does this retirement produce such fantastic effect why do men die on an average earlier than women in the workaday world well women are still doing more or less what they did before they didnt retire but the man did and he introduces notdo and even though he is advised to do this and he thinks its the thing to do and everybodys agreed the thing to do basically underlying all that this unknown factor existed it was one godawful overt now we gloss over the overt very nicely in amarillo texas one time i saw sign on the wall and it says if you think youre so valuable and needed go down to the graveyard and look those fellows thought so too nice western type of unfortunately it happens to be totally incorrect its not right its not right thetan down underneath it all and over all of the motivators and excuses and so forth knows he was important to that zone and action and knows he is important to life and knows he has function in life and when he doesnt perform it he knows he is performing the greatest overt he can perform theres only one greater overt is to forget it and that is the final effort to have an effect you can have effect on an area by not doing anything in the area if you can have effect from doing something all right now lets take the gradient scale of effect then all right it runs like this you do something and have an effect on things axiom 10 now lets float on down and see the undergrades of this you can have an effect on things by not doing thats still an effect on things all right now we could have downgraded lower effect lower order of effect but still an effect and actually worse overt in not being there we not only not do but we are not there either now below that gets the lower grade which is to forget it and that still has an effect on things believe it or not it still has an effect on things very rambunctious effect too you can see that in everyday life you forget to bring home the milk and you produce some randomity you see all youve got to do is to forget to do something and you can produce considerable amount of randomity well how about forgetting whole lifetime not just quart of milk but dont you think that might produce greater randomity well it does oddly enough and its an overt and the fellow realizes its an overt he recognizes totally the overt character of forgetting and there is whole track occlusion and ive been on the track of it here for long long while to nail it right on the button to where you could actually resolve this thing called occlusion because its been considerable target over considerable period of time and that is occlusion it is the overt of forgetting and the law behind it is that thetan never ceases to try to have an effect on targets he has selected he never ceases to try and the only thing which could ever pry him loose from those fixated effects and so forth would be something like scientology he is imprisoned to the degree that he is still trying to have hopeless effect on something and there is his imprisonment and that is his most basic imprisonment hes his own jailer hes trying still to have an effect i dare say theres there are armies whose bones have been wheat germ for long time battlefields totally forgotten on which you are still trying to have an effect and your last order of effect of course is to forget it because of course that doesnt ever permit it to asis does it ah thats the overt it can never asis if you forget it when fellow goes totally bad and gets even meaner than i was when i was young writer he forgets thatll show them thatll get even with them when you get it on down all the way down to the bottom of course its just that occlusion you make an occlusion on it and of course it will never asis and that makes the finest variety of overt ever heard of and youre trying to process people who have thousands and thousands of these things now if ow can stall case and if its mere matter of withholds if the mere matter of withhold can stall case you see what im looking for here is speedup of auditing not anything else but if the mere matter of having withholds can stall case how fast or how much do you think case could be stalled by not being there thats withhold of self isnt it all right now theres deeper grade how much do you think the case can be stalled by the withhold from self and there and from doingness and from the subject and from any knowledge of the subject and from any acquaintance and from any communication with any beingness of the subject you get the idea kowww and thats why the more occluded case is the harder the case is to audit and theres the mechanics of it so you get somebody and you run them on what wouldnt you mind forgetting theyre apt to make some very interesting case gains because youre really running withholds but youre running withholds of specific variety but the auditing command which would add up to something like this would be more likely in this zone and area it would be this is some generality of pattern of command it would be what confusion would forgettingness create thats just not necessarily deliverable command its just the model command out of which you could get many commands what confusion could be created by forgettingness what confusion have you created by forgettingness would be your rockbottom allthewaydownhill form those are not the auditing commands those are just the theory statements you ask yourself that question youre liable to get some astonishing answer i suddenly realized that im still getting even with the middle east of about the five hundred years on each side of the year zero im still getting even with it ill show them forget all about it and what would be the consequences of forgetting all about it hm nobody would know the succession of kings if i forgot all about it nobody would know the various dynasties nobody would know the national boundaries nobody would know the customs hahahaha nobody would know anything about the weapons all those fellows and all those glorious deeds which were supposed to have seen posterity would all disappear see i must have done good job on it because of all unknown archaeological areas in the world the middle east is certainly one of them thats the overt but weve looked on forgettingness as sort of passive thing and weve looked on you know the fellows just unfortunate he forgets you know and weve looked on weve looked on notdoingness as the natural state of beingness and all of sudden find these are the most horrendous overts that person could possibly run of course opens up brandnew wide horizon for faster processing okay i wish you all very good weekend and i wish the three who are becoming dear departeds all the luck in the world and all the success in the world and ill be hearing from you lets have contest you make more clears than we do and well make more clears than you do okay all right good night now female voice thank you
