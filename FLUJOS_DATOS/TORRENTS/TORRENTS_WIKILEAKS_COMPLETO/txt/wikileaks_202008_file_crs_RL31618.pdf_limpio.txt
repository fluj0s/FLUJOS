however if an institution began participating in fseog after fy1999 and received larger allocation in its second year of participation than in its first it is allocated 90 of the amount it received in its second year of participation institutions base guarantees are adjusted to be proportional to the ratio of total funds available for the fseog program to the national total of institutions base

program than in either fseog or fws far fewer two year and proprietary participate in the perkins loan program than the other two programs38 it is possible that these lower levels of participation are due to factors such as the administrative burden of administering revolving loan fund and the generally higher cohort default rates of students who attend these types of institutions over the past decade there has been slight increase in the number of ihes participating in the fseog and fws programs institutional participation in the perkins loan program however has continued pattern of decline

450 to 600 uniformly for all institutions it appears that this change will have very modest impact in redistributing the allocation of fair share funding from highercost institutions to lowercost institutions since the 150 increase is proportionally greater for lowcost ihes for example if an ihe has coa of 5000 the change represents 3 increase in coa for an ihe with coa of 15000 the change represents only 1 increase in coa still because in recent years after allocating funds for base guarantees only limited amount has been available for allocation according to fair share procedures and because the aggregate total of institutional need will increase as well the redistribution of funds across institutions will likely be minimal g8g25g21g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561
