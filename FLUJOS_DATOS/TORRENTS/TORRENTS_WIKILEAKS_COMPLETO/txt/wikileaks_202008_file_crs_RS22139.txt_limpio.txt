after the release of the annual report the social security board of trustees each year the social security board of trustees issues report to congress on the operations and status of the social security trust funds the sixmember board of trustees includes the secretary of the treasury the secretary of labor the secretary of health and human services the commissioner of social security and two public representatives public trustees are appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate for fouryear terms the secretary of the treasury serves as the managing trustee the deputy commissioner of the social security administration is designated as the secretary of the board 1 any reference to the combined social security oasdi trust fund assumes the merged operations of the separate federal oldage and survivors insurance oasi trust fund and the federal disability insurance di trust fund and treats them as if they were one collective oasdi fund in reality the two trust funds have distinct dedicated primary revenue sources in their respective portions of federal payroll taxes and operate separately the two trust funds and their respective programs are closely linked however and collectively make up what is commonly referred to as social security crs2 shortrange and longrange projections the trustees traditionally report on both the shortrange 10year and longrange 75year operations of the oasi and di trust funds since there is uncertainty in long term projections the trustees provide estimates based on three alternative sets of economic and demographic assumptions low cost alternative i intermediate cost alternative ii and high cost alternative iii the intermediate projections represent the trustees best estimate these intermediate projections are the projections used in assessing the shortrange adequacy of social security financing while the three sets of longrange projections highlight that there is uncertainty in these estimates this approach does not provide any indication of the probability that the future financial status of the trust fund are within or outside the range of these estimates the standard longrange projection methodology lowcost intermediate and high cost projections uses deterministic model of outcomes where certain assumptions are made regarding important demographic and economic factors affecting the trust fund balance the deterministic model uses separate specified assumed values for each of the assumptions in recent years the annual report has begun to provide stochastic httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22139 projections that attempt to model the probability of alternative trust fund outcomes the stochastic approach is built on thousands of independent simulations where the value of the assumptions are allowed to vary the distribution of these simulation outcomes are then used to determine the probability of solvency occurring within range of years or the probability of key trust fund indicators falling within particular numerical range while the trustees report provides these stochastic estimates they are found in an appendix of the report and the model is viewed as being in its early stages of development summarizing the trust fund operations over 75year period may lead to misperceptions about program sustainability for even longer periods the trustees report now includes some measures of trust fund obligations beyond the 75year period which assume that most of the demographic and economic trends continue indefinitely summary measures of program obligations through an infinite horizon are now part of the trustees report however the focus of discussion surrounding the trustees report is on trust fund estimates for the 75year period using the intermediate assumptions the remainder of this report will highlight the current report findings using these intermediate assumptions understanding trust fund financing in july of 2006 social security provided cash benefits for 49 million americans over 162 million americans paid taxes in support of those benefits the combined oasdi trust funds receive income from the payroll taxes workers pay on their wages and selfemployment income smaller amount is financed by part of the income tax some recipients pay on their social security benefits in addition the trust fund receives interest from its current assets this income is used to pay for current benefits and program administration income in excess of outgo is credited to the trust fund these trust fund assets are primary indicator of the programs financial status the trustees report details these transactions and makes projections about future years transactions and the status of the trust funds when assets at the beginning of any year are equal to or crs3 in excess of expected expenditures the trust fund is thought to have an adequate balance if this ratio of assets to expected expenditures reaches zero the trust fund is said to be insolvent this means that fullyscheduled current law social security benefits could not be provided without some infusion of additional revenues2 solvency under the intermediate forecast the trustees project that on combined basis the balance of the social security trust funds will peak in 2026 but will be depleted in 2040 one year earlier than estimated in last years report figure 1 illustrates the projected and eventual decrease in social security holdings table 1 shows other important dates related to trust fund financing under the intermediate projections the di trust fund by itself is projected to become insolvent in 2025 and the oasi trust fund by itself is projected to become insolvent in 2042 because the oasi trust fund as measured by income outgo and balances is much larger than the di trust fund when all combined oasdi operations are considered the year of exhaustion converges at 2040 figure 1 projected balances of the social security trust funds

insurance trust funds tax income social security payroll tax and the income tax on benefits is revenue from sources outside the government interest income interest earned on assets held by the trust funds is paid by the government to the government that is transfer of funds from one government account to another beginning in 2017 money will have to be drawn from the general fund of the treasury to meet benefit payments and administrative costs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22139 under the intermediate forecast the combined trust fund expenditures would begin to exceed tax revenue in 2017 as shown in figure 2 despite the tax revenue deficit at this time the combined trust fund assets continue to grow through 2026 bringing their balance to slightly under 6 trillion figure 2 projected income excluding interest and outgo of the social security trust funds intermediate projections calendar years 20062040 source the 2006 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal oldage and survivors insurance and disability insurance trust funds this increase is the result of continued growth in the trust funds net interest in 2027 and thereafter the reserve balance would begin to be drawn down until the trust funds assets do not fully cover expected costs in 2040 at that point annual tax revenue would be sufficient to cover only about 74 of program costs under the current law projection expected tax revenues would continue to decline as share of program costs crs5 such that at the end of the 75year projection period 2080 these revenues would equal just 70 of costs over the full 75year projection period on average trust fund expenditures are projected to exceed income by 15 expressed another way the longrange trust fund deficit is projected to be 202 of taxable payroll compared with 192 of taxable payroll as projected in the 2005 report the systems longrange financing problems reflect projected costs associated with the aging of the population the first members of the baby boom generation will reach early retirement age in 2008 and with projected increases in life expectancy and decreases in birth rates over the next 25 years the number of people aged 65 and older is projected to increase by 90 in contrast the number of workers whose taxes will finance future benefits is projected to increase by only 14 as result the number of workers supporting each recipient is projected to decline from 33 today to 22 in 2030 after 2030 the ratio gradually declines even further an additional way in which the trustees express the longterm concerns for the program is by providing an estimation of how large cash infusion would be needed to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22139 retain solvency in lieu of other reform options comprising of revenue increases or benefit reductions in the 2006 report the trustees estimate that the present value of future infusions necessary to keep the system solvent beyond 2040 to the end of the 75year longrange projection period would be 46 trillion to sustain solvency for the infinite horizon the present value of future revenue infusions is much higher 134 trillion3 3 the present value calculations used to determine the size of the unfunded obligation of the trust funds can be thought of as the lumpsum amount that if invested today given an assumed rate of return would grow to cover the programs costs at the end of the projection period these types of measure attempt to account for the time value of money interest earned and are dependent on the assumptions used in their calculation ie the interest assumptions it is not simple measure of the cumulative gap between trust fund income and outgo
