rrrca confidential and not for disl butionexocutive summary the south african health care system is characterized as fragmented due to the huge disparities in the funding and delivery of services consequently access to health care is unequal with the majority of the population relying on public health care system that has disproportionately less amount of financial and human resources at its disdosal to address these imbalances in access and utilisation of health services as well as health outcomes amongst the different socioeconomic groups the health care system requires fundamental transformationinto an integrated health care system that guarantees the progressive realidation of the right to health care for all the introduction of national health insurance system is founded on three key arguements first that it is constitutional right that the public has access to quality health services second that the empirical evidence suggests that the population is willing and able to contribute towards mandatory health insurance third that it makes economic sense to invest in human capital development reorganise the funding model for public purposes and ensufe cost containment by reducing administrative and transaction costs in the system and most importantly achieve redistributive justice through the principle of universal coverage slructure of the nhi authority at the core of the proposed health sector reforms is the reconfiguration of institutions and organisations involved in the funding purchasing and provision of health care services national health insurance authority will be established within the confines of the appropriate laws whose major responsibility will be to receive funds from various sources pool these resources and purchase services on behalf of the entire population the authority will be public entity and structured as single purchaser with subnational offices at the provincial and district level the authority will be run by ceo that directly reports to the minister and is supported by an executive management and specific technicl committees including the technical advisory committee audit committee pricing committee remuneation committee benefits advisory committee and others revenue generation and pooling functions the main sources of revenue for the national health lnsurance fund will be general tax and progressiv mandatory contribution both employers and employees will contribute to the fund mechanisms will be gradually developed to get contributions from the selfemployed extemalflrnding for health will be included in the fund atl this will result in the cfeation of single risk pool that promotes crosssubsrdrsation between the rich and the poor the healthy and the sick and yollng and old health sector

care systeh 11 introduction south africa posf1994 inherited highly inequiiable health sysien from the apartheid era although south africa has relalively high levels of health care expenditure as percentage of gdp felative to comparable other middleincome countries lts health status indicators are much poorer due in part to various social and economic detefminants such as poverty and unemployment unhealthy life styles such as smoking alcohol abuse and risky sexual behaviours that fuel hivaids and other sexually transmitted diseases and injury from interpersonal violence anothef cdtical factor contributing to poof health outcomes is differential access to quality health care resulting from the maldistribution of human financial and physical resources behveen the public and private sectors the majority of financial and human resources for health care are locaied in the private health sector serving minority the 14 of the population who afe medical scheme members in

with 60 of the nurses and 40 of the doctors serving 85 of the population using the public health sector lyost of the health workers work in urban areas while there is serious shortage in the rural areas the dispfoportionate distribution is also by province with the western cape and gauteng having high numbers of doctortopopulation ratios when compared with the rest of the provtnces nurses form the backbone of the health cafe system and yet they are in short supply this is largely due io number of factors including cuts in the provincial budgets and the closure of nursing colleges which has resulted in fewer nurses being trained but even those who were trained do not all go on to practice in this country for example it is estimated that about 67 of nurses who trained in the period 1997 to 2005 do not appear on the south african nursing council register breier et 2008 some leave the country to seek greener pastures in countries that pay them higher salaries such as saudi arabia oman uk us canada and australia another indicaior of the shortage is the vacancy rate persal daia suggest that the vacancy rate was between 315 in 2006 to 36 in 2007 hst 2007 which tanslates to 25 701 nurses that would be needed for different positions breier et 2008 however the auihors also quickly remind us thatvacancies cannot necessarily be equated with demand because they may reflect frozen posts due to lack of funding good measure of shodage is failue to fill vacant posts following advertisements researchers at the hsrc found that ihe vacancy fill rate for registered nurses and midwives was 56 suggesting that there is shortage of nurses in general some of the reasons given by employers for failure to fill the vacant posts were that nursing is not wellpaying job that it has low recognition low promotion potential and long unsociable hours of work that nurses run the risk of contracting hiv and that many migrate to other couniries cited in breier et 2008 major concern is that 16 of health wofkers are living with h lv shisana at 2004 and 189 are classified as eligible for arv therapy connelly et 2007 linked to the issue ol nurses is the shortage of medical practitioners access to quaiity health care for the majority of the population of south africans using the public health sector is senously hampered by inadequate supply of medical practitioners many migrate to the north in europe the americas north australia and new zealand in 2001 the oecd estirnated that 8921 doctors were in these regions some of the feasons advanced for migration of these doctors included crime deteriorating public education better pay abroad deteriorating conditions iir the plrblic sectof and foreign recruitment these afe challenges ihat the staie will need to address if south africa

assistant dental technician speech therapy and audiology assistant and pharmacy assistanl professional assistants play particularly important role in staffing rural health centres primary health facilities and district hospitals to bridge the gap between the urban and rural divide and well resourced and underservicd areas l4edical pharmacist and nursing assistants also play role ln larger hospitals where they assist health professionals in their tasks the midlevel workers have to address the challenges presented by the big shortages of medical nursing pharmacist and dental professionals available for the great demand for health workers in the oooulation in south africa the development of this cadre of health worker has been informed by the department of health strategy document on health human resources the pick report and subsequently the 2006 doh national human resources for health plan to aooress shortages of va ous health professional groups to facilitate the implementation of the primary health care phc package within the country professional assistants pa have to receive training that will provide them with higher skill levelthan basic assistants the program for training is meant to ensure that skills acquifed are appropriate to the level of work they are to execute and complements the functions performed by other team members challenge with professional assistance is that whilst it provides reliefto shortages of health professionals it may reduce the perception of the urgency with which the whole health system needs to be restructured failure to deal with the pushfactors in rural and the public sector may result in professional assistants being the backbone of the human resource component in the public health system and providing care without the supervjsion of professionally qualified siaff another challenge pertains to role clarification scope of practice overlap and formalisation of roles in relation to the professions that are supervisory to the pa or who are supervised by the pa this will ensure that potential conflict of interests and confusion around rores ano responsibilities ls avoided this challenge has manifested as attrition of professional assistants to the private sector such as is the case with pharmacy assistants or career divercion to the supervisory profession as careerpathing solution as has been rne case with dental assistants who have gone on to study tor dentistry 1414 access to medicines another challenge facing the public health sectof is the shortage of drugs at health facilities especially aids drugs recently there were reports in the media about shortages of antiretroviral drlrgs experienced in the free state and also ln the country to avert this crisis the budget for phafmaceutical services in the provinces must be ring fenced and be under the direct supervision of the head of phamaceutical services this will greafly facilitate tinreous payment of manufacturers who have supplied the products thls willthen not disturb the nranufacturlng delivery payment cycle secondiy usage data on pharmaceuticals at the province should be accurately captured and analysed so that correct estimates of quantities required can be put together these estimates are very crucial during the award of tender so that the manufacturers can appropriately plan their manufacturing and delivery loglstics careflrl consideration should be given to the ability manufacturers who win the tenders to manufacture and slpply at times this capaciiy does not exist and leads to unavailablity of medicines and shortages of quantities to be supplied the intelligence on this crucial issue has to be consolidated with the siate tender board that evaluates submissions and awards tenders there s also need to implement thepolokwane resolution establish state company to produce drugs as means ofreducing the cost of medicines 142 challenges facing the private health sector 1421 private health care expenditure in contrast to the public sector expenditure in the private sector has continued to increase at rates far exceeding the inflation rate ori an annual basis since the 1980s lvlembership of medical schemes has become increasingly unatfordable for south atricans as expenditure increases so do the contribution rates or premiums that are charged by medical schemes in the late 1980s and early 1990s contribution rates were increasing at between 25olo to 30 peryearin realterms lvlclntyre et 1995 the rate of annual contribution increases has reduced dramatically in recent years but the average annual real increase in contributions of 7 between 2000 and 2005 is still of concern although medicat scheme membership increased from about 65 million in the early 1990s to 69 miltion by 1997 the absolute total number of beneficiaries decreased in some years thereafter and had only reached 69 million again by 2005 medicalscheme membership has declihed considerably as percentage of the population from 17 of the population being members of medicl schemes in 1992 l4clntyre et 1995 to less than 15 in 2005 council for medical schemes 2006 the main cost drivers of medical schemes expenditure have been private hospitals specialists and medicines medical administration and brokers while in the 1980s and first part of the 1990s expenditure on medicines was increasing more rapidly than other ctegories of medical schemes expenditure expenditure on private hospitals has seen the most rapid increases in the latter part of the 1990s and the 2000s mclntyre and doherty 2004 real per beneficiary expenditure on specialists increased by 53 behveen 1997 and 2005 while that on hospitals increased by 74 over this period very tittle of the hospitals expendiiure was directed to public sector hospitals spending on private hospitals accounted for 985 of all medical scheme expenditure on hospitals in 2oo5 council for medical schemes 2006 medical scheme expenditure on hospitals per beneficiary increased three times more rapidly than inflation between 1997 and 2005 mclntyre et at 2007 there are range of reasons for the large increases in medical scheme expenditure including the feeforservce reimbursement mechanism which encourages providers to supply more services than may be strictly necessary from clinical perspective there has also been growing imbalance in the relationship bebeen purchaserc medical schemes and providers this is particularly the case with private hospitals where three large hospltal groups own about 84olo of all private hospitals van den

in expenditure on private hospitals when adjusted for inflation existing memberc of schemes pay indirectly for the full cost of i unoccupied beds the surplus10000 beds through iincreases in utilization and hospital stays this is confirmed by the results of study conducted in 2008 by deloitte touche on private hospitals on behalf of the hospital association of south africa the results confirm that to address the lnefficiencies more patients occupy hospital beds on week days than over weekends this variation in bed occupancy is predomlnantly as result of increased utiiisation 1 91 and to lesser extent 052 as result of increased length of stay in the hospital driven largely by an increase in chronically ill patients the cms annual report also indicates that specialists are the key dfves of lncreased hospital ltilisation and costs as they are the pfofessionals who predominantly adrit patients in pivate hospitals specialists generate around 707 to 80 of hospital costs incured

serves 7 to 17 times more people than those in the private sector depending on whether one focuses only on the medical scheme population or assumes that up to 36 of the population use private

however it should be noted that alrnost all of theprogressivity of health care funding is attributable to medical scheme contributions as it is only the richest groups which contribute to medlcal schemes however it is also only those who contribute to medical scheme who benefit from funds in medical schemes the distribution of health care funding in the form of outofpocket payments and general tax payments is relatively evenly distributed across socioeconomic groups although general tax payments are progressive they are only slightly so with the poorest 80oo ot the population quintiles 1 to

african population benefit from the services funded by these schemes heavily influences the distribution of benefits from health care utilisation across socioeconomic aroups figure 4 shows that benefits are heavily concentrated on the richest 40 of the population who receive about 60 of the health care benefits this is particulaly due to the use of private providers by thrs group bul also

the national health insurance authority rationale for the establishment of an nhi in south africa 21 the status quo in the south african health system in chapter 1 cannot remain on the one hand the public health sector has been systematically underresourced over the past decade this sector has had to cope with very limited financial human and other resources at time when the burden of ill health was increasing dramatically on the other hand the amount of financial and human resources located in the private health sector has been increasing equally dramatically tor several decades despite the fact that medical schemes have been unable to extend insurance coverage to greater section of the population the rationale for introducing national health lnsurance is that it would provide mechanism for improving crosssubsidies in the oyeral health system whereby funding conlributions would be linked to an individuals abilitytopay and benefits m health services would be in line with an individuals need for care this uld be achieved throuqh having an integrated funding pool 211 public and political support for the nalional health insurance there is public and potitical support for the establishment of the national health insurance as means to increase accss to good quality health care for all the human sciences research council conducted national household survey of the south african population in 2005 and included questions on the desirability of the national health insurance interesting results were found when asked which of the following is more important providing health care coverage for all south africans even it is means raising taxes or holding down taxes even if it means some south africans do not have health care coverage surprisingly large percentage indicated that it is more important to provide health care coverage for all 547 while small percentage 212 said it is better to hold down taxes participants were asked which would you prefer the cunent medical aid system or universal national health insurance programme and surprising 465 of all south africans indicated that they would prefer universal national health insurance over current rnedical scheme and small proportion preferring the existing medical schemes 26 9 and 26 6 not expressang an opinion shisana et 2006 more recent national hosehold survey conducted in 2008 shows that

fragmented on number of different legislative and policy planes which leads to inefjicient utilization of resources wasteful duplication of health cover and unnecessary overlapping of functions between various agencies people continue to fall between the cracks in the system with the result that their consiitutional rights to human dignity bodily and psychological integrity and access to health services are being compromised lt is necessary to create single focus for the funding of health care services that respects the rights ofthe wealthy the poverty stricken and all those in between alike the constitutional mandate of government to ensure the progressive realization of the right of access to heatth services requires the most eflcient and effective utilization of resources in order to ensure such access for south africans and permanent residents there are urgent health care needs for example those of the elderly the indigent and very young that are not being adequately met due in part to the continued fragmentation of the current system combined with historical inequities within that system the status quo in the south african health system as outlined above cannot be perpetuated on the one hand the public health sector has been systematically under resourced over the past decade this sector has had to cope with very limited financial human and other resources at time when the burden of ill health was increasing dramatically on the other hand the amount offinancial and human resources located in the private health sector has been increasing equally dramatically for several decades despite the fact that medical schemes have been unable to extend insurance coverage to greater section of the oopulation the rationale for introducing nhi is that it would provide mechanism for improving cross subsidies in the overal health system whereby funding contributions would be linked to an individuals abilitytopay benefits would be in line with an individuals need for care and not on the persons ability to pay health services would be accessible to all on an equitable basrs on the princiole of nondiscrimination ln view of the challenges facing

intenelated health financing functions for the delivery of heafth care services are key 1 revenue collection 2 pooling of ds and 3 purchaslrg of services revenue collection refers to the process by which the health system collecis money from the households enterprises and possibly donors pooling refers to the accumulation ard managemeni of the revenue with the purpose of ensuring that the risk of having to pay for health is collectively shared by all in the pool and not by an individual the purchasing function refers to the process by which pooled funds are paid to providers to deliver specified set of health services the revenue collection and pooling functions of the nhi are discussed in this chapter and while purchasing functions are discussed in chapter 15 32 revenue collection

revenues with some direct contributions from employers households and donors the totalpublic health sector budget for 20072008 was an estimated r58 billion translating into per tevets the private health sector is funded primarily from voluntary contributions according to the council for medical schemes there were 122 medical schemes in 2007 with total membership of 7 478 o4o principal members and beneficiaries the total healthcare expenditure within the private sector during the 20072008 financial year was r647 billioncompared to r576 billion in the previous financial yea0 this translates into per beneficiary per capita expenditure rate of around r8 700 therefore total of about r122 billion was spent on the south african nationat health system in the 200712008 financiai year with an estimated 53 percent being spent in theprivate sector on approximately 75 million lives compared to 47 percent in the public system on 42 million lives the ability of the public system to effectively deliver care is always hampered by the limited availability of financial infrastructural and human resources in many countries around the world with national health insurance system particularly scandinavian countries eg sweden the netherlands and belgium and some asian and latin american countries g taiwan thailand and cuba health systems are primarily tunded through general tax revenues and some form of mandatory contdbution general tax revenues form reliable source of funding which helps to ensure thal services can be sustainably delivered to the national population over given time period therefore within the south african context any move towards national health insurance system would have to be financed through significant tax revenues with complementary mandatory contributions imposed primarily for those who are employed and earn above given tax threshold 42 fiscal federalism by definition fiscal federalism is concerned with understandinq which functions and instruments are best centralised and whrch are best ptaced in the sphere of decentralized levels of goverflment oates 1999 lt relates to the study of trying to understand how competencies expenditure side and fiscal inskuments revenue side are allocareo acrossdtfferent vertical layerc of the administration an important comooneni of fiscal federalism is the system of transfer pavments or gleltg by which central government shares its revenues with r levels of government in the south african health system fiscal federalism is enshrined in the constitutjon the national department of health makes two primary types of transfefs to lower spneres orgovernment namely conditional eg national tertiary services grant and unconditional ie equitable share alloctions the princrple behind the fiscal federalist system in south africa is that the national level is primadly responsible for policy ntaking ano ovefarl stewafdship ol the system while the provincial and local governments afe more responsible for operationalising national pdrcy oates we 1999 an ess c fsa iedraism joornalofeconomicliterature3t3112049 jstor 56jever despite this dlvision of responsibilities there are some paaci araenges to the siem while the national depalnent of health is held accounia c he achievements failures mthin the health system implementation of many poicies is not ihe preserve of national level and in some cases provinces argue thai the national level has sdiction over how they allocate fesources within the equitable share additionally some vinces engage in some form ofbudget gaming they intentionally allocate conditionalcs for nonconditional purposes with the knowedge that national government will cmatically intervene by providing additionalfunds to ensufe that the national pfiorities are quately caiered for further matter that cbmplicaiss the flscal federalism system in 31h africa is that it significantly relles on the principle of cooperative governance because xis principle some provinces can simply reved to their constitutional auronorny ano ose to act against national mandate with recourse for the national level r rlin the nhi system the matter of fiscal federalism would have to be carefully addressed nsure that there is balance between the ability of the national and lower spheres of r3rnment to ensure that sttegic priorities and progfammes are imp

could include components likeegional age distribution gender profile specified disease categories ie hiv aids tb prevalence appropriate nechanisms will have to be developed and irlplemented to address some of the potential drallenges that could emanate from adopting this mechanism eg district health authorities could start to refer patients to other regions to ensure that there resources remain intact key approach here would be to ensure that districts with high levels of crossborder patient nbvements are sufiiciently compensated for the budget spent on such patients this matter is also important to consider in respect of portability of services for the covered nembers clearly it must be envisaged that members will not always access services only in districts in which they are registered to ensure effective portability of member stitlements mechanisms for reimbursements across districts must be carefully developed ttlat is dhas must be able to recover funds from other each other for services rendered to rnembes there must be clearly stipulated rules indicating the rates at which these rdmbursements should occur and the timeframe within which they should be effected an equally important matter that has to be considered carefully is the transition of the trding arrangements from the cunent multiple funder system that includes the three spheres of government and the current medical schemes as financing intermediaries to the 4proved policy proposal of single fundef nhi system ln practicalterms it is vitalto plan b an intermediate phase in which there will be

capitation rates totalpopulation in area less those registered with the private provider and apply the capitationrate this could gradually be phased into universal capitation approach for phc services careful attention needs to be paid to service provision arrangements for phc services in rapidly as possible standards must be maintained in both public and private sector facilitiesand considerable effort should be devoted to imbroving public phc facilities particularly inrelation to staffing levels including through approaches such as sessionl aooointments withprivate gps if inadequate numbers of salaried doctors can be attracted to wok in public phc facilities lf this does not occur there js the risk that higher income groups will allimmediately register with accredited private phc providers and poorer gups will have torely on currently understaffed public sector phc services the strategic preference is to tryand accredit public providers first and then rook for private alternative where oubric lacilitiesworthy ot accreditation may not immediately exist payment arangements will also have to be made to compensate phc oroviders when this is necessary to ensure portability of bene on feeforservice basis again caps should be placed the total value of feeforservtcepayments per provider in addition careful public education of the need to use the provider with whom they are registered except under very specific conditions patients should be ableto move their registration to another provider if they are dissatjslied with their cufientprovidef but this should generally only be allowed once year 523 provider payments for hospital care tjniversal health systems most ffequenfly either use budgets or casebased eg drgsreimbursement mechanisms diagnosis related

adopted in the uk nhs or the approach adopted in thaitano wnerecapitation payments are made to hospitats with the hospitalopd providing phc and ecialist care as well as inpatient care the issue of how to pay specialists and allied professionals will require careful considerationh the case of public hospitals those in fulltime employment would be paid on salaried bsis while those in parttime employment would be paid on sessional basis capitation to fmary care providers may also include cover for specialist clinical investigations such aspathology and radiology which are some of the key cost drivers and cost containment will bele principal motivation for implementing capitation in these instances institutions such asle mls and accredited private sector laboratory services will be feimbursed ar an agreeqee the key issue that needs further consideration is how to draw on the specialisttsources that are located in the private sector 53 pricing and negotiation mechanisms the nhia will set capitation levels and prices for reimbursement of both public and private foviders the prices and capitation levels will be negotiated nationally in accordance withte nha and once agreed these will be used by all nht accredited faiilities in the countrylytrat is critical is that prices and capitation levels set do not support profiteering ano nencew for cost containment and quality

priorities for health services at the local level within the dhs there should be an incremental improvement in the delivery of health seryices over five year period with long term strategy to provide the full package of defined services clearly each district will be starting from different baseline with unique set of probiems the priorities initially uld be based on the most commonly occurring health problems and for most districts these would include at least the ranoe of hiv services tb services maternal and child health services and emer6ency services once these have been satisfactorily sorted it is likely that many of the systemic problems will also have been sorted out and that incremental improvements in other components ofthe comprehensive package will come about facilities that meet the criteria for accreditation will be included in the national health insurance those unable to meet the accreditation criteria will be assisted to do so within five years of implementation of

introduction the policy proposal for the national health insurelnce unequivocally states that nhi membership will be compulsory and in order to access nhi services people must be registered and hold an nhi card furthermore itclearly states that accredited providers of the comprehensive package of serviceq will largeli be funded on per capita basis and will thus be responsible for defined population registration of the populations within defined geographical areas and documentation of all existing private and public health facilities including professionalgroups such as general practitioners and specialists will be criticalto the successful implementation of nhl this section describes what needs to be done to ensure that potential beneficiaries are registered and linked to accessible health care facilities in their area this involves three distinct phases i providing population and facility profile through geomapping ii defining the catchment populaiion and iii assessing the functionality of each facility 72 defining district population the role of the district health system dhs is critical to the delivery of nhi services and therefore the starting point in identifying beneficiary populations is to clearly identify the basic planning and administrative demarcations that is districts the nhi refers to the district health aulhorities which are defined in chapterfive in the national health act under the establishment ofthe dhs lt stipulates that each health district is required to be coterminous with local government lg district and metropolitan boundaries since interim health districts were established before lg finalized district boundaries in 2001 health districts were not necessarily contiguous with the administrative disirict boundaries as defined by the municipal demarcaiion boird for lg currently most health districts have been aligned with lg jurisdictions as shown in table 70 what is crucial is that the population profile is known and that the population covered is appropriately calculated first most recent national census data from stats sa will be used to depict the national population broken down by province and district this will provide an overview of potential beneficiaries in the districts provinces and nationally second in areas where the districts as defined by the census do not coincide with the doh defined district health authorities the population covered will be fecalculated using enumeration area populaiion figures the idea is to make sure that correct coverage populations are established for planning purposes namely resource and infrastructure planning for nhi see table 7 0 78table 70 polati aote u alron profile brrovince and district proviiicedistrict health eastern capechris hani

additionally the quatity of health care miappropriate services that are cov irryate sector and considered unatfordable and inappropriate in the public seeorequity here means that those with greater

their socioeconomic status or any other factof obviously the debates arognd need and equity lead to the unavoidable debate of whose perspective should be taken when considering the need and determining what is most equitable simplistic yet acceptable approach is to agree that need can never be universally described and that the context ie the legal and polilical space economic circumstances cultural values and the society will impact significantly on the agreed upon definition of need and how it is going to be addressed 82 defining package of ices the expansion of health services that given populalion is entitled 10 should not be the only factor that is considered when deciding the package of services to be offered under universal health insurance system this implies that not each and every service should automatically be made part of the service lt is important that development and to the long term sustainability of the system in defining the package of services that should be offered within given context three separale and interrelated matters must be adequately considered the size of the population that will be entitled to the package as defined the number and type of services to be covered lmpact of services included in the package on key indicators like infant l4ortality rate maternal lilortality rate immunization rite new hiv infections tb cure rates

summary of the types of hospitals at which the services indicated in the above table will be red is orovided in the attached annexure it is important to emphasize here that appropriate mechanisms must be developed to ensure that there is efficient and ctive delivery of the covered services this implies restricting the number of visits that each covered individual or household is entitled to in relation to gps specialists optometrists and dentists key element that will ensure costeffective and efficient use of the available resources is to ensure that adequate gate keeping mechanisms are in place to ensure that individuals are accessing the needed services at the right level and are given the most effective treatment this implies that the roles of the various provjders have to be clearly defined especially at the primary care level as that is where the patients first come into contact with the system an example of these restrictions is provided in the table 1 belowble 1 example of

and membership risk to staff morale if not accredited risk that purchases clients will shift away from facitity if low grade isgrven and stress associated with compliance efforts the accreditation process for all health facilities in south ica will be accorqrng to set norms and standards these will be influenced by the following themed objectives or goals associated with quality improvement achieved at ditferent facility types and sustained through accreditation processes namely goal 1 hospitals to provide the technical expertise to enable the national department of health and provincial health services to bring about an internationally accredited quality improvement and accreditation programme for hospitals goal 2 ary healthcare to provide the technical expertise to enable the

accreditation standards compliance at the facility level healthcare organisations hospitals primary health clinics ambulance services and community health services are surveyed against the appropriate standards to obtain baseline assessment of the organisation deviations from the standards are prioritised according to the impact they have on quality and patient and staff safety based on the detailed analysis of prioritised deficiencies an integrated quality improvement programme for the organisation is developed wjth input from the multidisciplinary team all quality improvement interventions are formally monitored timeframes and responsible people are identified database identifies when timeframes are nol met and remedial actions are taken to reestablish the quality improvement programmes objective of achieving facilitywide standard compliance and accreditation at the end of the standard implementation phase organisationwide ys are carried out against the standards and facilities are awarded certificates according to the level of standard compliance achieved facilities that achieve substantial compliance with the standards are awarded an accreditation certificate valid for hvo years this means that all services should score at least 80i100 there should not be any noncompliant standards or criteria that could result in serious harm or injury i tide

to engage different health facilities accreditation organisations these are borne by either the province or distri the hospital the fragmentation in terms of the organisations used to undertake the accreditation exercises and the jocus on specific type of facility is something that has to be addressed there is need to develop national framework of standards and guidelines that all provincial and district authorities the national health system irrespective of whether they are private or public facilities decision has been made that south africa will be implementing the national health insurance lrom 2oog onwards the national health insurance aulhority will have to enter into defined contractual arrangements with various providers for the provislon and delivery of health services key aspect of these arrangements will be the requirement that the contracted facilities attain the minimum accreditation norms and standards for heatth service providers as determined in accreditation of health facilities using the accreditation status received by provider to the level of reimsursement would provide an incentive mechanism for strengthening quality private providers would then have

responsibilities over and above those that relate to the whole health care system particularly the private forprofit and not r profit facilitjes thar are norpart of the nhl according to section 78 1 the director ceneral amendment would say the l4inister of health must establish an otfice of standards of compliance within the national department outside of the department of health and establish apublic entity under pfma which must include person who acts as an ombudsperson in respect of the complaints in terms of this act not essential because of the responsibilities iisted below the complaints rather go to the health facility commlttees or boards the office of standards compliance must do the following in line with the requirements of the national health insurance keep the minister informed of the quality of the health services provided by facilities that provide services under the nhi as measured aoatnstprescribed health standards b vise the minister on norms and

is also evidence thai key factor is attrition the gap between numbers trained and growth in registers in addition the implementalion ofthe service transformalion fbns in various provinces has led to the downgrading of some hospitals hence the reduction of hospital beds and staff the situation pertaining to the support service staff in the public health sector is particlrlarly precarious significant amounts of the support services staff have been oulsourced and inome provincs this trend continues ouisourcing has significantly affected ihe moral of the support services staff given the fact that where it has been introduced the wages and beneflts of those affected have been cut an estimated 40 l4any public health facilities lack adequate supportservice staff leading to situaiions where the nursing staff performs some of he functions of the support service staff thereby undermining quality care of patients theie have been careerpathing programmes for the support service staff

that the annual production of doctors should double from 1200 to 2400 per annum by 2014 there are many possible explanations for the actual decline including shortage of medical academics which is related to the shortage of specialists who are willing to practice in the public sector this decrease could also be associated with the changing medical schools admission criteria medical schools are increasingly admitting students from disadvantaged and rural backgrounds that are less academically prepared than previous intakes and often take more years to complete their degrees than those m

objectives of the public sector are being met and that females are not precluded from occupying senior management positions although it is understandable jn terms of governments transformation policy it is of concern that the majority ofpublic sector hospital managers are vas inexperienced having been in management posilions for less than five years the use of current public sector managirs who are highly experienced could beutilised through an inhouse mehtoring model in broader career management and succession planning injtiative to develop individuals with managementpotential this programme uld provlde for future sustainability and stability ofpublic sector instiiutions pillay found that generally formal management development programmes made significant difference to competency levels this is corroborated by the lower selfassessed proficiency levels among managers who attended formalprogrammes as well as the lower proficiency rating of public sector managers the majority of whom admitted to some form of formal training informal approaches significantly improved competency levels in allfacets of health management this implies that the currenl approach to the development ofheallh managers which is focused on predominanily formal and didactic approach is having minimal impact on management capacity instead managers are more likely to improve their skills and competencies by informal means basedon an experiential approach which may include mentoring and coaching networking with colleagues and inhouse programmes this approach has the benefit of tailoring training to practices and issues relevantwithin an institution of exploring issues in nonthreatening environment ofincreased acceptabiljty and convenience to participants and of facilitating and enhancing senior managers contribution to management development 128 key findings in research on nurse managers nurse managers who received some form of informal training mentoringcoaching inservice training and noncertified programmes were significantjy more likely toperceive themselves as being more competent in planning organising and legal ethical competencies than their colleagues who received informal in health care management this is especially pertinent given that it correlates with the findinqs inthe on health managers the fact that there is significant ditference in competency levels of managers bet een the different sectors with private sector managers rating themsetves significantly higher on all of the competencies except for health services deli rywhere there

collection and disbursement offunds 522 existence of other forms of insurance schemes some countries have introduced many forms of insurance as pari of financial market arrangements or under the social security frame rk aimost all countries have private health insurance as healh riders life insurance mutualfunds and other insurance packages offered by financial institutions the existence of strong private health insuranae market as is the case in south africa is also an important matter that ltas io be carefully considered in that the proposed restructuring process could lead to significant resistance and unnecessary delays in moving towards the implementation good strategy that can be used to counteract such forces is to involve them jn the process ofthe debates and get their buyin dlrring the preimplementation phases as the experiences of cermany the netherlands and sweden clearly indicate as counkies move to rds universal coverage the role of privaie health insurance can change when public funding is low private insurance can serve as transitjonal mechanism while public funding is directed at building capacity and providing flnancialprotection for cedain segments ofthe population such as vulnerable and indigent groups the institutional capacity inlbrmation systems and skills involved in regulating pdvate health insurance may later be useful in managing publicly funded fundauthority 1523 regular contribution from the payroll the plan in most countries that have implemented nhi is that mandatory earmarked health insurance contributions come from regular deductions from the payroll and are accumulated as health fund although the total contribution is calculated as percentage of the monthly income the amount is normally split between the employee and employer and sometimes even through an additional subsidy by the state depending upon the national policy and social consensus one aciuarial and explicit policy issue that has to be decided upon is what proportion of salary should be compulsorily deducted along with other deductions like pensjon and provident fund income tax etc the establishment of an nhi fundauthority to act as the single purchaser can help to ensure that those covered receive appropriate health care_ it goes without saying that the fundauthority has to work in an environment where health care facilities are functionjng in an adequate manner so that access to health care by the insured people is not denied for any reason lt does noi mean thai the fundauthority should establish its own health care facilities the only important matter here is that the health facilities are sufficiently resourced to provide the required contracted semces and that they meet all the minimum specified accreditation criteria for instance socjal security schemes in india and myanmarestablished their own health care facilities in order to fill the gaps left by publjchealth care providers simjlarly in other countries big state or private enierpriseslike mines railways electricity petrochemical indusiries and other healyindustry complexes have established their own health care facilities thole r are often

for south africa there are nltmber of institutional and organisational aspects of the national health system that have to be changed to help lowards moving to an nhi environment in the south african

phase are jikely to contnue jnto the second phase postnlll llvlpleientation phase to ensure continuous streamlined process of strengthening of systems structures and institutions to effectively

matter is the size of the administrative costs which may be influenced furlher by the distibution of the national population thepopulation in urban areas where there is likely to be at least minimum quality and quantity of infrastructure services and communications and high populatin density is likely to be easier to serve with the nhi system than widely dispersed rural popuiation further factor is the countrys ability to administer the establishment ofan nhi authority requires sufficiently skilled labour force with lechnical capacities andexpertise in various professionalfields secondary and tediary education sholrldldeally respond to such training needs related markets such as in financial services other insurance businesses and even wellestablished international organisations must be drawn upon to provide appropriately trained personnel their staff can also be called upon to be involved in the training and general capacity building of nhi authoritys staff while it may seem nebulous to some the level of solidaritv within societv andthe ability of the implementers to draw on this can go long way in influencingthe pattem of implementation and the ensuing successes ofthe process society with higher level of solidarity is interpreted here as being one wherejndividuals are more willing to support other indjviduals system offullfinancialprotection requires significant amount of crosssubsidization both from rich topoor and from low risks to high risks obviously ihe appropriate level of solidarity to enable such crosssubsidization is context driven therefore at iimespolicymakers can impose solidarity through legislative mandates but it must bekept in mind that suficient degree of innate solidarity in society is needed in orderto implement and sustain the crosssubsidization inherent within nhl finally it will still take governments stewardshlp to launch and guide process that leads to compulsory health insurance for all the stewardshio ofthe health system is the responsibility of the state the slate is resdonsible for the welfareof the population and concerned about the trust and legitimacy with which its activities are viewed by the citizenry one important element ofgovernmental stewardship is therefore to allow the various stakeholders and the oopulation at iarge to have voice in policymaking open and transparent poljtical debate andavailability of information help the population gain trust in govemment and other agencies involved in nhi implementation lt is therefore rranted that thestakeholdrs to nhl the providers and the
