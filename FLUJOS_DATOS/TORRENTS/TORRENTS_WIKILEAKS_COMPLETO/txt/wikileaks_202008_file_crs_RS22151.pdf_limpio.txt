been in troduced to regulate more strictly certain longrange 50 caliber rifles the fifty caliber sniper weapons regulation act of 2005 s 935 introduced by senator dianne feinstein would amend the national firearms act nfa2 to regulate 50 caliber sniper weapons in the same fashion as shortbarreled shotguns and s ilencers by levying taxes on the manufacture and transfer of such firearms and by requiring owner and firearm registration the other proposal introduced by representative james moran the 50 caliber sniper rifle reduction act hr 654 would also amend the nfa to in clude these weapons but would also amendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22151crs2 3 18 usc chapter 44 921 et seq 4 fcsa fact sheet available at httpwwwfcsaorgarticlesabouthtml 5 keith pagel brief history of 50 brow ning machine gun cartridge development very high power magazine available at httpwwwfcsaorgarticlesotherbrief_historyhtml 6 ibidthe gun control act3 to effectively freeze the population of these weapons legally available to private persons and to prohibit any further transfer of these firearms in other words hr 654 would grandfather in existing rifles but would ban th eir further transfer consequently the proposal would eventually eliminate these rifles altogether from the civilian gun stock it is likely that covered 50 caliber rifles would have to be destroyed or handed over to the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf as contraband when the legal firearm owner died or wanted to give up the firearm as currently constructed hr 654 includes co mpensation provision for rifles destroyed or handed over to the federal government under this proposal furthermore both proposals s 935 and hr 654 would define 50 caliber sniper weapon to mean rifle capab of firing centerfire car tridge in 50 caliber 50 bmg caliber any other variant of 50 caliber or any metric equivale nt of such calibers many rifles and even some handguns are chambe red to fire 50 caliber ammunition meaning the projectile is about onehalf inch in diamet er opponents of this legislation are likely to note that this definition is very broad and would likely cover 50 caliber rifles that would not be considered longrange or s niper rifles the 50 bmg caliber round on the other hand is an exceptionally large cartr idge projectile and casing which was once used almost exclusively as heavy machine gun round longrange shooting and the 50 caliber bmg cartridge certain specialized firearms manufactur ers began producing longrange 50 caliber rifles in the early 1980s in recent years these firearms have gained popularity among firearms enthusiasts and in 1985 they form ed the fifty caliber shooters association inc fcsa to advance the sporting uses of the 50 caliber bmg cartridge4 the fcsa holds competitive marksmanship matc hes of 1000 yards and longer the 50 caliber bmg cartridge was develope d following the first world war as heavy machine gun cartridge adopted by the us army in 1923 it has seen continuous service ever since according to one firearms expert one common variety of the 50 caliber bmg cartridge 127x99mm incl udes projectile that weighs 665 grains whereas comparable mids ize rifle cartridge like the 308 winchester 762x51mm includes projectile that weighs about 147 grains5 hence the 50 caliber bmg projectile is 45 times greater in weight than the 308 winchester while cartridges ballistic performance depends on the type of projectile grade of propellant gunpowder and other factors the 50 caliber bmg cartridge casing holds about five times more propellent than the 308 winchester by further comparis on the same rounds have 1 maximum effective range of 2000 and 1500 yards 2 muzzle velocity of 2900 nd 2750 feet per second and 3 muzzle energy of 12000 and 2400 footpounds respectively6 the muzzle energy of the 50 caliber bmg r ound provides not only increased knock down power but increased accuracy as well in modern rifles the 50 caliber bmg round

p 124 the price differential between the m107and civilian longrange 50 caliber rifles is accounted for in large part by the difference in the scopes for example the milita ry scope is much more advanced and includes all weather and night optics capabilitiesroutinely hit 55gallon drum at ranges of mile 1760 yards7 in skilled hands and known wind conditions such rifle can be used to place five shots within 6inch circle at range of over onehalf mile 1000 yards8 the fcsa maintains that longrange 50 bm g caliber rifles were first developed for marksmanship competitions and then adopted by the military as sniper rifles one of the rifles adopted by the us army is the m107 long range sniper rifle outfitted with 10round magazine the m107 is semiaut omatic rifle meaning it is selfloading but fires only one round per trigger pull it is also outfitted with an attached opticselectrooptics scope that supports ll weather daynight tactical dominance9 fifty caliber bmg ammunition comes in wide variety so the rifle is capable of delivering incendiary armor piercing tr acer and dual purpose ammunition according to one firearms expert the primary mission of this rifle is to enga ge and defeat material targets at extended ranges to include parked aircraft comma nd control communications computers and intelligence c4i sites radar sites ammun ition petroleum oil and lubricants and various other thin skinned lightly armo red material targets out to 2000 meters10 loaded with nine rounds the m107 weighs about 32 pounds for fy2005 the unit price for single rifle is 14833 based on modular cost of 89 million for 600 rifles11 the m107 government contractor barrett fi rearms manufacturing company produces longrange 50 caliber rifles which ar available to the general public12 equipped with conventional scopes these rifles range in price from 2800 for singleshot boltaction rifle to 6750 for semiautomatic rifle new in box nib 13 regarding the availability of armor piercingincendiary rifle ammunition in the civilian gun market for the past six years fy2000fy2005 provision has been included in the department of defense appropriations act that bans the resale of military surplus 50

httpwwwfiftycalorglegislationphpor for export to foreign governments for military purposes14 while such ammunition introduced into the civilian market prior to the ban is still available it is specialty item and not always easily located potential deadly misuse of longrange fifty caliber rifles gun control advocates have reported that longrange 50 ca liber rifles could be used by terrorists in several deadly scenarios according to the violence policy center given the range and power of 50 caliber bmg r ound rifle chambered to fire this round could be used to bring down slowlowflying aircraft15 it is also plausible that terrorist using such rifle could punch holes in pressuri zed chemical tanks igniting combustible materials or leaking hazardous gases16 in addition such rifle could be used to penetrate lightly armored vehicles ch as those used by law enforcement and protective limousine services17 while these potentialities exist as pointed out by gun control opponents longrange 50 caliber rifles have not been the weapons of choice of criminals as law enforcement encounters w ith these weapons have been few and sporadic18 given the potential destructiveness of these rifles one option for congress to consider is more strictly regulating thes firearms under the national firearms act national firearms act nfa as amended two major statutes regulate the commerce in and possession of firearms the national firearms act of 193419 and the gun control act of 196820 as amended supplementing federal law many state firearms laws are strict er than federal law for example some states prohibit any possession of machine guns by private persons require permits to obtain other firearms and impose waiting periods for firearm transfers21 other states are less restrictive but state law cannot preempt federal w in general federal law serves as the minimum standard in the united states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22151crs5 22 the term any other weapon was derived from the nfa definition of firearm which included firearms capable of being cealed on the person that were not pistols or revolvers such firearms include gadgetguns that are disg uised as pens walking canes belt buckles knives and flashlights in 1968 congress amended the nfa to more precisely define any other weapon and to include certain smoothbore shortbarreled firearms under that definition 23 effective jan 23 2003 the responsibility for admi nistering the nfa shifted to the attorney general as congress transferred atf from treasu ry to justice under the homeland security act

attorney general previously the secretary of the treasury to conduct amnesties for longer than 90 days to allow persons in possession of nfa weapons to register them without penalty such an amnesty was conducted officially from nov 2 through dec 1 1968 25 pl 99308 1029 100 stat 452 codified at 18 usc 922o1in 1934 congress passed the nfa to limit the availability of machine guns short barreled rifles and shotguns silencers and catchall class of other concealable firearms identified as any other weapon22 many of these weapons were considered particularly lethal nd often the weapons of choice of gangsters during the prohibition era 19191933 as part of the internal revenue code the nfa levies taxes on all aspects of the manufactureimpor tation and distribution of such firearms and requires that these firearms and their owners be registered at every point the firearms change ownership in the chain of commerce the nfa required the secretary of the treasury to establish registry of all nfa firearms in the united states that were not under the control of the united states today the registry is maintained by the attorney general23 title ii of the gun control act gca of 1968 revised and recodified the nfa to 1 expand its scope of coverage to incl ude destructive devices bombs incendiary devices and weapons with bore of greater th an onehalf inch 2 include definition for any other weapon to more precisely include certain smooth bore shortbarreled handguns and 3 redefine the term firearm to exclude antique firearms or any device except machine guns and destructive devices that were determined to be collectors items by reason of their date of manufacture value design and other characteristics and would not likely be used as weapon u nder this provision the attorney general is authorized to reclassify certain firearms as collectors items administratively removing them from the nfa the gca also increased penalties for violating the nfa in addition the gca included an amnesty provisi on that addressed supreme court ruling regarding the registration of nfa weapons and the likelihood that individuals holding unregistered nfa firearms would incriminate themselves by registering such weapons24 in 1986 congress passed the firearms owners protection act fopa and amended the gca to prohibit the possession of machine guns that were not legally possessed or available for transfer prior to enactment may 19 198625 while fopa included exceptions for any department or agency of the united states state or political subdivision thereof it effectively froze the number of machine guns that were legally available to the general public in the united states as stated above the nfa requires the attorn ey general to maintain central registry of all nfa firearms and owners

c onsidered contraband and are subject to seizure 29 transfers of nfacovered firearms incur tax of 200 except for those classified as any other weapon which are taxed at reduced 5 rate certain nfa firearm tran sfers are taxexempt they include transfers to lawful heir from an estate transfers between ffls who are also sots and transfers of unserviceable firearmsunder the control of the united

document the transferee may not take possession of the firearm until he holds the pproved transfer document private persons who are not otherwise prohibited by law ma acquire an nfa firearm in one of three ways 1 registered owner of an nfa firearm may apply for atf approval to transfer the firearm to another person residing in the sa state or to ffl in another state 2 an individual may apply to atf for approval to make and register an nfa firearm except machinegun or 3 an individual may i nherit lawfully registered nfa firearm options for congress congress could consider several options for dealing with longrange 50 caliber rifles one congress could take action two congress could requi re that such rifles be registered under the nfa as would nator feinsteins proposal s 935 three congress could ban their further producti on for the civilian gun market as would representative morans proposal hr 654 four congress could also ban any further transfer of these firearms effectively eliminating these weapons from the civilian gun market in time as would hr 654 five these weapons could be banned outright scenario under which congress could also co nsider compensating owners for turning such firearms over to the federal government six congress could also consider recalling all existing armor piercingincendiary 50 calib er bmg ammunition still available in the civilian gun market seven congress could consider setting ballistic performance standards that would benchmark the out ward limit for 50 caliber rifle ammunition considered acceptable for sporting hunting or recreational purposes
