alternative work arrangement updated september 14 2004 linda levine specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress selfemployment as contributor to job growth and as an alternative work arrangement summary selfemployment is the major alternative to the leading type of employee employer relationship which is firm paying wage to an employee the self employed have accounted for some 7 of nonfarm jobs over the past few decades selfemployment recently has drawn attention as one explanation for differing survey estimates of net job growth since the 2001 recessions end there also was debate over the two prior decades about the contribution to net job creation of self employment or entrepreneurship ie people starting businesses during the 1992 2000 economic expansion interest in selfemployment focused on the kind of jobs being created ie alternatives to secure traditional wage and salary jobs and on the possibility of misclassifying employees as selfemployed consultants or contractors who then are ineligible for certain government benefits eg unemployment insurance ui workers compensation and family and medical leave since the early 1990s the government has encouraged the establishment of selfemployment assistance programs to help reemploy some displaced workers likely to exhaust their ui benefits the contribution of selfemployment to net job creation has not varied greatly by decade except for the 1990s in the 1970s and 1980s increased selfemployment accounted for 7 and 10 of nonfarm job gains respectively during the 1990s however people more often became employees such that selfemployment contributed just 1 to net job growth to attract employees when unemployment rates were low in the second half of the 1990s firms may have expanded benefits that appealed to those who otherwise would have chosen selfemployment eg flexible work hours thus far in the current decade selfemployment has been much greater contributor to net job growth at 13 persons laid off in sluggish labor market may become discouraged about their hiring prospects and turn to selfemployment eg during the slow rebound from the last two recessions studies disagree however about whether high unemployment pushes people into selfemployment because of dearth of other options or whether it dampens entrepreneurship because of scarce opportunities and factors beyond conditions in the labor market affect the propensity of displaced workers and others to start businesses older workers greater likelihood of selfemployment may reflect desire to phase into retirement without jeopardizing receipt of employerprovided health insurance and level of employerprovided pension benefits womens increased selfemployment rate may reflect the desire of mothers with young children for hours flexibility to allow them to balance work and family roles thus over 80 of independent consultants in the february 19952001 period said they preferred their situation to that of traditional workers their satisfaction appears related to the comparatively high wages of male independent contractors although the availability of benefits lags for the group as whole further in that low unemployment period only 3 to 4 of independent contractors considered their positions insecure many fewer than others in

the leading type of employee employer relationship in the united states which is an employer paying wage or salary to an employee in 2003 according to data from the current population survey cps the selfemployed numbered little over 93 million they accounted for fewer than 7 of all employed persons in nonfarm industries wage and salary workers at 1260 million represented more than 9 of every 10 employed persons in the nonfarm sector of the economy1 why the interest selfemployment recently has drawn attention as partial explanation for the differing survey estimates of net job growth ie gross job gains minus gross job losses in the last few years the cps is survey of 60000 households conducted by the us bureau of the census for the us bureau of labor statistics bls it is the representative survey of the us population that yields the unemployment rate one of the rates components is the number of employed persons in the us civilian noninstitutional population age 16 or older employment in the cps is further disaggregated by class of worker wage and salary selfemployed and unpaid family workers bls current employment statistics ces survey queries 160000 us businesses excluding agriculture and government agencies covering some 400000 establishments about the number of payroll jobs unlike the cps then the establishment survey captures only wage and salary jobs in the nonfarm sector because of these and other differences between the two surveys2 some contend that the cps has better measured employment gains since the recessions end in 1 unless otherwise noted this report will be confined to analysis of statistics pertaining to the nonagricultural sector both total employment and selfemployment family farmers and ranchers in the agricultural sector declined substantially over time in addition data from the establishment survey discussed above covers only nonfarm industries 2 for more information see us bureau of labor statistics employment from the bls household and payroll surveys summary of recent trends available at httpstatsblsgovcpsces_cps_trendspdf crs2 november 2001 and more accurately portrays conditions in the labor market as it has evolved3 others counter that regardless of the arguments veracity greater self employment is not positive development because some individuals effectively were forced into working for themselves as firms had created few new payroll jobs until march 20044 there also was disagreement during the two prior decades about the contribution of selfemployment or entrepreneurship an individual starting business to net job creation5 the proposition as originally espoused by david l birch held that births of small businesses account for disproportionately large share of net new jobs supporters of this viewpoint asserted that critics were mischaracterizing the database and methodology that underlie it and were confusing its validity with other concerns eg the quality of the jobs at small firms6 they further contended that study refuting the allegedly superior job generating role of new as opposed to expanding small businesses7 could not be generalized to the nations largely service sector economy because the analysis was limited to manufacturing the studys findings subsequently were confirmed by an analysis of establishments across the entire private sector entrepreneurship is important to job growth in the united states but not as important as job expansion in existing firms however small establishments 1 to 19 workers play much larger role in job growth in the fastgrowing services industry eg health and business services than they do in manufacturing industries in the united states8 additionally david birch later amended his proposition to say that the precise contribution of new entrepreneurs to job growth varies by time period and that most 3 tim kane diverging employment data critical view of the payroll survey the heritage foundation mar 4 2004 available at

labor review july 2000 p 15 crs3 of the job growth is fueled by fairly few members of the heterogenous small business group9 during the 19922000 economic expansion interest in selfemployment focused on the kind of jobs being created namely alternative and contingent work arrangements the phrases often used interchangeably were coined to describe firms increased utilization of individuals on an asneeded basis rather than directly adding workers to their payrolls with an implicit or explicit promise of job security variations on the traditional work arrangement include bringing on board employees of temporary help agencies and retaining selfemployed consultants for as long or short time as necessary some endorse the restructured business model because it purportedly enables companies to respond more flexibly to changes in market conditions and to reduce payroll taxes as well as employee benefit costs10 they contend the selfemployed consultants or free agents are able in turn to have the independence that is important to them others view with disfavor all alternative work arrangements because they allegedly reduce workers job security and access to benefits eg health insurance and pensions and in some instances reflect misclassification of employees as independent contractors who as result are not eligible for certain government benefits eg unemployment insurance

misclassification on ui tax payments and benefits among other things the study released in february 2000 noted that rise in the unemployment rate such as occurred during and after the 2001 recession could heighten the administrative burden of state ui staff due to an increased number of contested claims filed by independent contractors who thought they were employees13 this report begins by defining and examining the characteristics of self employed persons it next analyzes the trend in selfemployment its contribution to net job growth and why some individuals become entrepreneurs the report then explores group closely related to the selfemployed namely independent contractors and compares them with those in other alternative work arrangements and in traditional jobs who are the selfemployed the definition of selfemployment in the cps may be narrower than some peoples conception of working for oneself the monthly cps asks people whether in their primary job they currently are employed by government private firm nonprofit entity or whether they are selfemployed individuals who respond affirmatively to the first three choices are classified as wage and salary workers those who reply they are selfemployed subsequently are asked if their business is incorporated if they say it is then they too are classified as wage and salary workers because they legally are the employees of their corporations thus the cps estimate of selfemployment applies to those whose primary job is owner of an unincorporated business from whose profits they derive their income14 the unincorporated self employed may hire employees but they generally do not do so15 confusion on the part of cps respondents may have led to understatement of the number of unincorporated selfemployed in the last decade or so when independent consultants seemingly became more prevalent16 during the dotcom bubble for example indemand network administrators and software engineers may have leapt from their wage and salary jobs to start working as freelancers if they subsequently contracted to work for their former employers they or their family members may have misidentified the job to the cps interviewer as payroll employment rather than selfemployment 12 continued vroman selfemployment assistance revised report prepared by the urban institute for department of labor dec 1997 13 planmatics

proprietorships and partnerships the latter of which can include limited liability companies 15 john bregger measuring selfemployment in the united states monthly labor review janfeb 1996 hereafter cited as bregger measuring selfemployment 16 kane diverging employment data crs5 the following discussion first focuses on selfemployment as defined in the monthly cps17 independent contractors are addressed in the reports last section but by way of preview the two overlapping groups have much in common gender as shown in table 1 selfemployment is much more common among men 80 than women 57 the disparity has lessened over time women today account for almost two of every five selfemployed individuals principally because relatively more women than men have become business owners over the years18 one often suggested reason for womens propensity toward selfemployment is it gives them control over work schedules which facilitates accommodation of their traditional role as family caregivers19 age selfemployment is increasingly common as people approach the end of their working lives some 15 of workers age 65 or older were selfemployed in 2003 desire to phase into retirement likely explains much of the groups comparatively high selfemployment rate persons eligible for social security benefits might want to work less than fulltime schedules20 even were employers to allow them to work parttime older workers might be penalized for doing so if their pension plans base benefits upon recent salary levels moreover firms less often extend health insurance coverage to parttime employees and when they do often require larger employee contribution faced with these circumstances members of the oldest age group might respond by retiring from their payroll jobs but keep their hand in by starting business or by making what previously had been side business their primary job lesser but still well aboveaverage share of 4564 year olds also are self employed the rate among midcareer workers probably is higher because they are more likely than younger workers to have accumulated the capital and managerial skills needed to become an entrepreneur 17 an individual is classified as selfemployed in the monthly cps if that is the job held at the time of the interview in the march supplement to the cps an individual is classified as selfemployed if that is the longest job held during the preceding year consequently the selfemployment rate derived from the monthly cps will be higher than the rate derived from the march supplement because the latter misses short spells of selfemployment studies of the composition of the selfemployed based upon data from the march supplement report findings similar to those discussed above see for example yannis georgellis and

owned their own unincorporated or incorporated business and who demonstrated commitment to these businesses based on number of hours worked increased at lesser rate among whites than non whites during the 1980s and 1990s however the selfemployment ranking by raceethnicity was stable over the period22 most of the increase in the number of selfemployed men is attributable to expansion of the male labor force as opposed to rise in their selfemployment rate the opposite of the case among women table 1 selfemployment by selected characteristics 2003 number of selfemployed percent of

data from the current population survey crs8 industry as shown in table 1 the selfemployment rate is highest in the following industry groups construction professional and business services such as legal and accounting and other services excluding private household such as repair and maintenance as well as personal and laundry part of the reason for these higher rates of selfemployment may be their fairly low financial barriers to entry23 wide gap exists between the earnings of selfemployed men and women selfemployed mens higher earnings may be due in part to their presence in more financially rewarding industries eg construction and professional specialties women in contrast are more prevalent in relatively lowpaying retail trade and services industries womens customary activities outside the labor market time spent in housework and childrearing also adversely affect the relative wages of female business owners24 occupation the highest rates of selfemployment are in natural resources construction and maintenance occupations 13025 and in management business and financial operations jobs 86 the lowest selfemployment rates are in production transportation and material moving occupations 38 only in service occupations eg child care workers and home health aides is the share of women business owners appreciably greater than the share of men 89 and 58 respectively bls projects selfemployment in management business and financial operations jobs could expand the number of selfemployed persons in professional and related occupations also is expected to increase eg computer occupations and registered nurses but there might be fewer selfemployed doctors as employment shifts into incorporated group practices and fewer lawyers reflecting the difficulty in establishing new legal practices26 similarly total selfemployment is projected to increase in service and construction occupations despite decreases in certain fields in contrast selfemployment overall among sales eg retail store owners and sales workers and production eg apparel and wood workers occupations could decline 23 ellen r rissman selfemployment as an alternative to

survey from 1967 onward the selfemployed include only owners of unincorporated businesses who thus derive their income from profits rather than salaries b although there was major redesign of the cps in 1994 it had fairly small effect on self employment data c data for 2000 are not comparable with earlier years because of the incorporation of population estimates from the decennial census which greatly increased employment estimates for the year d an upward population adjustment made in 2003 which was based upon higher estimates of net international migration from 2000 through 2002 resulted in much smaller increase in employment estimates in 2003 compared to the 2000 adjustment 27 the cps was reworded in the mid1960s to explicitly count as selfemployed only those who own unincorporated businesses and us businesses have exhibited marked tendency over time toward incorporation accordingly about the same decline in the self employment rate likely would have occurred but without the sharp singleyear drop between 1966 and 1967 according to bregger measuring selfemployment crs10 selfemployment as contributor to job growth as shown in the above table the contribution of selfemployment to net job growth has not varied greatly from one decade to another with the exception of the 1990s during the 1970s measuring approximately peaktopeak in the business cycle the addition of 15 million selfemployed persons accounted for about 7 of net new jobs the 18 million increase in selfemployed persons during the 1980s comprised larger share of job growth at almost 10 during the 1990s the very limited net increase in selfemployment 185000 contributed just 1 to the expansion in nonfarm employment while the absolute number of selfemployed workers had climbed steadily over the 1970s and 1980s their number remained fairly flat at or approaching 9 million during the long economic expansion of the 1990s researchers who study self employment cannot explain the aberration28 as the labor market tightened and health insurance costs rose over the course of the decade companies may have offered such things as flexible work schedules telecommuting and benefits to lure free agents onto payrolls29 between 1991 and 1997 for example the proportion of fulltime wage and salary workers with flexible schedules almost doubled rising from 15 to 2830 the robust economic times also may have dampened business starts because fewer people worried about losing or actually lost their payroll jobs31 for example in 1998 when the national unemployment rate was low 45 only 145 of people who started businesses said they did so because they had been laid off or feared that might happen32 selfemployment thus far into the current decade has been much more substantial contributor to net job growth than during the 1990s and exceeds its shares during the 1970s and 1980s the net addition of 139000 selfemployed persons from 2000 to 2003 accounted for over 13 of nonfarm job gains reasons for entering selfemployment from unemployment arguably some workers who lose wage and salary jobs when few are being created such as during periodic nationwide areawide or industrywide slowdowns or during prolonged geographic or industrial declines become discouraged about getting hired by companies and try to earn money by starting their own firms in the case of cyclical events this might have occurred after the last two national recessions businesses did not add workers to their payrolls for such long time 28 david leonhardt selfemployment on the decline new

recoveries33 for example an analysis of the new england economy found that during and after the 19901991 recession employment in the region contracted household survey data showed somewhat smaller decrease in employment than establishment survey data and the only group to report increased employment was the selfemployed34 recent empirical study of us men aged 21 and older in the 19791998 period concluded that dearth of wage and salary job opportunities pushes workers into selfemployment35 another analysis estimated that the unincorporated self employed in particular are sensitive with lag to local economic conditions the unincorporated presumably because incorporation can be costly and would be less attractive to persons who regard working for oneself as way station between salaried jobs with lag because it takes time to start business the economists model explained almost the entire increase in selfemployment that occurred since the 2001 recession began they speculated that many of these new businesses are likely to disappear when the wage and salary sector improves36 there is an ongoing debate among researchers however about whether high unemployment acts to discourage selfemployment because of the lack of available opportunities or encourage it because of the lack of viable alternatives37 demographic and economic factors beyond current labor market conditions affect the propensity of job losers among others to become entrepreneurs displaced workers age and prior household wealth were estimated to increase the probability of entering selfemployment38 other studies found that among women the likelihood of selfemployment increased if there were young children in the family and if there was selfemployed spouse who could serve as role model and who could provide capital for his wifes business venture39 in addition the independence and higher anticipated earnings of selfemployment are job characteristics that appeal to some individuals40 33 for more

unemployment why become self employed oxford bulletin of economics and statistics vol 58 2 may 1996 crs12 selfemployment as an alternative work arrangement an examination of independent contractors might shed additional light on the selfemployed particularly if as previously mentioned there may be some misidentification in the monthly cps of the selfemployed as wage and salary workers additionally the definition of independent contractor that bls developed may accord more with the current perception of what it means to be selfemployed eg computer consultants and freelance writers as opposed to retail store and restaurant owners from february 1995 to february 2001 bls collected statistics biennially on alternative work arrangements through questions that supplemented the basic cps questionnaire independent contractors also known as independent consultants and freelancers obtain customers on their own to whom they provide good or service the designation of selfemployed or wage and salary worker according to the basic cps questionnaire is irrelevant in the determination of who is in an alternative work arrangement41 thus almost 9 out of 10 independent consultants are unincorporated and incorporated selfemployed while the remainder are wage and salary workers42 there were almost 86 million independent contractors who accounted for 64 of total farm and nonfarm employment in february 2001 this does not differ much from the 91 million unincorporated business owners who accounted for 68 of nonfarm employment for all of 2001 as shown in table 2 which is not surprising because about half of all selfemployed persons incorporated and unincorporated farm and nonfarm said they were independent consultants since the supplementary questions were first asked independent consultants have been the largest of the four nontraditional worker groups most recently comprising little under 70 of the total the other groups are temporary help agency workers oncall workers and workers provided by contract firms traditional jobs are any that do not fall into the four other categories43 41 all individuals who respond affirmatively to the basic cps question about self employment regardless of whether they are unincorporated or incorporated are asked whether they consider themselves to be selfemployed as independent contractors independent consultants or freelance workers in order to distinguish them from those who operate establishments eg retail stores individuals who respond affirmatively to the basic cps question about wage and salary employment also are asked whether they very recently had been working as independent contractors independent consultants or freelance workers 42 bls contingent and alternative employment arrangements february 2001 may 24 2001 hereafter cited as bls contingent and alternative employment arrangements 43 ibid note oncall workers typically drawn from pool of qualified individuals are called in to work only when needed eg substitute teachers and construction workers supplied by union hiring hall employees of contract companies typically are provided to work at just one firm and to work on that firms premises for information on temporary help agency workers see crs report rl30072 temporary workers as members of the contingent labor force by linda levine crs13 worker preferences and job insecurity unlike others in nontraditional jobs most independent contractors more than four out of five have said they prefer to be their own boss the great majority at least three out of four give personal reasons for wanting to be freelancers eg flexible schedules and family obligations rather than economic reasons eg only type of work available44 the labor market prospects of independent contractors seemingly temper their preference for the work arrangement45 thus compared to the group overall fewer of those who recently had been laid off preferred freelancing nonetheless majority 662 of persons who lost jobs in the three years before being reemployed as consultants in february 1995 preferred their alternative to traditional employment the high rate of satisfaction among those who conceivably might have involuntarily become independent contractors through downsizing or some other job loss following the 19901991 recession is consistent with anecdotal evidence which indicates that while these workers may not have been happy to have lost their previous wage and salary positions they still would prefer not to return to situation in which they would be company employee instead these individuals may find that being an independent contractor affords them more job security than being someone elses employee does46 indeed fairly few independent consultants consider themselves to be in an insecure or contingent work arrangement ie one that is not expected to be longlasting when the economy was expanding vigorously toward the end of the 1990s and firms were competing intensely to hire employees the already small share of freelancers who believed their jobs were insecure shrank further 38 in 1995 35 in 1997 and 29 in 199947 as shown in table 3 the incidence of job insecurity

month before the official start of the latest recession the rate of job insecurity for consultants rose sharply to still low 41 the increase for the group as whole may reflect decrease in satisfaction with selfemployment reported by one segment namely independent contractors in wage and salary jobs48 in contrast job insecurity among those with traditional jobs fell slightly as it did to varying

source us bureau of labor statistics data from the alternative work arrangement supplement to the current population survey during the tightening labor market that encompassed the february 1995 through february 2001 survey periods most independent consultants appear to have had good reason to perceive their situations as secure they reported both the longest median tenure of workers in alternative arrangements and longer tenure than workers in traditional arrangements in february 2001 for example the typical freelancer had been hisher own boss for 81 years while the typical traditional worker had held hisher job for 44 years as in the past the tenure gap was wider between male contractors 101 years and male traditional workers 48 years compared to female contractors 60 years and female traditional workers 40 years reflecting the older profile of male contractors49 earnings the relative pay of workers in alternative jobs is estimated to positively affect the preference for nontraditional employment50 the median weekly earnings of independent consultants employed fulltime in 2001 was 644 well above workers 48 jeffrey wenger share of workers in nonstandard jobs declines economic policy institute undated note although bls also included these individuals in the independent contractor group it did not report separate findings for the relatively small subset hereafter cited as wenger share of workers in nonstandard jobs declines 49 unpublished data from the feb 2001 cps supplement on alternative work arrangements 50 marler and milkovich determinants of preference for contingent employment crs15 in all other alternative arrangements except employees of firms that provide onsite services to other companies 79051 earlier surveys show independent contractors had higher median weekly earnings than workers in traditional employment arrangements in 1999 the latest period for which such comparison can be made freelancers employed fulltime had median weekly earnings of 640 100 or 19 greater than fulltime workers in traditional jobs52 these earnings disparities are associated with individual and job characteristics compared to traditional workers independent contractors like the unincorporated selfemployed previously described generally are older they also more often are white males and college graduates who typically put in long hours in addition some occupations in which consultants are disproportionately employed are relatively highpaying eg executive administrative and managerial positions while the typical male freelancer employed fulltime earned more than males in traditional jobs during the second half of the 1990s the typical female freelancer earned less than her counterpart in traditional job53 an analysis comparing the hourly wage of nonstandard workers and regular fulltime workers and taking into account these personal and job characteristics estimated that all selfemployed independent contractors female independent contractors in wage and salary jobs and other male selfemployed eg store owners earned statistically significant wage premium in contrast other selfemployed women suffered statistically significant wage penalty compared to regular fulltime working women54 51 bls contingent and alternative employment arrangements 52 dinatale characteristics of and preferences for alternative work arrangements note the direction and extent of earnings differences appears to be sensitive to the definition of selfemployment and to the measure of earnings for example an analysis based upon survey of income and program participation from the mid1980s found that the typical unincorporated and incorporated male small business owner aged 1865 excluding farmers and highly paid professionals such as doctors and lawyers earned less than the typical paid employee the width of the pay gap depended upon the measure of earnings utilized see barton h hamilton does

54 wenger share of workers in nonstandard jobs declines note this analysis of the alternative worker supplement to the cps categorized the groups differently than bls regular fulltime workers were defined as wage and salary workers employed at least 35 hours week and not included in other arrangements called nonstandard eg regular parttime workers whom bls does not consider to be in alternative arrangements are defined as wage and salary workers employed fewer than 35 hours week and not included in the other nonstandard arrangements temporary help agency workers oncall workers day laborers and contract company workers whose definition unlike that of bls does not require employment at the client firms workplace the analysis includes as nonstandard those persons who reported themselves as selfemployed including shop or restaurant owners it further distinguishes between independent contractors who said they very continued crs16 more independent contractors than those in traditional work arrangements are employed parttime 248 and 168 respectively in 2001 this too may be related to demographic and job characteristics the share of freelancers at least 65 years old has been about three times the share of traditional workers most recently 79 and 26 respectively55 as previously noted members of this age group could choose to bridge their fulltime salaried careers and their nonwork years by consulting for few hours week in addition female independent contractors are more likely than female traditional employees to be raising preschool children which may partly explain why over three times the share of adult female than male freelancers are employed parttime by choice56 relatively more adult male consultants than male traditional workers are employed parttime for economic reasons ie slack work poor business conditions or unable to find fulltime jobs which may be partly linked to the formers greater presence in industries with work weeks over which they have little control eg agriculture and construction57 benefits as with earnings workers provided by contract companies have the highest rate of health insurance coverage 801 among persons in alternative work arrangements independent contractors again come in second with 725 having health benefits in 2001 this contrasts with the larger percentage of traditional workers who have health care coverage 83158 freelancers may obtain health benefits by independently purchasing policies or through spouses employer provided plan indeed it appears that the availability of health insurance coverage through spouse is positively associated with becoming selfemployed59 other consultants may have previously worked for companies that extend health benefits to retirees the situation is quite different when it comes to retirement benefits as might be expected just 23 of independent contractors had pension coverage through their employers compared to almost 583 of traditional workers in 200160 some 384 of freelancers had established individual retirement accounts iras or keogh plans about threefourths of independent consultants were employed fulltime in 54 continued recently had been on firms payroll

2001 and minority of these individuals had pension coverage through their employers 25 or through iras and keogh plans 381 misclassification of independent contractors whether individuals are considered to be employees of business or working for themselves has important consequences under employment labor and tax laws61 for example as result of an internal revenue service irs audit of microsoft in 1989 and 1990 the corporation had to pay withholding taxes on the salaries of freelancers whom the irs determined to be common law employees62 independent contractors who worked for microsoft between 1987 and 1990 then brought suit against the firm attesting that as employees they should have been eligible for benefits eg group health and life insurance vacation and sick leave defined contribution 401k pension plan and stock purchase plan the district court denied the plaintiffs claims on appeal of the decision concerning eligibility only for the 401k and stock option plans the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit held in vizcaino v microsoft corporation 97 f3d 1187 9th cir 1996 that the contractors were common law employees and therefore entitled to participate in their employers plans63 that decision was vacated and the case was reheard by the full court of appeals on the rehearing banc the court affirmed the panel decision that the workers were common law employees and that microsofts reasons for rejecting the workers participation in the two plans were invalid however the court remanded the decision about whether the workers were covered by the 401k plan to the plan administrator for determination in accordance with the terms of the plan and remanded the decision as to the appropriate remedy for excluding the workers from the stock pension plan to the district court vizcaino v microsoft corporation 120 f3d 1006 9th cir 1997 cert denied 522 us 1098 1998 ultimately after several further appeals and remands the parties reached courtapproved settlement the result leaves the question of whether misclassified employees are covered under an employers benefit plans subject in part to the plans definition of coverage and to the outcome of litigation as other courts have reached different conclusions64 61 for information on class of worker status see crs electronic briefing book taxation page on worker classification issues employees
