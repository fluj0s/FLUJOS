proposal th engovernor bush made during the presidential campaign its principal components are reduction in marginal individual income tax rates an increased child ta x credit tax cut for married couples elimination of the estate and gift tax permanent research and experimentation tax credit charitable contribution deduction for non itemizers and several tax benefits for health care and education tax cuts similar to the presiden ts have been considered by congress over the past several years but were not enacte d in part because of opposition by the clinton administration in march 2001 specific tax cut legislation along the lines of the bush program began to move through the house as set of standalone bills and by early may the house had passed bills containing mu ch of the presidents proposal on may 23 the full senate approved an omnibus bill including similar tax cuts conference committee version of the tax cuts hr 1836 was approved by th house and senate on may 26 it was signed into law on june 7 and became pl 10716 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 this report will not be updated for detailed comparison of the presiden ts proposal and

presidents proposal can be inferred from the estimated impact it would have on federal revenues based on the revenue estimates the centerpiece of president bushs tax proposal is its reduction of marginal individual income tax rates in the proposals tent h year by which time each of the proposals provisions would be fully phased in the re duction in tax rates w ould account for 43 of the plans

were repealed before they went into effect the estimates here are for ertas initial provisions both the revenue estimates for erta and the projected revenue estimates from the feb 1982 congressional

budget office the budget and economic outlook fiscal 20022011 washington jan 2001expansion of the perchild tax credit accounting for 11 of the revenue loss1 thus these three provisions would account for ove r threequarters 77 of the proposals revenue loss when the plan is fully implemented the size of the tax cut can also be gaug ed by looking at its estimated revenue loss in several additional ways for exampl based on the admin istrations revenue estimates and economic projec tions by the congressional budget office when the proposal is fully phased in it would reduce federal receipts by about 75 of projected revenue an amount equal to 15 of gross domestic product gdp by comparison as it was initially enacted the economic recovery tax act of 1981 erta the large tax cut enacted at the beginning of the reagan administration was expected to reduce tax revenue in its fifth full year by 25 of revenue that was otherwise expected to accrue and by 6 of projected gdp see how ever the cautionary note below2 looking at the 1990s the net tax increase enacted by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 was anticipated to increase revenue by 4 of expected receipts by its fifth year 01 of gdp the net tax cut enacted by the taxpay er relief act of 1997 was expected to reduce revenue by 1 of receipts or 02 of gdp by its fifth year the vetoed taxpayer refund and relief act of 1999 was expected to reduce revenue by 5 of an ticipated revenues or 1 of gdp by the time it was fully phased in on the basis of these comparisons the re venue effect of the presidents proposal would be substantially smaller than that anticipated with ertas landmark tax cut but substantially larger than the revenue impact of the significant tax legislation of the past decade as cautionary note however er tas tax cut was enacted in somewhat different context than now exists the tax system was not indexed and inflation was pushing some taxpayers into higher tax brack ets thus ertas tax cut preempted what would have been inflation induced tax increases for many taxpayers principal provisions again the largest component of the tax cut plan is its reduction in marginal tax rates that the tax code applies to taxable income under current law there are five tax rates that increase as taxable income increases the current rates are 15 28 31 36 and 396 the bush plan would replace th is structure with four tax rates in general the plan would separate the lowest bracket into two parts with 10 rate applying to the first 12000 for joint returns 6000 for singles and retaining 15 rate for the rest of the bracket the plan would consolidate the next four brackets into twohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20819crs3 3 information on the content of the presidents proposal is from an administration

compares the proposed new structure with that of current law for married couples3 in using the table note that the tax rates listed under the proposal are those that would be effective when the plan is fully phased in which would not occur until 2006 however the tax brackets shown in the table are those applicable to 2001 because current law adjusts the rate brackets each year to reflect inflation the actual dollar amount of the brackets will likely be different in 2006 note that the tax rates in the table are marginal rates that is they apply to increments of income taxpayer earns within the corresponding income bracket increments of taxpayers income corres ponding to lower brackets are taxed at lower marginal rates increments corre sponding to higher brackets are taxed at higher rates for example if single taxpayer earns 70000 of taxable income under current law 27050 of his income would be taxed at 15 38500 ie 65500 minus 27050 would be taxed at 28 and 4450 woul d be

deduct 10 of the lowerearne rs income up to maximum of 3000 in doing so the proposal would reinstate provision similar to one that was enacted by erta in 1981 but that was repealed by the tax reform act of 1986 the proposed deduction would reduce and in some cases eliminate current laws socalled marriage tax penalty that results in some couples payi ng more taxes than an unmarried couple with an

bush supports other proposals to increase charitable giving5 the presidents plan would make current laws research and experimentation tax credit permanent under current law the credit is equal to 20 of firms research spending above base amount the provisi on was first enacted in 1981 but has always been temporary and has been scheduled to expire but extended on numerous occasions most recently

presidential campaign th engovernor bush advanced several arguments supporting his tax cut proposal the arguments were based on both philosophical and economic grounds philosophi cally governor bush stated his belief that high taxes are linked with large govern ment economically he argued that reduced taxes are linked with longterm economic grow th because they stimulate work effort saving and entrepreneurship belief reflected in the plans emphasis on cutting marginal tax rates6 in december 2000 during the period between the election and his inauguration presidentelect bush advanced an additional justification for tax cut to provide an economic stimulus to an economy that had begun to show signs of slowing down in testimony before the senate budget committee federal reserve chairman greenspan offered qualified support for tax cut suppor t based on his negative view of extensive government holding of private liabilities that large surpluses would bring7 m n economists however are skeptical of the effectiveness of tax cut as shortrun countercyclical economic stimulus compared to monetary policy there are several reasons first there are considerable time lags between the time the need for stimulus is recognized and the time tax cut has its stimulative effect thus economic conditions may have changed by the time tax cuts effects begin to take hold second some economists believe that adjustments occur in private markets that c ounter and offset the effects of government ta xing and spending policy8 and finally the increasing openness of the us economy means that intern ational adjustments may well reduce the stimulative effect of fiscal policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20819crs6 9 for discussions of the impact of taxes on labor supply and saving respectively

httpwwwbrookeduviewsop2d edgale200101295fresponsehtmas well as shortrun effects that may or may not impinge on the business cycle tax cuts can affect longrun economic growth and economic efficiency and mr bush has argued for his plan partly on these grounds the centerpiece of the tax cut the reduction in marginal tax rates is indeed likely to improve economic efficiency on balance according to economic theory taxes are more economically efficient the less they distort economic decisions and behavior and the lower are marginal tax rates the less distorting taxes are othe r factors remaining constant the plans impact on longrun growth is ss certain it depends heavily on the tax rate cuts impact on labor supply and saving by itself economic theory provides clear answer on whether either labor supply or saving respond to tax cuts in general people may save or work less in response to tax cut because their aftertax income has increased and they need to work or save less to purchase desired items or they may save or work more because the aftertax return to saving or working has increased it therefore falls to empirical evidence to indicate the impact of taxes while results of studies vary most suggest the impact of taxes on work and saving is small further tax cut that reduces the federal budget surplu s would reduce government saving and as result aggregate national saving which may reduce economic growth9 another prominent issue in the current deba concerns the tax cut proposals equity the plans critics including many democrats have argued that the specific form of the presidents tax cut is unfair nd favors highincome individuals10 another issue in the taxcut debate has been its impact on the budget president bush has stated that his tax cut plan will not endanger the fiscal soundness of the social security and medicare programs indeed th anticipated revenue loss from the tax plan absorbs less than the expected offbudget surp lus ie the surplus in the social security trust fund at the same time however cr itics have argued that the surpluses are uncertain and even if they materialize the proposed tax cut would absorb much of the on budget surplus leading to cuts in government programs11 they further state that tax cut that reduces the projected budget surplu ses would likely advance the future point in time at which social security and medicare payments to retiring baby boomers pull the federal budget back into deficit
