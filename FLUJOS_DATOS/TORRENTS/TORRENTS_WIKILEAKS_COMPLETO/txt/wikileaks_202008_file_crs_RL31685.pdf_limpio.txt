unrecognized in senate rules or precedents they allow senators to give notice to their respective party leader that certain measures or matters should not be brought up on the floor implicit in the practice is that senator will object to taking up bill or nomination on which he or she has placed hold the senates majority leader who exercises primary responsibility for determining the chambers agenda traditionally in consultation with the minority leader is the final arbiter as to whether and for how long he will honor hold placed by member or group of lawmakers the origin of holds has been lost in the mists of history their ostensible purpose is to provide advance notice to senators as to when measure or matter in which they have expressed an interest by placing holds is slated to be called up by the majority leader however since the 1970s holds came into greater prominence in the senate as more members began to employ holds as way to try to accomplish their policy or political objectives in senate with large and complex workload and more dependent than ever on unanimous consent agreements to process its expanding business holds provide significant leverage to members who wish to delay action on legislati on or nominations given the heightened potency of holds there have been many initiatives over the years to reform the senates hold practices this report examines over more than three decade period wide range of proposals to reform holds in general the objective of these recommendations is not to abolish holds but to infuse more accountability uniformity and transparency in their use and to make it clear that holds are not veto on the majority leaders prerogative of calling up measures or matters the historical record underscores that it has been difficult to revise practice now regular feature of the senates workways that provides parliamentary influence and leverage to every senator the reform proposals examined are as follows 1 impose time

senator charles grassley riowa is notice by senator to his or her party leader of an intention to object to bringing bill or nomination to the floor for consideration1 hold is an informal custom of the senate which is neither recognized in the senates formal rules nor in its precedents as former majority leader howard baker rtenn 19811985 pointed out senators are aware of course that holds on both calendars the calendar of general orders and the calendar of executive business are matters of courtesy by the leadership on both sides of the aisle and are not part of the standing rules of the senate 2 in general senators place holds on measures or matters by writing letter to their party leader requesting delay in floor consideration of these propositions holds according to one account can be placed on virtually all matters including nominations3 although scheduling the senates business is the prime prerogative of the majority leader the democratic and republican leaders consult constantly about the floor agenda each notes on his copy of the senate calendar the names of party colleagues who have placed holds on legislation or nominations the majority leader can still act to call up such measures or matters but he also recognizes that holds are linked to the senates tradition of extended debate and reliance on unanimous consent agreements any senator whose hold is not honored has an array of parliamentary resources that he or she might employ to cause gridlock in an institution that is usually workload packed and deadline driven top floor aides to each leader assist in keeping track of democratic or republican holds inform ation on who places holds is closely held by the two party leaders and generally not made available to the public this circumstance means that compared to other parliamentary features of the senate rather little is known about the chambers system of holds such as who places them senat ors of course may publicly disclose that they have holds on measures or matters how often they are employed and whether the two parties use different hold procedures the ostensible purpose of holds is to provide advance notice to senators as to when measure or matter in which they have expressed an interest is slated to be called up by the majority leader the origins of the practice are unclear and lost in the mists of history the practice probably emerged from features long associated with the senate such as its emphasis on minority and individual interests the informality and flexibility of its procedures and legislative culture that encourages accommodation for individual senators policy and personal goals holds appeared to become widespread during and after the 1970s as the senate changed from the communitarian institution of the 1950s and 1960swhere senators were expected to serve an apprenticeship defer to an inner club of seniority leaders and exercise restraint in using rules to gain procedural advantageto todays individualistic and more partisan senate where independentminded members are not reluctant to exploit rules precedents and customs for their parliamentary benefit 4 as congressional scholar noted by the late 1970s holds became serious impediment to moving measures to the floor5 1 congressional record daily edition vol 148 april 17 2002 p s2850 2 congressional record daily edition vol 128 december

agreements to move an expanding volume of legislation also contributed to the heightened potency of holds6 holds are now prominent feature of todays senate because assertive senators recognize the political and policy potential inherent in this socalled silent filibuster only senators may place holds but they may do so at the request of house members lobbyists or executive officials senate staff have also been known to place holds on behalf of their member today holds are often used to stall action on legislation or nominations in order to extract concessions from other senators or the administration they are also employed to take hostages senators may delay bills or nominations which they do not oppose so they might gain political or procedural leverage to achieve other extraneous objectives there have been times said then senate gop leader trent lott miss when holds have been applied to every piece of committees legislationby an individual or group of senators not because they wish to be involved in consideration of those bills but as means of achieving unrelated purposes or leverage 7 from being courtesy to keep senators informed about impending action on measures or matters holds have evolved to become parliamentary weapon for stalling or obstructing floor decision making there are holds on holds on holds there are so many holds it looks like mud wrestling match exclaimed senate democratic leader tom daschle sd near the close of the 104th congress on another occasion senator daschle jokingly observed that holds on executive nominees are so common that if senators does not have one he or she ought to feel lonely you know whos your holder that seems to be the question of ev ery nominee its almost status symbol among senators i have holds im going to have to pick out nominee to get to know him or her lot better it works that way hello im your holder come dance with me8 an important virtue of holds was noted by robert dove former parliamentarian of the senate they are in many ways favor to the leadership by letting them know how senators feel about bill he said it lets them know how to plan their time9 holds too may sometimes be employed by senators not to block measures or matters but to impose temporary delay to accommodate their scheduling preferences g20g142g143g152g155g150g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561 since the 1970s

notifications the leadership policy stated over period of time the democratic and republican leadership have developed system by which senators ask the leaders to consult them regarding reservations or problems with particular legislation these notifications are commonly called holds the leaders will find it necessary to schedule matters on which senators have requested consultation when it is necessary to consider an issue any senator with an interest should be prepared to be on the floor to defend his or her interest in order to develop common understanding of what notifications mean the leaders have agreed on the following principles 1 it is the responsibility of every senator to notify his or her respective leader in writing about any need to consult with that senator on bill or nomination this notification should be made in timely fashion each leader will develop his own notification system 2 the leaders will respect the confidentiality of communications from senators however in order to facilitate the scheduling of legislation senators who ask to be consulted prior to the scheduling of bill or nomination should be prepared to discuss the issue with the relevant committee chairman andor ranking member or sponsor of the measure the leaders will encourage this type of consultation between senators prior to floor consideration 3 the leaders will give as much advance notification as possible to any senator who has asked to be consulted prior to the scheduling of legislation and nominations whenever possible the leaders will announce specific time for unanimous consent request to go to matter any senator wishing to object to unanimous consent request to go to legislation or to be involved in the arrangements under which measure will be considered should be on the floor at the announced time 19 senator mitchell emphasized that every senator is entitled to reasonable time to prepare for legislation or to consult with nominee but senator cannot

lott sent dear colleague letter to all members informing them that he was instituting new policy on holds he discussed two changes that he planned to implement on trial basis during the 105 th congress first hold must be specific i will not honor holds on blocks of legislation on the work of an entire committee or on that of specific senator or group of senators senator lott also stated that after senator or someone acting on his or her behalf receives precise notification as to when matter is slated for floor action he may have to come to the floor to express his objection after being notified of the intention to move the matter to which he objects second senator lott said i am hereby establishing an order that matter on which the leadership has been notified of hold will be cleared after 700 pm or the more votes announcement has been made whichever is later emphasis in original he explained that relinquishing the option of clearing the calendar late at night is necessary tradeoff for the right to demand that hold be restored to its original purpose notification of likely uc with latenight wrapup discontinued i can emphasis in original reasonably expect senators to come to the floor once their request for notification has been honored 24 part of the apparent reason for these changes was senator lotts desire to infuse greater certainty and predictability into the

despite the 1985 revision senators still complain about secret holds senators ron wyden d ore and charles grassley riowa took the lead to make all holds public in 1997 for example they were successful in amending district of columbia appropriations bill to establish new standing order of the senate it stated it is standing order of the senate that senator who provides notice to leadership of his or her intention to object to proceeding to motion or matter shall disclose the objection hold in the congressional record not later than 2 session days after the date of said notice28 the wydengrassley amendment was dropped in conference but the two senators voluntarily continued their practice of announcing publicly and within 48 hours their own use of holds the two senators continued their negotiations with republican leader lott and democratic leader daschle to work out way to end secret holds shortly after the start of the 106th congress senators lott and daschle jointly informed all senators in dear colleague letter printed in the congressional record of march 3 1999 of new policy regarding holds as the two party leaders wrote at the beginning of the first session of the 106th congress all members wishing to place hold on any legislation or executive calendar business shall notify the sponsor of the legislation and the committee of jurisdiction of their concerns further written notification should be provided to the respective leader stating their intentions regarding the bill or nomination holds placed on items by member of personal or committee staff will not be honored unless accompanied by written notification from the objecting senator by the end of the following business day however there was enforcement mechanism associated with this policy and secret

the measure number of scholars and former secretary of the senate testified before the rules and administration committee the witnesses examined the potential positive and negative effects of adopting sres 151 and suggested several ways to alter the senates informal practice of holds the suggestions for change included limiting or prohibiting debate on the motion to proceed requiring three to five senators to object to unanimous consent request to call up measure or to limit debate or amendments and devising special procedures to circumvent holds placed by only one or few members such as establishing weekly suspension procedure for taking up and agreeing to bills or nominations by twothirds vote almost six months later on november 7 2003 the majority and minority leaders sent dear

hold notify the bills sponsor and notify the senior party member on the jurisdictional committee if this policy is not observed they wrote then we will disclose the hold to the senior committee member of our respective party and to the legislations sponsor if member of our respective party upon inquiry from such individuals the two party leaders added that the purpose of these limiteddisclosure

establishing new standing order of the senate their amendment required the majority and minority leaders to recognize holdcalled notice of intent to object to proceedingonly if it was provided in writing by member of their caucus moreover noted former party leader for the hold to be honored the senator objecting would have to publish his objection in the congressional record 3 days after the notice is provided to leader 34 one of the principal authors of the amendment provided this explanation of their proposal our proposed standing order would provide that simple form be filled out much like we do when we add cosponsors to bill senators would have full 3 session days from placing the hold to submit the form to their respective party leader the hold would then be published in the congressional record and the senate calendar it is just as simple as that 35 s 2349 required enactment into law before the new holds policy could take effect but the 109th congress adjourned before

september 14 2007 president george w bush signed into law the honest leadership and open government act s 1 section 512 of title v of the law pl 11081 specifically dealt with the issue of secret holds the fundamental purpose of section 512 titled notice of objecting to proceeding is to promote more openness and transparency in the holds process section 512 is neither senate rules change nor standing order of the senate except as to the requirement that the secretary of the senate establish in the two senate calendars general orders and executive separate section identifying the senator who filed notice of intent to object the measure or matter the senator objects to and the date the objection was filed section 512 however is directive to the majority and minority leaders of the senate stating that before hold is recognized by them certain procedures must be observed by senators in effect it is the responsibility of each member to comply with the terms of the new policy there is enforcement device or method to ensure compliance except the stipulation that party leaders shall not honor notice of intent or hold if senators do not follow the specified procedures 34

hold public36 they are the process begins when any senator states that he or she on behalf of colleague is objecting to unanimous consent requestcommonly made by the majority leader or majority floor managerto proceed to or pass measure or matter that colleague must then submit notice of intent or hold letter to the appropriate party leader or their designee specifying the reasons for his or her objections to certain measure or matter not later than six session days after submission of the notice of intent letter the senator placing the hold submits the notice to be printed in the congressional record and in separate section of the appropriate calendar the majority leader and the minority leader or their respective designee are then obliged to recognize hold placed by member of their caucus recognition does not mean that the majority leaderwho schedules the senates businessmust honor the hold senator may withdraw his or her hold prior to the expiration of the 6session day period he or she is then under obligation to have their hold letter printed in the congressional record and noted in the appropriate senate calendar to remove their hold from the appropriate senate calendar senator submits notice for inclusion in the congressional record stating that he or she longer objects to proceeding to measure or matter it is useful to note that senator who publicly objects on his or her own behalf to unanimous consent request to proceed to or pass measure need not follow the section 512 process the disclosure has occurred publicly and members know who is the objector thus the name of the objector would not be required to be published in the congressional record or the appropriate calendar of the senate

g343g343g561political scientist steven smith also testified before the 1993 joint committee he too urged change in the holds system professor smith said the senate should reduce the bite of holds by making it more difficult for single senator to object to floor leaders request to call up measure limit debate or limit amendments the objections of at least five senators should be required in order to block such request if this were done along with curbs on obstructionist quorum calls the disruption caused by petty personalistic use of holds would be reduced 39 1996 twentieth century fund task

chairman of the 1993 joint committee suggested an indirect way to address holds during senator exons testimony before the panel he proposed elimination of debate on the motion to call up legislation if we abolish that we have gone long way to diffusing the validity of holds because hold is predicated on the fact that you cant get bill up without filibuster and if you take that away from the inception and then establish some kind of guidelines for holds i think that we will be moving in the right direction 42 another indirect way to soften the delaying potential of holds was proposed in 1965 by senator joseph s clark dpa he recommended that the senate adopt threehour rule whenever senator has held the floor for more than three consecutive hours an objection to his continued possession of the floor if made by any senator would compel him to yield the floor43

associated with this course of action for example when robert dole became the new majority leader in 1985 he wanted to rein in the use of holds at the outset of his tenure his plan was to roll senators who had holds and call up those measures or matters for floor action he soon found it easier said than done the risk of telling senators with holds that the leader was going forward with the bill in question was to invite doublebarrelled filibusteron the motion to proceed and the bill itself once session gets beyond the summer recess the remaining time is extremely valuable and is more likely to be the target of filibusterers with the diminishing time for the majority leader to meet his agenda and establish his partys record he must think twice about trying to roll anybody 45 party leaders may also view holds as less than sacrosanct as legislative circumstances change such as the approach of deadlines for instance on december 6 1982 majority leader baker stated on the floor in these final two weeks holds will be honored only sparingly and under the most urgent circumstances g21g158g150g150g138g155g162g561g17g139g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 there are many observations that can be made about holds but six may be especially pertinent first although holds are not formally recognized in the senates standing rules or precedents they are an increasingly important feature of the contemporary senate although little known outside the senate they have attracted wider attention from scholars journalists and pundits second repeated efforts to reform the system of holds demonstrate that such initiatives are neither easy to accomplish nor to enforce third senators recognize that holds provide them with leverage to influence the senates agenda they may be reluctant to change practices associated with holds because unexpected consequences might reduce their overall personal influence in the senate fourth the majority leader is ultimately responsible for deciding whether to honor hold and for how long party leaders often advocate revisions of this practice but they also recognize that holds alert them to potential problems in scheduling measures or matters fifth holds appear to be used more frequently by todays senators in part because they seem more willing than many of their predecessors to assert parliamentary prerogatives changes in the broader political environment such as the increase in the number of interest groups also may create additional incentives for the apparent heightened use of holds finally holds allow senators to be consulted on matters of importance to them such as winning recognition in unanimous consent agreement to speak for longer period of time than other senators or to offer certain nonrelevant amendments
