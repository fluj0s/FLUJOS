employees who engage in whistleblowing that is making disclosure evidencing illegal or improper government activities the protections of the wpa apply to most federal executive branch employees and become applicable when personnel action is taken because of protected disclosure made by covered employee generally whistleblower protections may be raised within four forums or proceedings 1 employee appeals to the merit systems protection board of an agencys adverse action against an employee known as chapter 77 appeals 2 actions instituted by the office of special counsel 3 individually maintained rights of action before the merit systems protection board known as an individual right of action or ira and 4 grievances brought by the employee under negotiated grievance procedures when congress first enacted the whistleblower pr otection act wpa in 1989 it stated that the intent of the legislation was to strengthen and improve protection for the rights of federal employees to prevent reprisals and to help eliminate wrongdoing within the government by1 mandating that employees should not suffer adverse consequences as re sult of prohibited personnel practices and 2 establishing that while disciplining those who commit prohibited personnel practices may be used as means by which to help accomplish that goal the protection of individuals who are the subject of prohibited personnel practices remains the paramount consideration 1 the operative statutory protections of the wpa are embodied in its definition of prohibited personnel practices 2302 prohibited personnel practices b any employee who has authority to take direct others to take recommend or approve any personnel action shall not with respect to such authority 8 take or fail to take or threaten to take or fail to take personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidencesi violation of any law rule or regulation or ii gross mismanagement gross waste of funds an abuse of authority or substantial and specific danger to public health or safety if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law and if such information is not specifically required by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs or b any disclosure to the special counsel or to the inspector general of an agency or another employee designated by the head of the agency to receive such disclosures of information which the employee or applicant r easonably believes evidencesi violation of any law rule or regulation or ii gross mismanagement gross waste of funds an abuse of authority or substantial

the following elements personnel action that was taken because of protected disclosure made by covered employee 3 g5g152g159g142g155g142g141g561g7g150g153g149g152g162g142g142g156g561 although anyone may disclose whistleblowing info rmation to the special counsel for referral to the appropriate agency the special counsel may order an investigation and require report from the head of the agency only if the information is received from covered employee in addition with few exceptions prohibited personnel practices apply only to covered employees hence as threshold matter it is important to note which federal employees are statutorily covered generally current employees former employees or applicants for employment to positions in the executive branch of government in both the competitive and the excepted service as well as positions in the senior executive service are considered covered employees4 however those positions that are excepted from the competitive service because of their confidential policy determining policymaking or policyadvocating character5 and any positions exempted by the president based on determination that it is necessary and warranted by conditions of good administration6 are not protected by the whistleblower statute moreover the statute does not apply to federal workers employed by the po stal service or the postal rate commission7 the government accountability office the federal bureau of investigation the central intelligence agency the defense intelligence agency the national imagery and mapping agency8 the national security agency and any other executive entity that the president determines primarily conducts foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities9

enactment of the wpa congress amended its statutory predece ssor the civil service reform act csra13 in so doing it changed the phrase disclosure to any disclosure emphasizing the point that the courts the osc and the mspb should not erect barriers to disclosures that will limit the necessary flow of information from employees with information of government wrongdoing14 in the committee report accompanying the wpa legislation the senate specifically criticized 1986 decision by the us court of appeals for the federal circuit fiorello v department of justice 15 where an employees disclosures were found not to be protected because the employees primary motivation was not for the public good but rather was for personal reasons16 the court reached this conclusion despite lack of any indication in the civil service reform act that employee motives were relevant to deciding whether disclosure is protected17 following enactment of the wpa in 1989 case law did not reflect the statutory expansion of disclosure to any disclosure this lack of responsiveness by the courts and the mspb was one factor prompting congress in 1994 to amend the whistleblower statute as the house report accompanying the 1994 amendments notes perhaps the most troubling precedents involve the boards inability to understand that any means any the wpa protects any disclosure evidencing reasonable belief of specified misconduct cornerstone to which the mspb re mains blind the only restrictions are for classified information or material the release of which is specifically prohibited by statute employees must disclose that type of information through confidential channels to maintain protection otherwise there are exceptions 18

evidence i violation of any law rule or regulation or ii gross mismanagement gross waste of funds an abuse of authority or substantial and specific danger to public health or safety and b not be prohibited by law or executive order except when the disclosure is made to the special counsel or to the inspector general of an agency or another employee designated by the head of the agency to receive such disclosures 21 the wpa limits evidence of mismanagement to only gross mismanagement as explained in the accompanying senate report while the committee is concerned about improving the protection of whistleblowers it is also concerned about the exhaustive administrative and judicial remedies provided under s 508 that could be used by employees who have made disclosures of trivial matters csra specifically established minimis standard for disclosures affecting the waste of funds by defining such disclosures as protected only if they involved gross waste of funds under s 508 the committee establishes similar minimis standard for disclosures of mismanagement by protecting them only if they involve gross mismanagement 22 moreover whistleblowing disclosures that are made public must not contain information the disclosure of which is prohibited by law or which is prohibited by an executive order in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs23 disclosures that are otherwise protected disclosures may be made however regardless of statutory executive order secrecy requirements to the special counsel or to an in spector general of an agency or to an employee designated by the agency head to receive disclosures 24

construed to authorize the taking of any personnel action against an employee w ho discloses information to the congress 25 with this provision of the law congress sought to protect its right to receive even confidential information from federal employees without employee fear of reprisals the provision is intended to make clear that by placing limitations on the kinds of information any employee may publicly disclose without suffering reprisal there is not intent to limit the information an employee may provide to congress or to authorize reprisal against an employee for providing information to congress for example 18 usc 1905 20 id 21 2 usc 2302b8a 22 srept 100413 supra at 12 23 5 usc 2302b8 24 id 25 5 usc 2302b see also 5 usc 7211 providing that an employee is guaranteed the

the wpa protects employees from reprisals in the form of an agency taking or failing to take personnel action this encompasses broad range of actions by an agency having negative or adverse impact on the employee the statute specifically defines the term personnel action to include 11 areas of agency activity 2 for the purpose of this section personnel action means i an appointment ii promotion iii an action under chapter 75 of this title or other disciplinary or corrective action iv detail transfer or reassignment v reinstatement vi restoration vii reemployment viii performance evaluation

embrace significant actions or changes that in relation to an employees overall duties responsibilities or working conditions are inconsistent with his or her professional qualifications training grade or rank the conference report accompanying wpa provided detailed discussion of the types of actions that may fall within or be excluded from the final category of personnel actions to be covered under this provision personnel action must be significant but it need not be expected to result in reduction in pay or gr ade it must also be inconsistent with an employees salary or grade level thus for example if an individual is currently employed and assigned duties or responsibilities consistent with the individuals professional training or qualifications for the job it would constitute personnel action if the individual were detailed transferred or reassigned so that the employees new overall duties or responsibilities were inconsistent with the individuals professional training or qualifications or if an individual holding decisionmaking responsibilities or supervisory authority found that such responsibilities or authority were redu ced so that the employees responsibilities were inconsistent with his or her salary or grade level such an action could constitute personnel action within the meaning of this subsection this is not intended to interfere with managements authority to assign individuals in accordance with available work the priorities of the agency and the needs of the agency for individuals with particular skills or to establish supervisory

the wpa changed the csras definition of prohibited reprisals against whistleblowers in such manner that personnel actions taken because of protected conduct are prohibited rather than personnel actions taken as reprisal for protected conduct as the original statute provided the amendment was made because the phrase as reprisal for had been interpreted to require showing of an improper retaliatory motive on the part of the acting official29 indeed two disciplinary action cases decided prior to the enactment of the wpa starrett v special counsel30 and harvey v msp b 31 required employees to show proof of the acting officials state of mind these cases stand for the proposition that reprisal will not be found even if an agencys actions against an employee were based on factors arising from protected whistleblowing activities so long as the agency officials were motivated by valid management reasons and not by any intent to punish the employee 32 with the definition of because of congress intended that showing of the officials state of mind is longer required as stated in the senate report accompanying the wpa legislation regardless of the officials motives personnel actions against employees should quite simply not be based on protected activities such as whistleblowing33 the wpa also 28 hrept 951717 conference report1978 at 128 129130 reprinted in 1978
