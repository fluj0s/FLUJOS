soldiers detain wide variety of people includingenemy prisoners of war epws enemy combatants insurgents violent criminalsor even innocent bystanders temporarily caught up in the action many detaineesdiffer significantly from the traditional disciplined and uniformed epw populationtypical in operation desert storm many enemy combatants captured and detainedin the gwot are not uniformed military personnel many of them do not adhere tothe customary laws of war significant number are violent predatory andextremist enemy combatants may pose much greater security threat duringprocessing escorting and handling than do more traditional epws us and coalition forces may captureapprehend and detain persons because they pose threat to us or coalition interests because they violate the law or becausethey may provide valuable intelligence or evidence this mission referred to asdetainee operations is complex and dangerous and places soldiers in continuouscontact with large frequently hostile enemy population often for extendedperiods of time the mission which could be part of any units normal operationsmust be accomplished with care special efforts are required to collect criticalintelligence effectively preserve evidence and protect detainees from harm planning effectively for detainee operations from point of capture to the internment facility helps us forces properly handle and process detainees while reducing thepotential for detainee abuse effective plans and execution should provide soldierswith clear screening criteria to identify those who possess items or information ofintelligence value and identify those who pose greater security risk at the end ofthe day planning effectively will ensure that us forces have the information andevidence to make an informed decision on whether to release detain transfercustody or prosecute each detainee for official use only iiidetainee operations at the point of capturechapter 1 detainee operations at the point of capture what soldiers must know at the point of capture the point of capture poc is the most critical point in the detainee operations process the poc often requires soldiers to disarm search and guard detainees inan unsecured environment among other potential combatants or sympathizerssmall units at the poc will probably not have sufficient resources and manpower toprovide for large number of detainees but still must begin processing detaineeswhile awaiting the arrival of additional resources and transportation leaders andsoldiers at the poc may have to assess and balance the risks of providing securityagainst potential attack by other combatants or sympathizers in the area while atthe same time providing adequate security to control their detainees all soldiers participating in military operations must be prepared to process detainees actions at the poc where soldiers have care custody and control ofdetainees can directly affect the success of the mission and even have lastingimpact on us strategic military objectives the poc is where most incidents of detainee abuse occur it is at this moment immediately following enemy contact when emotions may run high and where asoldiers instinct is to gain immediate intelligence in an attempt to preventadditional casualties leaders and soldiers must maintain situational understandingand monitor unit and individual stress levels to reduce the potential for detaineeabuse and prevent violations of us military policy detainees pose significant operational risks that can hinder mission success in numerous ways 1 detainees captured during combat engagement will most likely have weapons with unused ammunition and explosives soldiers must disarm and secure detainees for official use only 1detainee operations at the point of capture 1 all persons captured detained interned or otherwise held in us armed forces custody during the course of conflict will be given humanitarian care and treatment from the moment they fall into the hands of us forces until final release or repatriation 4 the inhumane treatment of epw ci rp is prohibited and is not justified by the stress of combat or with deep provocation inhumane treatment is serious and punishable violation under international law and the uniform code of military justice ucmj c190from ar 1908 enemy prisoners of war retained personnel civilian internees and other detainees october 1997to ensure further harm is inflicted on themselves or friendly forces hostile detainees require greater control measures and may become resourceintensive 2 upon capturing detainees soldiers must monitor and control their own emotions and those of other friendly forces moments earlier the same detainees may havetried to kill the soldier or may have killed or wounded fellow soldier amidst thislevel of tension soldiers must rely on army values and strictly adhere to usmilitary policy and the published rules of engagement roe and the rules for useof force under circumstances can soldiers allow themselves or others toretaliate or otherwise permit harm to befall detainees under their control 3 us forces may capture from one to several dozen detainees in fact some operations may lead to the capture of hundreds of detainees at single place andtime while the holding of one or two detainees may not create significantchallenge to small unit more detainees will require more soldiers and resourceslarge numbers of detainees pose greater security risk to the unit as well as risks toeach other safeguarding detainees includes providing adequate space food andwater and waste disposal while protecting them against physical harm from anycause including hostile fire these tasks may require more security additionaltransport cause significant delays for onward movement and divert needed assetsfrom the units primary mission 4 wounded or injured detainees are entitled to the same level of medical treatment as soldiers the requirements for treatment and evacuation may delay movementconsume critical medical resources and could complicate other detaineeoperational tasks such as security and segregation using the 5 ss and t technique search silence segregate safeguard speed to safe area and tag decisions regarding detainees current and future status are primarily based on the initial processing at the poc effective processing will ensure us forces can makeinformed decisions on whether to release detain transfer custody or prosecutedetainees soldiers must process detainees using the 5 ss and t technique these procedures provide structure to guide soldiers in conducting detainee operations until theytransfer custody of detainees to another authority or location 1search includes those actions taken to neutralize detainee and confiscate weapons personal items and items of potential intelligenceevidentiary value 2silence prevent detainees from communicating with one another or from making audible clamor such as chanting singing praying etc silenceuncooperative detainees by muffling them using soft clean cloth tied around their 2 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedmouth and fastened at the back of the head do not use duct tape or other adhesives place cloth or objects inside the mouth or apply physical force to silence detainees 3segregate segregate detainees in accordance with policy and standing operating procedures segregation requirements will differ from operation to operation theability to segregate detainees may also be limited at the poc by availablemanpower and equipment or supply resources at minimum strive to segregateby rank gender adults from juveniles keep mothers with small children andsecurity risk military intelligence and military police can provide additionalguidance and support in determining appropriate segregation criteria 4safeguard refers to the obligation to protect detainees safety and ensure the custody and integrity of all confiscated items safeguard detainees from continuedcombat risk from harm caused by other detainees and from improper treatment orcare by us government or coalition personnel report all injuries that occur todetainees while in custody correct and report violations of us military policy thatoccur while safeguarding detainees acts andor omissions that constitute inhumanetreatment are violations of the law of armed conflict and as such must be correctedimmediately simply reporting violations is insufficient if violation is ongoingevery leader and soldier has an obligation to stop the violation and report it 5speed quickly move detainees from the continuing risks associated with other combatants or sympathizers who may still be in the area of capture if there aremore detainees than the unit can control call for additional support search andhold detainees in place until reinforcements arrive 6tag ensure each detainee is tagged using an authorized dd form 2745 capture tag see figure b1 which provides the only official detainee tracking numberprior to receiving an internment serial number isn all confiscated equipmentpersonal items and evidence will be linked to the detainee using the capture tagserial number when an da form 4137 evidenceproperty custody document seefigure b2 is used to document confiscated items it will be linked to the detaineeby annotating the capture tag serial number on the form document the detainee at the point of capture it is important to remember that decisions regarding detainees current and future status are based in part on the initial processing of detainees at the poc properprocessing ensures that us forces can take the appropriate action to releasedetain transfer custody of or prosecute detainees accountability begins at the poc by documenting the detainee using dd form 2745 the capture tag serial number will be used to link the detainee to otherrecords ie property accountability forms documentation of medical conditioninterrogation data and custody transfer record the capture tag serial number is the for official use only 3detainee operations at the point of captureonly number used to account for detainee until an isn is assigned at an internment facility everything confiscated or impounded from detainee including weapons personal items and items of intelligenceevidentiary value must be documented on the daform 4137 and linked to the detainee by annotating the form with the capture tagserial number see appendix b for instruction and the forms used documentation provides information to support continued assessments on whether to detain or release to make determinations on detainee status eg enemycombatant enemy prisoner of war civilian internee or retained person to preparefor criminal proceedings and to transfer custody of the detainee properdocumentation also provides an official historical record of the events surroundingthe capture of detainee which may prove invaluable to counter future false claimsregarding alleged abuse or loss of personal property proper documentation alsoinitiates the chain of custody for evidence needed to prosecute the detaineephotograph the detainee with hisher property whenever possible photographs maybe used later in intelligence analysis if time or the situation does not allow the use of the da form 4137 to document confiscated items place items in the large resealable bag carefully mark thedetainees capture tag serial number on the bag using permanent marker theproperty inventory can be transferred later to the da form 4137 at the detaineecollection point always transport the detainee with the confiscated items to ensureboth are available to during screening and tactical interrogation units must

cuffs and tighten theflexible cuffs now secure both wrists behind the detainees back caution the flexible cuffs should be tight enough to secure the hands but loose enough to allow one finger between the flexible cuffs and the detainees wristcheck to ensure that the flexible cuffs do not restrict the detainees circulation note the detainee is now restrained and in position to be searched the searcher must periodically inspect restraints and adjust them as appropriate conduct the search precautions the body search discussed below is called the prone frisk search keep in mind that body searches are used to quickly detect contraband or weapons that could be usedto cause injury or death conduct samegender searches when possible if mixedgender searches are necessary for speed or security conduct them in respectful manner and in thepresence of an additional witness to address false claims of misconduct note soldiers must respect the local cultural traditions and taboos when considering the need for mixedgender searches in most cases the immediatetactical needs will not outweigh the potential loss of intelligence and may incitehostility in an otherwise cooperative group of detainees avoid mixedgendersearches whenever possible use the bending and crushing technique to search the detainee 1 as items are discovered remove them from the detainee and set them aside2 grasp loose clothing pull it away from the skin and squeeze to detect objects hidden under or within clothing 3 bend the seams before crushing to determine if razor blades or similar devices are hidden inside the clothing 4 repeat the crushing technique covering each area to assure there are hidden objects for official use only 9detainee operations at the point of captureif weapon is found at any point during the search 1 loudly announce the weapon found so that the guard and interpreter can clearly hear eg gun knife razor etc 2 the guard should be alerted and postured for action3 remain in

notplace the detainee completely on his side check the bra area on female detainees figure 15 pull detainee upward to check for hidden weapons or contraband it is critical that the soldier performing the search not be timid while searching detainees crotch or bra area experience has proven that theseare prime locations for hiding weapons and contraband avoid indiscreet orhumiliating actions but search both areas of the detainee thoroughly bfor female detainees only when soldier is searching female detainee at chest level heshe will search 1 down the middle of the bra2 around the breast3 below the bra4 check the connecting point of the bra on the detainees back for contraband 9 switch hands while controlling the detainees elbow and without changing position 10 search the detainee from

squat beside the detainee facing the same direction as the detainees head caution when preparing to roll the person over anticipate that an unruly detainee may attempt to spit on or bite the searcher and move as needed to avoid suchincidents the search is now complete and all material found on the detainee has been confiscated 1 assist the detainee to stand turn detainee onto his side facing away b direct the detainee to bring his knees to his chest 2 grasp the arms at the shoulder area and assist the detainee to his knees3 pull back on his arms to help him rise to his feet4 the guard remains

intelligence base the segregation plan on risk assessment of thenumber of available guards against the number of segregation categories andnumber of detainees do not overextend the guard force place security and safety before segregation b segregate iaw army policy and unit sop initial segregation should be based upon circumstances of capture and information easily assessedregarding detainee risk eg one group is clearly more defiant towardguards one detainee is on one of the watch lists etc based on thisinitial assessment and the units capability for guarding multiple groupsholding areas instruct soldiers to segregate detainees as follows 1 leaders perceived status and positions of authority from the remainder of the population 2 hostile elements such as religious political or ethnic groups hostile to one another if possible 3 security risks eg agitators radicals uncooperative detainees from compliant detainees 4 civilian from military5 military by rank ie officers ncos or enlisted6 those who surrendered willingly or deserted from those who resisted capture 7 minors and female detainees from adult male detainees do this for their protection keep small children with their mothers 8 others may include persons who cannot be readily identified as belonging to one of the above designations additional segregationcriteria may include national ideological religious and ethnicgroups for example 9 the capability of us forces to segregate will expand as detainees move from the poc to each subsequent location dcpdha and theater internment facility tif as information becomesmore detailed and as resources allow and conditions improve furthersegregate detainees to the greatest extent possible 10 tactical questioning screening and interrogation of detainees will

1 use an interpreter to articulate clear guidance to detainees2 use premade cards outlining guidance in the local language3 place detainees in sitting position facing away from each other b segregate uncooperative detainees to minimize their effect on others if they remain uncooperative and can be heard by others they may be muffledto prevent communication the decision to muffle will be made iaw unitsop if required and authorized silence uncooperative detainees using amuffle 1 use soft clean cloth across the mouth and fasten it around the head do not use duct tape or other adhesives place

soldiers have an obligation to stop the violation as well asreport it 4speed to safe area speed highlights one of the major differences in processing detainees at the poc the poc is usually the most vulnerable location at which soldiers will abuse detainees supervisors must weigh the need to thoroughly processdetainees against 1 the need to move soldiers and detainees quickly to safe area2 the need to continue the primary mission for official use only 27detainee operations at the point of capture3 either consideration may require more thorough detainee processing to wait until transfer of custody to the dcp b supervisors must ensure detainees are escorted quickly to the dcp or dha based on security operational conditions and available transportation 5point of capture is the first decision point to retain or release review circumstances of capture confiscated items and intelligence and evidentiary value to provide thorough assessment b report to chain of command with sufficient information to make an informed decision before moving out c when all detainees have been processed update higher hq on the situation to include 1 date time and location of capture2 total number of

provided adequate food water clothing and shelter for official use only 31detainee operations at the point of capturec guards must afford detainees access to latrines and personal hygiene resources as available 7 guards must be fully trained on the capabilities and limitations of available nonlethal technologies conduct thorough risk assessment before integrating new technology into detainee operations b train and incorporate new technologies into unit standing operating procedures sop before integrating them into security operations 8 use an interpreter whenever possible9 always use restraints when in contact with escorting or otherwise handling detainees periodically check restraints to ensure they are secure without restricting circulation b remove restraints when detainees are placed in confinement space or other adequate confinement facility restraints may be used in cell toprotect detainee from selfharm c restraints normally should allow detainees to stand sit and lie in prone position 10 other than fastening seat belts for detainees while they are traveling in vehicles avoid restraining detainees to fixed structure or objects such as the vehicle bodywhile in transit vehicle collisions could severely injure restrained limbs b ensure detainees are seatbelted on aircraft 11 do not daisychain detainees ie chain two or more detainees together in serial configuration 12 always maintain positive control and accountability of detainees13 ensure weapons are functional loaded and ready for use if needed remember roe and ruf 14 take an appropriate position and stay

onlycenter for army lessons learnedc guards face toward the detainees observe everything in their line of sight and report all incidents to their supervisor d when positioned with others all guards must understand their mutually supported sectors of fire communications and battle drills observe and report detainee behavior this passive intelligence collection is not only permitted it is critical during law enforcement and intelligenceprocessing for example report the following 1 during medical exam detainee speaks fluent english but during interrogation feigns knowledge of english whatsoever 2 detainee demonstrates leadership by providing instructions to other detainees detainees should be segregated and silent 1 ensure the detainees remain segregated if detainee attempts to move out of the designated area or advances on guard use language interpreter or hand signals to stop the behavior b if the detainee continues react in accordance with published roerufc notify supervisor and document accordingly ie on the staff duty journal 2 ensure detainees remain silent prevent detainees from communicating with one another or from making audible clamor such as chanting singing praying etc thisis to ensure the safety of soldiers and other detainees use an interpreter ifavailable 3 do not speak to detainees unless providing ordersinstructions answer necessary questions but do not answer personal questions or questions that may compromiseor hinder the mission 4 if detainee attempts unauthorized communication with other detainees attempt to stop the behavior using language via interpreter andor hand signals do not use physical force to silence detainees b if the individual continues the behavior report to supervisor and segregate or muffle as appropriate iaw unit sop c

small units and individual soldiers contribute to situational awareness and facilitate human intelligence humint collection in various ways tactical questioning is acritical element of small unit operations through tactical questioning soldiersobserve interact with the local environment during the conduct of missions controlenemy prisoners of war epwsdetainees and handle captured enemy documentsand equipment soldiers serve as the commanders eyes and ears when they 1 execute traditional offensive or defensive missions2 conduct patrol in stability operation3 man checkpoint or roadblock4 occupy an observation post5 pass through areas in convoys6 do anything that involves observing and reporting elements of the environment and activities of the population in the area of operations ao tactical questioning is the expedient initial questioning for information of immediate value 1 when the term applies to interaction with the local population it is not truly questioning but is more conversational in nature the task can be designed to buildrapport as well as to collect information and understand the environment 2 the soldier conducts tactical questioning based on the units standing operating procedures rules of engagement and the order for that mission small unit leaders must include specific guidance for tactical questioning in the operations order for appropriate missions b the brigade and battalion s2s and s3s must provide appropriate specific guidance in the form of special orders and requests down to company troopor battery level to help guide tactical questioning 3 the information that the soldier reports as result of tactical questioning will be passed up the chain of command some to the battalion s2 and brigade s2 andform vital part of planning and operations careful and quick handling ofepwsdetainees and documents also helps the intelligence effort for official use only 49detainee operations at the point of captureinteraction with the local populace collecting information 1 information collection can and should occur at all times in an operational environment collection of combat information consists of becoming familiar withthe surrounding environment including the people infrastructure and terrain aswell as recognizing change like police officer walking the beat in aneighborhood day after day soldiers at all ranks and echelons must be able torecognize that something has changed and if possible why even if the soldiercannot determine why something changed simply reporting that there has beenchange may help military intelligence personnel soldiers should train themselvesto become constantly aware of conditions such as aarmed elements location of factional forces minefields and potential threats bhomes and buildings condition of roofs doors windows lights power lines water sanitation roads bridges crops and livestock cinfrastructure the presence of functioning stores service stations etc dpeople numbers gender age residence or displaced persons refugees and evacuee status visible health clothing daily activities and leaders econtrast has anything changed for example are there new locks on buildings are windows boarded up or previously boardedup windows nowopen indicating change of use of building have buildings been defacedwith graffiti 2 if everyone is involved in the collection of combat information then everyone must also be aware of the information requirements ir all soldiers who havecontact with the local population routinely travel within the area or frequentlyattend meetings with local organizations must know the commanders ir and carryout their responsibility to observe and report key considerations for talking 1 there are elements of communication to consider that can make conversation more effective and productive various aos will have different social and culturalconsiderations affecting communications and the conduct of operations these mayinclude social taboos desired behaviors customs and courtesies the staff mustinclude this information in predeployment training at all levels to ensure soldiersare properly equipped to interact with the local populace soldiers must also keep inmind safety considerations and possible dangers associated with their actionssoldiers should know the threat level and force protection measures in their ao 50 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedb be knowledgeable of local customs and courtesies c be mindful of their own body languaged approach people in normal surroundings to avoid suspicione be friendly and politef remove sunglasses when speaking to people with whom they are trying to create favorable impression g know about the local culture and learn few phrases in the native language h understand and respect local customs for example if male soldiers should not speak to women or female soldiers should not speak to men i when security conditions permit position weapon in the least intimidating position questions 1 questions are the best way to open and maintain conversation try to use open questions that cannot be answered yes or an open question is basicquestion normally beginning with an interrogative who what where when howor why and requires narrative answer keep questions brief and simply worded toavoid confusion example when was the last time an enemy patrol passedthrough here is better question than have you seen the enemy the betterquestion requires narrative response and requests specific elements ofinformation 2 wellcrafted open questions are broad in nature and serve as an invitation to talk they require an answer other than yes or b result in the individual answering being allowed freedom in answering these questions do not offer forced choice such as was the man tall orshort not only could the answer be misleading but the question doesntallow for responses such as average height medium or otherdescriptive responses c encourage discussion demonstrate interest in his opinion or observations d allow the individual to talk while carefully listening and observing details such as tone expression and eye contact while the person isanswering questions watch for signs of nervousness or other nonverbalcues for official use only 51detainee operations at the point of capturee pose little or threat to the individual not all questioning is targeted at information collection asking questions about neutral or safe topics canbuild rapport f allow people to become involved people like to think their opinions are important asking what people think helps them feel involved g obtain answers that reveal what the person thinks is important if relating an experience people will often begin with what is most important to them h create conversational tone for example simple question about family work or hobbies allows person to talk freely since the topic isnonthreatening these nonpertinent questions can serve as springboardto topics more closely related to the collection requirement often withoutthe person who is being questioned even realizing that the topic haschanged 3 be subtle throughout the conversation remember to be sociable yet reserved at all times rattling off series of questions and writing down the responses will notgain the trust of the individual being questioned maintaining the conversation 1 once conversation is established here are some common techniques to maintain the conversation avoid use of military jargon especially with civilians b be prepared to discuss personal interests hobbies books travelc be sensitive to body languaged smile as long as it is appropriatee avoid sitting with arms crossedf do not show the soles of the feet in an arabic cultureg keep hands away from the mouthh lean forward and nod at appropriate timesi make frequent eye contact if culturally appropriate 2 additional tips use the persons name position title rank andor other verbal expressions of respect b avoid judging the person by age gender or appearancec body posture should appear relaxed but remain alert 52 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedd remember most people like to talk about themselves use humor carefully some cultures consider excessive humor to be offensive or sign of deceit f understand and take into account the significance of holidays and religious days or times of the day or week g have second person listen to the conversation and later compare what each one heard for accuracy of recall tactical questioning of detainees 1 when conducting tactical questioning of detainees follow the provisions of the geneva conventions da pam 271 treaties governing land warfare ta l l times soldiers must not mistreat detainees in any way 2 general guidance when conducting tactical questioning do not use interrogation approaches in an attempt to force or scare information from detainees only trained and certified interrogators such ashumint teams may conduct interrogations b do not pay money or offer compensation for informationc try to avoid questioning detainee in public location or ask questions which may be overheard by others and later result in retaliation against thedetainee be discreet when possible question detainee out of sight andhearing of their fellow detainees or passersby d avoid asking leading questions leading questions are questions that are constructed as to require yes or answer rather than narrativeanswer leading questions encourage the individual to answer with aresponse he or she thinks the interrogator wants to hear not necessarily thetruth for example is group xyz responsible is leading question avoid asking negative questions negative questions contain negative word in the question itself such as didnt you go to the warehouse f steer clear of compound questions compound questions consist of two questions asked at the same time for example where were you going afterwork and who were you meeting there g do not ask vague questions vague questions do not have enough information for the person to understand exactly what is being asked suchquestions may be incomplete general or otherwise nonspecific and createconfusion or lead to mutual misunderstanding for official use only 53detainee operations at the point of capture3do ask only basic questions as described in this chapter b move detainees to detention facility as quickly as possible using interpreters 1 the use of interpreters is an integral part of the information collection effort use of an interpreter is timeconsuming and potentially confusing proper use andcontrol of an interpreter is skill that must be learned and practiced to maximizethe potential of collection 2 perhaps the most important guideline to remember is that an interpreter is essentially mouthpiece repeating what the interrogator says but in differentlanguage this sounds simple but for those who have never worked withinterpreters problems can quickly develop 3 upon meeting an interpreter it is important that to assess his proficiency in english use an interpreter who has firm grasp of english and the terminologythat may arise 4 following are several tips that should prove useful when working with an interpreter placement 1 when standing the interpreter should stand just behind the interrogator and to the side 2 when seated the interpreter should sit right beside the interrogator but not between the interrogator and the individualbeing questioned b body language and tone 1 have the interpreter translate messages in the same tone2 ensure the interpreter avoids making gestures c delivery 1 the interrogator should talk directly to the person with whom they are speaking rather than the interpreter 2 speak as in normal conversation not in the third person for example do not say to the interpreter tell him that insteadspeak to the detainee directly ie i understand that you andinstruct the interpreter to translate 54 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned3 speak clearly avoid acronyms or slang and break sentences uniformly to facilitate translation 4 some interpreters will begin to translate while the interrogator is still speaking this is frustrating for some people if so discuss thepreference of translation with the interpreter d security 1 work under the assumption that the interpreter is being debriefed by threat intelligence service 2 always assume the worst3 avoid careless talk4 avoid giving away personal details5 do not become emotionally involved the most important thing to remember when using an interpreter is that the interrogator controls the conversation not the interpreter 5 checklist for monitoring the interpreter tell the interpreter precisely what is expected of him and how he should accomplish it b tell the interpreter exactly what is to be translated the interpreter should translate all conversation between the interrogator and the individual beingquestioned without adding or omitting anything c just as questioning should be conducted to disguise the true intent of the questioning from the source do not reveal intelligence requirementsfriendly force information requirement ir or essential elements of friendlyinformation to the interpreter d brief the interpreter on actions to take at the end of questioning or in the event of enemy contact tactical questioning and handling of epwsdetainees treat all epwsdetainees in accordance with the geneva conventions1 the first step in handling epwsdetainees is to implement the 5 sssearch silence segregate safeguard speed the 5 ss is common military term usuallyassociated with the handling of epwsdetainees the term reminds soldiers of thelegal obligation they bear in treating epwsdetainees humanely for official use only 55detainee operations at the point of capture2 the first soldier to question an epwdetainee must complete capture tag the ability to gather initial information that facilitates detailed questioning by humintpersonnel is extremely important 3 the acronym jumps job unit mission priority questions supporting information forms the basis of the types of questions to ask detainees the tablebelow shows pertinent questions jumps can be used with any person beingquestioned civilian or military simply modify the questions to fit the situation j job what is your job what do you do if military what is your rank if civilian what is your position title u unit what is your unit or name of the company you work for ask about their chain of command and command structure ie who is your boss or supervisor if civilian ask the name of the business and employer m mission what is the mission of your unit or element what is the mission of your next higher unit or element what mission or job were you performingwhen you were captured or detained what is the current mission of your unit orelement what is the future mission of your unit or element p priority questions ask questions based on unit tasking as briefed before patrol traffic control point roadblock based on the battalions or brigades pirask the questions during natural conversation so as not to give away the missionor the

either noncombatants or epwsdetainees originally these questionswere created specific to traffic control posts and roadblocks keep in mind thesequestions are only examples and can be modified or added to based on the missionunit guidance and the situation what is your name verify this with identification papers etc and check the detainof interestprotect lists b what is your home address former

you encounter on your way hereh what unusual activity did you notice on your way herei what route will you take to get to your final destinationj who do you personally know who actively opposes the us or multinational forces follow this question up with who else if theyknow someone ask what antius multinational force activities theyknow about where they happened etc k why do you believe we us or multinational forces are herel what do you think of our us or multinational force presence here these questions may seem broad when in fact they are pointed and specific they do not allow the person being questioned room for misinterpretation or the chanceto give vague or misleading answer always keep the questions pertinent to the mission and report the answers per unit guidance information of
