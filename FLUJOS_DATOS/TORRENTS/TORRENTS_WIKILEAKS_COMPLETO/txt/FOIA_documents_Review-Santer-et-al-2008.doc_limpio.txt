review consistency of modelled and observed temperature trends in the tropical troposphere santer et this is very well thought out and constructed paper i only have few comments 1 in few place the tone is bit too condescending i realize the douglas paper has major flaws but the authors should let their work speak for itself and tone down the rhetoric little below are few specific places p 7 where it says statistical test flawed should say something like we test whether the methodology used in dcps07 is applied properly p 20 replace na√Øve with something less condescending p 21 illogical and inappropriate replace with something little less confrontational 2 i was initially questioning the need for section 6 using synthetic data but this does add to the overall conclusion that not using standard errors adjusted for autocorrelation effects leads to undue rejection rates but reviewers may consider this bit of overkill 3 im not sure all the appendices are needed especially appendix 1 but that should be the reviewers call 4 in equation 4 shouldnt be se2 5 small point the first sentence in section 2 states that msu derived temperature has been monitored from space since 1978 but in reality they have only been monitored since christy and spencer first put out their msu product in the late 1980s the data does go back to 1978 but i dont think anyone was actually doing realtime monitoring starting then otherwise this is an excellent paper and i found it very readable the statistics were particularly well presented dave easterling
