nod to president medvedevs 2008 anticorruption legislation transparency internationals corruption perceptions index ranked russia at 146 up one spot from its 2008 147th ranking this general lack of progress confirms what analysts have told us corruption in russia remains serious problem despite medvedevs public denouncements and efforts to reduce it this presents quandary for the gor as it decides how to proceed dramatic steps might threaten the status quo yet gradual steps so far have been ineffective end summary russias corruption rankings stagnate 2 sbu transparency international released its 2009 corruption perceptions index on 17 november russia was ranked at 146 it was ranked at 147 in 2008 which transparency international said reflected mildly positive response to medvedevs 2008 anticorruption legislation russias 2009 rank however is still below its 2007 rank 143 and far below its 2006 rank 121 these results echo the world banks worldwide governance indicators with russias rankings on control of corruption showing steady annual decline since 2005 3 sbu president medvedev has repeatedly stated that corruption is endemic to russia and has made fighting it signature issue for his presidency he has highlighted consistently the damage corruption has done to russia most recently in both his highprofile forward russia article in september and his 12 november address to the federal assembly beyond the anticorruption legislation promulgated last year however few practical steps have been implemented elite losing control 4 c furthermore there is growing consensus among analysts that even if the power elite wants to tackle corruption the economic crisis has exacerbated tendencies towards unmanageability of corruption within the power vertical xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that the gor may have waited too long xxxxxxxxxxxx said that few years ago when only millions had been stolen from the russian people as opposed to todays billions the gor could have acted and not sparked public outrage xxxxxxxxxxxx said that the crisis had made the gors task more difficult and the scope of corruption has become unmanageable as the crisis reduced the size of the pot and the anticorruption rhetoric increased some russians felt that they had best grab as much as they could while the going was good xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the tendency of corruption to evade control by the gor was not new in 2006 at the height of putins control in booming economy it was rumored within the presidential administration that as many as 60 percent of his orders were not being followed do changes at interior ministry signal progress 5 c xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that minister of interior rashid nurgaliev had recently fired or brought charges against number of relatively lowranking law enforcement officials for corruption xxxxxxxxxxxx stated though that it was too soon to judge whether this activity reflected real change xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that nurgalievs actions were not meaningful he stated that action was required from higher up the power vertical and needed to affect the strata that average russians would consider untouchable moscow 00002823 002 of 002 can russias trajectory be changed 6 c xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx said that only revolution could change russias current trajectory he argued that the system had become too sclerotic and too beneficial for too many to allow for change xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that corruption had even become positive factor for substantial portion of society by taking merit out of the equation for success it was simply easier to pay for entrance to university for contract etc xxxxxxxxxxxx who has made fortune in russias casino business told us forthrightly that the levels of corruption in business were worse than we could imagine and that after working here for over 15 years and witnessing firsthand the behavior of gor officials at all levels he could not imagine the system changing comment 7 c corruption in russia remains pervasive and deeprooted while medvedevs anticorruption rhetoric is step in the right direction we have yet to see significant implementation of new measures russians appear to accept current levels of corruption and seem inclined to pay up or emigrate rather than protest neither have russians reacted to the sight of the connected few continuing to indulge in luxurious lifestyles as the economic recession continues to leave most russians worse off than they were two to three years ago nonetheless the commentary on the gors increasing inability to manage the scope of corruption bodes ill for its stated effort to enhance corporate governance and investor confidence beyrle
