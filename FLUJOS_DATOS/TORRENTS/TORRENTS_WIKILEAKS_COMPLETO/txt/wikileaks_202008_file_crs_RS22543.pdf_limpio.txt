whether the parents of child with disability are parties aggrieved under idea whether the parents ar parties aggrieved rns in large part on whether the rights guaranteed under idea are guaranteed for the child with disability for the parent of such child or both courts have varied in their views on this issue and therefore on the issue of whether nonattorney parents have the ability to pursue an idea case pro lower court decisions in winkelman v parma city school district jacob winkelman has autistic spectrum disorder and in accordance with an individualized education program iep was placed in preschool with the concurrence of both his parents and the pa rma city school district when he was old enough for kindergarten his parents and school officials disagreed on his proper placement with his parents alleging that the schools propos ed placement at pleas ant valley elementary school was not appropriate to jacobs needs after rulings supporting the school districts determination by the hearing officer and state level review officer the winkelmans appealed pro to us district court the district court agreed with the administrative rulings4 and the winkelmans appealed again without lawyer to the sixth circuit court of appeals the court of appeals issued an order dismissing the appeal unless an attorney was obtained within thirty days5 the winkelmans then sought and received stay of this order from the supreme court pending deci sion by the supreme c ourt the supreme court granted certiorari on october 27 2006 the sixth circuit decision in winkelman found that the recent sixth circuit decision in cavanaugh ex rel cavanaugh v cardinal local school district6 was dispositive of the question of whether nonattorney parents of child with disability could represent their child in court cavanaugh held that parents could not represent their child in an idea action and that the right of child with disability to fape did not grant such right to the childs parents the sixth circuit in cavanaugh first noted that federal law allows an individual to act as their own counsel7 but that generally parents cannot appear pro on behalf of their minor children because minors personal cause of action is herhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22543crs3 8 cavanaugh ex rel cavanaugh v cardinal local school 409 f3d 753 755 6th cir 2005 quoting shepherd v wellman 313 f3d 963 97071 6th cir 2002 9

arguing that the maroni court correctly interpreted idea see m brendhan flynn in defense of maroni why parents should be allowed to proceed pro in idea continuedown and does not belong to he r parent or representative8 finding that this general principle was not abrogated by idea the sixth circuit observed that idea explicitly grants parents the right to due process hear ing but in stark contrast the provision of the idea granting any party aggrieved access to the federal courts makes mention of parents whatsoever9 in addition the court observed that the intended beneficiary of idea is the child with disability not the parents and that although idea does grant parents some procedural rights these only serve to ensure the childs substantive right and do not provide the parents with substantive rights10 other court of appeals decisions the circuit courts are not all in accord with the sixth circuit in finding that parents may not proceed pro in an idea case currently there is three way split in their determinations of this issue with some circuits finding th at nonattorney parents may not proceed pro another circuit holding that nona ttorney parents have limitations on their ability to proceed and ot her courts of appeals holding that parents can proceed on procedural claims but must use lawyer for substantive claims parents may proceed pro i n maroni v pemibaker regional school district11 the first circuit held that parents have right to proceed pro on both procedural and substantive grounds the idea language stating that any party aggrieved by the findings and decision made under this subsection shall have the right to bring civil action with respect to the co mplaint presented pursuant to this section 12 was seen as including parents of children with disabilities this provision was described as not making distinction between procedur and substantive claims and the procedural and substantive rights under idea were described as inextricably intertwined13 the first circuit noted that there are some pr actical concerns about recognizing parents as aggrieved parties pare nts may not be the best advocates for their child as they may be emotionally involved and not able to exer cise rational and i ndependent judgment14 in addition pro litigants were seen as imposing burde ns on the courts and schools districts due to poorly drafted or vexa tious claims however the maroni court rejected these practical concerns finding th at since there is constituti onal right to appointed counsel in civil case having parent represent them was better for children with disabilities than having advocate15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22543crs4 15 continued cases 80 i nd lj 881 summer 2005 16 121 f 3d 576 11th cir 1997 see also navin v park ridge

school district and cavanaugh ex rel cavanaugh v cardinal local school district which were discussed previous ly other circuits have also denied parents the right to proceed pro for example in devine v indian river county school board16 the parents of child with autism brought suit alleging that the childs iep was inadequate although the parents were represented by an attorney at the beginning of the suit they informed the court that they wished to discharge the attorney and proceed pro the court noted that idea does allow parents to present evidence and examine witnesses in due process hearings but found indication that congress intended to carry this requirement over to federal court proceedings in the absence of such intent we are compelled to follow the usual rule that parents who are not attorneys may not bring pro action on their childs behalf because it helps to ensure that children rightfully entitled to legal relief are not deprived of their day in court by unskilled if caring parents17 parents may proceed pro on procedural claims but not substantive claims in collinsgru v palmyra board of education18 the parents sought special education services for their whom they contended had learning disability the parents pursued the administrative remedies under idea without an attorney although they did retain nonattorney expert the administrative law judge found that the childs difficulties were not severe enough to qualify for special education and rejected the parents complaint the parents then filed civil action in district court the district court held that the parents could not proceed pro to represent their child and rejected the parents assertion that the parents were pursuing their own rights the court of appeals in collinsgru first found that under general legal theories regarding pro representation idea did not allow parents to proceed pro to represent their child stating congress expressly provided that parents were entitled to represent their child in administrative proceedings that it did not also carve out an exception to permit parents to represent their child in fe deral proceedings suggests that congress only intended to let parents represent their children in administrative proceedings19 the third circuit noted that the requirement of repr esentation by counsel was based on two policy considerations first the court found there is strong state interest in regulating the practice of law requiring minimum level of competence was described as protecting not only the represented party but also his or her adversaries as well as the court from poor drafted or vexatious claims second the court emphasized the importance of the rights at issue and the final nature of th adjudication licensed attorney would be subject to ethical obligations and may be ed for malpractice while an individual not represented by an attorney woul d not have these protections httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22543crs5 20 id at 236 21 id at 234 22

education they had joint substan tive rights with their child under idea they noted that parents are often the only available advocates for their child and that attorneys are often unwilling to take idea cases due to their specialized and complicated nature and since the cases often lack significant retainers the court expressed some sympathy for these arguments but noted that congress d provided for attorneys fees in idea and concluded that ideas statutor provisions indicated that the rights at issue here are divisible and not concurrent20 the parents and the child were thus found to possess different idea rights the parents possess explicit rights in the form of procedural safeguards21 while the child possesses both pro cedural and substantive rights other courts have also found that parents have procedur rights under idea which they can bring suit pro to enforce in mosely v board of education of the city of chicago22 the seventh circuit observed that id ea provides both children and their parents with an elaborate set of procedural safeguards that must be observed in the course of providing the child free appropriate pub lic education23 citing collinsgru for the proposition that idea confers different rights on parents and children the court f ound that the parents procedural rights we re enough of an interest to allow pro suit to enforce these parental rights to proceed similarly in wenger v canastota central school district24 the second circuit denied pa rents attempt to bring suit pro on behalf of his child but stated that the parent is of course entitle d to represent himself on his claims that his own rights as parent under the idea were violated25
