political branches of government5 there are two types of mootness article iii mootness and prudential mootness6 as the name implies the former is derived from the constitutional requirement that judicial power be exercised only in cases or controversies7 the latter concerns federal courts discretion to withhold use of judicial power in suits that while not actually moot should be treated as moot for prudential reasons article iii mootness usually case or controversy must exist throughout all stages of federal judicial proceedings and not just when the lawsuit is filed or

the outcome of the case9 the supreme court has descri bed mootness as follows the personal stake aspect of mootness doctrine serves primarily the purpose of assuring that federal courts are presented w ith disputes they are capable of resolving one commentator has defined mootness as t he doctrine of standing set in time frame the requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation standing must continue throughout its existence mootness10 when legal claim becomes moot while awaiting appellate review the established practice is for the federal appeals court to reverse or vacate the judgment below and to remand the case to the district court with an instruction to dismiss the action11 that consequence is because moot case does not qualify as case or controversy under article iii due to the lack of jurisdicti on federal courts have power to consider the merits of constitutionally moot case12 cases may be rendered moot because of change in the status of the parties or in the law or because of an act of one of the parties that dissolves the controversy the following paragraphs provide examples of these scenarios change in the status of the parties when white law school applicant challenged the constitutionality of public law schools affirmative action admissions policy he was admitted to the school pursuant to trial court ruling that found in his favor during his second year of law school the states supreme court reversed the lower courts decision by the time the supreme cour t granted certiorari to hear the case the student was

while his appeal was pending he was transferred twice first back to the medium security facility and thereaf ter to minimum security instituti on the supreme court held that the suit longer presented case or controversy and thus dismissed the case as moot15 prudential mootness equitable or prudential m ootness has been referred to as the cousin of the mootne ss doctrine and described as relating to the courts discretion in matters of remedy and judicial administration unlike article iii mootness it addresses not the power to grant relief but the courts discretion in the exercise of that power in some circumstances controversy not actually moot is so attenuated that considerations of prudence and comity for coordinate branches of government counsel the court to stay its hand and to withhold relief it has the power to grant16 thus while case may not be moot for failure to meet article iiis requirements court may nevertheless treat the case as moot for prudential reasons and decline to exercise judicial power in the case17 the doctrine of prudential moot ness is often applied in cas where the federal court declines to grant the plaintiffs request fo r declaratory judgment or injunctive relief because the defendant has already changed or is in the process of changing its policies or where it appears that any repeat of the actions in question is otherwise highly unlikely18 the supreme court has explained th at the burden on the party asking the court to dismiss case on prudential mootne ss grounds is heavy one as the movanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22599crs5 19 wt grant

1969 23 roe v wade 410 us 113 125 1973usually the defendant must demonstrate that there is reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated19 exceptions to the mootness doctrine the supreme court has recognized several exceptions to the mootness doctrine that if found to apply to case would permit federal court adjudica tion of the dispute possibility of collatera l legal consequences in sibron v new york an individual convicted of unlawful possession of heroin had completed service of his prison sentence prior to supreme court review of the case the court explained that the case was not moot although the term has been served the results of the conviction may persist subsequent convictions may carry heavier penalties civil rights may be affected as the power to remedy an invalid sentence ex ists we think respondent is entitled to an opportunity to attempt to show that this conviction was invalid20 this exception to the mootness doctrine thus applies in the criminal context when there is possibility that any collateral legal consequences will be imposed on the basis of the challenged conviction21 even remote possibility of such consequences is enough to save criminal case from becoming moot22 conduct capable of repetition yet evading review some disputes or injuries may arise in the shortterm and have the potential for recurrence but always fail to last long enough to permit federal judicial review in such situation federal courts have justified an exception to the mootness doctrine classic example is the landmark abortion case roe v wade the supreme court explai ned why the exception should be invoked in this instance when as here pregnancy is significant fact in the litigation the normal 266day human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete if that termination makes case moot pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage and appellate review will be effectively denied our law should not be that rigid pregnancy often comes more than once to the same woman and in the general population if man is to survive it will always be with

1975however the court has held that this exception applies only in exceptional situations where the plaintiff can make reasonable showing that he will again be subjected to the alleged illegality24 voluntary cessation if defendant voluntarily rminates the allegedly unlawful conduct after the lawsuit has been filed but retains the power to resume the practice at any time federal court may deem the case nonmoot25 the heavy burden of persuading the court that case has been mooted by th defendants voluntary actions lies with the party asserting mootness and the standard for such termination is stringent one if subsequent events make it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior can not reasonably be expected to recur26 this exception is supported by the supreme court because in addition to ensuring that the defenda nt is not free to return to his old ways there is public interest in having the legality of the practices settled27 for example an environmental group had filed citizen suit under the clean water act against laidlaw company that operated wastewater treatment plant alleging that the plant had discharged far more toxic pollu tants into river th an it was allowed under terms of governmentissued permit however after the lawsuit began laidlaw began to comply with the discharge limit the supreme court held that this case was not moot because it was disputed factual matter wh ether the companys substantial compliance with its permit requirements or its closure of the facility in question which had occurred after the court of appeals had issued its d ecision would make it absolutely clear that laidlaws permit violations could not reasonably be expected to recur28 class action litigation when the claim of the named plaintiff in certified class action becomes moot the class action will not be dismissed so long as member of the class continues to have sufficiently adversarial relationship to constitute live controversy for example plaintiff brought class action to challenge oneyear residency requirement in st ate divorce statute on the gr ound that it violated the us constitution by the time her case reached the supreme court she had long since satisfied the states durationa l residency requireme nt development that had she filed the suit only on her own behalf would have made the case moot because she longer retained personal stake in the outcome however the court noted the significant fact that she had brought the lawsuit as class action in representative capacity which affected the mootness determin ation when the district court certified the propriety of the class action the class of unnamed persons described in the certification acquired legal status separate from the interest asserted by the named representative and therefore the article iii cases or controversies requirement was satisfied29
