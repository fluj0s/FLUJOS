against israelis and at times against americans congress also has expressed concern that us funds for palestinian refugees channeled through the united nations have been mismanaged or found their way

department designated foreign terrorist organization following hamass victory in the 2006 legislative election and the formation of hamasled pa cabinet the united states halted aid to the pa but continued humanitarian aid along with efforts to bolster fatah leader and pa president mahmoud abbas in june 2007 hamas seized control of the gaza strip leading abbas to dissolve the government and appoint an emergency government based in the west bank that excludes hamas the administration quickly announced plans to resume aid to the new government but questions remain over fatahs ability to govern in the west bank and possible humanitarian crisis in gaza since the signing of the oslo accord in 1993 the us government has committed an estimated 19 billion in bilateral economic assistance

the palestinian territories background and us relations historical background the palestine mandate following world war i and the collapse of the ottoman empire the united kingdom was given the mandate for palestine which encompassed what is today jordan israel the west bank and the gaza strip1 britains stewardship of palestine was troubled from the beginning as it became embroiled in the struggle between jewish settlers seeking to establish their own state and arab inhabitants who were resisting these efforts because of uncertain data precise population figures for palestine at this time are not available the numbers most frequently cited are from 1922 british census which put the figures at 660000 arabs 84000 jews and 7600 others by 1948 there were an estimated 135 million arabs and 650000 jews2 during the 1920s and 1930s jewisharab relations in palestine worsened and were marked by spasms of violence repeated british efforts to find formula that would satisfy all parties succeeded only in further angering and alienating the two sides as world war ii wound down violence in palestine escalated and jewish underground groups began attacking british installations and assassinating british officials in february 1947 britain told the general assembly that it wished to relinquish the mandate and asked the new body to settle the issue the 1947 partition plan and the creation of israel the special commission on palestine eventually recommended dividing palestine into jewish state about 56 of the territory and an arab state about 42 of the territory and placing jerusalem about 2 of the territory under international administration3 the general assembly adopted this plan on november 29 1947 as general assembly resolution 1814 many observers believed the plan was unworkable not least because it left many arabs living in the proposed jewish state the jews saw the decision as imperfect but accepted it as step toward creating the jewish state for which they had worked so long the arabs felt that it 1 in 1922 britain set up separate administration for the land east of the jordan river and soon began transferring authority to the newly created emirate of transjordan later renamed jordan 2 mideast web the population of palestine prior to 1948 httpwwwmideastweborg palpophtm 3 for map of the 1947 partition plan see httpwwwmideastweborg unpartitionhtm 4

plan both sides began organizing and arming themselves and groups on both sides carried out attacks on civilians as violence mounted many palestinian arabs began fleeing to neighboring countries on may 14 1948 the british withdrew from palestine and the jews proclaimed the independent state of israel in the following days and weeks neighboring arab states invaded the newly proclaimed state of israel in palestine when the fighting ended in 1949 israel held territories beyond the boundaries set by the plan total of 78 of the area west of the jordan river jordan held east jerusalem and the west bank and egypt held the gaza strip about 700000 palestinian arabs fled or were driven out of israel5 palestinians call their defeat and exile in 1948 alnakba the catastrophe many palestinian refugees ended up in camps in the egyptiancontrolled gaza strip the jordanianruled west bank jordan proper syria and lebanon where they and their descendants remain today the arab countries resisted assimilating the refugees for both political and economic reasons many palestinians did not wish to assimilate hoping to one day return to their homes israel refused to readmit the refugees seeing them as both physical and demographic threat to the new state the 1967 war during the 1950s and 1960s as the winds of arab nationalism blew across the region radical arab leaders in egypt and syria pressed for military action against israel in may 1967 egypt moved military units into the sinai peninsula and concluded military agreement with jordan on june 5 1967 israel assuming war was inevitable launched preemptive air strikes against its arab neighbors6 its subsequent victory over egypt jordan and syria took only six days israel took control of the sinai and the gaza strip from egypt the west bank and east jerusalem from jordan and the golan heights from syria almost 1 million arabs mostly palestinians came under israeli rule in november 1967 the security council passed resolution 242 calling for israeli withdrawal from territories occupied during the war and the right of every state in the region to live in peace within recognized borders7 the defeated arabs states refused to recognize or negotiate with israel the israeli government decided to keep the territories as bargaining chips in future peace talks many observers believe one consequence of the war was the emergence of stronger sense of palestinian national identity palestinians began to more forcefully advocate for state of their own the palestine liberation organization plo which had been established in 1964 became more militant and portrayed itself as movement struggling for national liberation in time the plo became recognized by the palestinian people the arab states and much of the international community 5 there is reliable data for the precise number of palestinian refugees who fled in 1948 most scholars place the figure between 600000 and 750000 6 for contrary view that asserts that israel was motivated more by fear of being disadvantaged diplomatically than by genuine military threat see roland popp stumbling decidedly into the sixday war middle east journal spring 2006 7 for the full text of unscr 242 see httpwwwunorgdocumentsscres1967 scres67htm crs3 as the legitimate representative of the palestinian people israel strongly opposed the plo because of terrorist attacks by its component groups and because its charter at the time aimed to destroy the state of israel the october war and camp david in 1973 the arabs led by egypt and syria launched surprise attack on israel in part to regain the lost territory catching israel off guard the arab armies made initial advances but eventually israel drove the arab forces back to roughly the 1967 armistice lines by 1977 with the panarab dream shattered egyptian president anwar sadat offered peace if israel withdrew from the occupied lands and agreed to palestinian state in 1978 following vigorous diplomatic efforts by president carter egypt and israel signed framework agreements that led to the egyptianisraeli peace treaty and israels withdrawal from the sinai and promised autonomy talks for palestinians in the west bank and gaza the autonomy talks however never materialized and other arab states did not accept the camp david accords in the mid1970s israeli nationalistreligious groups accelerated their campaign to establish jewish settlements in the occupied territories in 1977 when the rightwing likud party came to power in israel for the first time the government began backing the settlement enterprise more intensively crs4 figure 1 map of west bank and gaza strip the first intifada uprising growing sense of frustration set in among palestinians during the 1980s over the lack of progress in finding durable resolution of their nationalist claims in december 1987 after four gaza palestinians were killed by an israel defense force idf truck in traffic accident rioting broke out and quickly spread through the territories initially palestinian youth hurled stones and molotov cocktails at idf soldiers although in some later clashes hand grenades and guns were used the idf struggled at first to contain the crowds and often resorted to firing into them killing hundreds of palestinians the protests also featured acts of civil disobedience including strikes demonstrations tax resistance and boycotts of israeli products all coordinated through locally based popular crs5 committees over the next six years over 1100 palestinians and 160 israelis were killed in the violence8 the uprising put the palestinian question back on the international agenda in july 1988 in response to the months of demonstrations by palestinians in the west bank jordan ceded to the plo all jordanian claims to the territory to try and fill the political vacuum in november 1988 the palestine national council the plo legislature declared the establishment of the state of palestine in accordance with general assembly resolution 181 the 1947 partition plan though symbolic the plos declaration was seen by many as tacit recognition of israel and acceptance of twostate solution from the palestinian perspective by engaging the israelis directly rather than relying on neighboring arab states the palestinians reinforced their identity as separate nation worthy of selfdetermination the impact on israelis was equally profound many observers have noted that the first intifada demonstrated to many israelis that something they had come to take for granted the occupation of the west bank and gaza could not continue indefinitely the oslo years by the early 1990s the intifada the end of the cold war and the changed international climate led israels new labor government and the plo to conduct secret negotiations in oslo norway to settle the conflict the breakthrough came in 1993 and the resulting agreements often called the oslo accords included letters of mutual recognition between israel and the plo the establishment of palestinian interim selfgoverning authority in the west bank and gaza and fiveyear window in which to conclude final status deal the new palestinian authority pa had directly elected president and legislative council elected separately the pa assumed full control of major west bank cities and limited control in other areas however palestinian rejectionist violence and israeli settlement building in the territories undermined the process nonetheless in july 2000 president clinton invited israeli prime minister ehud barak and plo chairman yasir arafat to camp david to press them to conclude final status deal baraks offer went further than any previous israeli offer but still fell short of palestinian demands the summit collapsed and the two sides traded accusations over who was to blame the second intifada and israels withdrawal from gaza in september 2000 with tensions high then opposition leader ariel sharon visited the temple mountharam alsharif in jerusalems old city site holy to both jews and muslims the visit sparked palestinian riots in jerusalem which quickly spread through the territories igniting the second or alaqsa intifada9 as palestinian crowds rioted in some instances members of the palestinian security forces opened fire on israeli forces israeli soldiers often responded with deadly force killing more than 100 palestinians over the next few weeks palestinian militant groups responded with bombing campaign against israeli civilian and military targets killing scores 8 figures according to btselem the israeli information center for human rights in the occupied territories httpwwwbtselemorgenglishstatisticsfirst_intifada_tablesasp 9 the name alaqsa intifada is taken from the alaqsa mosque the third holiest site in islam located on the temple mount or haram alsharif in arabic the scene of sharons visit crs6 of israelis and several americans amid the violence israeli and palestinian negotiators continued the peace talks begun at camp david meeting in taba egypt in january 2001 the two sides closed the gaps between them considerably and agreement appeared near based on set of ideas presented by president clinton however talks were suspended for the israeli election in which barak sought vote of confidence from the public sharon who opposed the talks won decisive victory and the talks were never resumed in 2002 to try and stem the bombings the idf reoccupied all major west bank cities and began building separation barrier in the west bank at the end of 2003 prime minister sharon announced his intention to disengage from the palestinians by unilaterally withdrawing settlers and idf forces from the gaza strip and small area of the west bank in september 2005 israel completed its unilateral withdrawal from gaza but still controls the flow of people and goods in and out of the territories continues to occupy the west bank and has erected hundreds of checkpoints and roadblocks to thwart terrorism just over 4000 palestinians and just over 1000 israelis have been killed since the second intifada began10 palestinian society and political dynamics demographics there are an estimated 38 million palestinians living in the west bank gaza strip and east jerusalem 24 million in the west bank and east jerusalem and 14 million in gaza11 in addition some 425000 jewish settlers live in the occupied territories 250000 in the west bank and 175000 in east jerusalem west bank palestinians generally are wealthier better educated and more secular than their gaza brethren the palestinian population has one of the highest growth rates in the world and is disproportionately young according to the norwegian institute for labor and social research widely considered the most credible authority on palestinian demographics 51 of the palestinians in the territories are 20 years old or younger and 80 are less than 40 years old the youth bulge ensures that the population growth rate will remain high even as fertility rates decline palestinians are well educated relative to other arab countries with an adult literacy rate of 92 and 92 of schoolage children enrolled in school jordan by comparison has 90 adult literacy rate and 99 enrollment rate while egypt has 71 adult literacy rate and an 83 enrollment rate12 the palestinian population is 98 sunni muslim just under 2 are christians of various denominations see palestinian christians section below for further discussion 10 figures according to btselem the israeli information center for human rights in the occupied territories httpwwwbtselemorgenglishstatisticscasualtiesasp 11 the pa last conducted census in 1997 in which it counted 29 million residents of the palestinian territories the 38 million figure is not an actual count but projection of the 1997 census assuming an annual growth rate of between 4 and 5 an additional 13 million palestinians live inside israel proper as arab citizens of israel 12 unicef data httpwwwuniceforginfobycountrynorthafricahtml crs7 national identity and the quest for statehood historians have noted that the concept of palestinian national identity is relatively recent phenomenon and in large part grew from the challenge posed by zionism in the first half of the 20th century13 palestinian identity first emerged during the british mandate period began to crystalize with the 1947 partition plan and grew stronger following israels conquest of the west bank and gaza strip in 1967 although in 1947 the united nations intended to create two states in palestine one jewish and one arab only one came into being the arab state was stillborn victim of the military triumph of the new jewish state the failure of the palestinians and some allege the collusion of arab and british leaders14 today the palestinian publics desire to establish state of their own on at least some portion of historic palestine is the dominant political issue throughout the palestinian territories how that state should be established and its nature however continue to divide palestinian society fatah and hamas are the largest political movements and reflect the basic cleavage in palestinian society namely between those who support negotiated twostate solution with israel and those who do not the fatahhamas rivalry fatah secular nationalist party and the largest faction within the plo dominated palestinian society and politics between 1969 when its leader yasir arafat became plo chairman and his death in 2004 in its 1988 declaration of independence and again in the oslo accords the plo renounced violence recognized israel and committed to negotiating twostate solution to the conflict the first palestinian elections were held january 20 1996 in accordance with the oslo accords arafat was elected president with 88 of the vote and fatah won 55 of the then88 seats in the palestinian legislative council plc when arafat died mahmoud abbas also known as abu mazen succeeded him as leader of fatah and the plo and was elected pa president in january 2005 however polling data between 1996 and 2004 showed significant drop in support for fatah against backdrop of widespread political alienation in 2003 poll for example some 40 of respondents said they favored none of the existing factions15 most observers believe fatahs decline was due to the publics perception that the pa was rife with corruption out of touch with the populace and had failed to achieve progress toward statehood or provide law and order hamas for many years the main opposition force in the palestinian territories grew out of the muslim brotherhood religious and political organization founded in egypt in 1928 with branches throughout the arab world hamass founder and 13 rashid khalidi palestinian identity the construction of modern national consciousness new york columbia univ press 1997 14 khalidi palestinian

as the muslim brotherhoods local political arm in december 1987 following the eruption of the first intifada hamas combines palestinian nationalism with islamic fundamentalism its founding charter commits the group to the destruction of israel and the establishment of an islamic state in all of historic palestine17 hamas rejected the oslo accords boycotted the 1996 elections and has waged an intermittent terrorist campaign to undermine the peace process its military wing the izz aldin alqassam brigades18 has carried out hundreds of terrorist attacks since 1993 killing more than 500 israelis the us state department has designated hamas as foreign terrorist organization fto hamas owes much of its popularity to an extensive social services network supported by donations from palestinians other arabs and international charitable front groups it funds schools orphanages mosques healthcare clinics soup kitchens and sports leagues in the west bank and gaza fatahs political hegemony inside the occupied territories was undermined by the inability of the plo and later the pa to coopt or incorporate hamas which proved more resistant than its secular rivals to the plos inducements the independence of this islamic group has created constant sense of ambivalence as to where the center of gravity in palestinian politics lies particularly between 2000 and 2004 the popularity of hamas began to increase as fatahs fell hamas made strong showing in series of municipal elections held between december 2004 and december 2005 still most observers were surprised by the scale of hamass victory in the january 2006 legislative election hamas won 74 of the 132 seats in the plc19 fatah won 45 seats and smaller parties claimed the remainder hamass popular vote victory was far narrower 44 to fatahs 41 most observers believe that the hamas victory was function of several factors including complicated mixed electoral system that rewarded hamass better organization and party discipline disaffection among younger marginalized political activists and general disenchantment with fatah over its inability to deliver peace and good governance20 yet despite the electoral setback observers point out that fatah has done little to purge its ranks of corrupt discredited officials or adopt norms of honesty and transparency in order to regain the publics trust one scholar noted that fatah party leaders seem to be more intent on shortterm maneuverings against hamas and each other than the longterm viability of the party21 16 israel assassinated yassin on march 22 2004

clothes the decay of the palestinian authority and the international response carnegie endowment for international peace continued crs9 hamass decision to participate in the plc election may have intensified internal strife and threatened the organizations vaunted unity there appears to be split between hardliners such as hamas political chief khalid mishal who lives in exile in damascus and mahmoud zahhar gazan considered close to mishal and more pragmatic figures such as current prime minister ismail haniyeh observers differ however on how far such split may go those who believe hamas is wedded to its violent antiisraeli agenda point to its deeply held religious views as expressed in its charter written in 1988 the charter is explicit about the struggle for palestine being religious obligation it describes the land as waqf or religious endowment saying that one can abandon it or part of it in the charter hamas describes itself as distinct palestinian movement which owes its loyalty to allah and that strives to raise the banner of allah over every inch of palestine it calls for the elimination of israel and jews from islamic holy land and portrays the jews as evil citing antisemitic texts these observers also note that hamas leader is on record as sanctioning permanent recognition of israels right to exist side by side with an independent palestinian state or as expressing willingness to disarm or to stop attacks on israel and israelis or to make distinction between israeli soldiers and civilians22 other observers see hamas as more pragmatic evolving movement they note that hamas has already moderated its positions by participating in the 2006 plc election body created by the oslo accords which the group has long rejected and by expressing willingness to enter into longterm ceasefire or hudna with israel most importantly they say hamas signed the mecca accord in which it agreed to share power with fatah respect previous agreements signed by the plo and allow the plo to negotiate with israel and submit any agreement reached to the palestinian people finally they note that the plo also once terrorist group albeit secular one altered some of its tenets in the late 1980s and early 1990s under pressure from the united states and agreed to condemn terrorism recognize israels right to exist and negotiate for twostate solution other rejectionist groups several other small palestinian groups continue to reject the plos decision to recognize israel and negotiate twostate solution they remain active in the territories and retain some ability to carry out terrorist attacks and other forms of violence to undermine efforts at cooperation and conciliation the largest of these is the palestinian islamic jihad pij designated foreign terrorist organization that like hamas is an offshoot of the muslim brotherhood the pij estimated at 1000 members emerged in the 1980s in the gaza strip as rival to hamas inspired by the iranian revolution it combined palestinian nationalism sunni islamic fundamentalism and shiite revolutionary thought the pij seeks liberation of all of historical palestine through armed revolt and the establishment of an islamic state but unlike hamas has not established social services network formed political 21 continued june 2007 22 steven erlanger academics view differences within hamas new york times january 29 2006 crs10 party or participated in elections mainly for these reasons pij has never approached the same level of support among palestinians as hamas pij headquarters is in damascus and syria allows it to operate on its territory and during the syrian occupation in lebanon iran however is the pijs chief sponsor providing the group with almost its entire budget since 2000 the pij has conducted nearly 1000 attacks against israel killing scores of israelis23 the aqsa martyrs brigades is militant offshoot of fatah that emerged in the west bank early in the second intifada the group initially targeted only israeli soldiers and settlers but in 2002 began spate of attacks on civilians in israeli cities and in march 2002 was added to the state departments list of foreign terrorist organizations according to terrorism experts the group switched tactics to restore fatahs standing among palestinians at time when palestinian casualties were mounting hamass popularity was rising and fatah was tainted by its cooperation with israel during the oslo years most of the brigades members are believed to be members of the palestinian security forces the popular resistance committees prc is loose alliance of armed dissidents and militants that first appeared in the gaza strip in 2000 its founder jamal abu samhadana former member of fatah was killed in an israeli air strike in june 2006 the membership of the prc encompasses both the secular and islamic fundamentalist palestinian movements including fatah hamas and the popular front for the liberation of palestine exmembers of the pas preventive security organization also are reported to be active in the prc the group also has been implicated in the october 15th 2003 attack that killed three us diplomatic security personnel in the gaza strip the attack roadside bomb that destroyed the van the men were traveling in was claimed and then later denied by the prc in part to avenge the death of their leader samhadana in june 2006 the prc along with hamas and splinter group calling itself the army of islam launched raid on an israeli army post near the gaza strip killing two israeli soldiers and capturing third gilad shalit palestinian christians there are approximately 60000 palestinian christians living in the west bank gaza strip and east jerusalem about 2 of the population palestinian christians once made up some 810 of palestinian arabs but their numbers have been shrinking for several decades as disproportionate number of them have fled for economic and security reasons according to the state departments 2006 international religious freedom report for the occupied territories the pa does not have constitution but the basic law provides for religious freedom and the pa generally respects this right in practice since islam is the official religion of the pa islamic institutions and places of worship receive preferential treatment majority of palestinian christians are greek orthodox the remainder consist of roman catholic greek catholic protestant syrian orthodox armenian coptic maronite 23 for fuller discussion of the pij see terrorist group profile palestinian islamic jihad centra technology inc august 1 2006 crs11 and ethiopian orthodox denominations christians are concentrated primarily in the areas of jerusalem ramallah and bethlehem the 2006 religious freedom report draws attention to several issues that have negatively affected the christian community and that have raised congressional concern since 2003 the israeli government has confiscated land with some compensation generally offered but refused belonging to three catholic institutions in bethany for construction of the separation barrier israeli closure policies imposed by the government due to security concerns prevented tens of thousands of palestinians from reaching places of worship in jerusalem and the west bank including during religious holidays such as christmas and easter the pa failed to halt several cases of seizures of christianowned land in the bethlehem area by criminal gangs there have been credible reports in recent years that pa security forces and judicial officials colluded with members of these gangs to seize land from christians24 press reports in early 2007 noted that while christian leaders describe rise in attacks on christians and their property in the past year most blamed mounting stresses on palestinian society including growing unemployment and lawlessness rather than the hamasled government for the increase25 palestinian refugees of the some 700000 palestinians displaced during the 1948 arabisraeli war about onethird ended up in the west bank onethird in the gaza strip and onethird in neighboring arab countries they and their descendants now number 44 million many living in refugee camps in the west bank gaza jordan lebanon and syria26 jordan offered palestinian refugees citizenship but the remainder are stateless and therefore unable to travel they receive little or assistance from arab host governments and remain reliant on the united nations for food health care and education for political and economic reasons the arab host governments have been unwilling to allow the palestinians to assimilate into their countries even if they were able many of the palestinian refugees hold out hope of returning to the homes they left behind or possibly to future palestinian state according to many observers it is difficult to overstate the deep sense of dispossession and betrayal these refugees feel over never having been allowed to return to their homes land and property thus their presence exerts significant pressure on both their host governments and the palestinian leadership in the territories to seek solution to their claims as part of any final status deal with israel 24 for the text of the 2006 international religious freedom report for israel and the occupied territories see

concerns some in congress have questioned whether unrwa refugee rolls are inflated there is also concern that effort has been made to settle the refugees permanently or extend the united nations high commissioner for refugees mandate to include palestinian refugees unrwas crs14 defenders point out that unrwa periodically updates the rolls to try to eliminate duplication and that its mandate covers relief and social services but not resettlement at present many observers consider unrwa unique organization that is better left in place until way forward on the peace process can be found for many years congress has raised concerns about how to ensure that unrwa funds are used for the programs it supports and not for anything inappropriate such as terrorist activities some in congress have been concerned that refugee camps have been used as military training grounds the camps are not controlled or policed by unrwa but by the host countries concerns also have been expressed about the content of textbooks and educational materials used by unrwa with claims that they promote antisemitism and exacerbate tensions between israelis and palestinians unrwa responds that the host country not unrwa provides the textbooks and determines their content because students must take exams in host country degree programs in the 109th congress in 2006 congressman mark kirk introduced hr 5278 the unrwa integrity act which would have required that us contributions to unrwa be provided only if the president certified that unrwa among other things is subject to independent financial audits does not knowingly provide aid to any member of foreign terrorist organization and does not promote antisemitism in 2005 an amendment to hr 2745 the henry j hyde united nations reform act of 2005 would have

economic profile and issues section below political contacts which were regular and wide ranging during the oslo years culminated in intensive negotiations on final status agreement between july 2000 and january 2001 since then political interaction has been limited because of intifada violence which broke out in september 2000 and more recently the election of hamas in 2006 however prime minister ehud olmert has met several times with pa president abbas since december 2006 these meetings encouraged by secretary of state condoleezza rice as precursor to resuming peace negotiations initially focused on easing restrictions on palestinian movement and restoring law and order to the palestinian territories in october 2007 israeli and palestinian negotiating teams began meeting to discuss final status issues in an effort to reach an agreement in principle prior to ussponsored peace talks planned for november in the west bank idf soldiers regularly mount arrest operations to apprehend wanted palestinians or foil terrorist plots in gaza despite the fact that israel crs15 withdrew its settlers and soldiers in 2005 palestinian militants sporadically fire crude homemade rockets socalled qassam rockets at israeli civilian targets the rockets are inaccurate but occasionally lethal in 2006 over 800 rockets were launched into israel killing two israelis in 2007 two more israelis have been killed since the withdrawal most of the rockets have been fired by pij or prc operatives but hamas has claimed responsibility for some observers offer several explanations for the rocket attacks sometimes they appear to be designed as retaliation for idf operations in the west bank at others they seem intended to draw an israeli response in order to rally and unify warring palestinian factions since hamas seized control of the gaza strip in june 2007 israel has closed all border crossings allowing only food and medical supplies to enter the territory in september it declared the area hostile entity and authorized the disruption of power and fuel supplies to the strip in order to press hamas to end the rocket fire regional states and actors jordan west bank palestinians share common bloodline culture and history with jordan palestinians mostly refugees from the 1948 and 1967 arab israeli wars comprise an estimated 55 to 70 of jordans population jordan controlled the west bank from 1949 until israel seized it in 1967 in 1950 jordan annexed the west bank but in 1988 in the midst of the first intifada and growing palestinian demands for selfdetermination jordan relinquished its claim to the territory however the late king hussein and his and successor king abdullah ii have remained deeply involved in championing the palestinian cause and urging negotiated twostate solution with israel at joint meeting of congress in march 2007 king abdullah called the need for just and secure peace in palestine the core issue in the middle east and urged renewed us commitment to this end in may 2007 the king invited some 200 palestinians israelis and jordanians to aqaba to discuss peace plans for the region28 in june 2007 pa president abbas reportedly requested that israel allow the badr brigade palestinian force loyal to fatah and stationed in jordan to return to the west bank to shore up his control following hamass takeover of gaza jordans relations with hamas are strained and since the 2006 hamas electoral victory the jordanian government has been placed in difficult position much of its citizenry sympathizes with hamas and jordans own islamist party the islamic action front reportedly maintains close ties to hamas however on april 20 2006 jordan reportedly cancelled planned visit by then palestinian foreign minister mahmoud zahhar who is also highlevel hamas official on the grounds that hamas had hidden weapons cache in jordan hamas denied the charge and claimed that jordan was using the allegation to justify cancelling the visit hamas had been expelled from jordan in 1999 shortly after king abdullahs ascension to the throne egypt president hosni mubarak has attempted to act as broker advisor messenger and arbitrator between palestinian factions in the hopes of galvanizing 28 ilene prusher newold idea for palestinian peace christian science monitor may 31 2007 crs16 them to take the necessary risks for peace in addition egypts intelligence chief omar suleiman has repeatedly met with hamas and pa figures in order to secure ceasefire arrangements with israel however press reports in may 2007 suggest egypt is growing increasingly frustrated by the palestinians inability to halt violence and restore order in gaza although egypt has often tried to steer neutral course in dealing with the palestinians most observers believe that hamass rise to prominence poses number of challenges for egyptian diplomacy in the region since the egyptian government has traditionally been at odds with its own domestic islamist groups according to israeli press reports egypt has begun barring senior hamas leaders from entering egypt due to concerns over their contacts with the muslim brotherhood29 in december 2006 and again in june 2007 several news outlets reported that egypt with the approval of the israeli government shipped ak47 rifles and large stockpiles of ammunition to fatahaffiliated groups in the gaza strip30 with intrapalestinian violence flaring in the gaza strip us israeli and egyptian officials sought to bolster forces loyal to pa president abbas in an unsuccessful bid to prevent hamas from seizing control there from egypts standpoint providing military support to one palestinian faction while in its interest could pose problems for the mubarak government egyptian public opinion may be somewhat sympathetic to hamas making public disclosure of overt egyptian support for antihamas groups an unwelcome development for the mubarak government on the other hand egypt derives certain political benefits as one of the few outside powers capable of acting as an intermediary between israel the united states and the palestinians following hamass takeover of gaza president mubarak hosted israeli prime minister olmert pa president abbas and jordanian king abdullah in sharm shaykh on june 25 2007 to show support for abbas syria and lebanon as noted some exiled leaders of hamas pij and other palestinian terrorist groups are based in syria according to the state departments most recent annual report on global terrorism country reports on terrorism 2006 published on april 30 2007 syria continues to provide political and material support for palestinian groups that have committed terrorist acts and allows them to maintain offices in damascus syria admits its support for palestinians pursuing armed struggle in israeli occupied territories but insists that these actions represent legitimate resistance activity as distinguished from terrorism syria also is home to some 400000 palestinians refugees most of whom live in unrwarun refugee camps among lebanons palestinian refugee population are several militias including some rejectionist groups opposed to the arabisraeli peace process in the past palestinian militias in lebanon were secular and in some cases marxist in outlook with little affinity for islamic fundamentalism more recently however some 29 barak ravid mubarak

laden and the late abu musab alzarqawi some have joined the insurgency in iraq while others have sought to turn lebanon into recruiting ground for terrorist activities relatively obscure palestinianassociated group known as fatah alislam has mounted the most serious challenge to the lebanese government numbering between 100 and 300 this group is variously described as having ties to qaeda or to syrian intelligence however syrian officials deny any links with it and maintain that they have pursued fatah alislam through interpol and other channels31 observers also differ on its composition some calling it palestinian organization and others saying its membership includes syrians saudis jordanians and other arab and nonarab nationals the organization is particularly strong among palestinian refugees residing in the nahr albared camp located near the northern lebanese city of tripoli in may 2007 lebanese police conducted raids against suspected fatah alislam hideouts in tripoli reportedly in pursuit of bank robbers fighting between lebanese army and police units on one hand and fatah alislam militia on the other spread to the nearby nahr albared refugee camp prohibited by 1969 agreement from entering palestinian camps the army besieged the camp and shelled militia positions in an effort to force the militia out the siege ended in early september after the army killed or captured almost all of the militants and the remainder fled saudi arabia prior to the election of the current hamasled government saudi support to the pa was estimated at 80 million to 180 million per year32 since hamas came to power in 2006 saudi support has been channeled through the office of president abbas in the past there have been reports of private saudi citizens and charities aiding hamas according to one 2003 press report at one time saudi benefactors contributed some 5 million to hamas per year or approximately half of its pregoverning annual operating budget33 past reports indicated that saudi authorities tolerated fund raising for hamas for example in may 2002 israeli officials citing captured palestinian documents said the saudi government had given money to 13 charities seven of which provided support to hamas then saudi government spokesman adel jubeir maintained that saudi government money goes to hamas directly or indirectly34 in 2007 saudi arabia has undertaken efforts to end the fighting between palestinian factions as well as the international aid boycott on the hamasled government in february 2007 king abdullah invited hamas and fatah leaders to mecca where they reached the mecca accord creating unity government in which 31 liz sly lebanons stability under fire qaedalinked group emerges as new threat chicago tribune may 22 2007 32 don van natta jr with timothy l obrien flow of saudi cash to hamas is under scrutiny by us new york times september 17 2003 33 ibid 34 ibid crs18 the two rivals agreed to share power the saudis continued their diplomatic push at the arab league summit in riyadh in march during speech at the summit saudi king abdullah called for an end to the international boycott of the pa in light of the agreement between fatah and hamas to form unity government in addition the summit communique relaunched the arab peace initiative of 2002 originally crafted by abdullah himself which calls for full israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967 creation of an independent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital and just agreed upon solution to the refugee problem in exchange all arab states would enter into peace agreements and establish normal relations with israel analysts speculate that the saudi diplomatic drive had several purposes first was to end the intrapalestinian violence and resume longstalled peace negotiations with israel second by securing arab and perhaps international recognition of government that included hamas and then relaunching peace talks with full arab backing the saudis hoped to bring hamas into the arab consensus moderate its antiisraeli ideology and ultimately get it to accept twostate solution finally by creating momentum toward peace the saudis were seeking to undermine the regional influence of iran and rejectionist groups like hezbollah iran and hezbollah since the early 1990s iran has supplied cash arms and training to hamas but most observers say the relationship has been an uneasy one iran has sought foothold in the palestinian territories while hamas jealousy guards its political and operational independence the relationship has been relatively unaffected by the widening rift between some sunni and shiite groups although hamas protested the december 2006 execution of saddam hussein by the shiiteled government of iraq since the international aid boycott was enacted iran has increased its assistance to hamas hamas officials visiting tehran in 2006 often returned carrying large sums of cash according to press reports the international monetary fund estimates that in 2006 some 70 million in cash was carried into the territories most of it thought to be from iran after visit to iran in december 2006 then palestinian prime minister haniyeh said iran had agreed to provide 120 million in assistance in 2007 and up to 250 million in total israeli security officials have warned of growing iranian influence in gaza the head of the israel defense force southern command maj gen yoav galant said in april 2007 he believes large number of iranian terror and guerrilla experts are operating in the gaza strip training palestinian terrorists35 other observers contend that claims of iranian influence in gaza are exaggerated primarily in order to influence us policymakers36 although hamas and the lebanese militia hezbollah are not organizationally linked and represent different constituencies palestinian sunni vs lebanese shiite hezbollah provides military training as

role model for hamas which has sought to emulate the lebanese groups political and media success moreover the two groups share the goal of driving israel from occupied territories and ultimately eliminating it both maintain close ties with iran on june 25 2006 palestinian gunmen including hamas members raided an idf position near gaza killing two israeli soldiers and capturing third on july 12 under cover of massive shelling of town in northern israel hezbollah forces crossed the international border from lebanon into northern israel and attacked two israeli vehicles killing three soldiers and kidnaping two hezbollah thereby opened second front against israel ostensibly in support of hamas sheikh hassan nasrallah hezbollahs leader suggested that the hezbollah operation might provide way out of the crisis in gaza because israel had negotiated with hezbollah indirectly in the past even though it refuses to negotiate with hamas now he said that the only way the soldiers would be returned would be through prisoner exchange37 the european union the european union eu has been the largest donor to the pa since its creation in the mid1990s the focus of eu aid had been on longterm institution building and development assistance but more recently has shifted to humanitarian assistance the eu joined the united states in banning direct assistance to the pa after the election of the hamas government in 2006 in july 2006 the eu established temporary international mechanism tim to channel aid directly to palestinians bypassing the hamasled government through world bank account european donations or social allowances are paid directly into the bank accounts of some palestinian public sector workers and other needy families the tim also provides essential services in the gaza strip through fuel deliveries to hospitals and clinics as well as by maintaining water and waste water treatment facilities38 following the establishment of the palestinian unity government eu officials met with nonhamas members of the pa government but left in place the ban on direct aid the eu has had some success in forging consensus on its approach to the israelipalestinian conflict over the last few years the eu views resolving the israelipalestinian conflict as key to reshaping the middle east and promoting stability on europes periphery moreover eu member states are committed to maintaining common eu policy on this issue to boost the credibility of the unions evolving common foreign and security policy the eu joined the united states in announcing resumption of aid to the pa in june 2007 after abbas dissolved the hamasled unity government and set up an emergency government without hamas 37 lebanon hezbollah leader holds news

council and the general assembly have worked to carry out their charter functions40 some observers have asserted that debate and resolutions on these issues are intended only to criticize and target israel others on the other hand have viewed the united nations as necessary ingredient or factor in any solution leading to lasting stability for the region41 the security council as the organ with primary responsibility in the maintenance of international peace and security has worked to bring an end to any immediate conflict and to set agreedupon longrange principles and goals the general assembly has passed resolutions to reflect the views of majority but not necessarily all of the international community since 1947 the general assembly has annually passed at least one resolution relating in some way to arabisraeli or palestine issues the numbers of resolutions adopted each session slowly increased after the 1967 sixday war and leading up to the 1973 yom kippur war when the assembly passed resolutions dealing with human rights and with conditions in the occupied territories resolutions adopted after 1973 also focused on palestine and on the plo with the assembly granting observer status to the plo in 1974 declaring that zionism is form of racism in 1975 and broadening plo palestine rights as observer in the assembly in 199842 the general assembly held special sessions on palestine in 1947 and in 1948 the remaining assembly special sessions on these issues have 39 this section was written by marjorie ann browne specialist in international relations 40 the 1945

arabisraeli or palestine issues the security council adopted fewer numbers of resolutions on these issues in part this was because the united states used its veto to prevent adoption of resolutions it viewed as onesided or unbalanced the veto was used in the council in approximately 25 percent or 53 of 210 cases to prevent adoption of resolution on issues involving the arabisraeli disputes or palestine44 over the years organs have set up number of bodies or offices as well as five peacekeeping operations which had mandates or functions directly related to palestine or the arabisraeli

main contributors to the 20002005 crisis fiscal crisis in 2006 following the establishment of the hamasled pa government israel and the international donor community took series of measures that triggered drastic reduction in pa revenues and drove palestinian society deeper into poverty and crisis israel began withholding tax and customs revenues that it collects on behalf of the pa and imposed more severe restrictions on the movement of palestinian people labor and goods on security grounds western donors suspended direct financial support to the pa budget and began channeling humanitarian aid through international and nongovernmental organizations and in some cases directly to palestinian families as economic activities in the west bank and gaza declined due to the crisis domestic tax revenues dropped correspondingly finally arab and international banks fearing possible litigation under us antiterror law refused to provide lending facilities to the new pa government to help cover the shortfall the pa had to curtail spending pa employees were estimated to have received 5055 of their normal salaries in 2006 according to the international monetary fund imf and world bank46 the israeli government for security reasons has hindered the free movement of palestinian people labor and goods within and between the west bank and gaza as well as across borders since the 1990s employing checkpoints roadblocks curfews and border closures these restrictions were intensified both in number and complexity after the outbreak of the second intifada they physically hindered the flow of economic transactions raised the cost of doing business and often left palestinians unable to export goods for days or weeks at time including perishable fruits and vegetables key palestinian export in 2006 israel further tightened restrictions on movement especially after june 25 attack in which palestinian gunmen killed two israeli soldiers and captured third usbrokered

goods improved slightly at karni in the first quarter of 2007 the crossing has remained closed since june when hamas fighters seized control of the gaza strip the suspension of gaza trade will further

the impact of the 2006 fiscal and access crisis on palestinian living conditions has been severe according to the imf and world bank the palestinian economy declined in 2006 with real gdp falling between 5 and 1049 an increase in official and private aid flows cushioned the impact of the decline somewhat unemployment is now estimated at 25 19 in the west bank and 35 in gaza however even those with jobs are often making due with substantially less as noted the estimated 165000 pa employees in gaza the pa employs 73000 or 40 of gazas work force received only about half of their salaries in 2006 teachers have been striking off and on since september 2006 to protest unpaid salaries hospitals regularly run out of essential medical supplies and are often able to provide more than emergency treatment poverty levels already 44 at the beginning of 2006 have risen finance minister salam fayyad in april 2007 estimated that nearly twothirds of gazans are living below the poverty level50 according to report 34 of palestinians are food insecure with income below 168 per day andor showing decreasing food expenditures an additional 12 of palestinians are vulnerable to food insecurity51 current issues in uspalestinian relations hamas takes power the first hamas government after winning majority of seats in the january 2006 palestinian legislative election hamas formed government without fatah which initially refused to join hamasled coalition on april 7 2006 the united states and the european union announced they were halting direct aid to the hamasled pa government but that humanitarian aid would continue to flow through international and nongovernmental organizations israel also began withholding about 50 million in monthly tax and customs receipts that it collects for the pa in 2005 international assistance and the israelicollected revenues together accounted for nearly 75 of pa revenues the resulting fiscal crisis left the hamasled government unable to pay wages regularly and deepened poverty levels in the palestinian territories by the end of 2006 tensions in the west bank and gaza strip were rising as living conditions deteriorated and pa employees including members of the security forces went unpaid for weeks or months armed supporters of fatah and hamas clashed repeatedly in gaza trading accusations of blame settling scores and drifting into

establishing palestinian state on all the lands that were occupied in 1967 with jerusalem as its capital and at the same time affirmed the palestinians right to resistance in all its forms and to defend themselves against any ongoing israeli aggression the government committed to respect previous agreements signed by the plo but did not explicitly renounce violence or recognize israel the government platform stated that any peace agreement reached would have been submitted for approval to either the palestine national council the plo legislature or directly to the palestinian people in

measure of law and order in the strip although sometimes with heavy hand the courts are not functioning because judges and prosecutors are refusing to work under the hamas regime hamas officials

2003 three us security guards were killed in gaza when their vehicle was destroyed by roadside bomb in what appears to have been targeted attack the popular resistance committees shadowy group of dissidents and militants operating in gaza claimed and then later denied responsibility political economic and security reform58 because of the late palestinian president yasir arafats preference for cronyism duplicate lines of authority and controlled chaos over order calls for pa reform have been heard from palestinian activists since the late 1990s59 sustained international efforts to press for pa reform emerged following president bushs june 2002 speech in which he explicitly tied movement toward palestinian statehood with pa reform within weeks of the presidents speech key donors led by the united states formed the task force on palestinian reform which established series of specific benchmarks against which pa performance was evaluated emboldened palestinian legislators and civil society activists made the issues of reform and anticorruption dominant theme in palestinian political discourse these internal and external pressures led to the appointment of the wellrespected former imf official salam fayyad as minister of finance in june 2002 the plc rejection of arafats proposed cabinet deemed insufficiently reformminded in september 2002 and the creation of the post of prime minister designed specifically to curb arafats power in march 2003 the first prime minister was mahmoud abbas the current president abbas quit the post after just four months because arafat refused to yield key powers envisioned for the prime minister now as president abbas fired prime minister haniyeh over their power struggle in gaza elections viewed by all as an integral component of the reform agenda from the outset created conundrum for the international community as well as for palestinians despite rhetorical commitment to democratic processes the bush 58 much of this section

ambivalent about holding palestinian presidential elections while arafat was alive for their part arafat and his inner circle were reluctant to schedule longoverdue legislative or local elections which they feared might result in repudiation of their rule the problem was only resolved by arafats death in november 2004 in accordance with the palestinian basic law presidential election was held in january 2005 municipal elections followed later that year and legislative election was held in january 2006 arafats penchant for establishing competing lines of authority and playing rivals off against one another led to proliferation of palestinian security forces as many as 22 by one count60 reformers in the palestinian territories and abroad have called for reduction in the number of security forces the removal of leaders notorious for the violation of human rights and the creation of hierarchical chain of command although arafat replaced some securityforce leaders neither he nor his successor abbas has shown the willingness to undertake the complete reform that is needed during the tenure of the hamasled government the problem worsened as hamas established yet another force the executive force in gaza in february 2005 the bush administration named lieutenant general william ward as us security coordinator for gaza to help the palestinians reform and rehabilitate their security forces and support israels forthcoming withdrawal from the gaza strip following the pullout the administration provided 23 million in nonlethal assistance to the palestinian security services and police to facilitate their assumption of security responsibilities in these areas the equipment purchased included vehicles riot gear and basic provisions an additional 12 million in usaid funds was used to set up community policing initiative but that program was suspended when the hamas government was established lt gen keith dayton replaced ward in november 2005 so far neither dayton nor the administration has commented on how the hamas takeover of gaza will affect his mission congressional responses us foreign assistance61 most us assistance to the palestinians is provided through

emergency government in the west bank the united states announced it was resuming assistance to the pa current restrictions since fy2003 annual foreign operations appropriations laws have contained several restrictions on assistance to the palestinians including limitation on assistance to the pa which bans direct assistance to the pa unless the president submits waiver to congress citing that such assistance is in the interest of national security limitation on assistance for the plo which bans aid to the plo us aid has ever been provided to the plo restriction concerning jerusalem which bans using us funds for new office in jerusalem for the purpose of conducting diplomatic business with the palestinian authority over gaza and jericho restriction concerning palestinian statehood which bans us assistance to future palestinian state unless the secretary of state certifies among other things that the leadership of the new state has been democratically elected is committed to peaceful coexistence with israel and is taking appropriate measure to combat terrorism the president can waive the certification if he determines that it is important to us national security interests

gaza program which calls for annual audits of all us assistance to the west bank and gaza strip in order to ensure that funds are not being diverted to terrorist groups since fy2005 annual foreign operations appropriations have also contained prohibition on funds for any program that would recognize or otherwise honor individuals who commit or have committed acts of terrorism recent legislation section 550 of pl 109234 the fy2006 emergency supplemental appropriations act prohibits us aid to the pa but provides the president waiver authority to grant some assistance to the office of the president of the palestinian crs30 authority mahmoud abbas provided among other things that such assistance will not benefit or be retransferred to hamas and that the president consult congress and provide written policy justification for use of the waiver upon signing pl 109234 into law on june 15 2006 president bush asserted that since the presidents constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and take care that the laws be faithfully executed cannot be made by law subject to requirement to consult with congressional committees or to involve them in executive decisionmaking the executive branch shall construe the references in the provisions to consulting to require only notification62 on december 21 2006 president bush signed into law pl 109446 the palestinian antiterrorism act of 2006 which bars aid to the hamasled palestinian government unless among other things it acknowledges israels right to exist and adheres to all previous international agreements and understandings it exempts funds for humanitarian aid and democracy promotion it also provides 20 million to establish fund promoting palestinian democracy and israelipalestinian peace the law limits the pas representation in the united states as well as us contact with palestinian officials in signing statement the president asserted that these and several other of the bills provisions impinge on the executive branchs constitutional authority to conduct foreign policy and he therefore viewed them as advisory rather than mandatory63 the final bill reflected many of the provisions of the senate version of the bill the original house version hr 4681 passed on june 23 2006 was seen by many observers as more stringent as it would have made the provision of us aid to the pa more difficult even if hamas relinquishes power in march 2007 representative ileana roslehtinen introduced hr 1856 the palestinian antiterrorism act amendments of 2007 which would amend the original act to further restrict contact with and assistance to the pa hr 2764 the fy2008 department of state foreign operations and related programs appropriations bill passed by the house on june 22 2007 in addition to the restrictions listed above includes provision prohibiting any funds or previously appropriated funds being used for security assistance in the west bank and gaza until the secretary of state reports to the appropriations committees on the extent of palestinian compliance with benchmarks including maintaining law and order fighting terrorism and countering qassam rocket launches established for such assistance during floor debate by 39030 vote the house adopted an amendment offered by congressman mike pence that would prohibit the disbursement of 635 million in the bill for the palestinian territories unless the administration certifies that the pa recognizes israel renounces violence and accepts previous agreements with israel the senate version of the bill passed by the senate on september 6 2007 includes 75 million in aid for the west bank and gaza and does not include the additional restrictions contained in the house version 62 for text of the
