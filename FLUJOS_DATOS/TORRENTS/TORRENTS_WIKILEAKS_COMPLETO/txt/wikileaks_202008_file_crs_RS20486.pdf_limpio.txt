accountability in administering its trust funds ross w gorte natural resource economist and senior policy analyst resources science and industry division summary the usda forest service has numerous permanently appropriated trust funds and special funds that provide substantial funding independent of the annual appropriations process critics have alleged abuse of the funds and have sought greater congressional oversight and the general accounting office has testified on the agencys management of some of these accounts while the administration has offered few responses to the criticisms of these funds it has in its fy2001 budget request proposed creating two new trust funds and combining several existing funds into new fund with expanded purposes this report provides an overview of the permanently appropriated forest service accounts and concerns over their use and proposed alternative structures that could provide greater public and congressional oversight and control over permanently appropriated funds this report will be updated if events warrant overview and concerns the forest service has 18 permanently appropriated accounts providing substantial funding for agency programs 22 in fy1998 independent of annual appropriations1 nine accounts had more than 25 million in budget authority in fy2000 for total of 628 million in descending order of fy2000 budget authority the nine accounts are the timber salvage sale fund to recover from timber purchasers the cost of preparing salvage sales including necessary roads and administering harvests 1279 million in fy2000 the knutsonvandenberg kv fund originally to collect funds from timber purchasers funds to reforest and improve timber stands and since 1976 also to mitigate and enhance other resources in timber sale areas 1156 million in fy2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20486crs2 2 for more information see crs report rs20178 forest service receiptsharing payments proposals for change the spotted owl payments to

in fy2000 the national forest roads and trails 10 fund originally to supplement appropriations for road construction and since 1999 also to supplement appropriations for forest health improvement 260 million in fy2000 the brush disposal bd fund to collect from timber purchasers funds to reduce the hazards from the limbs and tops left following timber harvests 259 million in fy2000 and the recreation fee demonstration program to collect from recreation users funds to maintain and restore recreation facilities and sites 250 million in fy2000 these accounts have two major purposes as described above to compensate local governments for the taxexempt status of the national forests and to fund various specific agency activities within the national forests the 25 payments to states have been criticized as providing insufficient andor inappropriate compensation and legislation to alter this program has been introduced and has passed the house2 in contrast to the compensation accounts the permanent funds for agency activities have been widely criticized both for alleged misuse of the funds and for the agencys poor accounting of their performance in the past three years the

otoole to write reforming the forest service washington dc island press 1988 and then to cooperate with an array of interests environmentalists industry and others to develop the alternative financing and governance ideas presented in 2nd century options for the forest service in august 1999 the national academy of public administration presented recommenda tions on forest service fiscal management and accounting in restoring managerial accountability to the united states forest service the agency has argued that the accounts are necessary tools for effective resource management although better fiscal accounting and management are needed3 in its fy2001 budget the administration announced its intent to offer legislation to create three new permanent accounts one of which addresses the concerns cited above the healthy investments in rural environments hire fund to reform the forest services trust fund system to reduce the backlog of road and recreation maintenance and reconstruction fire suppression and forest health projects while funding work currently performed under the trust funds using baseline of funds from the treasury the land acquisition reinvestment fund to acquire environmen tally valuable lands using funds from increased authority for land sales and the facilities acquisition and enhancement fund to build new facilities and acquire environmentally sensitive lands from new authority to sell facilities buildings constructed features and land in excess of the agencys needs situations that have led to the concerns the existing permanently appropriated accounts were created for specific purposes the kv fund for example was established to assure adequate funding for reforestation and other needed work on timber sale areas following timber harvests it was expanded in 1976 to allow timber receipts to be used to mitigate damages to resource values in timber sale areas the salvage sale fund was established to assure recovery of the direct costs from lowvalue salvage sales deposits for other cooperative work were authorized to ensure that cooperators eg timber purchasers funded the necessary subsequent agency activities eg road maintenance needed because of logging truck traffic such reasoning underlies most if not all of the permanent accountshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20486crs4 one issue concerns the use of permanent accounts to fund activities beyond the intent of the original authorizing legislation the kv fund for example is longer restricted to funding reforestation of the timber sale area from which the funds were collected instead they can now be used on any sale area in the national forest where they were collected and sale areas the entire area within the boundaries of the sale not just the area where trees are cut have been expanding to allow broader use of kv funds in addition the 1976 amendment allowed kv funds to be used to enhance resource values not just to reforest timber sale areas in 1999 the administration proposed allowing the use of deposits to the kv fund and other accounts anywhere in the national forest system to reduce hazardous fuel loadings these several changes including amendments to the original authorization as well as the implementing rules reduce accountability for achieving the performance originally intended by congress when it established the kv fund in 1930 because they establish multiple competing purposes with forest service discretion to allocate funds among those purposes and virtually limit on the level of the deposits up to the total amount of money received from the timber sale critics have expressed concerns about funds with multiple authorized purposes when one activity generates the receipts notably the kv fund this fund receives portion of the revenues from most timber sales which can then be allocated to timber purposes eg reforestation andor other purposes eg watershed improvement critics assert that some managers might support damaging activity eg timber sale because it generates local funds for other desired activities eg wildlife habitat improvement others argue that mitigating damages or improving site conditions is an appropriate use of the timber receipts another situation is the disposition of excess collections where the deposits are more than was actually needed to perform the authorized task several accounts including the kv fund the salvage fund other cooperative work and the bd fund specify that any excess collections are to be transferred to the general treasury the managers have incentive to identify excess collections since the money is effectively lost to the treasury and cannot be used by the agency there have been numerous charges of misuse but until recently congressional oversight has been limited some of the authorities for the existing permanent accounts attempt to provide quite specific directions for the use of the funds the salvage sale fund for example was created in 14h of the national forest management act of 1976 to cover the cost to the united states for design engineering and supervision of the construction of needed roads and the cost for forest service sale preparation and supervision of the harvesting of such timber other uses of the salvage sale fund are apparently not authorized similarly the act establishing the bd fund states purchasers of national forest timber may be required to deposit the estimated cost to the united states of disposing of brush and other debris resulting from their cutting operations however even accounts with narrowly written laws have been criticized as being used for unauthorized purposes for example gao reported that 27 of fy1997 expenditures from five accounts ranging from 934 and including the salvage sale and bd funds were used for overhead costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20486crs5 4 in 1947 responding to request from the secretary of agriculture to allow use of kv funds to pay adminis trative costs the comptroller general of the united states wrote in view of the matters outlined above there would appear to be reasonable basis for the view that the kv fund established under the act of june 9 1930 properly may be charged with part of the cost of the services referred to indirect costs and objection to such practice will be interposed by this office b67619 dec 3 1947 gao thus determined that some indirect costs could properly be paid from deposits to the kv fund comparable letters may exist for other forest service accounts although none has been identified 5 see randal otoole reforming the forest service washington dc island press 1988 and paul w hirt conspiracy of optimism management of the national forests since world war two lincoln nb univ of nebraska press 1994this prompted widespread criticism from members and legislation hr 4149 of the 105th congress to restrict such use which had been endorsed by gao in 1947 as appropriate4 structures to achieve the intended results various proposals have been offered to restructure the permanently appropriated accounts to increase the likelihood that they fulfill congressional intent efficiently one option that has been suggested would be to eliminate the accounts ie to require annual appropriations for all agency activities or at least to require annual approval for spending any of the deposits in special account probably in the appropriations bill both would increase congressional control over expenditures for various purposes and the latter might also increase congressional oversight of revenues and deposits however some argue that this is difficult choice between hoping that congress will fund the desirable programs in annual appropriations and trusting the agencys discretion to fund desirable programs from the permanent trust funds some critics have suggested that congress has not provided balanced funding to achieve the desired outputs from and desired conditions in the national forests5 another structure for achieving specific purposes on specific sites would be for the statute that authorizes deposits to permanent account to narrowly specify the level of deposits the activities and sites on which they could be used and the amount of overhead costs which could be paid that would probably be most efficient and effective if there were causeandeffect relationship between the sources and uses of the funds such as using harvest receipts to pay for reforestation needed because of the timber harvest that second structure would require some means to minimize excess collections some have suggested that an external organization oversee the collections and determine when collections are excessive simpler suggested approach might be to require that collections not used for the authorized purposes on the appropriate sites be returned to the depositor that approach could work effectively for deposits by timber purchasers for the kv fund salvage sale fund bd fund and some other cooperative work timber purchasers would have an interest in assuring that the forest service minimized the funds used since any unused funds would be returned it might also encourage purchasers to alter their timber harvesting operations to reduce the subsequent site preparation and reforestation expenses devising sufficiently clear statutory language for contractual arrangement and to prevent litigation on each timber sale could be difficult that might also require relatively precise accounting for receipts and expenditures for each timber salehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20486crs6 6 the migratory bird conservation commission 16 usc 715a might be useful analogy this commission composed of three administration officials and four members of congress is authorized to review us fish and wildlife service recommendations for land purchases using the permanentlyappropriated migratory bird conservation fundwhich provided deposits to the special account on the other hand simplification might also be feasible for example if site preparation from the bd fund were combined with reforestation from the kv fund that approach would benefit from very close linkage both geographically and causally between the sources and uses of the funds with limits on the allowable use of the funds and external or independe nt oversight of those uses for some of the existing funds notably the reforestation trust fund the 10 roads and trails fund the recreation fee demonstration program and the resource enhancement and stand improvement activities of the kv fund the conceptual link between the activities that generate the funds and those on which the funds are used is obscure and developing connection that would be transparent might be difficult an alternative approach suggested by randal otoole and others in 2nd century options for the forest service would be to deposit fixed share of receipts eg 10 to special fund such funds could then be used on specified activities and allocated to address identified priorities with oversight by an advisory group to assure that the priorities and funded activities fulfill the intent of the program6 that would not establish close geographic and causal links but it would fund specific activities and focus on priority needs with oversight by interested parties although the financial stake of depositors who were refunded excess collections would be missing conclusion critics have alleged that the forest services permanently appropriated trust funds have been abused funding unauthorized activities and providing inappropriate incentives for agency managers such alleged abuse could result from the structure of the specific funds but could also result from inadequate oversight minimal oversight in turn could at least partly result from nontransparent financial management practices and other inadequate performanceaccountability measurement and reporting various options have been suggested to address the concerns including terminate the funds and require annual appropriations for all activities require annual appropriations to spend money from the funds authorize and test new governance and funding structures although this generally addresses the entire agency not just the permanent funds establish direct causeandeffect linkages between fund sources and uses with independent oversigh t to assure performance and prevent excess collections and centralize collections and allocate funds to achieve priority needs with independent oversight however any changes in the permanent trust funds and special funds would require legislation which would likely be controversial because of the numerous local state and national interests involved
