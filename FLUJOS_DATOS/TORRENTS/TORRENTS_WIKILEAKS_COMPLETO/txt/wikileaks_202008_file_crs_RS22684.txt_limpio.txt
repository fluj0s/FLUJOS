stability order code rs22684 updated july 2 2007 potential f22 raptor export to japan christopher bolkcom and emma chanlettavery foreign affairs defense and trade division summary japan has expressed interest in purchasing the f22a raptor aircraft from the united states although the export of the plane is now prohibited by us law congress has recently and may again consider repealing this ban arguments for the sale include httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22684 potential benefits to us industry contribution to the defense of japan and the region and promotion of us interoperability with the japanese military arguments against the transfer include concerns about technology proliferation and the potential for undermining regional stability this report will be updated as warranted background the f22a raptor1 is the us air forces and according to many observers the worlds most advanced manned combat aircraft developed principally to defeat soviet aircraft in airtoair combat the f22 exploits the latest developments in stealth technology to reduce detection by enemy radar as well as thrustvectoring engines for more maneuverability and avionics that fuse and display information from onboard and offboard sensors in single battlefield display current plans call for the us purchase of 183 f22s with the last aircraft being procured with fy2009 funds air force leaders say that they require 381 f22s but lack the funds to purchase 198 additional aircraft the debate over the export of f22s though not new has become more pointed as the end of procurement funding fy2009 and the closure of the assembly line nears the department of defense dod is officially neutral on whether the f22 should be exported but senior leaders have suggested that they favor foreign sales of the f222 however congress has expressed opposition to exporting the raptor in fy1998 fy2001 and fy2005 appropriation conferees wrote none of the funds made available in this act may be used to approve or licence the sale of the f22 advanced tactical fighter 1 for more information see crs report rs21848 air force fb22 bomber concept and crs report rl31673 f22a raptor 2 frank wolfe aldridge jsf letter hints at administration favor toward f22 foreign sales defense daily october 5 2001 crs2 to any foreign government3 this provision known as the obey amendment was debated in the 109th congress the house defense appropriations bill for fy2007 proposed to repeal the law but export opponents prevailed with the senate in conference4 japans defense policy for the united states its alliance with japan provides platform for us military readiness in asia about 53000 us troops are stationed in japan and have the exclusive use of 89 facilities throughout the archipelago okinawa hosting 37 of the facilities is the major us forward logistics base in the asiapacific region since roughly 2001 japan has developed more muscular foreign policy and forward defense posture including bolstering its military alliance with the united states5 highlevel usjapan bilateral initiatives declared an expanded commitment to security cooperation by establishing common strategic objectives outlining major command changes and calling for greater interoperability between the two militaries japans contributions to operations in afghanistan and iraq reinforced the notion of the alliance as one of the central partnerships of us foreign policy particularly in asia led by former prime minister junichiro koizumi and his successor shinzo abe japan has moved to retool its pacifist postworld war ii stance in december 2006 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22684 japans defense agency was formally upgraded to ministry for the first time since world war ii and the ruling party has approved referendum process to amend the constitution including the warrenouncing article 9 although article 9 states that land sea and air forces as well as other war potential will never be maintained the japanese selfdefense forces are in practice wellfunded and wellequipped military japan faces challenging regional context both direct and potential security threats as well as suspicion from other states that changes to tokyos defense policy indicate return to its militarist past north korea poses particularly acute and proximate threat to japan heightened by pyongyangs missile and nuclear device tests in 2006 historical enmity and contemporary competition for influence with china makes beijings military modernization worrisome for japanese defense planners the japanese sdf has detected periodic chinese military activities in areas surrounding japans outlying islands including submarine incursion in 2004 close to okinawa and fleet of warships near disputed gas field tokyo also faces difficult relations with south korea because of koreans distrust of japan based on the memory of japans 40year annexation of the peninsula and some territorial disputes issues for congress the executive branch

relations issues for congress 6 for more information see crs report rl33696 conventional arms transfers to developing continued crs3 environment in east asia and questions that are specific to domestic interests factors that argue for transfer include potential benefits to us industry contribution to the defense of allied countries and promoting us interoperability with those countries factors that argue against particular arms transfer include the likelihood of technology proliferation and the potential for undermining regional stability7 us industrial base exporting f22s to japan is one way to keep the f22 production line running after us air force procurement ends lockheed martin the f 22 prime contractor estimates that it employs 3351 f22 workers at three plants marietta ga fort worth tx palmdale ca many others are also employed by major subcontractors pratt whitney and boeing and by companies that produce f22 parts and subcomponents generally speaking promoting employment in the aerospace sector is beneficial to the us economy however some aerospace jobs are more important to promoting us industrial competitiveness than others at this stage of production more f22 employees are involved in aircraft assembly which is relatively rote and unskilled compared to the design and engineering skills required earlier in the aircrafts development and initial production keeping the f22 production line open by building aircraft for japan would also help the prime contractor reduce peraircraft costs because httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22684 labor and manufacturing processes become more efficient over time and because sunk costs such as rd or capital investment would be amortized over larger number of aircraft dod and us taxpayers would only benefit from reduced peraircraft costs however if the air force were to purchase more f22s after those produced for japan and in addition to the 183 aircraft currently planned final industrial base issue pertains to the f35 joint strike fighter jsf although originally intended to be complementary aircraft f22 and jsf capabilities development and production have converged implicitly if not explicitly these aircraft are competing for scarce procurement funds extension of f22 production would likely bring these aircraft into even sharper competition technology transfer air force leaders have consistently touted the f22 as the worlds most technologically advanced and capable fighter aircraft protecting us intellectual property in these technologies and denying access by adversaries is high national security priority it is unclear whether the united states and japan could come to terms on the capabilities to be offered in the export variant of the f22 japan would likely want an aircraft the same as or similar to that flown by the us air force japan would likely prefer to license or comanufacture the aircraft which gives them more opportunity to acquire engineering and design knowledge and technology transfer presumably dod would desire to export less capable aircraft in part to protect key technologies and would have strong aversion to license or coproduction japan has traditionally placed great value in developing industrial defense autonomy that is 6 continued nations 19982005 and crs report rl33758 us arms sales agreements with and deliveries to major clients 19982005 7 in the late 1980s congress debated and denied dod request to codevelop fighter aircraft with japan based on the f16 falcon some of the issues weighed during that debate may be relevant today crs report 90986 japanese fsx fighter controversy out of print available upon request crs4 indigenous weapons production although this imperative has relaxed somewhat in recent years as cooperation with the united states has increased8 the potential for technology transfer touches upon both military and economic concerns unlike some countries japan does not have track record of reexporting technology that it acquires through import however an inadvertent leak of us technology or knowledge could also be threat the recently reported leak of secret data associated with the aegis weapon system by japanese military personnel is an example of this potential danger9 japan is military ally but also an economic rival many of the f22 technologies or industrial processes could have commercial application some may be concerned that f22 technology or knowledge could find their way into myriad of japanese products to the competitive detriment of us industry second proliferation issue relates to the effect potential f22 sale could have on other countries other countries in the region could perceive the f22 as causing an imbalance of military power in favor of japan and inciting them to seek their own advanced aircraft or defensive systems once japan sets the precedent of f22 export other countries might pressure on us policy makers to sell them f22s israel for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22684 example has reportedly expressed interest in the f22 interoperability and interdependence recent bilateral agreements aim to expand the benefits of the alliance by increasing the interoperability of the us and japanese militaries therefore multiplying their collective capability several joint facilities are planned including an air operations coordination center at yokota air base to be operational by 2010 japans acquisition of the f22 would boost the interoperability mission because both militaries could use identical stateoftheart equipment because of the us security guarantee to japan japans possession of the f 22s may allow the united states to rotate its own aircraft out of the region when necessary similarly by fielding the f22 japan could make up for the deficit of 198 raptors the us air force says it needs but cannot afford despite these ambitions however achieving true interoperability is difficult task constitutional legal and normative constraints limit sdf participation in many of the operations and training that traditionally integrate different national forces increasing the sophistication of bilateral training requires funding and facilities currently under pressure because of sdfs budget requirements language barriers and differences in military doctrine also present challenges in addition localities affected by the noise of military bases particularly those hosting aircraft have been vocally opposed to many of the troop realignment proposals opposition among okinawan residents is particularly strong regional security china and south korea have voiced concern about japans intention to upgrade its military capabilities largely grounded in suspicions that japan will inch toward returning to its pre1945 militarism some analysts caution that selling the f22s to japan could destabilize the region by angering seoul and beijing possibly 8 richard j samuels give take the outlook for usjapan defense industrial cooperation armed forces journal february 1 2006 9 high barriers for introduction of f22 asahi news june 4 2007 from the daily summary of japanese press us embassy public affairs section crs5 even sparking an arms race and contribute to an image of japan becoming americas proxy in the region the sale could complicate the us effort to manage the relationship with china south korea has already registered its unease at japan acquiring f22s and suggested that it may seek deal to purchase the aircraft in order to match japans capabilities10 the ussouth korean alliance has been strained in the past several years due to diverging approaches to dealing with north korea and some south koreans see improved us defense ties with japan as coming at their expense japanese defense officials have pointed to chinas acquisition of increasingly sophisticated air capabilities to justify their request for the f22s asserting that chinas modern air fleet will soon dwarf japans despite the recent warming of relations between tokyo and beijing the two nations remain wary of each others intentions although the risk of military confrontation is considered small there is the potential that territorial disputes over outlying islands could escalate into armed clashes or that conflict could break out in the taiwan strait between the united states and china which could involve japan for this reason some us and japanese commentators have supported the sale of f22s to japan as necessary to maintain the taiwan balance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22684 japanese restraints japan faces an array of legal and budgetary concerns about enhancing its military raising questions about whether tokyo could follow through on an f22 sale under selfimposed ban on exporting arms japan cannot in principle participate in joint development that requires it to export weapons parts and research data to other countries this ban has been loosened to allow japan to work on missile defense with the united states but the issue remains contentious japans aversion to military export led to tokyos decision not to participate in the international consortium to co develop the f35 joint strike fighter second legal issue that could generate debate in japan and therefore affect the sale is the question of whether the f22 is an offensive weapon under the current interpretation of the japanese constitution the sdf is only allowed to possess defensive capability military aircraft are almost inherently flexible weapon systems and can be difficult to classify as offensive or defensive they can be used in primarily defensive roles such as defending indigenous airspace from attack or to attack an adversarys homeland or air forces when the f22 program was threatened by congressional budget cuts advocates argued that its offensive capabilities mandated its continuation consistent emphasis on the f22s ability to penetrate contested airspace and destroy enemy defenses could lead many to believe that the raptor is primarily an offensive weapon at 42 billion 2006 japans defense budget is among the largest in the world however japanese leaders are under pressure to stem government spending overall and many ministries face budget cuts as part of ongoing fiscal reform defense spending in japan has traditionally been capped at 1 of gdp most leaders are wary of surpassing that symbolic benchmark although the cap is not law tokyos defense expenditures include ongoing host nation support for us forces stationed in japan totaling 110 10 currently the korean air force plans to acquire 39 f15ks from boeing by next year and then develop 20 more f15klevel fighter jets from 2010 through 2012 crs6 billion from 1978200711 and an estimated 20 billion for the realignment of us troops in the region based on these burdens some analysts have voiced concerns that the sdf runs the risk of becoming hollow force because of its insufficient procurement system budget pressure is likely to remain high in japan due to the demographic reality of an aging and shrinking population with shortage of workers potential alternatives to the f22 there appear to be at least five us alternative combat aircraft to the f22 for japan each aircraft presents strengths and weaknesses in terms of operational capabilities and also visavis the security proliferation and industrial base issues outlined in this report f35 joint strike fighter jsf the jsf was designed from the beginning as multinational aircraft technology transfer issues remain but their resolution will likely be far easier than those presented by the f22 while the jsf is not as fast or nimble as the f22 its radar and avionics are more advanced the jsf may be well suited to japans selfdefense requirements while presenting less offensive capability httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22684 fa18ef super hornet the fa18ef super hornet is the most capable fighter aircraft flown by the us navy it does not offer stealth technology like the f22 or jsf but is expected to be in the active inventory through at least 2020 and will retain its combat edge through upgrades and modifications the super hornets manufacturer boeing recently signed its first export deal with australia f15 eagle the f15 eagle has been the us air forces top fighter aircraft since it was fielded in the 1970s today japan operates 203 f15 aircraft by purchasing additional f15 aircraft instead of importing new type of fighter japan could potentially realize economies of scale savings in training maintenance and supplies by operating larger fleet the f15 is not as capable as the f22 or jsf but if upgraded and operated in conjunction with support aircraft such as awacs and electronic warfare aircraft might be sufficiently capable to meet japans needs unmanned combat aerial vehicles ucav another alternative would be to develop or import ucav uavs such as the usaf predator are relatively well established weapons platforms but limited compared to uavs designed from the beginning as combat platforms while advocates believe that ucavs represent the future of combat aviation true dedicated combat uavs have not yet been fielded pursuing ucavs versus manned aircraft could be perceived as either avant garde or premature european options japan could import an advanced combat aircraft from sweden the jas gripen russia su30 flanker and mig29 fulcrum series or from consortium of european countries the eurofighter typhoon japan has relied almost exclusively on us military imports in the past and many believe it unlikely that it would import from nonus sources purchasing european aircraft however would allow japan to establish second source of technology and thus some autonomy from the united states and european governments would be expected to offer very attractive terms to penetrate the heretofore closed japanese market 11 cia world factbook japan cia 20070315
