code rs21195 updated december 11 2006 evolutionary acquisition and spiral development in dod programs policy issues for congress gary j pagliano and ronald orourke specialists in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21195 the department of defense dod in 2001 adopted new approach for developing major weapon systems called evolutionary acquisition with spiral development easd as its preferred standard easd is intended to make dods acquisition system more responsive to rapid changes in military needs easd poses potentially important challenges for congress in carrying out its legislative functions particularly committing to and effectively overseeing dod weapon acquisition programs this report will be updated as events warrant background origin and aims of easd dod in 2001 adopted new approach for developing new weapon systems called evolutionary acquisition with spiral development easd as its preferred standard easd which is referred to informally though not entirely accurately as spiral development is an outgrowth of the defense acquisition reform movement of the 1990s and is part of dods effort to make its acquisition system more responsive to rapid changes in threats technology and warfighter needs it is also intended to increase dods control over program costs dod programmanager accountability and participation of hightech firms in dod weapon acquisition programs dods goals in using easd are to get useful increments of new capability into the hands of us personnel more quickly take better advantage of user feedback in refining system requirements and developing subsequent increments of capability mitigate technical development risk in weapon programs that are to employ new or emerging technologies and facilitate the periodic injection of new technology into weapons over their life cycles so as to better keep pace with technological changes crs2 description of easd under dods previous weapon acquisition method now known as single step to full capability ssfc dod would first define specific performance requirement to be met and then work usually for period of more than 10 years in the case of complex weapon system like an aircraft or ship to develop and build design that upon first deployment was intended to meet 100 of that requirement the core idea of easd is to set aside the quest for 100 fulfillment of the requirement in the initial version of the weapon and instead rapidly develop an initial version that meets some fraction for example 50 to 60 of the requirement field experience with this initial version is then be used to develop later versions or blocks of the weapon that meet an increasing fraction of the requirement until version is eventually developed that meets the 100 standard figure 1 below details the process for each block each block includes four phases for conceiving developing producing and sustaining ie supporting weapon system each phase is governed by certain acquisition rules and regulations including entrance and exit criteria and is subject to the requirements process including the initial capabilities document icd and capability development document cdd each block includes its own acquisition contracts and fully funded budgets for defined time period httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21195 figure 1 the 5000 acquisition model utilizing evolutionary acquisition and spiral development as shown in figure 1 spiral development occurs as the second phase within block spiral development is an iterative process for developing weapon systems capabilities in which the developer tester and user to interact with one another so as refine ie spiral down to specific understanding of the systems operational requirements spiral interaction can change the course of systems technology development although easd differs from ssfc in its use of block development from the outset of program from programmanagement perspective easd is similar in some areas to ssfc including the development milestones and reviews that are used at each development stage easd however is intended to be more flexible than ssfc in terms of permitting changes in programs requirements or development path resulting from crs3 changes in threats technology or warfighter needs easd is also intended to be more flexible than ssfc regarding entry points into the acquisition process under ssfc the dominant entry point was the beginning under easd in contrast programs can enter various phases of any block b or c in figure 1 depending on the maturity of the program under easd the final desired capability of the system can be determined in two ways at the beginning of the program with the content of each deployable block determined by wellunderstood ie mature key technologies or along the way with the content of each block determined by success or failure in developing lesswellunderstood ie emerging technologies or the evolving needs of the military user applying easd at the outset of large weapon acquisition programs such as the ballistic missile defense program can create significant initial uncertainty regarding the design and ultimate cost of the systems that will eventually be procured under the program the number of systems to be procured and the schedule for procuring them applying easd to other programs particularly those intended to develop more uptodate subsystems for improving existing weapons such as the f16 fighter or m1 tank can produce much less uncertainty regarding the programs ultimate outcome httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21195 programs using easd although dod used easd for years on somewhat limited basis dod decided in 2001 that easd would henceforth be the preferred ie standard or default acquisition strategy for all types of weapon acquisition programs newly initiated programs existing programs for developing new weapons and programs for upgrading weapons already in existence easd was elevated in prominence that year when dod announced that it was applying easd to its ballistic missile defense program1 and that the navys program for new family of surface combatants would be an easd program2 several defense programs are now using easd the ballistic missile defense program is more complex case than others because it includes multiple weapon systems some existing and some in initial development in different phases and blocks of development in addition although the ballistic missile defense program has embraced most of the easd model notably the possible absence of ultimate cost and timeline projections it differs from other programs being pursued under easd because it operates under different oversight rules instituted in january 2002 by defense secretary rumsfeld gao report november 2003 general accounting office gao report on easd prepared at the direction of the senate armed services committee see legislative activity section below concluded the following 1 statement of lt gen ronald t kadish usaf director ballistic missile defense organization on the ballistic missile defense program amended fy2002 budget before the senate armed services

navy ddg1000 ddx and cgx ship acquisition programs oversight issues and options for congress by ronald orourke and crs report rl33741 navy littoral combat ship lcs program oversight issues and options for congress by ronald orourke crs4 dod has made major improvements to its acquisition policy by adopting knowledgebased evolutionary practices used by successful commercial companies if properly applied these best practices can put dods decision makers in better position to deliver highquality products on time and within budget the next step is for dod to provide the necessary controls to ensure knowledge based evolutionary approach is followed for example the policy does not establish measures to gauge design and manufacturing knowledge at critical junctures in the product development process without specific requirements to demonstrate knowledge at key points the policy allows significant unknowns to be judged as acceptable risks leaving an opening for decision makers to make uninformed decisions about continuing product development dod was responsive to the requirements in the defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 see legislative activity section below this gao report makes recommendations that the secretary of defense strengthen dods acquisition policy by requiring additional controls to ensure decision makers will follow knowledgebased evolutionary approach dod httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21195 partially concurred with our recommendations dod believes the current acquisition framework includes the controls necessary to achieve effective results but department officials will continue to monitor the process to determine whether other controls are needed to achieve the best possible outcomes dod agreed it should record and justify program decisions for moving from one stage of development to next but did not agree with the need to issue report outside of the department3 issues for congress easd poses potential issues for congress regarding dod and congressional oversight of weapon acquisition programs some of these issues appear to arise out of uncertainty over how easd differs from the ssfc approach others appear to arise out of the features of easd itself dod acquisition policy and oversight one issue for congress addressed in the gao report is whether dod has established adequate rules and regulations for conducting internal oversight of easd programs some observers have expressed concern about this issue particularly with regard to the spiral development phases of programs in support of this concern they have cited budget justification documents for the ballistic missile program which have included some references to block development but have provided incomplete information on how much funding is spent for specific blocks over what period of time and on what progress has been made to date in each block supporters of easd argue that dod is fully aware of the need for adequate oversight and will take steps to ensure that it is provided potential questions for congress include how does dod oversight for easd programs compare to dod oversight of ssfc weapon acquisition programs in terms of frequency 3 us general accounting office defense acquisitions dods revised policy emphasizes best practices but more controls are needed washington 2003 november 2003 gao04 53 p 23 crs5 and nature of reviews information required to be submitted to reviewing authorities and evaluation and reporting by reviewing authorities will dod oversight procedures and review bodies be the same for all easd programs or will they vary from program to program congressional program commitment and oversight another issue for congress is how to carry out its responsibility to allocate defense spending easd poses potentially significant issues for congressional oversight particularly for newly initiated weapon acquisition programs in three areas ambiguous initial program description programs initiated under easd may not be well defined at the outset in terms of system design quantities to be procured development and procurement costs and program schedule these are key program characteristics that congress in the past has wanted to understand in some detail before deciding whether to approve the start of new weapon acquisition program easd can thus put congress in the position of deciding whether to approve the start of new program with less information than it has had in the past httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21195 lack of welldefined benchmarks corollary to the above is that congress may not years later have welldefined initial program benchmarks against which to measure the performance of the military service managing the program or the contractor funding projections potentially more volatile although projections of future funding requirements for weapons acquisition programs are subject to change for various reasons funding projections for easd programs may be subject to even greater volatility due to each programs inherent potential for repeated refinements in performance requirements or technical approaches as result any longrange projections of future funding requirements for easd programs may be even less reliable than projections for systems pursued under the ssfc approach supporters of easd argue that it can improve congressional oversight of dod weapon acquisition programs because the information that dod provides for given program will focus on the specific block that is proposed for development over the next few years this information they argue will be more reliable and thus better for congress to use in conducting its oversight role than the kind of longrange information that used to be provided under the ssfc approach under ssfc dod provided information about the entire projected program stretching many years into the future such information supporters of easd argue may appear more complete but is not very reliable because it requires projecting program related events well into the future dods history in accurately projecting such events they argue is far from perfect as result they argue information provided in connection with an ssfc weapon acquisition program can give congress the illusion but not the reality of understanding the outlines of the entire program on the other hand critics of easd contend that it has the potential for drawing congress into programs to point where extrication becomes difficult if not impossible and without clear idea of programs ultimate objectives crs6 potential questions for congress and dod regarding congressional oversight of easd programs include the following what might be the impact on congressional approval of new weapon acquisition programs and subsequent congressional oversight of those programs of having limited initial detail in terms of system design quantities to be procured procurement schedules and total costs how might congressional oversight of weapon development programs be affected if program information with longer time horizons but potentially less reliability is exchanged for program information with potentially greater shortterm reliability but without previously available if imperfect estimates of full program costs to what extent might dods new preference for easd be influenced as some critics contend by the knowledge that it might relieve dod of the responsibility for providing specific answers to congressional questions regarding system architecture effectiveness time lines long term strategic implications and cost legislative activity httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21195 fy2007 defense authorization act hr 5122pl 109364 section 231 of hr 5122pl 109364 conference report hrept 109702 of september 29 2006 would among other things require dod to review and revise policies and practices on weapon test and evaluation in light of new acquisition approaches including programs conducted pursuant to authority for spiral development granted in section 803 of pl 107314 see below or other authority for conducting incremental acquisition programs fy2004 defense authorization bill hr 1588s 1050 in its report srept 10846 of may 13 2003 page 346 on s 1050 the senate armed services committee expressed support for incremental acquisition and directed gao to assess current acquisition policies and regulations and to determine whether 1 the policies support knowledgebased evolutionary acquisitions 2 the regulations enforcing these policies provide the necessary controls to ensure the departments intent is followed and 3 the policies are responsive to concerns expressed by the committee in pl 107314 as discussed above gao submitted the required report in november 2003 fy2003 defense authorization act hr 4546pl 107314 section 802 of the conference report hrept 107772 of november 12 2002 on the fy2003 defense authorization act hr 4546pl 107314 of december 2 2002 required dod to report on how it planned to apply to easd programs certain statutory and regulatory requirements for major dod acquisition programs section 803 set forth conditions to be met before dod acquisition program can be pursued as an easd effort and required dod provide annual status reports for the next five years on each research and development program being pursued under easd section 132 required the air force to submit to congress list of programs that it had designated as acquisition reform pathfinder programs set forth conditions under which those programs can proceed and applied to them the requirement for filing status reports established under section 803 these provisions are also discussed on pages 455456 and 667668 of the report the senate armed services committee in its report srept 107151 of may 15 legislative day may 9 2002 on the fy2003 defense authorization bill s 2514 included similar provisions and commented extensively on the easd process see pages 94 and 333335
