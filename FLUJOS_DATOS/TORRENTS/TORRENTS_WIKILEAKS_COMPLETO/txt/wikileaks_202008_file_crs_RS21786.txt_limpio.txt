labonte and philip winters government and finance division march 2 2005 abstract the federal budget deficit in fy2004 was 36 of gross domestic product gdp when the influence of economic conditions and temporary factors is excluded from the measurement of budget balances the fy2004 deficit was 26 of gdp by either measure the deficit is above the historical average for the last 50 years the fy2004 deficit represents dramatic turnaround from the fy2000 surplus of 24 of gdp most of this turnaround can be traced to fall in receipts from 50year high of 209 of gdp in fy2000 to 45year low of 163 of gdp in fy2004 in percentage terms tax cuts accounted for approximately 45 of the decline in the federal budget balance between fy2000 and fy2004 the downturn in the economy and temporary factors were responsible for about 38 of the deterioration in federal finances while increases in federal outlays as percentage of gdp were responsible for another 17 order code rs21786 updated march 2 2005 crs

deterioration in federal finances while increases in federal outlays as percentage of gdp were responsible for another 17 this report presents historical data and will not be updated concern over the federal budget deficit has prompted growing debate in congress over how the budget turned from surpluses into deficits and what can be done to restore balance1 review of the historical data on federal receipts outlays and deficits can help identify the forces that led to the current situation using standardized budget data this report makes peak surplus 2000 to peak deficit 2004 comparison to separate policy contributions to the deficit from economic factors this report addresses two specific issues first how do expected fy2004 federal receipts outlays and the resultant deficit compare to historical averages second what factors caused the federal budget to change from surplus in fy2000 to deficit in fy2004 1 the economic effects of the budget deficit are discussed in crs report rl31235 the economic effects of the federal budget deficit by brian cashell congressional research service the library of congress crs2 historical data on federal receipts outlays and budget balances figure 1 shows total federal receipts as percentage of gross domestic product gdp over the fy1955 to fy2004 time period budgetary totals as percentage of gdp provide the best measurement of fiscal balance over long periods of time because they correct for changes in the price level and growth in the economy as shown in figure 1 over the last 50 years federal receipts have averaged about 181 of gdp however there has been great deal of fluctuation around the average over time the largest change as share of gdp has occurred over the last five years when receipts fell from 50year high of 209 of gdp in fy2000 to 45year low of 163 of gdp in fy2004 which is 18 percentage points below the 50year average standardized receipts are explained on page 3 figure 1 federal receipts as of gdp fy19552004 24

federal outlays as percentage of gdp over the last 50 years outlays have averaged about 20 of gdp the figure shows that there was an upward trend in federal outlays as percentage of gdp between fy1955 and fy1983 since fy1983 there has generally been downward trend in outlays as percentage of gdp between fy1992 and fy2000 federal outlays continuously declined as percentage of gdp reaching 184 of gdp in fy2000 in fy2001 federal outlays as percentage of gdp began to rise again and by fy2004 they reached 198 of gdp about equal to their 50year average as these two figures show the deterioration in the budget balance since fy2000 is largely the result of falling receipts not increases in outlays as percentage of gdp during this period receipts fell from 209 of gdp to 163 of gdp decline of 46 percentage points while outlays rose from 184 of gdp to 198 of gdp an increase of 14 percentage points crs3 figure 2 federal outlays as of gdp fy19552004 24 23 22 21 20 of gdp 19 18 outlays 17

gdp and outlays rising as percentage of gdp has caused the budget balance to turn from surplus of 24 of gdp in fy2000 to deficit of 36 of gdp in fy2004 the average budget balance over the fy1955 through fy2004 period has been deficit of 19 of gdp thus the budget deficit in fy2004 is 17 percentage points larger than the 50year average but these data give indication whether the fall in receipts and rise in spending were policy induced or the result of the economic slowdown when gdp growth slows tax receipts tend to fall as the growth in income slows and mandatory spending on certain programs such as unemployment insurance automatically rises without any change in policy to distinguish the effect of economic and policy changes on the budget the congressional budget office cbo calculates standardized budget measure that strips out the economic and temporary effects2 this is done by estimating what receipts and outlays would be if the economy were at full employment with its labor and capital resources fully employed3 the standardized budget measure makes other adjustments for temporary phenomena such as changes in capital gains realizations the effects of changes in inflation on interest payments on the national debt timing changes in federal payments and receipts and so on 2 see congressional budget office the cyclically adjusted and standardizedbudget measures march 2005 3

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21786 the previous three figures also show standardized receipts outlays and budget balances as percentage of gdp for the fy1962 to fy2004 period as the figures illustrate part of the volatility over time is result of changing economic conditions and temporary factors rather than policy changes standardized receipts and outlays show that annual deviations from the longrun averages that result from policy changes are smaller than the actual data would suggest for example on standardized basis the fy2004 budget deficit is 26 of gdp the standardized budget deficit which strips out economic effects shows that the fy2003 and fy2004 deficit would still be well above the historical average even if there had not been an economic slowdown changes in the budget balance fy2000 to fy2004 table 1 shows the effects of policy changes and economic conditions on receipts outlays and the budget balance between fy2000 and fy2004 if the economy were at full employment and other temporary factors were removed the standardized estimate cbo estimates that receipts would equal 165 of gdp in 2004 almost the same as actual receipts in fy2000 cbo estimates the economy was above full employment economic output and therefore tax revenue was unsustainably high standardized receipts were 193 of gdp in fy2000 while actual receipts were 209 of gdp the difference between the decline in actual receipts and standardized receipts represents the effect of the economic downturn and temporary factors on receipts in this case actual receipts fell by 46 percentage points and standardized receipts fell by 28 percentage points economic conditions were therefore responsible for about 18 percentage points of the total decline in actual receipts 46 percentage points less 28 percentage points in percentage terms this is about 39 of the decline in actual receipts crs5 additionally the change in standardized receipts gives rough estimate of the effects of policy changes on federal receipts because economic and other temporary factors have been stripped out hence policy changes tax cuts reduced federal receipts by 28 percentage points of gdp 61 of the total revenue

significantly larger than the scoring of legislative changes to the tax code by the joint tax committee jct and cbo at the time the tax cuts were enacted it was estimated that the three tax cuts enacted between 2001 and 2003 pl 10716 pl 107147 and pl 10827 would cost about 265 billion or 23 of gdp in 2004 compared to the 28 of gdp decline in standardized receipts from 2000 to 2004 forecast by cbo unlike the revenue side there is straightforward way to make comparison of policy changes affecting outlays over time because spending levels for discretionary programs are determined by annual appropriations number of different measurements of outlays could be considered to be current policy including keeping spending constant increasing spending at the rate of inflation or increasing spending at the rate of population growth in this report keeping spending constant as percentage of gdp is used to make comparisons over time using any of the other measures would attribute 4 there is third potential cause of changes in revenue over time holding the tax code and the business cycle constant the same tax code will yield different amount of revenue at different times because of changes in the composition of gdp for example if greater proportion of gdp is devoted to preferentially taxed activities eg fringe benefits vs wages over time the same tax code will yield less revenue this factor should be unimportant over short periods of time in fact there are factors at work that would lead the same tax code to yield more revenue over time because of real bracket creep rising income leads to higher average effective tax rates with the same statutory rates relatively faster income growth among high income cohorts also leads to higher average effective tax rates with the same statutory rates and because some parts of the tax system are not inflation adjusted notably the alternative minimum tax nominal changes in income lead to higher real taxes crs6 greater proportion of the change in overall fiscal balances to spending as can be seen in figure 2 spending as percentage of gdp shows clear upward or downward trend over the entire 50year period and that measure would therefore have made better projection of policy in the long term than the other three measures which would have consistently underpredicted spending levels between fy2000 and fy2004 actual outlays increased from 184 to 198 of gdp change of 14 percentage points policy effects changes in standardized budget outlays accounted for 11 percentage points 79 of the total increase in outlays subtracting changes in standardized outlays from changes in actual outlays shows that 03 percentage points 21 of the increase was due to the economy and other temporary factors5 combining outlays and receipts the actual budget balance changed from surplus of 24 of gdp in fy2000 to deficit of 36 in fy2004 change of 60 percentage points the standardized budget changed from surplus of 11 of gdp in fy2000 to deficit of 26 in fy2004 change of 37 percentage points subtracting changes in standardized budget balances from changes in actual budget balances shows that 23 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21786 percentage points 38 of the deterioration in the budget balance was due to the economy and other temporary factors thus policy changes primarily tax cuts were responsible for 62 the deterioration in the budget balance since fy2000 tax cuts accounted for 45 28 percentage points and the increase in outlays resulting from policy changes accounted for 17 11 percentage points of the overall deterioration absent policy changes the budget would have stayed in surplus despite the recession6 these figures overstate the contribution of outlay changes to increases in the deficit because policy changes that increase the deficit increase the interest payments on the debt which are counted as an increase in outlays whether the policy change affects receipts or outlays the recent series of tax cuts accounts for about twothirds of the increase in interest payments caused by policy changes 5 in the case of mandatory spending not all increases in spending are result of policy changes some changes are the result of changes in eligibility among recipients eg more retirees eligible for social security benefits the standardized increase in mandatory spending between fy2000 and fy2004 was 05 percentage points of gdp since legislative changes to mandatory programs since 2000 have been estimated to cost 05 of gdp in 2004 it appears that most of the change in mandatory spending is due to legislation not eligibility changes 6 it is possible that policy changes between fy2000 and fy2004 caused economic growth and other macroeconomic variables to differ from what they would have been in the absence of policy changes this report does not attempt to measure that effect
