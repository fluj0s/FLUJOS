subject ambassadors meeting with michel rocard ref paris 7195 classified by ambassador craig r stapleton for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary former prime minister michel rocard received ambassador stapleton october 24 fresh off the earlyoctober publication of his new book if the left had known and recent trip to china rocard sees the november congress of his socialist party ps as historic opportunity offering historical perspective rocard stated that the ps unlike its main counterparts in europe has never cut itself off completely with the ideology and politics of rupture with capitalism when in power dealing with the world as it is the ps has been forced to modernize this was particularly true during the five years 19972002 lionel jospin led the party and government when out of power it is pulled back by the romanticism of its marxist roots rocard described his historic role in the party as that of the leader of the modernizers in the tradition of jean jaures leon blum and pierre mendesfrance he was hopeful that at the mans congress in november the socialists would make the final break from the past and emerge as unified social democratic party rocard was reluctant to pronounce on the socialists stable of presidential contenders but was skeptical that jospin would emerge to rally the party to victory too many can not forgive him for having deserted the ship when he abruptly announced his retirement the morning after his defeat in the first round of the 2002 presidential elections rocard expressed the fear and loathing of nicolas sarkozy that is common currency on the left dominique villepin is more acceptable alternative on the right even if he mistakes himself for napoleon when he is in fact cyrano bergerac rocard who did not support the war in iraq said that if he had been president he would have privately explained his views to president bush but then would have remained with the us rocard long chastised by some as the american in the party pronounced antiamericanism minority sentiment historically linked to the communists and gaullists he advocated joint effort in the form of europeanamerican thinktank to identify and address common emerging challenges end summary 2 c rocard like former president valery giscard destaing reftel believes that french history provides the keys for understanding french politics and frances policies rocards point of departure is frances emergence as nationstate the history of other european nationstates is that of linguistic communities serving their trade needs france created itself by destroying five cultures breton occitan alsatian corsican and flemish we are the only european nation which is the military creation of nonhomogeneous state this makes france difficult to govern to this day this explains our difficulty in reforming our slowness he said 3 c the socialist party and its historic resistance to embrace social democracy is case in point rocard contrasted the ps with european counterpart parties noting that in most countries social democratic party can expect about 35 to 42 percent of the national vote in france however the ps can only count on about 18 to 22 percent with the communists taking about 7 to 8 percent and parties of the extreme left roughly equal number the need to work with the communists the far left and the unformed wing of the ps makes it difficult to have feasible realistic economic policies rocard pointed out that in the 25 eu member states only the ps among the main parties of the european left had split and majority of its electorate opposed over the proposed constitutional treaty 4 c rocard stressed the importance of the upcoming november party congress the french media insist on focusing on it only as it pertains to the fortunes of the wouldbe presidential candidates while the congress will have an impact on individual candidacies its significance will depend on its success in defining the program even the identity of the party amidst debate and soulsearching stirred up by the referendum rocard listed three important questions for the party to resolve are we social democrats are we europeans do we admit at last that the market economy is not only reality but necessity while he thought it possible and in his view essential that the congress will answer each question in the affirmative this is not foregone conclusion the party leadership had taken the right approach in deciding to address the policy issues before proceeding to the selection of candidate it has created an opportunity for the socialist party to finally emerge as modern social democratic party comparable to the spd in germany or labor in britain such clarifying result would represent the break from the past that rocard has long sought that said more tepid result was possible given the strength of the traditionalists including those now centered around laurent fabius 5 c rocard clearly did not wish to be drawn out on the merits or demerits of the possible socialist candidates for the presidency in 2007 replying to the ambassadors question on how the ps could transcend its normal 18to22percent electoral take in the first round of presidential elections and furnish winning presidential candidate rocard cited the need for charismatic candidate and an attractive platform this winning combination would produce sufficiently strong showing in the first round so as to obviate the need to negotiate with the communists and far left thereby increasing its appeal to the moderate center in the second round 6 c noting media effort by allies of lionel jospin to position the former prime minister as the only figure who could rally the fissiporous left rocard was skeptical rocard in fairminded assessment of jospin cited his historic contribution of opening up the party in the postmitterrand period modernization that was cut short by the defeat in 2002 he cited jospins honesty but saw it as political liability jospin cant bear lying he is straight and honest man to the point of rigidity he refuses to make unfillable promises to the electorate despite jospins virtues his abrupt departure after his defeat in the first round of the 2002 elections was viewed by too many in the party and among its supporters as an act of desertion in the hour of the partys and countrys greatest need this would likely disqualify him for another run at the presidency 7 c rocard was more voluble when discussing the two presidential rivals on the right he compared prime minister villepin favorably to interior minister and union for popular movement ump president nicolas sarkozy even if villepin had gained notice by his 2003 speech before the security council not pleasant association for the us it is sarkozy whom we should fear villepin knows the limits of power sarkozy by contrast has traveled little has minimal foreign language ability and only meager interest in international issues he employs language when addressing illegal immigrants that rocard characterized as borderline racist in short sarkozy is not safe in his respect for human rights hes not pen but hes danger to the balance of the french republic in its practice of human rights by contrast villepin shares our common values concerning human right in addition he is someone who would never mistake those who are allies with those who are not sic 8 c rocard however also expressed his anger at villepin for the 2003 unsc speech which he thought had been counterproductive particularly with respect to thensecretary powell we should have been supporting powell instead villepin pushed him into corner rocard said that if he had been president of france at the time he would have written four or five page letter to president bush at the outset setting forth his misgivings over military solution the letter would have remained confidential once the us decided to proceed against iraq sipdis however he would have remained silent and not led international opposition as chirac and villepin had done rocard joked that villepin identifies with napoleon whereas he is in fact more cyrano bergerac character he is the inheritor of proud french oral tradition we like to talk if you want silent partner you should be dealing with the finns instead 9 c rocard emphasized to the ambassador the importance of not conflating the loud french antiamericanism espoused by the communists and gaullists with the proamerican sentiment felt by most french people please dont forget he said that antiamericanism has never won majority here he criticized the us however for not having listened to friendly advice in the leadup to the iraq war the french who lost two colonial wars in indochina and algeria he said tried to warn the us that it would be unavoidable sociologically predictable that the iraqi factions would unite against the usg he emphasized however the necessity for the us to stay the course warning that iraq would descend into civil war if the us left before 20102012 11 c in response to the ambassadors question on the consequences for europe of the failure of the constitutional treaty rocard said he thought it less important than many believe and not too important to the us there is indeed resultant paralysis but not of the functioning of the eu rather it has incapacitated the creative energy and enthusiasm for the european project it kills the idea of political europe which you the us were afraid of and does not change thing in the integrated market he provided his assessment that the current administrations support for europe had been hesitant and for two reasons concern over the possible emergence of europe as military power separate from natous and increasing conflict over economic and commercial issues which was an unavoidable result of europes development as strong unitary player in the international economy 12 c rocard proposed joint europeanamerican thinktank which might fill current gap place where europeans and americans can together consider the challenges of tomorrow speaking of the growth of india and china along with all the other challenges confronting both of us he said we need vehicle where we can find solutions for these challenges together so when these monsters arrive in 10 years we will be able to deal with them please visit paris classified website at
