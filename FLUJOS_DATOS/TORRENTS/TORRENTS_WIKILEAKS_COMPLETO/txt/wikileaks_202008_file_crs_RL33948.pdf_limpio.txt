the supreme court struck down on foreign co mmerce clause grounds california state statute that applied an ad valorem propert tax on foreign cargo containers stating that more extensive constitutional inquiry is required in foreign commerce cases for two reasons 1 the enhanced risk of multiple taxation and 2 the possibility that the disputed measure may impair federal uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential or in other words may prevent the federal government from speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments8 the court made clear that if state tax contravenes either of these precepts it is unconstituti onal under the commerce clause9 in container corp of america v franchise tax board 463 us 159 194 1983 the c ourt upheld state income tax law at variance with federal policy indicating that state law ma have merely foreign res onances without implicating foreign affairs and stating that differing state tax law will violate the one voice standard if it either implicates foreign policy issues which must be left to the federal government or violates clear federal directive10 the court noted that the second of these factors is of course essentially species of preemption analysis11 the court later concluded in barclays bank plc v franchise tax board of california 512 us 298 1994 case examining california s incomebased corporate franchise tax that even state statute that may make it more difficult for the federal government to speak in solo international trade voice will be sustained if there is clear indication that congress had intende d to bar the state practice the court stated that container corporation and subsequent case wardair canada inc v florida dept of revenue 477 us 1 1986 in which the court upheld state tax on jet fuel purchased by foreign airlines suggest that congress may more passively indicate that certain state practices do not impair federal uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is ssential it need not convey its intent with the unmistakable clarity required to permit state regulation that discriminates against interstate commerce12 where congress has not clearly immuni zed state selective purchasing or divestment law for foreign commerce cl ause purposes arguments that the law impermissibly burdens foreign commerce13 may be countered by invocation of the

described by the supreme court in hines v davidowitz 312 us 52 1941 stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress23 in preemption cases

continueddepending on the nature of state stat ute and the type of federal action taken to deal with problematic foreign na tion opponents of sanc tions law may thus argue that absent express preemption stat law may conflict with federal laws and policies targeted at specific country with respect to the activities and persons covered or that there is reason to presume that congress intended that all state and local measures targeting par ticular country be preempted24 in response it might be maintained inter alia that federal limitations on the exercise of proprietary powers to contract and invest must be ex pressly intended or must result from highly pervasive federal scheme25 moreover state laws may arguably mandate consequences that differ fro m federal remedies or that

obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress as it undermines the intended purpose and nat ural effect of at least three provisions of the federa l act namely its delegation of effective discretion to the president to control economic sanctions against burma its limitation of sanctions solely to united states persons and new investment and its directive to proceed diplomatically in developing comprehensive multilateral strategy towards burma29 after rejecting the states argument that the law could not be preempted because it was based on the states spending power the court found that the law lacked the flexibility inherent in the federal statute the former had stringent application requirements and rmination provision while the tter authorized the president to lift federal measures in certain circumstances allowed him to prohibit new investment based on his own findings and provided waiver authority with regard to all sanctions imposed in the statute 30 the state law was also found to exceed federal authorities in covering most state contracts foreign and domestic firms and firms already operating in burma whereas the federal law imposed sanctions solely on us persons authorized prohibition on new investment only and exempted purchase and sales contracts from any ban31 finally the state law had impeded the presidents ability to pursue the multilateral strategy envisioned in the federal act the court citing formal protests from us trading partners world trade organization complaints and the distraction caused by the state law in discussions with foreign countries regarding the situation in burma32 finally the court rejected the states argument that in not expressly preempting the state law congress had implicitly permitted it the state noting that congress was aware of the massachusetts law when in adopted the federal burma statute in 1996 the court found that failure to pr ovide for preemption expressly may reflect nothing more than the settled character of implied preemption doctrine that the courts will dependably pply and citing hines that in any event the existence of conflict cognizable under the supremacy clause does not depend on express recognition that federal and state law may conflict33 the court found that in thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33948crs9 34 id at 388 35

europe during the nazi regime an executive agreement with germany signed by the president provided that the international commission on holocaust era insurance claims serve as the sole vehicle for voluntary insurance claims to reduce litigation between foreign nationals and german firms despite the lack of specific preemption clause the court citing the kid glove approach chosen by the executive branch evident in the german agreement as well as in similar agreements with austria and france and in executive branch statements supporting this approach determined that there was clear conflict between the policies adopted by the execu tive and the iron fist that california sought to use35 the court made clear that state law could be preempted by the presidents exercise of his inde

of any pension fund established under the code from investing in any entity unless the company managing the funds assets certif ied that the managing company had not transferred any assets of th illinois retirement system or pension fund to forbidden entity the statute ultimately required that none of the assets of the system or fund be invested in forbidden entities by the end of july 2007 for purposes of the pension amendments the term forbidden entity included not only the firms described above but also an publicly traded company that owned or controlled sudanrelated property or assets or engaged in other sudanrelated transactions and any nonpublicly traded company that fa iled to submit to the funds managing company sworn affidavit averring that the company did not own or control any sudanrelated property and di d not transactions business in sudan the statute was challenged on preemption foreign ffairs and foreign commerce grounds in reaching its decision the court set out federal law regard ing sudan beginning with 1997 executive order signed by pres ident clinton freezing sudanese property in the united states and prohibiting various transactions between the united states and sudan and continuing with three s ubsequent public laws the sudan peace act 2002 the comprehensive peace in sudan ac t 2004 and the darfur peace and accountability act 2006 none of these statutes contains provision addressing state law preemption and as noted earlier preemption provision in the house passed version of the 2006 enactment wa s not included in the final statute addressing the statutory preemption argu ment the court held that with respect to the amendment to the deposit of state moneys act the statutes lack of flexibility extended geographic reach and impact on foreign entities interferes with the national governments c onduct of foreign affairs and was thus preempted by federal law39 on the other hand the pension amendments were found not to be preempted since federal law di d not expressly address dive stment and in the courts view the potential effects of pension divestment on the national governments ability to conduct foreign policy are highly attenuated40 the court stated that it had not been presented with evidence suggesting that these pension funds inability to purchase the securities of such companies would be in any way likely to affect their decision to do business in that country and thus citing crosby it had not been shown that pension fund dive stment stands as an obs tacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectiv of congress with regard to sudan policy41httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33948crs11 42 id at 745 43 id 44 id 45 id at 747 46 id at 749 47 ill pub act 0950521 sb 1168effective august 28 2007 available at http wwwilgagov legislationpublicactsfulltextaspname0950521regarding foreign affairs preemption the court f ound scant prior case law on the issue but concluded that the amendm ents to the deposit of state moneys act would have an impact on the national governments ability to deal with sudan that is at least equal to or greater than the impact of the state laws in zschernig and garamendi 42 the court considered that the amendments might cause multinational companies to pull out of sudan resulting in real and direct effect on sudans economy and that they thus clearly had mor than an incidental or indirect effect in sudan43 noting as well the amendments substantive and direct impact on the national governments ability to carry out the flexible and measured approach to sudanese relations that cong ress and the president have created the court held that they interfered impermissibly with the fe deral governments power to conduct the nations foreign affairs44 at the same time the court held that the pension amendments did not improperly intrude on the federal foreign affairs authority finding that they did not place the same kind of pressure on firms to sever business ties with that country that flowed from the banking amendments and thus were not likely to affect firms willingness to do business in sudan because the court had already found th banking amendments unconstitutional on two grounds it did not consider them in light of the foreign commerce clause nevertheless it did find that there is little doubt that the conduct the illinois sudan act seeks to proscribe involves foreign commerce45 and that without the protection of the market participant ex ception the amendment to the pension code violates the foreign commerce clause46 the court found that to the extent that the state was exercising contro l over municipal pension f unds however it was acting as market regulator and that the market participant doctrine even if it were determined that the doctrine had role in foreign commerce clause cases was inapplicable in this situation with respect to the state s control of its own pe nsion funds the court held that even were it to find that the amendment was constitutional if only applied to these funds it could not sever the unc onstitutional portion of the statute and thus struck down the pension amendment as whole the state of illinois appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit it also enacted new s udanrelated divestment legislation which included repeal of th invalidated provisions47 in october 2007 the state moved to dismiss the appeal as moot and to vacate the district court judgment the court granted the motion and re manded on november 30

used in statutory preemption analysis justice souter suggests that state law shoul d be preempted under field preemption with or without action by the national government if th state acts in domain of foreign affairs not traditionally allocated to it in the event of conflict between the federal foreign policy interest and an act of state within its s phere of traditional competence that affects foreign affairs balancing test betw een the two interests might occur id at 420 n11 the court does not establish precise threshold although citing boyle v united technologies continuedsome future prospects where state or local sanctions are held to be preempted by federal statute congress could choose expressly to author ize such measures in new legislation48 it is also possible that subnational sanctions law could be written so as not to conflict with federal enactment where congress has not enacted sanctions against particular country state or local sanctions directed at that jurisdiction may be challenged on dormant fore ign affairs or foreign co mmerce clause grounds given that crosby did not address and thus did not foreclose or limit the use of these constitutional arguments at the same time questions remain as to the outcome of these arguments in particular case among them whether in foreign commerce clause challenge legislative silence woul d be construed as imp lied authorization of state sanctions law or instead as mani festation of an overri ding federal policy that particular country not be s ubject to restrictive us measures49 whether the market participant exception applies in fo reign commerce clause cases also remains unclear where state law is challenged as intruding into the federal foreign affairs power garamendi suggests that executive agreements or statements might preempt any state action despite lack of specific agreement language showing the intent to do so50 at the same time the court recommended following justice harlans standard from the zschernig case as minimum threshold for foreign affairs preemption that is that the state legisl ation should produce something more than incidental effect in conflict with express foreign policy of the national government51httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33948crs13 51 continued corp 487 us 500 507508 1988 it suggests that in an area of uniquely federal interest the conflict with
