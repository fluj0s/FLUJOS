state st atutes placed an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce clause of the united states constitution in each case the court upheld the statute finding th at the local benefits of the act outweighed the burden placed on those sending the unsolicited messages via email49 in state of washington v heckel the defendant resident of another state challenged washingtons restriction on unsolicited commercial email alleging that the statute placed an unconstitutiona l burden on interstate commerce50 t h defendant was an oregon resident who was charged with

recipient by contacting the registrant of the internet domain name contained in the recipients email address52 the defendant argued that the wash ington statute violated the dormant commerce clause of the constitution53 by discriminating against persons doing business outside the state the court reject ed this argument finding that the statute applies evenhandedly to ins tate and outofstate spa mmers and would be equally enforceable against washington resident engaging in the same practices54 the court then articulated the balancing test that must be applied when considering state statutes that may burden interstate commerce by stating that where the statute regulates evenhandedly to eff ectuate legitimate local public interest and its effects on interstate commer ce are only incidental it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive relative to the putative local benefits55 the court determined that the statutes local benefits surpass any alleged burden on interstate commerce thus rejecting the defendants challenge and upholding the statute56 in ferguson v friendfinders inc california resident filed suit against advertisers who were sending

court reversed the lower cour ts opinion and upheld the statute on appeal the defendants argued that the statute when viewed in the context of internet reality ttempted to regulate be yond californias

applied in heckel discussed above the court found that the state had substantial legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from the harmful effects of deceptive uce unsolicited commercial email
