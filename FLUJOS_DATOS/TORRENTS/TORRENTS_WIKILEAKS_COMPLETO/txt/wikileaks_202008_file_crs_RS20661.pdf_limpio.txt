section 211 of pl 10565 the fy1998 hud appropriations bill extended the streamlined downpayment program through fy1998 for loans insured in alaska and hawaii the conferees on the bill directed hud to study the proposal to streamline the downpayment formula and explain its impact if it were expanded to the continental united states hud was directed to exa mine how the proposed downpayment formula would favorably or adversely affect each st ate how it would impact the fha insurance fund whether it would improve homeo wnership opportunities for low and moderateincome families and whether it w ould cause inappropriate competition between fha and private mortgage insurance companies the study was to be completed by march 1 1998 but was co mpleted on april 21 1998 section 212 of pl 105276 the

permanent part of the national housing act impact of the program according to the 1998 hud study lenders and real estate brokers like the simplified formula because it makes it easier to explain fha requirements to prospective homebuyers2 low and moderateincome fa milies who may have thought that homeownership was beyond their r each were able to understand fhas cash requirements and were given clear goal to reach to ward for about 9 of borrowers the downpayment would be lower than under the old system but the net effect on the average downpayment would be negligible the study concluded that the simplified formula is not expected to adversely impact the profitability of the fha insurance fund from the hud study it may be inferred th at elimination of the program would not necessarily result in cost saving for th government and that extension would not necessarily result in increased costs for the government
