meanstested entitlement program that finances the delivery of primary and acute medical services as well as longterm care to more than 61 million people at an estimated cost to the federal and state governments of roughly 317 billion of all federally supported programs only medicare comes close to this level of spending and only social security costs more each state designs and administers its own version of medicaid under broad federal rules state variability in eligibility covered services and how those services are reimbursed and delivered is the rule rather than the exception this report describes the basic elements of medicaid focusing on federal rules governing who is eligible what services are covered how the program is financed and how beneficiaries share in the cost how providers are paid and the role of special waivers in expanding eligibility and modifying benefits the deficit reduction act of 2005 or dra pl 109171 as amended by the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 included many provisions affecting medicaid dra allows states to make funda mental changes in medicaid program design including covered benefits and beneficiary costsharing in 2007 the bush administration issued several regulations and program guidances affecting medicaid most recently the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 pl 110173 delayed implementation of two such regulations affecting schoolbased and rehabilitation services additional laws placed restrictions on other administration actions as well these and other major regulatory and legislative activity are summarized here lastly basic program statistics and citations to indepth crs reports on specific topics are provided this report will be updated

medicare program ie the social security amendments of 1965 pl 8997 it grew out of and replaced two earlier programs of federal grants to states that provided medical care to welfare recipients and the elderly it has expanded in additional directions since that time in the federal budget medicaid is an entitlement program that constitutes large share of mandatory spending two other federally supported health programsmedicare and the state childrens health insurance program schipare also entitlements 1 and are also components of mandatory spending in the federal budget all three programs finance the delivery of certain health care services to specific populations while medicare is financed exclusively by the federal government both medicaid and schip are jointly financed by the federal and state governments federal medicaid spending is openended with total outlays dependent on the generosity of state medicaid programs in contrast schip is capped federal grant to states even though medicaid is an entitlement program in federal budget terms states may choose to participate and all 50 states do so if they choose to participate states must follow federal rules in order to receive federal reimbursement to offset portion of their medicaid costs g25g145g152g561g146g156g561g7g149g146g144g146g139g149g142g561g143g152g155g561g15g142g141g146g140g138g146g141g501g561 the federal medicaid statute title xix of the social security act defines more than 50 distinct population groups as being potentially eligible to qualify for medicaid coverage applicants income eg wages social security benefits and often their resources or assets eg value of car savings accounts must meet program financial requirements these requirements vary considerably among states and different rules apply to different population groups within state medicaid eligibility is also subject to categorical restrictions generally it is available only to the elderly persons with disabilities as generally defined under the federal supplemental security income program or ssi 2 members of families with dependent children and certain other pregnant women and children in recent years medicaid has been extended to additional groups with specific characteristics including certain women with breast or cervical cancer and uninsured individuals with tuberculosis in general while medicaid is targeted at individuals with low income not all of the poor are eligible and not all those covered are poor for example adults without qualifying disability and dependent children are not eligible for medicaid matter how poor they are unless state has special waiver see the subsection on waivers below and the income standards applicable to some medicaid eligibility groups exceed the poverty level as described below moreover from state to state applicants with substantial differences in gross income may qualify for medicaid under the same eligibility group depending on the income methodology used ie what types of income are counted and how much if any income of given type is disregarded or ignored 1 the term entitlement has two meanings in this context individuals who meet state eligibility requirements are entitled to medicaid similarly individuals who meet federal eligibility requirements are entitled to medicare in contrast states that meet certain fede ral requirements are entitled or have acces s to federal schip grants all states have qualified for schip there is individual entitlement under schip 2 ssi provides cash assistance to the elderly and adults with cer tain disabilities that significantly restrict their ability to be gainfully employed in the case of children disabilitie s must result in marked and severe functional limitations m

cover them others are optional examples of groups that states must provide medicaid to include poor families that meet the financial requirements based on family size of the former aid to families with dependent children afdc cash assistance program3 families transitioning from welfare to work who receive up to 12 months of medicaid coverage reinstated and extended under dra and pl 109432 pregnant women and children under age six with family income below 133 of the federal poverty level fpl4 children ages six through 18 with family income below 100 fpl poor individuals with disabilities or poor individuals over age 64 who qualify for cash assistance under the ssi program5 and certain groups of legal permanent resident immigrants eg refugees for the first seven years after entry into the us asylees for the first seven years after asylum is granted lawful permanent aliens with 40 quarters of creditable coverage under social security immigrants who are honorably discharged us military veterans examples of groups that states may choose to cover under medicaid pregnant women and infants with family income exceeding 133 fpl up to 185 fpl individuals with disabilities and people over age 64 whose income exceeds the ssi level about 75 fpl nationwide up to 100 fpl children with disabilities whose family income is above the financial standards for ssi but below 300 fpl added under dra individuals who require institutional care in nursing facility or other medical institution whose income exceeds the ssi level up to 300 of the applicable ssi payment standard based on family size or roughly 221 fpl medically needy individuals who meet categorical requirements eg are over 64 or under 19 have disability are pregnant or are members of families with dependent children with income up to 133 ⅓ of the maximum payment amount applicable under states former afdc programs based on family size6 unlike most other eligibility groups medical expenses if any may be subtracted from 3 afdc income standards are well below the federal poverty level but states can modify liberalize or further restrict these criteria under the 1996 welfare reform law afdc was replaced with the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program although tanf recipients are not automatically eligible for medicaid some states have aligned income rules for tanf and medicaid thus facilitating medicaid coverage for some tanf recipients 4 for example in 2007 the fpl for family of four was 20650133 of fpl for such family would equal 27464 5 some states use income resource and disability standards that differ from current ssi standards 6 this limit can be raised or lowered based on specific provisions in the 1996 welfare reform legislation

coverage which is often referred to as spend down and legal immigrants after their first five years in this country dra made significant changes to asset transfer rules that potentially affect eligibility for medicaids longterm care services both institutional care and services provided in homes or the community described below in general states must delay the start date for medicaid enrollment for individuals who transfer assets for less than the fair market value on or after lookback date of five years prior to application rather than the three years typically applicable under prior law under dra the penalty period begins on the later of 1 the first month following the date of the improper transfer as under prior law or 2 the date the person is medicaideligible and would qualify for an institutional level of care in sum these dra changes could lengthen the period of ineligibility for some individuals

benefits under the traditional medicaid program certain other services may also be offered at state option states define the specific features of each covered benefit within four broad federal guidelines each service must be sufficient in amount duration and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose states may place appropriate limits on service based on such criteria as medical necessity within state services available to categorically needy groups 7 must be equal in amount duration and scope likewise serv ices available to medically needy groups8 must be equal in amount duration and scope these requirements are called the comparability rule with certain exceptions the amount duration and scope of benefits must be the same statewide also referred to as the statewideness rule with certain exceptions beneficiaries must have freedom of choice among health care providers or managed care entities participating in medicaid standard benefits identified in the federal statute and regulations include wide range of medical care and services some benefits are specific items such as eyeglasses and prosthetic devices other benefits are defined in terms of specific types of providers eg physicians hospitals whose array of services are designated as coverable under medicaid still other benefits define specific types of service eg family planning services and supplies pregnancyrelated services that may be delivered by any qualified medical provider that participates in medicaid examples of benefits that are mandatory for most medicaid groups 7 categorically needy groups include families with children the elderly persons with disabilities and certain other pregnant women and children who meet former afdc and ssirelated financial standards or have income below specified percentages of the fpl 8 medically needy groups include individuals meeting the same categorical restrictions but different typically somewhat higher financial standards apply

services provided by federally qualified health centers laboratory and xray services physician services pregnancyrelated services nursing facility services for individuals age 21 and over and home health care for those entitled to nursing home care examples of optional benefits for most medicaid groups that are offered by many states prescribed drugs covered by all states routine dental care physiciandirected clinic services other licensed practitioners eg optom etrists podiatrists psychologists inpatient psychiatric care for the elderly and for individuals under age 21 nursing facility services for individuals under age 21 physical therapy prosthetic devices and transportation the optional traditional benefits offered vary across states in addition the breadth of coverage for given benefit can and does vary from state to state even for mandatory services for example states may place different limits on the amount of inpatient hospital services beneficiary can receive in year eg up to 15 inpatient days per year in one state versus unlimited inpatient days in another state exceptions to stated limits may be permitted under circumstances defined by the state the federal medicaid statute also specifies special benefits or special rules regarding certain benefits for targeted populations for example most children under age 21 are entitled to early and periodic screening diagnostic and treatment epsdt services under epsdt children receive wellchild visits immunizations laboratory tests and other screening services at regular intervals in addition medical care that is necessary to correct or ameliorate identified defects physical and mental illness and other conditions must be provided including optional services that states do not otherwise cover in their medicaid programs while all women who qualify for medicaid are eligible for pregnancyrelated services women who qualify under one of the pregnancyrelated eligibility groups are eligible for only pregnancyrelated services including treatment of conditions that may complicate pregnancy through period of 60 days postpartum

states may offer more restrictive benefit package than is provided to categorically needy populations but at minimum must offer 1 prenatal and delivery services for pregnant women 2 ambulatory services for individuals under 18 and those entitled to institutional services and 3 home health services for individuals entitled to nursing facility care9 state medicaid programs must pay medicare costsharing expenses eg medicare premiums and in some cases deductibles and coinsurance for certain lowincome individuals eligible for both programs often called dual eligibles another example of special longterm care benefits for targeted populations is home and community based services under section 1915c of the federal medicaid statute the secretary of health and human services hhs may waive certain medicaid requirements allowing states to cover broad range of home and community based services hcbs for persons who would otherwise be eligible for medicaidfunded instit utional care waiver participants must be members of targeted groups as designated by the state including the aged persons with physical disabilities persons with mental retard ation or developmental disabilities mrdd and persons with mental illness benefits may include for example personal care eg assistance with eatingdrinking toileting medication management habilitation services eg assistance with socialization and adaptive skills for individuals with mrdd transportation case management psychosocial rehabilitation and clinic services for persons with chronic mental illness costeffectiveness test requires that expenditures for hcbs not exceed the cost of institutional care that would have otherwise been provided to waiver participants thus states may cap enrollment andor set expenditure limits on per capita or aggregate basis to meet this requirement dra allows states to establish hcbs under new optional benefit category thus under specific circumstances certain services longer requir section 1915c waiver states have long complained that waiver requirements and processes are burdensome to add this new hcbs benefit states will instead submit medicaid state plan amendment to the federal government for approval this new benefit is available to cert ain individuals with income below 150 fpl who are not required to need an institutional level of care to qualify unlike other state plan benefits states offering this new hcbs benefit will be allowed to cap the number of enrollees and establish waiting lists as they did under section 1915c waivers finally as an alternative to providing all of the mandatory and selected optional benefits under traditional medicaid dra gives states the option to enroll statespecified groups in new benchmark and benchmarkequivalent benefit plans these plans are nearly identical to the benefit packages offered through the state childrens health insurance program schip the benchmark options include the blue crossblue shield preferred provider plan under the federal employees health benefits program fehbp plan offered to state employees the largest commercial hmo in the state and 9 broader requirements apply if state has chosen to provide coverage for medically needy persons in institutions for mental disease and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded

and optional medicaid eligibility groups wraparound benefits must include epsdt states may choose to provide other wrap around and additional benefits wraparound typically refers to situations in which the state provides specific service eg rehabilitation services nursing home care to beneficiaries enrolled in plan that does not cover that service for given group of beneficiaries ensuring coordination of care between two or more entities responsible for managing different benefits eg the state medicaid agency and managed care plan is always an issue and one that is not unique to these

the federal government for portion the federal share of states medicaid program costs because medicaid is an openended entitlement there is upper limit or cap on the amount of federal funds state may receive medicaid costs in given state and year are primarily determined by the expansiveness of eligibility rules and beneficiary participation rates the breadth of benefits offered the generosity of provider reimbursement rates and other supplemental payments 10 the statespecific federal share for benefit costs is determined by formula set in law that establishes higher federal shares for states with per capita personal income levels lower than the national average and vice versa for states with per capita personal income levels that are higher than the national average11 the federal share called the federal medical assistance percentage fmap is at least 50 of state medicaid benefit costs and can be as high as 83 statutory maximum for fy2008 the federal share for benefit costs ranges from 50 in 13 states up to just over 76 in one state the federal match for administrative expenditures does not vary by state and is generally 50 but certain administrative functions have higher federal matching rate functions with 75 federal match include for example survey and certification of nursing facilities operation of state medicaid fraud control unit mfcu and operation of an approved medicaid management 10 key supplemental payments are described in crs report 97483 medicaid disproportionate share payments and in crs report rl31021 medicaid upper payment limits and intergovernmental transfers current issues and recent regulatory and legislative action pl 109432 made some technical changes to certain supplemental payments eg disproportionate share hospital or dsh payments more recently pl 110173 extended dsh payments for tennessee and hawaii 11 for one benefit family planning services and supplies the federal share is 90 for all states in addition the federal

for some groups of beneficiaries all service related costsharing is prohibited unless the prohibitions are lifted under special waiver see the subsection on waivers below all service related costsharing is prohibited for children under 18 years of age service related costsharing is prohibited for pregnant women for any services that relate to the pregnancy or to any other medical condition which may complicate pregnanc in addition such costsharing cannot be charged for services furnished to individuals who are inpatients in hospital or are residing in long term care facility or in another medical institution if the individual is required to spend most of their income for medical care services furnished to individuals receiving hospice care emergency services and family planning services and supplies for most other beneficiaries and services medicaid programs are allowed to establish nominal service related costsharing requirements nominal amounts are defined in regulations and are generally between 050 and 3 depending on the cost of the service provided for working individuals with disabilities who qualify for medicaid under eligibility pathways established by the balanced budget act of 1997 bba97 and the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 twwiia service related costsharing charges may be required that exceed nominal amounts as

are exempt from paying premiums under this new dra option also certain groups and services eg preventive care for children emergency care family planning services are exempt from the servicerelated costsharing provisions nominal costsharing amounts in regulations will be indexed increased by medical inflation over time special rules apply to costsharing for non preferred prescription drugs and for emergency room copayments for nonemergency care dra also allows states to condition continuing medicaid eligibility on the payment of premiums providers may also deny care for failure to pay servicerelated costsharing finally dra provides an opportunity to test an alternative to traditional medicaid that covers certain benefits combined with new beneficiary costsharing structure similar to health savings accounts in the private sector in general the secretary is required to establish demonstration for health opportunity accounts hoas for which participants would have an hoa to pay for state specified services and after an annual deductible is met set at 100 but more than 110 of the annual state contribution to the hoa would also provide coverage for medicaid items and services otherwise available in the state hoa contributions could be made by the state or by other persons or entities including charitable organizations as permitted under current law including federal shares the state contributions generally may not exceed 2500 for each adult and 1000 for each child

payment rates for medicaid providers federal regulations require that these rates be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that covered benefits will be available to medicaid beneficiaries at least to the same extent they are available to the general population in the same geographic area prior to dra providers could not deny care or services based on an individuals ability to pay medicaid costsharing amounts however this requirement did not eliminate the liability of medicaid beneficiary for payment of such amounts in practice some states have allowed providers to refuse to provide services to medicaid beneficiaries who have failed to make copayments in the past but most states do not have specific policies on this issue 12 as noted above dra permits providers to deny care for failure to pay servicerelated costsharing medicaid regulations place restrictions on how medicaid costsharing may be used in determining provider reimbursement states are prohibited from increasing the payments they make to providers to offset uncollected amounts for deductibles coinsurance copayments or similar charges that the provider has waived or are uncollectable with the exception of

further the goals of the medicaid program as well as other programs such as schip some policy makers at both the federal and state level view section 1115 authority as means to restructure medicaid coverage control costs and increase state flexibility in variety of ways to obtain such waiver state must submit proposals outlining the terms and conditions of its waiver for approval by the federal agency that oversees and administers the medicaid programthe centers for medicare and medicaid services cms under this authority the secretary may waive any medicaid requirements contained in section 1902 of the federal medicaid statute including but not limited to freedom of choice of provider and comparability and statewideness of benefits as described above in the benefits section for example states may obtain waivers that allow them to provide services to individuals who would not otherwise meet medicaid eligibility rules eg childless adults without disability cover nonmedicaid services limit benefit packages for certain groups adapt programs to the special needs of particular geographic areas or groups of recipients or accomplish policy goal such as to temporarily extend medicaid in the aftermath of disaster as was done in new york city after the september 11 terrorist attacks and in gulf coast states after hurricane katrina approved waivers are deemed to be part of states medicaid plan and thus the federal share of the costs for such waivers is determined by the fmap formula described earlier unlike traditional medicaid waiver guidance 14 specifies that the costs of 1115 waivers must be budget neutral over the life of the program to meet this requirement estimated spending under the waiver cannot exceed the estimated cost of the states existing medicaid program under current law requirements for example states may move certain existing medicaid populations into managed care arrangements and use the savings accrued from that action to finance coverage of otherwise ineligible individuals under an approved waiver there are specific limits and restrictions on how state may operate waiver program for example such waivers must not limit mandatory services for the mandatory pregnant women and children eligibility groups another provision specifies restrictions on costsharing that may be imposed under waivers continued costsharing amounts that are bad

year nearly onehalf of these beneficiaries 292 million were children and 162 million were adults in families with dependent children there were also 95 million individuals with disabilities and 60 million people over the age of 65 enrolled in medicaid that year15 the latest published estimate of total medicaid spending available from cms including the costs of benefits and program administration for the federal and state governments combined was 3167 billion for fy2006 16 across the nation traditional medicaid covers very diverse population and compared to both medicare and employersponsored health care plans offers the broadest array of medical care and related services available in the united states today different groups under medicaid have very different service utilization patterns these patterns result in large differences in the proportion of total benefit expenditures by group for example for fy2005 while the majority of enrollees were children without disabilities roughly 50 such children accounted for only about 17 of medicaids total expenditures on benefits most of the expenditures for such children are typically for primary and acute care in the feeforservice setting and for managed care premiums the nextlargest beneficiary groupadults without disabilities in families with dependent childrenaccounted for about 26 of all enrollees but only about 12 of benefit expenditures like children primary and acute feeforservice care and managed care premiums account for the majority of these costs in contrast individuals with disabilities represented about 15 of medicaid enrollees but this group accounted for the largest share of medicaid expenditures for benefits about 43 of all groups most of the costs for persons with disabilities are typically for institutional and noninstitutional longterm care services primary and acute feeforservice care and outpatient prescription drugs finally the elderly represented about 9 of medicaid enrollees but about 23 of all expenditures for benefits for the aged the vast majority of costs are usually for longterm care and outpatient prescription drugs while these statistics vary somewhat from year to year and state to state the patterns described above generally hold true beginning in 2006 medicaid beneficiaries who are also eligible for medicare ie the elderly and certain individuals with disabilities receive their outpatient prescription drugs through the new medicare prescription drug benefit known as medicare part d instead of through medicaid while the longterm impact of the part d program on medicaid is unclear medicaids drug costs for these populations have been considerably reduced in fact cy2006 was the first time in 15 beneficiary statistics for fy2007 were taken

scrutinized by congress resulting in important legislative changes for example in the 1980s eligibility expansions for pregnant women and children were adopted in the mid1990s welfare reform restricted access to medicaid for new immigrants and removed the automatic link between receipt of cash assistance and medicaid for lowincome families in the 1990s managed care was expanded significantly as was coverage for workers with disabilities largely because of concerns about questionable financing practices at the state level on several occasions congress has restricted supplemental medicaid payments made to hospitals serving disproportionate share of medicaid and uninsured patients also called dsh payments similarly in 2000 congress also required new more restrictive uppe r payment limit rules for institutional providers under medicaid other significant changes such as the recently enacted dra have also been made in february every year the president submits federal budget proposal to the congress in the presidents fy2008 budget proposal number of changes to medicaid were outlined some of proposed changes would require legislative action by congress while others would be implemented administratively eg via regulatory changes issuance of program guidance etc 18 the administration has issued number of rules and program guidances some of which have been modified by congress through subsequent legislation for example pl 109432 prevents the presidents provider tax proposal to limit the extent to which states may tax certain providers to obtain additional federal medicaid funds from being implemented via administrative action this law also sets the provider tax ceiling to 6 of revenues except for the period of january 1 2008september 30 2011 during which the rate is fixed at 55 compared to 3 in the presidents proposal final rule would also restrict the use of certain intergovernmental transfers and certified public expenditures to finance the nonfederal share of medicaid costs and would implement payment caps for government providers 19 in addition proposed rule would end federal payments associated with graduate medical education20 costs under the medicaid pl 11028 delayed implementation of these two rules for one year until may 25 2008 this law also requires the use of tamperresistant pads for medicaid prescriptions and provides medicaid pharmacy plus waiver extension subsequently pl 11090 delayed implementation of the tamperresistant pads provision for six months until march 31 2008 th is law also temporarily
