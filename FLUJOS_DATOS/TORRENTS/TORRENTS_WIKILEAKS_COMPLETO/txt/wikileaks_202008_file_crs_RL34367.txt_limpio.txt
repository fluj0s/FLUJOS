king analyst in financial economics and risk assessment government and finance division sidebyside comparison of flood insurance reform legislation in the 110th congress summary in 1968 congress established the national flood insurance program nfip in response to severe flooding following series of hurricanes in 1963 1964 and 1965 the key policy objectives of the nfip were threefold 1 reduce the nations flood risk through floodplain management 2 improve flood hazard data and risk assessment by mapping the nations floodplains and 3 make affordable flood insurance widely available in communities that adopt and enforce measures to make future construction safer from flooding fiscally the program had been self supporting from the mid1980s until the 2005 hurricanes these storms exposed serious weaknesses which congress is attempting to address in an effort to return the nfip to financial soundness in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes the nfip faced unprecedented financial and regulatory strains the program had to borrow 17535 billion from the us treasury in order to pay claims and expenses those concerned about program challenges in the wake of the 2005 storms cite the increasing need to borrow from the us treasury substantial premium discounts or crosssubsidies among classes of policyholders outdated flood insurance rate maps allegations of uneven compliance with mandatory purchase requirements and questions as to the performance and efficiency of private insurers operating under the nfips write your own program policymakers are now examining ways to strengthen the nfip on july 19 2007 representative maxine waters introduced hr 3121 to restore the financial solvency of the national flood insurance program chairman barney frank had introduced hr 1682 an earlier version of hr 3121 on march 26 2007 hr 3121 is designed to make the program satisfy traditional criteria for actuarial soundness by phasing in actuarial premiums for owners of certain commercial properties and some residential properties that are not the owners primary residence hr 3121 would also 1 raise civil penalties on federally regulated lenders who fail to enforce mandatory purchase of flood insurance for mortgage holders 2 increase program participation incentives 3 add coverage for wind as well as water damage and 4 encourage revisions to flood maps hr 3121 passed the house on september 27 2007 on may 13 2008 the senate approved s 2284 flood insurance reform bill designed to increase the amount of premiums collected to meet the cost of expected claims under the nfip s 2284 is substantially similar to hr 3121 except that the senate legislation would forgive the programs outstanding debt to the treasury and exclude coverage for wind damages some stakeholder groups have expressed concerns about making abrupt changes to the nfip particularly phasing out the subsidized premiums they point to need for flood insurance reform but say changes should be made in the broader context of program reauthorization nfip authority expires september 30 2008 this report will be updated as events warrant contents background 1 summary of hr 3121 and s 2284 3 list of tables table 1 sidebyside comparison of flood insurance reform legislation hr 3121 and s 2284 4 sidebyside comparison of flood insurance reform legislation in the 110th congress background in 1968 congress established the national flood insurance program nfip in response to rising flood losses and as an alternative to ad hoc federal disaster assistance the nfips insurance operation was selfsupporting from the mid1980s until the 2005 hurricane season when hurricanes katrina rita and wilma exposed serious flaws in the program the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes were catastrophic disasters that required an estimated 1928 billion in claims payouts under the nfip the program now faces unprecedented financial and regulatory challenges and 17535 billion debt owed to the us treasury members of congress are concerned about the financial challenges facing the nfip and the need to reauthorize the program before september 30 2008 an important aspect of the financial challenges facing the program involves the rebuilding of the gulf coast region and the adequacy of the nfip to meet the future commercial and multifamily real estate mortgage financial needs of all other communities without federal flood insurance for example lenders will often not be able to sell mortgages in coastal areas and other regions prone to flooding without reliable and uninterrupted source of affordable flood insurance mortgage credit and home ownership would be more expensive the nfips financial status has prompted policymakers to focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the nfip in managing and financing the nations flood risk those concerned about program weaknesses typically cite the increasing need to borrow from the us treasury substantial premium crosssubsidies among classes of policyholders outdated flood insurance rate maps allegations of uneven compliance with mandatory purchase requirements and questions as to the performance and efficiency of the nfips write your own program legislative efforts are now underway in congress to reform the nfip on march 26 2007 representative barney frank introduced hr 1682 the flood insurance reform and modernization act of 2007 in order to restore the financial solvency of the national flood insurance program on july 19 2007 representative maxine waters introduced hr 3121 bill that is substantially similar to hr 1682 as approved by the full house on september 27 2007 hr 3121 would add two new sections to provide for optional wind damage coverage through the flood insurance program and to extend the nfip five years through september 30 2013 section 4 of the bill was modified to reflect minor changes in the phasein of actuarial rates beginning on january 1 2011 crs2 on may 13 2008 the full senate approved s 2284 to reauthorize the nfip through 2013 increase the amount of premiums collected to reduce the cost of future claims and expand the program to address concerns brought forth after the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons s 2284 is substantially similar to hr 3121 except that the senate legislation would forgive the programs 175 billion in outstanding debt to the treasury and exclude coverage for wind damages some stakeholder groups have expressed concerns about making abrupt changes to the nfip particularly phasing out the subsidized premiums they point to need for flood insurance reform but say changes should be made in the broader context of program reauthorization nfip authority expires september 30 2008 many private insurers oppose the inclusion of wind coverage claiming the insurance industry is capable of insuring wind coverage opponents also stress that including the wind peril in the program would expose the program to unnecessary future indebtedness to the treasury supporters insist that the federal flood insurance program lost billions due to its lack of wind damage provision the reason is that claim adjusters arguably attributed all damage including obvious wind damages to flood crs3 summary of hr 3121 and s 2284 hr 3121 is substantially similar to s 2284 in that both bills would modify the nfip to bring more consumers into the system and gradually phase out premium subsidies currently available for structures built prior to the mapping and implementation of nfip floodplain management requirements the socalled pre flood insurance rate maps prefirm structures1 the bills would achieve these outcomes in different ways specifically hr 3121 would 1 phase out subsidized premiums for some policyholders 2 require fema for the first time to map the nations 500year floodplain and areas that would be flooded if dam or levee failed 3 notify borrowers of requirements making flood insurance potentially available to all homeowners and not just to those in the 100year floodplain as part of the real estate settlement procedures act respa process 4 provide for the purchase of optional insurance coverage for wind as well as water damage and 5 extend the nfip five years through september 30 2013 s 2284 like hr 3121 would phase out the premium subsidies on prefirm properties require mapping the 500year floodplain and areas behind levees require borrowers to be notified about the availability of flood insurance and extend the program through fiscal 2013 the senate bill however would 1 forgive the debt owed to the treasury 2 continue to exclude coverage for wind damage 3 establish reserve fund that maintains balance equal to 1 of total potential loss exposure of the program to pay extraordinary future claims 4 establish an ombudsman or consumer advocate within fema to ensure that the write your own companies pay claims in an appropriate manner and 5 create nonpartisan commission to examine the proper approach to manage catastrophic risks table 1 provides detailed sidebyside comparison of key provisions in hr 3121 and s 22842 1 prefirm buildings pay heavily discounted rates on the first 35000 of their structures insured value and full
