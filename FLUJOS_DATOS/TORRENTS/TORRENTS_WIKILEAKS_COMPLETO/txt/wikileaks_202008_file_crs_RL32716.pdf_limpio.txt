with disabilities education act idea20 usc 1400 et seq is both grants statute and civil rights statute it provides federal funding for the education of children with disabilities and requires as condition for the receipt of such funds the provision of free appropriate public education fape the statute also contains detailed due process provisions to ensure the provision of fape originally enacted in 1975 the act responded to increased awareness of the need to educate children with disabilities and to judicial decisions requiring that states provide an education for children with disabilities if they provided an education for children without disabilities 1 idea has been amended several times most comprehensively prior to the 108th congress by the 1997 idea reauthorization pl

provisions such as the establishment of the office of special education programs osep within the us department of education ed 603 the findings and purposes of the 2004 reauthorization largely track the provisions of the 1997 reauthorization however there are some changes particularly in the findings section which emphasize the need to reduce irrelevant and unnecessary paperwork and to expand opportunities to resolve disagreements between parents and schools in positive and constructive ways 601 g6g142g143g146g151g146g157g146g152g151g156g344g561 pl 108446 retains most of the idea definitions 602 however the act adds some important definitions and modifies others g10g146g144g145g149g162g561g19g158g138g149g146g143g146g142g141g561g22g142g138g140g145g142g155g156g561 arguably one of the most significant new definitions is that of highly qualified teachers 60210 pl 108446 links its definition to the definition of highly qualified in section 910123 of the elementary and secondary education act esea3 but modifies that definition as it applies to special education teachers most notably it addresses concerns that have been raised about certain groups of special education teachers such as those who teach more than one core academic subject4 the esea definition of highly qualified applies only to teachers of core academic subjects and differentiates between new and veteran teachers and between those teaching at the elementary level and above the elementary level thus under esea the highly qualified definition applies 2 definitions in part of idea apply to the entire act dditional definitions are included in and only apply to other parts sections subsections etc such definitions are discussed elsewhere in this report as warranted 3 for information on esea requirements see crs report rl30834 k12 teacher quality issues and legislative action by jeffrey j kuenzi 4 esea 910111 defines core academic subjects to include english reading or language arts mathematics science foreign languages civics and government economics arts history and geography pl 108446 cross references this definition 6024

g345g561only to those special education teachers who teach core subjects although this is probably most special education teachers pl 108446 provides additional requirements and options to the definition with respect to special education teachers5 see table 1 below for summary of these requirements first of all to be highly qualified under idea all special education teachers whether they teach core subjects or not must hold at least bachelors degree and must obtain full state special education certification or equivalent licensure 60210b special education teachers who have emergency temporary or provisional certification do not meet the idea definition in addition pl 108446 modifies the esea requirements with respect to two groups of special education teachers those who teach only the most severely disabled children and those who teach more than one core subject if the teachers in these two groups meet the idea criteria they are considered to have met the esea requirements both new and veteran special education teachers who teach core subjects exclusively to children with disabilities who are assessed agains t alternative achievement standards under esea 6 can of course meet the definition of highly qualified by meeting their applicable esea standards alternatively new and veteran teachers of these severely cognitive disabled students at the elementary level may meet the highly qualified definition by demonstrating competence in all the academic subjects in which the teacher teaches based on high objective uniform state standard of evaluation often referred to as housse 7 teachers of these students at levels above elementary school can meet the definition by demonstrating subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction as determined by the state needed to effectively teach to those standards ie alternative achievement standards 60210cii t able 1 summar of requir ements to be highly qualified special education t eacher category of

indicating the most severely cognitive disabled students esea requires that nearly all students be held to the same high state achievement standards the exception with respect to children with disabilities is that those who are the most severely cognitively disabled estimated to account for about 1 of total enrollm ent and 10 of children with disabilities can be held to alternative

alternatively veteran special education teachers teaching two or more core subjects may also qualify as highly qualified based on the esea housse option 60210dii which may include single evaluation covering multiple subjects8 finally newly hired special education teachers teaching two or more core subjects who are already highly qualified in mathematics language arts or science are given two

to the deadline explicitly applied to special education teachers for meeting the highly qualified definition under either id ea or esea which is the end of school year 20052006 esea section 1119a29 regarding other classifications of special education teachers one can infer that those who do not teach core subjects would meet the idea definition if they meet the idea criteria for all special education teachers full certification and at least bachelors degree with respect to special education teachers who provide only consultative services to other teachers the conference report observes that special education teacher who provides only consultative services to highly qualified teacher should be considered highly qualif ied special education teacher if such teacher meets the requirements of section 60210a such consultative services do not include instruction in core academic subjects but may include adjustments to the learning environment modifications of instructional methods adaptation of curricula the use of positive behavioral supports and interventions or the use of appropriate accommodations to meet the needs of individuals children 10 8 the conference report

idea does require some services for children in private schools even if they are unilaterally placed there by their parents exactly what these services are or should be has been contentious subject for many years the 1997 reauthorization of idea expanded on the private school provisions and the 2004 reauthorization includes several changes to the provisions relating to children who are placed in private school by their parents the provisions relating to children placed in private schools by public agencies were not changed generally children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private schools are to be provided special education and related services to the extent consistent with the number and location of such children in the school district served by lea pursuant to several requirements 612a10ai this provision was changed from previous law by the addition of the requirement that the children be located in the school district served by the lea the senate report described this change as protecting leas from having to work with private schools located in multiple jurisdictions when students attend private schools across district lines 38 there are five requirements regarding this provision of special education the first is that the funds expended by the lea including direct services to parentally placed private school children shall be equal to proportionate amount of federal funds made available under part b of idea the 2004 reauthorization added the phrase regarding direct services the senate report stated that it is the committees intent that school districts place greater emphasis on services provided directly to such childrenlike specifically designed instructional activities and related servicesrather than devoting funds solely to indirect services such as professional development for private school personnel39 second new provision relating to the calculation of the proportionate amount is added in calculating this amount the lea after timely and meaningful consultation with representatives of private schools shall conduct thorough and complete child find process to determine the number of children with disabilities who are parentally placed in private schools third the new law keeps the previous requirement that the services may be provided to children on the premises of private schools including religious schools

the number of children evaluated the number of children determined to have disabilities and the number of children served under the private school provisions the senate report stated that this requirement was to help to ensure that these funds are serving their intended purpose40 the general requirement regarding child find is essentially the same as previous law the requirement for finding children with disabilities is the same as that delineated in 612a3 for children who are not parentally placed in private schools including religious schools as was done in the previous section the former use of the term parochial is replaced by the term religious in the new law new provisions are added concerning equitable participation activities cost and the completion period child find is to be designed to ensure the equitable participation of parentally placed private school children with disabilities and their accurate count the cost of child find activities may not be considered in meeting the leas proportional spending obligation finally the child find for parentally placed private school children with disabilities is to be completed in time period comparable to that for students attending public schools 612a10aii pl 108446 adds requirements that the lea consult with private school officials and representatives of the parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities this consultation is to include the child find process and how parentally placed private school children with disabilities can participate equitably the determination of the proportionate amount of federal funds available to serve parentally placed private school children with disabilities including how that amount was calculated the consultation process among the lea private school officials and representatives of parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities including how the process will operate how where and by whom special education and related services will be provided for parentally placed private school children with disabilities including discussion of the types of services including direct services and alternate service delivery mechanisms how the services will be apportioned if there are insufficient funds to serve all children and how and when these decisions will be made and how the lea shall provide written explanation to private school officials of the reasons why the lea chose not to provide services if the lea and private school officials disagree 612a10aiii the senate report described the consultation procedure as similar to that in the child left behind act and therefore the committee does not believe including these provisions places an undue burden on leas 41 40 ibid p 15 41 ibid

disability is unilaterally placed in private school by his or her parents the cost of the private school placement is not paid by the lea unless hearing officer or court makes certain findings as in previous law this reimbursement may be reduced or denied if the childs parents did not give certain notice 612a10ciii both the 1997 and 2004 reauthorizations contain an exception to this limitation but this exception is changed somewhat in the new law under the new law the cost of reimbursement is not to be reduced or denied for the failure to provide notice if the school prevented the parent from providing such notice the parents had not received notice of the notice requirement or compliance would likely result in physical harm to the child previous law had included provision that reimburse ment not be reduced or denied if parent is illiterate and had included serious emotional harm pl 108446 also contains new provision allowing at the discretion of court or hearing officer the reimbursement not to be reduced or denied if the parent is illiterate or cannot write in english or compliance with the notice requirement would likely result in serious emotional harm to the child

federal education programs idea requires states and leas to follow certain financial principles to ensure that federal funds add to rather than substitute for state and local educational funding one of these principles is the maintenance of effort moe requirement which generally in idea requires that state and local spending on special education not be reduced from one year to the next ie 100 moe prior law allowed certain exceptions to local moe one of which allowed leas to treat as local funds for the purpose of meeting the moe requirement up to 20 of any annual increase in their idea grant55

authority except that it modifies the criteria for exercising the prohibition and requires states prior law permitted states to exercise the prohibition if warranted58 under the prior law this exception applied only to leas not to states pl 108446 extends this moe exception to state that pays or reimburses all local educational agencies within the state from state revenue 100 percent of the nonfederal share of the costs of special education and related services 613j the secretary of education would have similar obligations to deny this option to state that the state has for leas in addition state could not take advantage of this exception if any local educational agency in the state would as result of such reduction receive less than 100 percent of the amount necessary to ensure

lea determines that the childs educational and service needs academic achievement or functional performance warrants reevaluation 614a262 for example reevaluation might be warranted if the childs performance in school significantly improves suggesting that he or she longer requires special education and related services or if the child is not making progress toward the goals set out in his or

procedural safeguards to initiate the evaluation 614a1iii if the parent refuses the provision of special education and related services for the child based on the initial evaluation pl 108446 directs the lea not to provide special education and relate d services to the child by utilizing the procedures described in section 615 614a1iiii under such circumstances the lea would not be considered to

pl 108446 continues many of the evaluation requirements of the prior version of idea for example multiple measures or assessments must be used to determine eligibility for idea services and these measures or assessments must be technically sound one notable change to these requirements deals with the language or mode of communication used to administer assessments prior law required that tests and other evaluation materials be provided and administered in the childs native language or other mode of communication unless it is clearly not feasible emphasis added to do so 65 pl 108446 rephrases this requirement as follows assessments and other evaluation materials must be provided and administered in the language and form most likely to yield accurate information on what the child knows and can do academically developmentally and functionally unless it is not feasible emphasis added to so provide or administer 614b3aii pl 108446 also addresses concerns about children with disabilities who transfer from one lea to another during the school year by requiring coordination between such childrens prior and subsequent schools as necessary and as expeditiously as possible to ensure prompt completion of full evaluations 614b3d 66 pl 108446 continues to require that the eligibility for special education and related services be determined by team of qualified professionals and the childs parent 614b4a and that eligibility not be predominantly based on the lack of appropriate reading or mathematics instruction or on limited english proficiency pl 108446 adds specific requirements regarding the determination of specific learning disabilities in determining whether child has specific learning disability an lea shall not be required to take into consideration whether child has severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability 614b6a 67 pl 108446 continues to require an evaluation before determining that child longer requires special education and

technicality rather than an actual showing that the childs education was harmed by the procedural flaw the ramifications of this are great when considering that such finding can subject school district to the payment of attorneys fees75 however the senate report also observed that there are procedural violations which can deny child fape for example schools failure to give parent access to initial evaluation information to make an informed and timely decision about their childs education can amount to fape violation 76 the 2004 reauthorization added exceptions to the requirement that

authorizes grants to states to develop and maintain early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities the idea infants and toddlers program has parallels with the provisions and requirements of part b however these provisions and requirements differ in important respects from those of part b because this disabled population differs in significant ways from the mainly schoolaged population served under part b for example while part b eligibility is based on categories of disabilities 6023 eligibility for part c programs is often based on diagnosis of development delay that requires early intervention services 6325 instead of an iep part c programs have individualized family service plans ifsps 636 in recognition that services must be provided to the family as well as to the infant or toddler because infants and toddlers are served in variety of locations including the home part c services are to be provided in natural environments in which children without disabilities participate 6324g to the maximum extent appropriate 635a16a pl 108446 maintains the overall purposes and st ructure of part c with some additions and revisions arguably the most extensive addition is the option for states to adopt policies that would permit parents of children receiving part c early intervention services to extend those services until they are eligible to enter kindergarten 635c under previous law and in states that choose not to adopt such policy these children would likely transition into preschool program under section 619 described above pl 108446 has series of requirements for state policy to extend part c services 635c2 including informed written consent from parents that they choose this alternative 89 pl 108446 removes requirement to include transition funding for preschool programs for the outlying areas in their fy1998 allotment since the 1997 idea amendments pl 10517 619c4 eliminated the authority for them to participate in this grant programs the removal of this provision would appear to have impact
