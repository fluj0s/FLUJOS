simple or straight motion to recommit or motion to recommit with instructions bills and conference reports can be recommitted but the motion to recommit does not have the same effect on measures at both stages of the legislative process simple motion to recommit bill gives the minority party final opportunity to kill measure before the house votes on whether to pass it when the house adopts simple motion the underlying bill goes back to committee and is considered to have been rejected by the house simple motion to recommit conference report proposes to return the report to conference but does not necessarily kill the bill in question motion to recommit bill with instructions provides the minority last chance to amend bill before the house votes on its passage when the house recommits bill with instructions the measure goes back to committee but typically with binding directions that the committee report the bill back to the house instantaneously with an amendment that is included in the instructions the recommittal of conference report with instru ctions returns the report to conference with nonbinding directions to the house conferees only eg to insist on disagreeing to specific senate amendment most motions to recommit bills and conference reports contain instructions the motion to recommit is in order in the house but not in the committee of the whole the motion must be offered after the previous question has been ordered but before the vote on passing bill or agreeing to conference report debate is allowed only on motions to recommit with instructions that are offered to bills and joint resolutions debate is not permitted on simple motions or on any motions to recommit conference reports except by unanimous consent the house must approve the motion by simple majority vote from the 101 st congress through the 109th congress the house adopted 76 of all motions to recommit in modern house practice the right to offer the motion to recommit is the prerogative of minority party representative who is opposed to the underlying measure until the 104th congress however house precedents only gu aranteed the minoritys right to offer simple motion to recommit the house rules committee was allowed to report special rules that limited or prohibited instructions in motions to recommit since the beginning of the 104 th congress the rules committee has been prohibited from reporting any special rules that restrict or preclu instructions in motions to recommit offered to bills and joint resolutions provided the motion is offered by the minority leader or his designee this report will be updated at the end of each congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33860g22g145g142g561g15g152g157g146g152g151

motions to recommit in the contemporary house of representatives is the prerogative of the minority party the motion is in order in the house but not in the committee of the whole formally committee of the whole house on the state of the union motion to recommit must be offered after the previous question is ordered on measure but before the vote on final passage takes place when measure is called up under special rule that orders the previous question in advance through final passage the rule expressly protects the right to move to recommit in practice recommittal motion typically is offered after engrossment and third reading of the measure only one valid motion can be offered and it can take one of two forms simple or straight motion or motion with instructions both forms have equal privilege on the house floor but differ in how they affect the underlying measure this report discusses the two forms of recommittal motion relevant rules of the house the minoritys prerogative to offer the motion and procedures for disposing of motions to recommit the report emphasizes motions to recommit bills and conference reports because they represent the overwhelming majority of all recommittal motions each congress data on motions to recommit made from the 101 st congress through the 109th congress are presented in tables throughout the report1 motions that were offered and then

bills and most resolutions and sometimes conference reports as well the motion is out of order however when measures are called up under the suspension of the rules procedure table 1 below shows data on the different types of measures that to which motions to recommit were offered from the 101st congress through the 109th congress the largest number of recommittal motions were offered to bills and conference reports respectively 1 the data were for the 101st104th congresses were gathered by searching the legis and congressional record files of house information resources hir for references to the motion to recommit in the house technical problem with the congressional record files caused information from july 1996 to the end of the 104th congress to be missing for this time period only the legis files were searched the data for the 105th congress and the first session of the 106th congress were gathered from searches of the legislative information system lis and the lexis database the

simple resolutions it is not in order to move to recommit resolution on the order of business usually called rule or special rule reported by the house rules committee concurrent resolutions section 305a of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 as amended forbids motions to recommit from being offered to concurrent budget resolutions or conference reports on them joint resolutions the house sometimes acts on joint resolutions to disapprove or approve of specific executive actions under the terms of special expedited or fasttrack procedures that may prohibit the

committee typically the committee that originally reported the measure the reporting committee5 simple motion to recommit bill gives the minority final opportunity to reject that measure the motion proposes only to return the bill to th committee that had reported it when the house adopts simple recommittal motion the underlying bill goes back to committee and is considered to have been rejected by the house the simple motion gives the house an indirect way to kill bill instead of voting directly on its final passage by contrast motion to recommit with instructions provides the minority last chance to amend bill recommittal motion in this form proposes to send the bill back to committee and also to instruct the committee as to what additional action on the bill it should take most often these instructions direct the committee contain an additi onal amendment to the bill thus the mover of recommittal motion with instructions seeks not to kill the underlying bill but to change it to conform more fully with his or her policy views these policy views are generally those advocated by the minority party most recommittal motions with instructions order the committee to report the bill back to the house forthwith with an amendment these amendatory instructions contain the text of the proposed amendment in this form recommittal motion gives the committee discretion and time in which to act the committee must retu rn the bill to the house with the amendment immediately consequently when the house adopts recommittal motion with amendatory instructions the underlying bill is not actually sent back to committee instead the chairman of the committee specified in the motion takes the floor and on behalf of the committee immediately reports the measure back to the house with the amendment set forth in the instructions at this point the bill is before the house once again and the amendment contained in the instructions is the pending question for the house to decide so the house proceeds to vote on the amendment if the amendment is adopted the house then votes on whether to pass the bill as it now has been amended see the recommittal of bill case study section for an illustration of these procedures in practice 3 all the principles discussed in this s ection also govern motions to recommit join t resolutions concurrent resolutions and simple resolutions 4 references to bills in this and later s ections of this report apply equally to jo int concurrent and simple resolutions unless otherwise noted 5 the recommittal motion also can propose sending the bill to select committee established by the motion itself for example in the 102nd congress the motion to recommit with instruc tions offered to hr 3732 budget process reform act of 1992 sought to send the bill to select committee on reform to be composed of ten members of the house to be appointed by the speaker the motion failed by vote of 162262 see congressional record vol 138 march 31 1992

instructions cannot propose an amendment that would not have been in order if it had been offered directly as an amendment to the bill6 for instance amendatory instructions must be germane to the underlying measure to cite one example from the 103rd congress motion to recommit hr 3221 iraq claims act with amendatory instructions was ruled out of order because the amendment contained in the instructions was not germane to the underlying bill the chair explained that the instructions proposed adding language that would change immigr ation law subject that was not addressed in the underlying bill7 amendatory instructions also cannot propose to strike out an amendment that the house already has adopted this is consistent with the principle that an amendment cannot be amended after having been adopted by the same token the instructions cannot propose to amend portion of 6 the information presented in this section draws upon relevant house pr ecedents discussed in the

reflects the principle that it is not in order to propose to amend only amended text the amendment in recommittal motion can however propose and often has proposed an amendment that was earlier rejected by the committee of the whole or the house when the house adopts an amendment in the nature of substitute reported by the committee of the whole ie completely new version of the bill this action could preclude recommittal motion from including amendatory instructions because any amendment would propose to reamend some portion of the bill that the house already has amended for this reason whenever special rule anticipates that the house will consider an amendment in the nature of substitute the special rule almost always provides explicitly for motion to recommit with or without instructions if the house considers bill under special rule amendatory instructions in the recommittal motion must conform with any other relevant provisions of that resolution for example if the special rule prohibits amendments to title ii of the bill in both the committee of the whole and the house it would be out of order to move to recommit the bill with instructions to amend title ii amendatory instructions also must abide by certain rulemaking provisions of law such as certain provisions in the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 93 344 88 stat 297339 as amended when the underlying measure is general appropriations bill motion to recommit with amendatory instructions must comply with other applicable house rules 8 most important the instructions

amendatory some recommittal motions contain nonamendatory instructions such as directing committee to hold hearing or to conduct study9 if the house recommits bill with nonamendatory instructions the

technology called the v chip formally the violence chip earlier representative markey had offered this identical section as an amendment in the committee of the whole the committee of the whole however adopted substitute for the markey amendment the substitute amendment offered by representative tom coburn proposed policy alternative that did not include the vchip requirement the committee of the whole then adopted the markey amendment as amended by the coburn substitute as result there was direct vote during the amending process in committee of the whole on the vchip mandate proposed in the original markey amendment ie the amendment as offered by representative markey not the version as amended by the coburn substitute representative markey secured this upordown vote in the house by offering motion to recommit hr 1555 to the committee on commerce with instructions that the bill be reported back forthwith with an amendment containing the text of the original markey amendment after the house adopted this motion to recommit chairman bliley reported the bill back to the house on behalf of the commerce committee with the amendment contained in the motions instructions the house then approved the amendment finally the house then passed hr 1555 which at that point contained both the text of the coburn substitute as well as the text of the original markey amendment this example illustrates how the minority party can use the motion to recommit with instructions to secure house vote on its policy alternative it also shows the effect of rules change made at the beginning of the 104 th congress and discussed in detail later in this report that guarantees the minoritys right to offer motion to recommit with instructions to bill or joint resolution before this rules change the special rule governing bill such as hr 1555 could have prohibited or limited the instructions that could be contained in motion to recommit the following excerpts from the

be either simple motions or motions containing instructions however motions to recommit conference reports do not have the same purpose or effect as motions to recommit measures during their initial house floor consideration simple motion to recommit conference report proposes only to send the report back to conference for further negotiation adopting this motion does not necessarily kill the bill motion to recommit conference report with instructions also seeks to return report to conference for further negotiation but it also proposes to instruct the house conferees also referred to as managers as to what they should try to achieve during these negotiations11 most commonly the instructions enjoin the house confer ees to insist on the house position on certain issue or to disagree to certain senate position the instructions are advisory in nature they are not binding on the house conferees representative cannot make point of order against conference report on the ground that it is inconsistent with instructions that the house had given to its conferees also the instructions must stay within the sc ope of differences between the house and senate positions in the conference for example in the 102nd congress motion to recommit the conference report on s 3 campaign finance reform legislation was ruled out of order because its instructions directed the house conferees to include in the conference report three provisions that went beyond the scope of the differences between the house and senate versions of the bill 11 the instructions are directed only to the house conferees not to the conference committee as whole because the house cannot instruct committee some of whose members are senators httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33860g22g145g142g561g15g152g157g146g152g151

remained within the scope of differences this second motion was defeated12 instructions in motions to recommit conference reports never direct conferees to report back to the house forthwith as motions to recommit bills with amendatory instructions almost always do the reason lies in the fact that the house cannot instruct committee comprising representatives as well as senators conference report can come to the house floor only after majority of the house conferees and majority of the senate conferees have signed it and the accompanying joint explanatory statement when the house adopts motion to recommit conference report simple or with instructions the house conferees carry the original papers back to conference and the same conferees remain appointed 13 if new conference report is later filed it receives new number and can be subjected to another motion to recommit motion to recommit conference report is in order on the house floor only if the senate has not acted on the report14 once the senate acts on conference report the senate conferees are discharged so there is conference committee to which the report can be recommitted at this point the house can vote only to accept or reject the conference report also motion to recommit conference report can be offered only after the previous question has been ordered on the reporteport has been ordered in some cases the house has recommitted conference report by unanimous consent 15 table 3 provides data on motions to recommit conference reports from the 101st congress through the 109th congress the overwhelming majority 85 of motions offered to recommit conference reports contained instructions the house adopted only one simple motion to recommit conference report during the 17year period16 there were instructions included in all the other recommittal motions that the house adopted 12 see congressional record vol 138 april 9 1992 p 90219023 13 house practice conferences between the houses chapter

mining legislation was in the conference report on the budget reconciliation bill that was scheduled to receive house floor consideration in several days when the new conference report on hr 1977 came to the house floor representative yates moved to recommit the report with instructions these instructions directed the house conferees to insist not only on the house position on senate amendment 158 ie with conditions but also on senate amendment 108 this second senate amendment allowed the forest service to sell more timber land in the tongass national forest the house adopted the motion to recommit 230 to199 with the support of 48 majority members 18 the conference committee reconvened for third time and filed new conference report hrept 104402 nearly one month later this third conference report extended the oneyear freeze without conditions and contained compromise on the tongass national forest issue in explaining the third conference report representative ralph regula majority floor manager for the report told the house the important thing i want to emphasizeis that we responded to the motion to recommit after the previous question was ordered on the conference report representative yates once again moved to recommit the report with instructions this time he proposed instructions that the house conferees insist on the house position regarding the tongass national forest the house rejected this motion 187241 and then adopted the conference report 244181 19 these examples of recommitting conference report in the house illustrates how motions to recommit with instructions can affect conference committee negotiations the house recommitted the first two conference reports on hr 1977 for the same reasonthe conferences rejection of the house position on senate ame ndment 178 in doing so the house sent the message that its adoption of the conference report required conference approval of the house position on that senate amendment while the

this has not always been the case however before 1909 the recommittal motion was typically reserved for representative friendly to measure typically the majority floor manager for the purpose of giving one more chance to perfect it as perchance there might be some error that the house desired to correct 20 in 1909 the house amended what is now rule xix clause 2a to add the language directing the speaker to give preferential recognition for offering the motion to recommit to member delegate or resident commissioner who is opposed to the measure21 by 1932 house precedents interpreting this rule firmly established that preferential recognition should be given to minority party member opposed to the underlying measure22 from 1934 to the start of the 104th congress however separate precedents held that the minority was only guaranteed the right to offer simple motion to recommit23 these precedents interpreted clause 6 of rule xiii as allowing the rules comm ittee to report special rule that prevented or limited the inclusion of instructions in motion to recommit bill or joint resolution because there were recorded votes in the committee of the whole until 1971 recommittal motion with amendatory instructions provided the only certain means for the minority to obtain recorded house vote on its policy alternative24 before 1971 special rule restricting amendatory instructions took away this minority tool for obtaining recorded votes or limited the minoritys ability to use that tool as it saw fit in the late 1980s and early 1990s the rules committee increasingly issued special rules that limited the offering of floor amendments in the committee of the whole socalled restrictive rules25 in some of these situations the republican minoritys only

instructions when restrictive special rule also prohibited instructions in the recommittal motion the minority sometimes was effectively blocked from offering its most important amendments26 during the 101st through the 103rd congresses the republican minority began to challenge the house precedents allowing the rules committee to report special rules that only permitted simple motion to recommit27 each challenge however resulted in the earlier precedents being sustained when the republican party took control of the house in the 104th congress the house amended its rules to preclude the rules committee from reporting special rule that prevents or limits the minority from offering recommittal motion with instructions to bill or joint resolution this rules change added the following new language to the last sentence of rule xiii clause 6c2 concerning motions to recommit bills and joint resolutions including motion to recommit with instruc tions to report back an amendment otherwise in order if offered by the minority leader or designee except with respect to senate bill or resolution for which the text of housepassed measure has been substituted with the addition of this language the houses rules explicitly recognize the minoritys prerogative to offer motion to recommit with or without instructions to bills and joint resolutions to summarize the situation in todays house the following principles govern preferential recognition for offering recommittal motions the speaker first looks to the minority leader or his designee thereafter under house precedents the speaker gives preferential recognition to minority members of the committee reporting the bill in their order of seniority on the committee then to other members of the minority and finally to majority members opposed to the bill28 the speaker gives preferential recognition to member who is opposed to the underlying measure when member seeks recognition to offer recommittal motion the speaker asks is the gentlewoman gentleman opposed to the measure once the representative answers affirmatively the speaker neither examines the degree of that members opposition nor does he

instructions house rule xix clause 2b allows ten minutes of debate if the motion is offered to bill or joint resolution debate is permitted on recommittal motions with instructions that are offered to other types of measures under clause 2c of the same rule the ten minutes of debate can be extended to one hour upon the demand of the majority floor manager when this demand is anticipated the special rule governing the measures floor consideration may specify that the recommittal motion with instructions shall be debatable for one hour30 debate time whether ten minutes or one hour is equally divided between the mover of the motion and member opposed to the motion usually the majority floor manager g18g152g146g151g157g156g561g152g143g561g17g155g141g142g155g561 the chair rules on whether motion to recommit is in order only in response to point of order that the motion violates house rule or precedent or provision of rulemaking statute or special rule member may make or reserve such point of order immediately after the recommittal motion is read or after the reading has been dispensed with by unanimous consent in situations where debate on the recommittal motion is permitted the point of order must also be made before debate on the motion begins in nearly all situations the chair decides whether to sustain or to overrule the point of order an exception is discussed below if the chair overrules the point of order the house proceeds to consider the recommittal motion 31 if the point of order is sustained new motion to recommit can be offered if it is offered in timely fashion the same principles also apply to points of order raised against amendments to motions to recommit as discussed in the next section special procedure is used for points of order raised under the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 pl 1044 109 stat 48 the chair does not rule on these points of order instead the house votes on whether to consider the matter against which point of order has been made this vote takes place after twenty minutes of debate that is equally divided between the member making the point of order and an opponent the first unfunded mandates point of order was raised against motion to recommit with instructions offered to hr 3136 contract with america advancement act in the 104 th congress this point of order claimed the motions instructions contained an unfunded governmental mandate the house voted not to consider the recommittal motion valid motion to recommit with instructions was subsequently offered and defeated32 30 for example in the 103rd

instructions such an amendment is in order only before the house votes to order the previous question on the motion this generally leaves only three opportunities for offering an amendment none of which arises frequently first for debatable recommittal motions only an amendment is in order once debate is completed if the previous question has not been ordered on the motion the mover of the recommittal motion controls the floor at this time and only that member can offer an amendment or yield to another representative to do so33 member seeking to amend motion to recommit would therefore have to ask the motions mover to yield for an amendment while the member offering the motion has little incentive to yield for that purpose it has happened on occasion34 second for both debatable and nondebatable motions to recommit an amendment can be offered if the member who offered the motion does not mo ve the previous question this is an unlikely scenario however the previous question motion has precedence over the motion to amend this means that if the previous question on the recommittal motion is not moved and member seeks to offer an amendment to the motion the motions sponsor could still move the previous question and prevent house consideration of the amendment35 last for both debatable and nondebatable motions to recommit an amendment can be offered if the previous question on the recommittal motion is defeated the previous question on the recommittal motion is typically ordered without objection and without formal vote taking place however member trying to offer an amendment could demand the yeas and nays on the motion to order the previous question if the house reject s that motion house precedents provide that member who in the speakers determination led the opposition to the previous question on the motion to recommit such as the chairman of the committee reporting the bill is entitled to offer an amendment to the motion regardless of party affiliation 36 in addition the member proposing the amendment would not necessarily have to qualify as being opposed to the bill37 debate is not permitted on an amendment to recommittal motion regardless of whether the underlying motion was debatable the amendments supporters may explain it and urge its adoption before they actually offer the amendmentfor example during whatever time may be available for debating the recommittal motion itself especially because the house normally must vote against ordering the previous question on the motion before any amendment to it can be offered the amendments proponents typically make their case in favor of the amendment in the process of urging members to vote against the previous question an amendment to recommittal motion must be germane to the underlying measure not necessarily to the instructions contained in the recommittal motion itself point of order against 33 us congress house procedure in the us house of representatives 97th cong

is read or after the reading has been dispensed with by unanimous consent if the chair sustains the point of order another amendment to the motion can be offered unless the house then votes to order the previous question simple motion to recommit bill or joint resolution can be amended to change the committees specified in the motion or to add instructions to the motion when the underlying measure is conference report the simple motion can be amended to insert instructions to the house conferees recommittal motion with instructions whether offered to bill or conference report can be amended to delete the instructions thereby making the recommittal motion simple one or to change the instructions in part or in whole substitute amendment striking out all the instructions and substituting new instructions cannot be ruled out as interfering with the right of the minority to move recommitment 38 even if it is majority party member who offers the substitute the house must approve an amendment to recommittal motion by simple majority vote first the house normally votes to order the previous question on the motion and the amendment that has been offered to it after the previous question is ordered the house first votes on the amendment if that amendment is approved the house then votes on adopting the recommittal motion as amended39
