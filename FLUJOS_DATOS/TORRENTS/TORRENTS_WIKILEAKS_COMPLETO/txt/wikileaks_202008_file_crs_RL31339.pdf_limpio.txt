claims it is handing off to presidentelect obama security environment in iraq that is vastly improved over that which prevailed during 20052007 it attributes that turnaround to the troop surge announced by president bush on january 10 2007 new way forward defense department reports assess that overall violence is down about 65 from late 2007 levels to levels not seen since 2004 major issue is that presidentelect obama has indicated that stabilizing afghanistan should be higher priority for the united states than iraq but us commanders say that the progress in iraq is fragile and could be jeopardized by too rapid drawdown they recommend measured incremental conditions based reductions in us forces and continued building of iraqs security forces until further political progress produces unified democratic iraq that can govern and defend itself and is an ally in the war on terror usiraq status of forces agreement sofa ratified by iraqs parliament on november 27 2008 mandates us withdrawal by the end of 2011 although presidentelect obama has said residual presence of us forces might be needed beyond that time us officials are increasingly worried that the ma ny political disputes that remain and some of which are escalating pose the greatest threat to the 2008 achievements these disputes are playing out in the runup to january 31 2009 elections in fourteen of iraqs eighteen provinces there are growing tensions between the shiitedominated government and those sunni leaders and fighters who have been key to stabilizing large parts of iraq as well as continued concerns over the degree to which the shiite faction of moqtada sadr although weakened is integrating into the political process other shiite parties that have been allied with maliki concerned about his displays of political strength in 2008are now competing with malikis party and reportedly assessing the possibility of trying to oust him politically tensions have increased significantly between the iraqi kurds and prime minister maliki over kurdish demands for control of disputed areas and local energy development deterioration the progress in 2008 came after several years of frustration that operation iraqi freedom had overthrown saddam husseins regime only to see iraq wracked by violent sunni arabled insurgency resulting sunnishiite sectarian violence competition among shiite groups and the failure of iraqs government to equitably administer justice or deliver services mounting us casualties and financial costswithout clear movement toward national political reconciliation

g343g561raq has not previously had experience with democratic form of government although parliamentary elections were held during the period of british rule under league of nations mandate from 1920 until iraqs independence in 1932 and the monarchy of the sunni muslim hashemite dynasty 19211958 the territory that is now iraq was formed from three provinces of the ottoman empire after british forces defeated the ottomans in world war i and took control of the territory in 1918 britain had tried to take iraq from the ottomans earlier in world war i but were defeated at kut in 1916 britains presence in iraq which relied on sunni muslim iraqis as did the ottoman administration ran into repeated resistance facing major shiiteled revolt in 1920 and major antibritish uprising in 1941 during world war ii iraqs first hashemite king was faysal bin hussein of sharif hussein of mecca who advised by british officer lawrence lawrence of arabia led the arab revolt against the ottoman empire during world war i faysal ruled iraq as king faysal i and was succeeded by his ghazi who was killed in car accident in 1939 ghazi was succeeded by his young faysal ii major figure under the british mandate and the monarchy was nuri assaid probritish pro hashemite sunni muslim who served as prime minister 14 times during 19301958 faysal ii with the help of assaid ruled until the mil itary coup of abd alkarim alqasim on july 14 1958 qasim was ousted in february 1963 by baath partymilitary alliance since that same year the baath party has ruled in syria although there was rivalry between the syrian and iraqi baath regimes during saddams rule the baath party was founded in the 1940s by lebanese christian philosopher michel aflaq as socialis t panarab movement the aim of which was to reduce religious and sectarian schisms among arabs one of the baath partys allies in the febr uary 1963 coup was abd alsalam alarif in november 1963 arif purged the baath including prime minister and military officer ahmad hasan albakr and instituted direct military rule arif was killed in helicopter crash in 1966 and was replaced by his elder brother abd alrahim alarif following the baath seizure of power in 1968 bakr returned to government as president of iraq and saddam hussein civilian became the regimes number twovice chairman of the revolutionary command council in that position saddam developed overlapping security services to monitor loyalty among the population and within iraqs institutions including the military on july 17 1979 the aging bakr resigned at saddams urging and saddam became president of iraq under saddam secular shiites held high party positions but sunnis mostly from saddams home town of tikrit dominated the highest positions saddams regime repressed iraqs shiites after the february 1979 islamic revolution in neighboring iran partly because iraq feared that iraqi shiite islamist movements emboldened by iran would try to establish an iranianstyle islamic

1991 launch of operat ion desert storm to reverse iraqs august 1990 invasion of kuwait president george hw bush called on the iraqi people to overthrow saddam that administration decided not to try to do so militarily because 1 the united nations had approved only liberating kuwait 2 arab states in the coalition opposed an advance to baghdad and 3 the administration feared becoming embroiled in potentially highcasualty occupation1 within days of the wars end february 28 1991 shiite muslims in southern iraq and kurds in northern iraq emboldened by the regimes defeat and the hope of us support rebelled the shiite revolt nearly reached baghdad but the mostly sunni muslim republican guard forces were pulled back into iraq before engaging us forces and were intact to suppress the rebellion many iraqi shiites blamed the united states for not intervening on their behalf iraqs kurds benefitting from usled fly zone set up in april 1991 drove iraqi troops out of much of northern iraq and remained autonomous thereafter the thrust of subsequent us policy was containment through security councilauthorized weapons inspections an international economic embargo and usled enforcement of fly zones over both northern and southern iraq 2 president george hw bush reportedly supported efforts to promote military coup as way of producing favorable government without fragmenting iraq after

difficulty of that strategy led the bush administration initially to continue its predecessors containment policy11 some believe the september 11 attacks provided administration officials justification to act on longstanding plans to confront iraq militarily during its first year the administration tried to prevent an asserted erosion of containment of iraq by achieving security council adoption resolution 1409 may 14 2002 of smart sanctions plan the plan relaxed unimposed restrictions on exports to iraq of purely civilian equipment12 in exchange for renewed internationa l commitment to enforce the ban on exports to iraq of militarily useful goods bush administration policy on iraq clearly became an active regime change effort after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in presiden t bushs state of the union message on january 29 2002 given as major combat in the usled war on the taliban and qaeda in afghanistan was winding down he characterized iraq as part of an axis of evil with iran and north korea some us officials particularly thendeputy defense secretary wolfowitz asserted that the united states needed to respond to the september 11 2001 attacks by ending states such as iraq that support terrorist groups vice president cheney visited the middle east in march 2002 reportedly to consult regional countries about the possibility of confronting iraq militarily although the arab leaders opposed war with iraq and urged greater us attention to the arab israeli dispute some accounts including the books plan of attack and state of denial by bob woodward published in april 2004 and september 2006 respectively say that then secretary of state powell central intelligence agency experts and others were concerned about the potential consequences of an invasion of iraq particularly the difficulties of building democracy after major hostilities ended other accounts include the downing street memo paper by british intelligence officials based on conversations with us officials saying that by mid2002 the administration was seeking information to justify firm decision to go to war against iraq president bush and thenbritish prime minister tony blair deny this on december 20 2001 the house passed hjres 75 by vote of 39212 calling iraqs refusal to readmit weapons inspectors mounting threat 11 one account of bush administration internal

g349g561the primary theme in the bush administrations public case for the need to confront iraq was that iraq posted grave and gathering threat that should be blunted before the threat became urgent the basis of that assertion in us intelligence remains under debate wmd threat perception senior us officials including president bush particularly in an october 2002 speech in cincinnati asserted the following about iraqs wmd 1 that iraq had worked to rebuild its wmd programs in the nearly four years since weapons inspectors left iraq and had failed to comply with 16 previous resolutions that demanded complete elimination of all of iraqs wmd programs 2 that iraq had used chemical weapons against its own people the kurds and against iraqs neighbors iran implying that iraq would not necessarily be deterred from using wmd against the united states and 3 that iraq could transfer its wmd to terrorists particularly qaeda for use in potentially catastrophic attacks in the united states critics noted that under the us threat of retaliation iraq did not use wmd against us troops in the 1991 gulf war comprehensive september 2004 report of the iraq survey group known as the duelfer report 13 found wmd stockpiles or production but said that there was evidence that the regime retained the intention to reconstitute wmd programs in the future the formal usled wmd search ended december 200414 although us forces have found some chemical weapons left from the iraniraq war15 unmovics work was formally terminated by security council resolution 1762 june 29 2007 links to qaeda iraq was designated state sponsor of terrorism during 1979 1982 and was again so designated after its 1990 invasion of kuwait although they did not assert that saddam husseins regime was directly involved in the september 11 attacks senior us officials asserted that saddams regime was linked to qaeda in part because of the presence of proal qaeda militant leader abu musab alzarqawi in northern iraq although this issue is still debated the report of the 911 commission found evidence of collaborative operational linkage between iraq and qaeda 16 march 2008 study by the institute for

held for transitional national assembly 18 provincial councils fouryear term and the kurdish regional assembly the sunni arabs still resentful of the us invasion mostly boycotted and major sunni slates were offered enabling the shiite united iraqi alliance uia to win slim majority 140 of the 275 seats and to ally with the kurds 75 seats to dominate the national government constitutional referendum subsequently constitution drafted by committee appointed by the elected government was approved on october 15 2005 sunni opponents achieved twothirds vote in two provinces but not in the three needed to defeat the constitution the crux of sunni opposition was the provision for weak central government federalism it allows groups of provinces to band together to form autonomous regions with their own regional governments internal security forces and large role in controlling revenues from any new energy discoveries sunnis oppose this concept because their region has thus far lacked significant proven oil reserves and they depend on the central government for revenues the constitution also contained an article 137 that promised special constitutional amendment process within set sixmonth deadline intended to mollify sunnis full term government in the december 15 2005 election for full four year term government some sunnis seeking to strengthen their position to amend the

during 2007 iraqi leaders began agitating to end the chapter 7 status of iraq viewing that as legacy of saddams aggression on nove mber 26 2007 president bush and prime minister maliki signed declaration of principles by video conference under which the mandate would be renewed for only one more year until december 31 2008 and that by july 2008 iraq and the us would complete bilateral strategic framework agreement and related status of forces sofa agreement that would replace the security council mandate these agreements were needed to keep us forces operating in iraq beyond the expiry of the mandate the strategic framework agreement was to outline the future political and economic relationship between the two countries section 1314 of pl 11028 the fy2007 supplemental says that the president shall redeploy us forces if asked to officially by iraqs government 26 formal sofa and related strategic framework agreement were negotiated and approved by iraqs parliament on november 27 2008 by vote of 14935 91 deputies not voting considered sufficient but not the overwhelming consensus urged by ayatollah sistani however the parliament passed that day related law requiring national referendum on the pact by july 31 2009 which could trigger termination of the pact one year subsequently the ratified draft is in effect as of january 1 2009 following signature by iraqs presidency council on december 11 2008 the sofa provides significant immunities from iraqi law for us troops while performing missions and for civilian employees of us forces but not for security contractors 27 it also delineates that us forces must coordinate operations with joint usiraq military committee one difference was resolved in july 2008 after maliki possibly bowing to sadrist and other opposition said the agreement should include timetable for us withdrawal the bush administration had repeatedly rejected firm timetables for withdrawal but president bush reportedly agreed with maliki on july 17 2008 to set timetable for us pullout from iraq at the end of 2011 the sofa sets that timetable eliminating previous provision that allowed for extension at iraqi request and stipulates that us combat forces will cease patrols in iraqi cities as of june 30 2009 alth ough the top us commander gen raym ond odierno said in december 2008 that some us forces might remain in some cities as trainers of iraqi forces the final draft also included provision not in previous drafts and intended to mollify iran that us forces cannot use iraq as base to attack other countries under the pact the green zone or international zone was handed over to iraqi control on january 1 2009 the sofa does not allow for permanent us bases in iraq the facilities used by us forces in iraq do not formally constitute permanent bases this is in line not only with iraqi insistence on full sovereignty but with recent us legislation including the defense appropriation for fy2007 pl 109289

resolutions designed to ease sunni concerns over government abuses and repression and thereby attract their support for the pact the resolutions called for release of eligible sunni detainees and for more sectarian balance in the security forces most of the opposition votes in the parliamentary vote came from the sadr movement his followers had held demonstrations against the pact in baghdad for the several weeks prior to the vote sadrs faction holds 30 seats in the 275 seat national assembly which was not enough to defeat it even if the assembly agreed to require twothirds vote according to some observers sadr had hoped to defeat the sofa by allying with shiite independents as well as sunnis there are about 70 sunni deputies in the assembly and secular leaders on december 24 2009 the cor after several attempts passed law authorizing nonus troop contingents to remain in iraq until july 2009 beyond the december 31 2008 expiration of the mandate of particular concern was the still large

his faction of the dawa party after the basra crackdown sunni and kurdish leaders rallied to malikis side because the operation showed his willingness to act against fellow shiites partly as result the leading sunni accord front bloc rejoined the cabinet in july 2008 taking one deputy prime ministership as well as the ministries of culture womens affa irs higher education communications and the state ministry of foreign affairs simultaneously the cor voted in four new uia members to fill vacancies left by the pullout of the sadrist faction from the cabinet in 2007 these cabinet changes added to the october 2007 replacement of two resigned sadrist ministers health and agriculture with independent shiites meaning that the cabinet now has only one vacancy justice that same political boost to maliki has brought on problems for him malikis perceived political strength has caused isci to compete vigorously against malikis dawa party in the provincial elections isci has always been viewed as the larger better organized party controlling the provincial leadership of at least four southern provinces unlike isci the dawa party never had an organized militia arm and maliki has tried to redress the power imbalance through alliances with local security forces and with shiite tribal leaders in the form of governmentdirected tribal support councils some reports suggest that iran is already actively working to support iscis prospects in those elections building on the longstanding ties between isci leaders and irans leadership the vigorous competition among shiite groups has manifested most notably in basra where 1300 candidates are competing for the provinces 35 council seats total of 440 seats in the fourteen provinces that will vote are up for election although many sunnis are coming into the politic process this trend has creating growing differences within the sunni arab political stru cture the established urbanbased sunni parties that participated in the december 2005 elections are now facing challenges from triballybased sunnis who are part of the awakening as sahw movement founded in late 2005 in ramadi by shaykh abd alsattar alrishawi to counter qaeda in iraq the awakening movement is credited with helping stabilize anbar in partne rship with us forces the tribal groups are competing vigorously in the upcoming provincial elections the awakening leaders have been working with the united states and its forces but they blame maliki for refusing to allow any more than 20 of the 92000 sons of iraq for mer insurgents who turned to assist the us military to join the iraqi security forces sign of malikis continued distrust the awakening movement is now headed by shaykh rishawis brother ahmad following rishawis assassination in september 2007 another key figure in their coalition is anbar province governor mamoun rashid alalwani this power st ruggle contributed to delay in the handover of anbar province to iraqi control but that handover did take place on september 1 2008 the splits among even the establishment sunnis have widened in advance of the provincial elections the main sunni bloc tawafuq fractured in december 2008 with the pullout of the national dialogue council party from the bloc the tensions contributed to the december 2008 decision by cor speaker mahmoud almashhadani to resign under criticism the sunnis have not been able to date to agree on new speaker although the provincial elections will not be held in the kurdish region the kurds remain fully engaged in the political structure in baghdad however they are increasingly at odds with maliki over the lack of progress in resolving the status of kirkuk and other disputed territories as well as central government opposition to the krgs decision to move forward on oil and gas

that proposal is now delayed until after the provincial elections it was the kirkuk dispute that caused presidential veto of the july 22 2008 cor vote held on july 15 despite kurdish walkout on the

officials say iraqis are freer than at any time in the past 30 years with free press and the ability to organize politically similarly the september 19 2008 report on international religious freedom

enough to celebrate christmas 2007 at churches in ba ghdad an attack on the yazidis in august 2007 noted above also appeared to reflect the precarious situation for iraqi minorities us military forces

duration and intensity of sunni arabled insurgency defied many expectations probably because it was supported by much of the iraqi sunni population that feels humiliated at being ruled by shiites and kurds some sunni insurgents have sought to return the baath party to power while others want to restore sunni control more generally the insurgent groups have been loosely coordinated within cities and provinces the most senior baathist still at large is longtime saddam confidant izzat ibrahim alduri qaeda in iraq aqi founded by abu musa b alzarqawi killed in june 7 2006 us airstrike has been key component of the insurgency because it is responsible for an estimated 90 of the suicide bombings against both combatant and civilian targets including such high profile attacks hpas as the august 2003 bombing of headquarters in baghdad aqi is composed of sunni fighters from around the arab and islamic world who have come to iraq to fight us forces and shiite domination of ira q however aqi has

contributing to the deteriorating security environment in 2006 and early 2007 was the increase in sunnishiite sectarian violence that many observers were characterizing as civil war the severe phase of sectarian violence was set off by the february 22 2006 aqi bombing of the askariya shiite mosque in samarra which set off wave of shiite militia attacks on sunnis in the first days after the mosque bombing top us officials said in late 2006 that sectarianmotivated violencemanifestations of an allout struggle for political and economic power in iraqhad displaced the sunniled insurgency as the primary security challenge since november 2007 us officials have presented statistics showing dramatic drop in sunnishiite violenceattributing the progress to the us troop surge and the ceasefire of the mahdi army called by sadr in august 2007 the sectarian warfare wrenched iraqi society by driving sunnis and shiites out of mixed neighborhoods some observers say sunnis largely lost the battle for baghdad with some accounts saying that baghdad was about 35 sunni arab during saddams rule but was reduced by the violence to about 20 many victims of sectarian violence turn up bound dumped in about nine reported sites around baghdad including in strainer devices in the tigris river the samarra mosque was bombed again on june 13 2007 and their were reprisal attacks on sunni mosques in basra and elsewhere although the attack did not spark the large wave of reprisals that the original attack did possibly because the political elite appealed for calm after this second attack the shrine is being reconstructed with the help of unesco discussed below are the two major shiite militias in iraq iscis badr brigades and the mahdi army badr brigades most badr militiamen have now folded into the isf particularly the national police and other police commando units the badr brigades were originally recruited trained and equipped by irans hardline force the revolutionary guard during the 198088 iraniraq war in which badr guerrillas conducted forays from iran into southern iraq to attack saddam regime targets badr fighters were recruited from the ranks of iraqi prisoners of war held in iran however many iraqi shiites viewed isci as an iranian puppet and badr operations in southern iraq during the 1980s and 1990s did not shake saddams grip on power this militia is led by hadi alamiri member of the cor from the badr organization of the uia in late 2005 us forces uncovered militia run detention facilities site 4 and arrested those badr brigade and related iraqi police running them mahdi army jaysh almahdi jam the march 2007 measuring stability reports said this militia had replaced aqi as the most dangerous accelerant of potentially selfsustaining sectarian violence in iraq us assessments of the jam subsequently softened as the jam largely abided by sadrs ceasefire of jam activities in august 2007 that directive might have represented an effort not to directly confront the us troop surge the jam later reemerged as perhaps the primary adversary of the united states and of maliki during the spring 2008 basra fighting discussed below

although sunnishiite violence is down us reports and officials say the shiite militias could return to iraq to interfere in the upcoming provincial elections and could be positioned to undermine iraqi stability over the long term if the united states draws down forces too quickly shiiteagainstshiite violence increased in 2007 and accelerated at times in 2008 perhaps because maliki and isci feared that the sadr faction was trying to achieve political influence commensurate with what it believes is its popularity since early 2007 these tensions had led to consistent but varying levels of internecine fighting among shiite groups in southern iraq primarily between the badrdominated isf police and army units on the one side and sadrs jam on the otherin competition for power influence and financial resources the most violent single incident took place on august 28 2007 when fighting between the jam and the isf purportedly mostly badr fighters within the isf in the holy city of karbala triggered by jam attempt to seize control of the holy sites there caused the death of more than 50 persons mostly isf and jam fighters the popular backlash led sadr to declare the jam ceasefire despite the ceasefire intrashiite skirmishing late r increased as international forces particularly those of britain reduced their presence in southern iraq britain redeployed its forces from the city to basra airport in september 2007 and it handed over control of the province to the iraqis on december 16 2007 there had been major concentrations of us troops there leaving the security of the city entirely the responsibility of the isf on march 26 2008 maliki ordered the launch of an isf offensive operation charge of the knights against the jam and other militias in basra in an effort to reestablish rule of law sadr read the move as an effort to weaken his movement in advance of planned provincial elections in the fighting the badrdominated isf units initially performed poorly many surrendered their vehicles weapons and positions to jam militiamen forcing the us and british military to support the isf with airstrikes mentors and advisers the fighting on march 30 2008 with an iranbrokered proposal by sadr and welcomed by the maliki government that did not require the jam to surrender its weapons as result of settlement that appeared to be on sadrs terms the offensive was at first considered setback to the isf subsequent to the offensive 1300 isf members were dismissed for refusing to fight and the iraqi police and army commander in basra were recalled to baghdad general petraeus in his april 2008 testimony called the offensive poorly planned and some reports suggest the maliki move preempted more deliberate move against the shiite militias in basra planned by mnfi however as result of subsequent us and britainbacked operations by the isf jam activities in basra and nearby provinces maysan qadisiyah have been reduced simultaneous with the basra combat and since jam fighters in the sadr city district of baghdad fired volleys of 107 mm iraniansupplied rockets on the international zone killing several us soldiers and civilians us and isf forces subsequently pushed into the southern districts of sadr city to take the rockets out of range the figh ting caused many sadr city residents to flee and fighting continued against us forces since may 10 2008 agreement for the jam to permit isf forces but not american forces to patrol northern sadr city the districtand jam activities in generalhas quieted considerably as result of the setbacks sadr announced in july 2008 transformation of his movement and of the jam in to cultural and social organization although with continued military activities by 2008 of special companies of mahdi fighters authorized to fight these special group fighters some of whom have retreated into iran but some of which are also said to be filtering back into iraq are said to be amenable to influence by tehran and

sides to help ease iraqs security difficulties the working group met for the first time on august 6 in his september 10 and 11 2007 testimony ambassador crocker said the talks with iran were worth continuing be cause iran might at some point alter its stance following us assessments of reduced iranian weapons shipments into iraq the united states agreed to another meeting with iran in baghdad but the planned december 18 2007 meeting was postponed over continuing usiran disagreements over the agenda for another round of talks as well as over irans insistence that the talks be between ambassador crocker and iranian ambassador hassan kazemiqomi on may 5 2008 iran said it would not participate in any further meetings in this channel because of the us combat in sadr city which iran

drawdown of an additional 8000 forces by february 2009a more cautious drawdown than anticipatedbecause of concerns 1 that violence could flare again as provincial elections approach 2 that situation

forces might remain in established sites in some cities beyond that date to train and mentor iraqi forces reduced sectarian killings more than 90 from levels of the same time period in 2007 the reduction in violence has enabled many families to return to baghdad and some districts formerly written off as aqi strongholds such as amiriyah the former baathist stronghold of adhamiyah and the formerly highly violent doura district are bustling with normal commerce g344g342g342g351g561g6g155g138g160g561g141g152g160g151g561g18g149g138g151g156g561 decisions have been announced regarding draw downs beyond those scheduled for the end of 2008 and press reports say that draw down recommendations will be completed by us military leaders some time in the spring of 2009 secretar of defense gates who has been reappointed by presidentelect obama has said the defense department is looking for ways to accelerate further draw downs in 2009 presidentelect obam has said since being elected that residual presence of us forces to continue to train iraqi forces and protect us personnelmight be needed beyond the end of 2011 withdrawal comp letion date stipulated in the sofa that presence is estimated by experts to possibly require 35000 70000 forces what is not clear is how the rate of draw down might be affected by any upsurge in violence some of the possibilities are discussed in the sections on options below g4g158g146g149g141g146g151g144g561g11g155g138g154g146g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g8g152g155g140g142g156g561g507g11g21g8g508g561 key to the rate of us draw down is the quali ty of the iraqi security forces isf the bush administration had said that its intent was to gradually transition us forces to an overwatch posture relying more on supporting iraqi forces rather than leading the combat this strategy was first articulated by president bush in june 28 2005 speech when he said our strategy can be summed up this way as the iraqis stand up we will stand down 42 however this emphasis on the isf was largely reversed subsequently as violence worsened and the administration judged that stability required the training and expertise of us forces responsibility for building the isf lies with the commander of the usled isf training mission the multinational transition security commandiraq mnstci that is now lt gen frank helmick as evidence of isf maturation and growth us commanders and others point to the increase in the number of units capable of operating with minimal coalition support or are in the lead and to their performance in ongoing combat operations against aqi in northern iraq recent measuring stability reports have praised the isf for growing professionalism and proficiency us officials have attributed some of the progress to interior minister jawad bolani for trying to remove militiamen and death squad participants from the isf numerous other isf commanders are said by us officials to be weeding out sectarian or nonperforming elements from isf and support ministry ranks the national police is now considered more effective and professional without its wholesale disbanding and rebuilding that was recommended by the jones commission us officials say the interior ministry headquarters has been almost completely transformed and is longer factionalized as it was one year ago mid2007 or populated with different guard forces 42 speech by president bush can be f ound at httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200506200506287html

both separately stated in january 2008 that the isf would not be re ady to secure iraq from internal threats until 2012 and from external threats until 20182020 despite the expanding size of the isf in testimony before the house armed services committee on july 9 2008 gen dubik rotating out shortened that time frame somewhat saying that the isf could assume the lead internal security role between 2009 and 2012 however the outer edge of that range is beyond the december 31 2011 us withdrawal date in the sofa suggesting that the sofa might have to be renewed or renegotiated if the isf cannot secure iraq alone by that time the measuring stability reports discuss and depict the degrees to which the iraqi government has assumed operational isf control and of isf security control over territory recommendations 42 43 and 44 of the iraq study group report advised an increase in training the isf and completion of the training by early 2008 prior to the signs of progress of the isf in 2008 the isf was mostly the subject of criticism some observers had gone so far as to say that th isf has been part of the security problem in iraq not the solution because of incidents of isf member involvement in sectarian involvement or possible antius activity still there are said to be as much as onethird of isf members absentwithoutleave or might have deserted at any given time many units remain unbalanced ethnically and by sect and penetrated by militias or even insurgents many sunnis distrust the isf as instruments of repression and responsible for sectarian killings according to observers appointments to senior commands continue to be steered toward shiite figures primarily dawa party members by malikis office of the commanderinchief run by his dawa subordinate dr bassima aljaidri she reportedly has also removed several qualified commanders who are sunni arabs causing sunni distrust of the iraqi military and she reportedly has routinely refused to follow us military recommendations to place more sunnis in security positions the about 110000 members of the facilities protection force fps which are security guards attached to individual ministries are involved in sectarian violence the united states and iraq began trying to rein in the force in may 2006 by placing it under some ministry of interior guidance including issuing badges and supervising what types of we apons it uses as of august 2008 over 35000 fps personnel have been formally placed under the ministry of interior including 22000 oil police transferred in january 2008 in recommendation 54 the

dependent primarily on donations of surplus equipment by coalition members the iraqi army is using mostly east bloc equipment including 77 t72 tanks donated by poland but is in the process of taking delivery of 4200 humvees from the united states the united states has sold iraq under foreign military sales fms about 45 billion worth of equipment thus far the equipment includes us munitions including upgrades to uh1 helicopters and various military vehicles some of which is for the iraqi police c130 transport aircraft m1ai abrams tanks helicopters light armored vehicles and armored

air force with combat aircraft because of the potential for misuse in sectarian or political conflict press reports in early january 2009 say iraq plans to buy up to 2000 retrofitted t72 tanks from eastern european suppliers the tanks would serve as the core of iraqs armored force which now has about 149 tanks in october 2007 it was reported that iraq also is ordering 100 million in light equipment from china to equip the isf police forces iraqi president talabani said part of the rationale for the china buy was the slow delivery of us weapons in october 2008 france said it is considering arms sales to iraq and the european union reportedly is discussing with iraq sales of small arms in recommendation 45 the iraq study group said the united states should encourage the iraqi government to accelerate its fms requests there are fears that some of these weapons are fa lling into the hands of insurgents militias or terrorist groups in august 2007 the gao reported that the

policing iraqi cities and should instead scale back its mission to 1 operations against aqi 2 an end to active patrolling of iraqi streets 3 force protection and 4 training the isf this option appears to be encapsulated in presidentelect obamas discussion of residual presence of us troops beyond the end of 2011 the rationale for the mission change has been to maintain us presence possibly long term to assist the isf and protect regroupi ng of aqi but without incurring large us casualties as of mid2008 the bush administration argued that improving security conditions have permitted the us mission to be reduced gradually to an overwatch posture focused on supporting and training iraqi forces rather than taking the lead on combat operations the mission change idea is partly incorporated into the sofa which requires us forces to pull out of iraqi urban areas by june 30 2009 as noted above 13 provinces have already been handed over to provincial iraqi control press report in june 2007 washington post june 10 2007 said that the scaledback mission described above might require retaining about 5000060000 us forces of these forces about 20000 would be assigned to guarantee the security of the iraqi government or assist the isf if it is having difficulty in battle change of mission was proposed by several senators for consideration of the fy2008 defense authorization hr 1585 but was

as noted above many of the iraq study group recommendations proposed increased regional and international diplomacy one idea included in the study group report was to form contact group of major countries and iraqi neighbors to prevail on iraqs factions to compromise the bush administration took significant steps in this direction including the multilateral and bilateral meetings on iraq discussed above some experts expect the obama administration to continue this trend possibly including steppedup gagement with iran to try to ensure iran does not exert excessive influence over iraq as us combat involvement is reduced in the 110 th congress few bills hr 744 hconres 43 and hconres 45 support the iraq study group recommendation for an international conference on iraq in the 109th congress these ideas were included in several resolutions including sjres 36 sres 470 sjres 33 and s 1993 although several of these bills also include provisions for timetables for us withdrawal other ideas involved recruitment of new force donors in july 2004 thensecretary of state powell said the united states would consider saudi proposal for contingent of troops from muslim countries to perform peacekeeping in iraq reportedly under separate command some iraqi leaders believed that such peacekeepers would come from sunni muslim states and would inevitably favor sunni factions within iraq with international partners now departing such ideas are not widely discussed among experts another idea has been to identify highlevel in ternational mediator to negotiate with iraqs major factions some members of congress wrote to president bush in november 2006 asking that he name special envoy to iraq to foll ow up on some of the administrations efforts to promote political reconciliation in iraq

government should be reorganized by the united states to be more inclusive of resentful groups particularly the sunni arabs however there is little agreement on what additional or alternative incentives if any would persuade sunnis leaders and their constituents to fully support government that is headed by shiites sunni resentment is unlikely to ease because shiite domination is likely to continue following the scheduled late 2009 national elections for new national assembly some believe that sunnis might be satisfied by wholesale cabinetgovernmental reshuffle subsequent to those elections that gives several leading positions such as that of president to sunni arab although many kurds might resent such move because kurd now holds that post the ability of the us to determine the post election power structure might be limited even if there were decision by presidentelect obama to try to do so some maintain that sunni

under way others opposed major usled governmental change because doing so might necessitate the voiding of the 2005 elections move that would appear undemocratic some argue that iraq could adopt the lebanon model in which major positions are formally allotted to representatives of major factions for example iraqis might agree that henceforth the president might be sunni the prime minister might be shiite and the cor speaker might be kurdish or some combination of these allocations some believe such as system has worked relatively well in lebanon helping it avoid all out civil war since the late 1980s although others argue that lebanon is perpetually unstable and that this model is not necessarily successful

political military and economic support behind the mainstream shiite and kurdish factions that have all along been the most supportive of the usled overthrow of saddam and which dominate iraqs government according to this view sometimes referred to as the 80 solution shiites and kurds are about 80 of the population 45 most sunni arabs will never fully accept the new order in iraq and the united states should cease trying to pressure the shiites and arabs to try to satisfy them opponents of this strategy say that it is longer needed because sunnis have now begun cooperating with the united states and are beginning to reconcile with the shiites and kurds others say this is unworkable because the shiites have now fractured and the united states now supports one group of shiites against anotherthe sadrists and their allies these factors demonstrate according to those with this view that it is possible to build multisectarian multi ethnic government in iraq others say that iraqs sunni neighbors will not accept complete us tilt toward the shiites and kurds which would likely result in even further repression of the sunni arab minority still others say that further us shift in favor of the shiites and kurds would contradict the us commitment to the protection of iraqs minorities

iraq cannot be stabilized as one country and should be broken up or hard partitioned into three separate countries one kurdish one sunni arab and one shiite arab 46 this option is widely opposed by broad range of iraqi parties as likely to produce substantial violence as iraqs major communities separate physically and that the resulting three countries would be unstable and too small to survive withou t domination by iraqs neighbors others view this as us attempt not only to usurp iraqs sovereignty but to divide the arab world and thereby enhance us regional domination still others view any version of this idea including the less dramatic derivations discussed below as unworkable because of the high percentage of mixed sunnishiite arab families in iraq that some say would require dividing bedrooms this recommendation was rejected by the iraq study group as potentially too violent 45 krauthammer charles the 20 percent solution washington post oped july 20 2007 46 the pros and

incr easing transfer of authority to sunni tribes in the sunni areas and the relative lack of us troops in the shiite south and that formalizing the policy would merely confirm the existing direction of us policy and of events on the ground in iraq others say that the sunni arabs who initia lly opposed federalism in the constitution now are reconsidering that view and might even wa nt to form their own autonomous sunni region the idea has been tested since april 2008 when the voluntarily moratorium ended on forming new regions agreed in october 2006 by the major factions when the regions law was adopted only in basra has there been substantial move to form new region some believe that popular shiite support for iscis drive to form major shiite region in southern iraq spanning as many as nine provinces has faded since the regions law was passed in part because of the iraqi resentment of iranian influence in the south proponents of the idea say that options such as this were successful in other cases particularly in the balkans in alleviating sectarian conflict proponents add that the idea is means of bypassing the logjam and inability to reconcile that characterizes national politics in iraq some believe that to alleviate iraqi concerns about equitable distribution of oil revenues an international organization should be tapped to distribute iraqs oil revenues opponents of the idea say it was proposed for expediencyto allow the united states to withdraw from iraq without establishing unified and strong central government that can defend itself still others say the idea does not take sufficient account of iraqs sense of iraq national identity which despite all difficulties is still expressed to wide range of observers and visitors others maintain that any soft partition of iraq would inevitably evolve into drives by the major communities for outright independence observer s in the balkans say that the international community had initially planned to preserve central government of what was yugoslavia but that this became untenable and yugoslavia was broken up into several countries 48 others say drawing some support from recent events betw een turkey and the iraqi kurds that the autonomous regions of decentralized iraq w ould inevitably fall under the sway of iraqs neighbors still others say that matter how the concept is implemented there will be substantial bloodshed as populations move into areas where their sect or group predominates the federalism or decentralization plan gained strength with the passage of on september 26 2007 of an amendment to the senate version of hr 4986 pl 110181 an fy2008 defense authorization bill the amendment passed 7523 to hr 1585 the original version that was vetoed over other issues showing

based on the final provisions of the iraqi constitution reflecting the possibility of major amendments to the constitution as discussed above that creates federal iraq and allows for federal regions conference of iraqis should be convened to reach comprehensive political settlement based on the federalism law approved by the cor in october 2006 the amendment does not specify how many regions should be formed or that regions would correspond to geographic areas controlled by major iraqi ethnicities or sects subsequently with the exception of the kurds and some other iraqi arab officials many of the main blocs in iraq jointly and separately came out in opposition to the amendment on some of the grounds discussed above although many of the iraqi statements appeared to refer to the amendment as partition plan an interpretation that proponents of the amendment say is inaccurate us embassy iraq statement on the amendment also appeared to mischaracterize the legislation saying as we have said in the past attempts to partition or divide iraq by intimidation force or other means into three separate states would produce extraordinary suffering and bloodshed the united states has made clear our strong opposition to such attempts g515g5g152g158g153g516g561g152g155g561g515g21g157g155g152g151g144g150g138g151g516g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g561 another option that received substantial discussion in 2007 time of significant us criticism of malikis failure to achieve substantial reconciliatio n is for the united states to oust maliki either through force or by influencing the cor to vote confidence in his government some believe maliki should be replaced by military strongman or some other figure who would crack down on militias or someone who is more inclined to reach compromise with the restive sunni arabs this option could imply that the united states might express support for those parliamentary blocs reportedly considering trying to oust maliki some say former prime minister allawi still is trying to position himself as an alternative figure claiming that his term in office was characterized by nonsectarianism and focus on enforcement of law however experts in the united states see concrete signs that such an option might be under consideration by the bush administration or by presidentelect obama using us influence to force out maliki would in the view of many conflict with the us goal of promoting democracy and rule of law in iraq g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g156g561 some believe that the key to continuing to calm iraq is to accelerate economic reconstruction accelerated reconstruction could in this view drain support for insurgents by creating employment improving public services and creating confidence in the government this idea propounded by dod reconstruction official paul brinkley deputy undersecretary of defense for business transformation in iraq was incorporated into the presidents january 10 2007 initiative in part by attempting to revive stateowned factories that can employ substantial numbers of iraqis prior to that the concept of using economic reconstruction to drive political accommodation was reflected in the decision to form prts as discussed above others doubt that economic improvement alone will produce major po litical results because the differences among iraqs major communities are fundamental and resistant to economic solutions another idea has been to set up an iraqi fund or trust that would sure that all iraqis share equitably in iraqs oil

senator hillary rodham clinton and senator john ensign supported the idea of an iraq oil trust modeled on the alaska permanent fund the two put this idea forward in legislation on september 11 2008 s 3470 many members believe that iraq now flush with oil revenues and unspent assets should now begin assuming more of the financial burden for iraq and that the united states should sharply cut back
