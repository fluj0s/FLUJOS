1001antihoax legislation in the 107th congress addressing problems since september 20011 background the united states has experienced proliferation of hoax anthrax attacks against its citizens since september 11 2001 thus placing the united states at war at home and abroad2 on november 7 2001 cnn news reported that the us postal service said it has been plagued in recent days by nearly 12000 hoaxes threats and suspicious mail incidents an average of 654 daily that have resulted in the evacuation of 429 postal facilities for varying amounts of time3 thus this would suggest that the cost of responding to these hoaxes both in financial and emotional terms has been substantial4 the director of the fbi robert mueller noted that the bureau has received 2300 reports of anthrax incidents since october 1 2001 the overwhelming majority of them he said are obviously hoaxes but he pointed out that investigating these hoaxes has wasted millions of dollars of antiterrorism resources5 federal law already prohibits bomb scares and similar hoaxes that 1 involve public transportation6 2 are transmitted by mail telephone or computer7 3 involve false reports affecting interstate or foreign commerce that consumer product has been tainted and if true would create risk of death or bodily injury to another person8 4 are statements or entries made with respect to any matter within the jurisdiction

under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years or both proposed 18 usc 881a general overall comparison of the various proposals is appendedproposed addressing hoaxes the house has passed an antihoax terrorism act hr 3209 and proposals have been offered by number of senators including several members of the senate judiciary committee ie s 1658 sens schumer dewine and hatch s 1659 sens hutchinson and sessions s 1665 sens biden and hatch s 1666 sen leahy and s 1719 sen feinstein legislation new crimes the housepassed bill hr 3209 and its senate counterpart s 1719 would add new section 1037 to title 18 providing for criminal and civil penalties proposed section 1037 provides that whoever engages in any conduct with intent to convey false or misleading information under circumstances where such information may reasonably be believed and where such information concerns an activity which would constitute violation of section 175 229 831 or 2332a shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years or both the other proposals are similar but with several significant differences21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31314crs4 22h rept 306 supra note 2 at 5 2318 usc 35 has alternative mens rea whoever willfully and maliciously or with reckless disregard for the safety of human life intent the house bill requires that the perpetrator have mens rea intent to impart the false impression or misleading information the judiciary committee believed that this mens rea requirement will protect innocent individuals who have acted inadvertently as an additional protection against prosecuting innocent or inadvertent behavior the legislative language requires that the information be reasonably believable and concern activities that would constitute violation of criminal law relating to biological chemical nuclear or weapons of mass destruction 22 minority of the house committee members favored the knowingly and maliciously standard found in s 1666 and reminiscent of the transportation hoax language of 18 usc 35 under the view that the section would otherwise apply to the ill advised jokester id at 235 additional views of reps conyers scott jacksonlee and waters23 each of the other bills uses knowing standard intended consequences each of the bills requires that the offender intend to impart the imminence of violation of 18 usc 175 229 and 831 relating to unlawful possession or use of biological chemical or nuclear material respectively the hutchinsonsessions bill s 1659 goes further the house version and the other senate proposals add 18 usc 2332a to the predicate offense list section 2332a proscribes unlawful use attempted use or threatened use of weapons of mass destruction term which it defines to include not only biological chemical and nuclear weapons but firearms and explosives as well thus under their terms the new law would reach false reports of man with gun both the leahy and schumerdewinehatch bills include section 2332a as predicate but narrow the scope of their offerings by requiring that the hoax be one which is reasonably likely to cause response by governmental agency jurisdiction only the bidenhatch bill using language similar to that in the federal bomb scare statute 18 usc 844e contains an explicit federal jurisdictional element through the use of the mail telephone or other instrument of interstate or foreign commerce the other proposals rely upon the jurisdictional foundations of the predicate offenses instead of free standing crime their hoax prohibitions might as easily have been added as subsections to the predicate offenses biological chemical nuclear and massively destructive weapons offenses thus their jurisdictional pedigree would seem to be as good as that of the predicate offenses to which they relatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31314crs5 24h rept 306 supra note 2 at 5 25s 1659 whoever communicates information knowing the information to be false concerning the existence of activity which would constitute violation of section 175 229 or 831 is liable to the united states for civil penalty of the greater of 10000 or the amount expended by the united states incident to the investigation of such conduct including the cost of any response made by any federal military or civilian agency to protect public health or safety proposed 18 usc 881b s 1665 whoever through the use of the mail telephone telegraph or other instrument of interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce knowingly engages in any conduct that is likely to impart the false impression that activity is taking place or will take place that violates section 175 229 831 or 2332a of this title shall be liable to the united states or any state for civil penalty of the greater of 10000 or the amount of the money expended by the united states or the state in responding to the false information proposed 18 usc 2339cbsentences the proposals punish offenders by imprisonment for not more than 5 years and fine of the greater of 250000 or twice the amount of damage caused the house committee observed that this new provision is consistent with current provisions in the criminal code that treat hoaxes related to certain crimes as felonies for example 18 usc 1365c1 provides whoever knowingly communicates false information that consumer product has been tainted shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years or both24 the same penalties attach to violations of 18 usc 35 transportation hoaxes although 844e threats and bomb scares carries 10year maximum term of imprisonment civil liabilitycivil penalties violations of 18 usc 35 hoaxes involving transportation facilities subject the offender to the possibility of civil penalties of not more than 1000 recoverable by the united states in civil cause of action other than the leahy and schumerdewinehatch bills the proposals adopt variation of this approach the housepassed legislation and its senate companion create cause of action for expenses incurred as consequence of responding to hoax or more precisely whoever engages in any conduct with intent to convey false or misleading information under circumstances where such information concerns an activity which would constitute violation of 175 229 831 or 2332a is liable in civil action to any party incurring expenses incident to any emergency or investigative response to that conduct for those expenses the bidenhatch and hutchinsonsessions proposals call for civil penalties in an amount equal to the greater of 10000 or the cost of response25 the house bill permits recovery by federal state local and private entities and individuals even if damage is less than 10000 the civil penalties are set at minimum of 10000 and are recoverable only by the federal government in the case of the hutchinsonsessions bill and only by the federal or state governments in the case of the bidenhatch legislation unlike restitution or reimbursement under the proposals neither the cause of action nor the civil penalties require prior criminal convictionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31314crs6

schumerdewinehatch hutchinsonsessions and bidenhatch bills explicitly include the costs of responses made to protect public health and safety the hutchinsonsessions proposal extends only to federal costs bidenhatch requires reimbursement of both federal and state authorities the schumerdewinehatch offering covers expenses incurred incident to the investigation regardless of who incurs them the housepassed bill and its feinstein counterpart insist on reimbursement of any party for expenses incident to any emergency or investigative response most explicitly sweeping of all the leahy proposal requires restitution to victims for losses suffered and reimbursement for federal and state governmental entities for expenses incurred in response some members of the house judiciary committee objected to the mandatory nature of the reimbursement provision in the house bill on the grounds that it would negate any prospect of individualized sentencing and that its impact would be disproportionately felt by the economically disadvantaged hreptno 30629 constitutional questions first amendment whenever communications are outlawed first amendment free speech questions are likely to arise statute which makes criminal form of pure speech must be interpreted with the commands of the first amendment clearly in mind30 not all speech however enjoys first amendment protection the supreme court has observed on number of occasions that the first amendment affords violence and the threat of violence protection31 but only true threats are unshielded political hyperbole obvious jokes and the like do not qualify as threats first amendment concerns are satisfied by excluding statements which are when taken in context not true threats because they are conditional and made in jest32 the speaker need not intend or even have the capacity to carry out his promise of criminal harm33 it is enough under the circumstances that those to whom the threat is communicated reasonably believe the speaker is able andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31314crs8 34united states v morales 272 f3d 284 287 5th cir 2001 3518 usc 35 36united states v rutherford 332 f2d 444 446 2d cir 1964 37new york times co v sullivan 376 us 254 27980 1964intends to carry it out the true threat one beyond the pale is one that the recipient of the incontext threat reasonably feared would be carried out34 and so it is with the hoax which differs from the threat in that the speaker need not be the agent of harm the courts have long observed as the second circuit noted when considering first amendment challenge to the transportation hoax statute35 if the statute so far as it applied to aircraft were limited to making criminal the imparting of false information with respect to the existence of bomb on loaded aircraft there could be little doubt that the giving of the false information would be beyond the protection of the first amendment it would fall within the principle of the false cry of fire in crowded theater the classic illustration of unprotected speech given by mr justice holmes36 the fact that the speaker knows the hoax is false removes it even farther from the shelter of the first amendment even in the arena of public debate where free speech concerns are most strongly felt those who make harmful statements of fact that they know to be false may claim first amendment protection37 the criminal sanctions in each of the bills would appear to survive first amendment scrutiny since each is cast so that criminal liability turns upon the offenders knowing creditable but false communication of the existence of dangerous criminal condition or threat of such condition the civil liability and civil penalty provisions might pose more difficult issue two of the bills s 1658 and s 1666 have only criminal and reimbursement components one s 1665 uses identical language to describe the elements of the criminal and civil wrongs it proscribes the others hr 3209s 1719 and s 1659 however use identical language except that their civil penaltycivil cause of action omits one of the elements found in their criminal prohibition ie that the hoax be objective ly creditable under circumstances where such information may reasonably be believed in the case of threat this deletion would appear to usher in first amendment problems the presence of some creditable anticipation of the announced harm is what separates the true threat from the statement protected by the first amendment on the other hand the first amendment is less protective of intentional false statements threat need not be false but hoax must be in the case of hoax the courts have given clear indication of whether less than creditable statement of impending harm loses its first amendment protection because the speaker also knows the statement is false moreover hoax sentences might be thought to raise first amendment issues similar to those raised by hate crimes statutes following enactment of the proposals the sentencing guidelines would increase the sentencing range for hoax if the offender were motivated by the victims race color religion national origin ethnicity gender

question would be when two people commit the same crime should the sentencing guidelines provide that person with hate in his or her mind receive higher sentence than the person with more trivial motive39 the supreme court has made it clear however that motivation is valid basis for sentencing distinctions the first amendment notwithstanding40 double jeopardy double jeopardy concerns may have induced the creation of crimes and civil penalties or causes of actions with different element s the fifth amendments double jeopardy clause command that person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb prohibits multiple prosecutions by the same sovereign for the same offense41 second prosecution is permissible if the offenses are not the same that is if each requires proof of fact which the other does not42 the reference to life or limb notwithstanding the clause is not restricted to instances where an individual is twice exposed to the peril of execution or imprisonment for the same offense the supreme court articulated the applicable standards for whether crime and parallel civil penalty for the same misconduct may raise double jeopardy concerns in hudson v united states 43 the clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense whether particular punishment is criminal or civil is at least initially matter of statutory construction even in those cases where the legislature has indicated an intention to establish civil penalty the court has inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect as to transform what was clearly intended as civil remedy into criminal penalty in making this latter determination the factors listed in kennedy v mendozamartinez 44 provide useful guideposts including 1 whether the sanction involved an affirmative disability or restrainthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31314crs10 2 whether it has historically been regarded as punishment 3 whether it comes into play only on finding of scienter 4 whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishmentretribution and deterrence 5 whether the behavior to which it applies is already crime 6 whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it and 7 whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned it is important to note however that these factors must be considered in relation to the statute on its face and only the clearest proof will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated civil remedy into criminal penalty the house bill and its senate companion seem likely to withstand double jeopardy challenges for at least three reasons first as noted earlier the crime and cause of action they create have different elements second double jeopardy concerns would only be implicated if the united states brings the cause of action suit by state or private party would have double jeopardy consequences since double jeopardy is only implicated if both prosecutions are initiated by the same party third it is characterized as civil cause of action to compensate those who have suffered by the wrong it defines nothing in its provisions implies punitive purpose certainly nothing so draconian as to warrant overcoming the basic presumption and concluding that the cause of action was created to punish that it is criminal sanction in disguise the same can be said for the civil penalty provision of the hutchinsonsessions proposal except for the fact that its civil penalty may only be enforced by the united states consequently the proposal cannot claim the different party distinction the civil penalty established in the bidenhatch bill cannot assert different elements defense because it uses the same elements of the crime and civil penalty it creates nevertheless double jeopardy questions would arise when state seeks to enforce the civil penalties and the penalty it envisions seems both compensationrelated and not so excessive as to overcome the basic presumption that the penalty should not be characterized as criminal penalty finally the presence of postconviction reimbursement device available for the same costs covered by the civil penalty suggests that the civil penalty provisions may have been intended to provide an alternative to prosecution in less serious cases in much the same manner exposing an individual to both criminal penalties and reimbursement order as consequence of conviction poses double jeopardy problemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31314crs11 appendix threats hoaxes and related state statutes alabama ala code 13a623 menacing by physical conduct causing another to reasonably fear imminent
