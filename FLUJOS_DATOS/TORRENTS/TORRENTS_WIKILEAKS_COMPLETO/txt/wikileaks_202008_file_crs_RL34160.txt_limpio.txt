science and technology policy resources science and industry division jim monke specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division frank gottron specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division the national bio and agrodefense facility issues for congress summary the agricultural and food infrastructure of the united states is potentially susceptible to terrorist attack using biological pathogens in addition to the effects of such an attack on the economy some animal diseases could potentially be transmitted to humans these diseases are known as zoonotic diseases scientific and medical research on plant and animal diseases may lead to the discovery and development of new diagnostics and countermeasures reducing the risk and effects of successful terrorist attack to safeguard the united states against animal disease congress has appropriated funds to the us department of agriculture usda to engage in research at the plum island animal disease center piadc off the coast of new york on animal diseases not native to the united states when creating the department of homeland security dhs in 2003 congress transferred piadc from usda to dhs both usda and dhs in cooperation with usda conduct foreign animal disease research at piadc but piadc has been identified as outdated and too limited to continue as the primary facility for this research homeland security presidential directive 9 tasks the secretaries of agriculture and homeland security to develop plan to provide safe secure and stateoftheart agriculture biocontainment laboratories for research and development of diagnostic capabilities and medical countermeasures for foreign animal and zoonotic diseases to partially meet these obligations dhs has requested congress to appropriate funds to construct new facility the national bio and agrodefense facility nbaf this facility would house highcontainment laboratories able to handle the pathogens currently under investigation at piadc as well as other pathogens of interest six candidate sites have been identified one of which is plum island the dhs plans to select the site in 2009 and open nbaf in 2015 the final construction cost will depend on the site location and has been estimated to range between 648 million and 939 million significantly exceeding 2005 baseline projections additional expenses such as equipping the new facility relocating existing personnel and programs and preparing the piadc facility for disposition may exceed an additional 100 million the plans announced by dhs to establish the nbaf have raised several issues community concerns about safety and security previously expressed about piadc and other laboratories being built to study dangerous pathogens are also being voiced about nbaf coordination between dhs and usda as well as prioritization and investment in agricultural biodefense may be reassessed if more highcontainment laboratory space becomes available research with live foot and mouth disease fmd virus is allowed on the us mainland only if explicitly permitted by the usda secretary however the food conservation and energy

nbaf space by gross square footage 21 the national bio and agrodefense facility issues for congress introduction the agricultural and food infrastructure of the united states is key component of economic productivity and growth terrorist attack on this infrastructure could damage the public trust in agricultural safety and quality and the nations ability to provide food and other agricultural products1 additionally many animal diseases can infect humans2 these types of diseases are termed zoonotic scientific and medical understanding of such zoonotic diseases in their animal hosts may protect the animals themselves and could also lead to the discovery and development of new medical countermeasures for humans to safeguard the united states against the impacts of naturally occurring and intentional animal disease outbreaks the us department of agriculture usda engages in animal disease research including research into highly contagious animal pathogens and animal diseases not native to the united states3 such research activities have historically been performed at the plum island animal disease center piadc located on plum island an island near long island new york when creating the department of homeland security dhs in 2003 congress transferred the operation of the piadc facility from usda to dhs though usda still maintains an active research program at piadc the dhs in cooperation with usda has established its own research and development program at piadc as the federal government undertakes new efforts in human biodefense and defense against agroterrorism dhs has characterized the piadc facility as reaching the end of its life cycle and lacking critical capabilities and asserts it can longer continue as the primary facility performing this research4 homeland security presidential directive 9 hspd9 tasks the secretaries of agriculture and homeland security to develop plan to provide safe secure and stateoftheart agriculture biocontainment laboratories that research and develop 1 for more background on the potential of terrorism directed against agriculture and food see crs report rl32521 agroterrorism threats and preparedness by jim

technology directorate fy2006 congressional justification p 44 crs2 diagnostic capabilities for foreign animal and zoonotic diseases5 the secretary of homeland security is to coordinate an acceleration and expansion of new and current countermeasure development these countermeasures are to be against the intentional introduction or natural occurrence of catastrophic animal plant and zoonotic diseases including countermeasure research and development of new methods for detection prevention technologies agent characterization and dose response relationships for highconsequence agents in the food and the water supply6 the department of homeland security has announced that to meet the obligations of hspd9 it will establish new facility the national bio and agrodefense facility nbaf7 this facility would have highcontainment laboratories able to hold the pathogens currently under investigation at piadc as well as other pathogens of interest the plans announced by dhs to establish nbaf have raised congressional and public concerns regarding its safety and security and policy questions about coordination between dhs and usda regarding the research to be conducted at nbaf the dhs has narrowed the number of possible sites for nbaf to six the sites are located in athens ga manhattan ks madison county ms granville county nc san antonio tx and plum island ny8 the dhs published draft environmental impact statement eis on june 27 2008 that addresses some of the effects building and operating the facility would have on each site9 the dhs expects to publish the final eis in late fall 200810 and announce the selected site in january 200911 this report outlines current progress towards establishment of the nbaf presents current and projected funding levels and

capacity and capability existing at piadc the highest level of biocontainment available at piadc is biosafety level 3 agricultural bsl3ag12 because dhs plans to perform experiments with some pathogens that require higher level of protection approximately 10 of nbafs gross square footage would be bsl4 laboratories13 the dhs foresees multiple uses and goals for the new facility serving as unique bsl3 and bsl4 livestock laboratory capable of developing countermeasures for foreign animal diseases providing advanced test and evaluation capability for threat detection vulnerability assessment and countermeasure assessment for animal and zoonotic diseases and supporting the countermeasure licensing process14 the research agenda for nbaf is to be at least partially based on current risk assessments and subject to change as the risk assessments change the dhs predicts that the facility will focus on foot and mouth disease fmd classical swine fever african swine fever rift valley fever nipah virus hendra virus contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and japanese encephalitis15 the dhs plans to perform research at nbaf to study how these pathogens enter the animal what types of cell the disease affects what effects the disease has on cells and animals and how newly developed countermeasures help the animal develop protection against the disease 12 pathogen biosafety levels and

obtaining expressions of interest to be the site of nbaf selecting prospective sites from these expressions of interest and requesting further information assessing the information provided and visiting these prospective sites narrowing the number of prospective sites to list of final sites preparing environmental impact studies of the final sites choosing site for nbaf and constructing the facility this process is currently at the environmental impact study phase the dhs stated it planned to choose the final site by october 200816 however dhs recently revised that prediction to january 200917 expressions of interest in january 2006 dhs issued request for expressions of interest from consortia interested in hosting nbaf consortia responding to the dhs request included academia industry and nonprofit institutes in its request dhs described four criteria that the agency would use when considering the expressions of interest research capabilities workforce

reportedly estimated by dhs as up to 100 million42 however dhs noted in 2007 that building nbaf at the plum island site would produce substantially lower transition activity costs43 these costs might be seen as partially offsetting the higher estimated construction costs of building nbaf on plum island see table 6 additional delays to the construction schedule may further change the final cost of the facility due to changing material and labor costs44 building on the mainland would allow dhs to sell plum island to possibly recoup some of the costs of nbaf construction see selling plum island

congress also considered permitting fmd research on the mainland through hr 1717 the fy2009 dhs appropriations bills contain language that would either authorize or require the sale of plum island if dhs selects mainland site for nbaf as of this date hr 6947 and s 3181 respectively as reported by the house committee for appropriations the department of homeland security appropriations act 2009 hr 6947 would forbid the use of fy2009 appropriated funds for design or construction of nbaf on the mainland until the dhs completes risk analysis of whether footandmouth disease work can be done safely on the united states mainland and until the government accountability office gao reviews this risk assessment consequences of pathogen release although the likelihood of pathogen release is low pathogens have escaped from high containment laboratories through accidental releases the potential consequences of such release vary widely since the effects would depend on the pathogen type amount location and method of release weather conditions presence of susceptible nearby humans or animals and the effectiveness of any government and private sector response since nbaf will store pathogens known to have significant animal health impact the consequences of pathogen release has been topic of great interest the draft eis addresses the consequences of foreign animal disease pathogen release from nbaf at the different candidate locations although some of the pathogens evaluated to be studied at nbaf can cause human disease the draft eis analysis focuses on economic losses following pathogen release rather than modeling the effect on public health effects the analysis presented relies on limited model to estimate the economic effects of release of three of the pathogens foot and mouth disease virus rift valley fever virus and nipah virus planned to be studied at nbaf46 dhs chose these pathogens for analysis in the eis because dhs considered them representative of all of the pathogens to be studied at nbaf attempts to calculate or model the effects of disease outbreak are complicated and have produced differing results in 2008 the usda developed complex economic model to estimate the costs associated with outbreaks of foreign animal diseases47 whether the results of this model which has not been applied to all of the pathogens to be stored at nbaf are in accord with those used in the draft eis may shed light on the efficacy of the draft eis release consequence assessment foot and mouth disease foot and mouth disease fmd is highly contagious disease that affects

crs13 acquired infections48 an outbreak on the mainland would likely cause severe disruption in the nations export markets several groups have attempted to estimate the cost of an outbreak of fmd either through an agroterrorist attack or an accidental release university of california study in 1999 estimated the potential impacts of an fmd outbreak in california at between 85 and 135 billion49 2002 purdue university and usda study found that an fmd outbreak in the united states similar to the 2001 outbreak in the united kingdom could reduce farm income by 14 billion 2002 national defense university study estimated that limited outbreak of fmd on just 10 farms could have 2 billion financial impact50 the usda used fmd to illustrate the use of their complex economic model and determined an fmd outbreak would cost between 28 billion and 41 billion51 this estimate correlates closely with the estimate generated for the draft eis which indicated an accidental fmd release from nbaf would cost between 28 billion plum island and 42 billion kansas52 rift valley fever rift valley fever is disease that affects humans and many domesticated animals including sheep cattle goats and dogs approximately 8 of infected people become severely ill its fatality rate in humans depends on many factors including strain of the virus and underlying health of the patient but is generally considered to be approximately 153 this disease is transmitted through mosquito bite or through handling infected animals the draft eis does not contain an independent estimate of the cost of release of the rift valley fever virus from nbaf rather it cites 2004 estimate from the rift valley working group group of government and nongovernment experts this group estimated the impact of deliberate release at multiple locations on the us economy as 50 billion54 in contrast to fmd and as previously noted rift 48 department of homeland security national bio and agrodefense facility draft

valley fever can infect and kill humans the rift valley working group estimated that the scenario they studied would result in 114 human deaths within the first year following the attack in the draft eis dhs concludes that because rift valley fever could become endemic in the united states following release from nbaf the cost of release could approach the levels projected by the rvf working group55 the dhs did not differentiate costs of release from each of the proposed sites the draft eis does state that release from the plum island site or the kansas site is less likely to result in rift valley fever becoming an endemic disease and thus represents smaller threat to the national economy56 nipah virus nipah virus is serious disease that affects humans and some domesticated animals including pigs cats dogs cattle goats and horses the mortality rate varies for humans varies by outbreak but approximately 40 of infected humans die nipah virus is not easily transmissible from person to person but people with close contact with sick people animals or infected tissues can become infected57 the draft eis estimated release of nipah virus from nbaf would cost the pig industry 19 million58 although nipah virus can kill humans dhs did not estimate the potential number of lives lost due to nipah virus release from nbaf in the draft eis the dhs did not differentiate costs of release from each of the proposed sites although the draft eis states the plum islands relative isolation from susceptible livestock would lower the risk to the regional and national economy59 adequacy of response plans given the potential consequences associated with pathogen release from nbaf policymakers may question the adequacy of the governments planned response to release the usda responded to previous releases of fmd on plum island and has developed plan to contain an outbreak from mainland site according to usda the plan accounts for many factors including the size of the outbreak how the outbreak was detected and local circumstances the plan includes 54 continued august 2426 2004 available online at httpnabcksueduassetsfactsheet_docsrvf rift20valley20reportpdf 55

less well prepared to contain other diseases it plans to study at nbaf in august 2007 the usda and the rift valley fever working group noted that the federal government lacked single comprehensive response plan for rift valley fever rvf outbreak furthermore the authors asserted the united states has national and state assets for vector surveillance but none for vector control in the event of an rvf outbreak we would have to rely on cooperation from local mosquito abatement agencies that may or may not be distributed where they are most needed the us military has the logistic capability to perform vector control anywhere in the country and has done so on casebycase basis but agreements or even discussions have taken place to make the military part of vectorborne disease response plan61 in more recent meetings the rift valley working group has noted that the federal government is making some progress addressing these needs62 although nbaf will not commence research for several years policymakers might decide that response plans should be fully evaluated and in place before nbaf begins operations the viability and cost of the response plans might differ between the alternative nbaf sites and influence the final choice for example responding to release from site surrounded by potential wildlife or livestock animal disease hosts could be more expensive than from site that was not adequacy of protection against pathogen release pathogen release is potential risk at all highbiocontainment laboratories biosafety guidelines and the select agent program have been implemented to help reduce the probability that pathogen might be released from laboratory thus the likelihood that pathogen would be accidentally released from the laboratory into the surrounding area is generally considered to be low biosafety guidelines to protect against an accidental pathogen release or an occupational exposure to laboratory worker the department of health and human services and the usda have developed guidelines for the construction maintenance and operation of highbiocontainment laboratories these guidelines take into account the properties of the pathogen and the types of experiments being performed the established biocontainment levels have increasing levels of rigor and these biocontainment protocols are adhered to as matter of best practice in government academic and industrial laboratories63 60 bill white usda public statement at nbaf draft environmental impact statement public meeting washington dc july 24 2008 61 seth britch kenneth linthicum and the rift

outside of laboratory high containment areas worldwide including several at the piadc64 since 2004 laboratory workers in the united states have been exposed to several pathogens including those that cause tularemia ebola anthrax q fever and brucellosis65 security concerns regarding the potential for terrorist use of pathogens also has led to the application of registration of researchers and facilities that work with or possess certain select agents the piadc must conform to the regulations of the agricultural select agent program promulgated by usda and the nbaf would as well66 under these regulations pathogens and toxins that pose severe threat to public animal or plant health have been identified and listed as select agents agricultural select agents are pathogens and toxins including fmd that pose severe threat to animal or plant health entities that possess use or transfer these select agents are required to develop security plans for protecting the select agents register with the usda animal and plant health inspection service aphis and become certified as eligible to possess select agents researchers handling select agents must pass security review by the department of justice even with these guidelines and regulations in place some critics remain concerned that these protections may be insufficient67 government investigations have found many examples

similarly found compliance problems69 such violations have led to the levying of 1887000 in fines and the suspension of permission of one laboratorys permission to use select agents70 should nbaf be on the mainland historically in the united states foreign animal disease has been studied on an island separated from the mainland because of concerns that the disease pathogens might infect animals and spread through domestic wildlife and livestock as biocontainment technology has increased in sophistication questions have been raised whether such research could now be performed safely on the mainland additionally questions have been raised about the efficacy of water barrier in preventing animals from swimming to the island and whether pathogens could be carried by air from an island to the mainland in the current context policymakers face tradeoff between potentially increased risk of infection following pathogen release versus lower construction operating and maintenance costs and greater efficiency and ease of access according to dhs pathogen release from laboratory on the mainland would cause greater harm than equivalent release from laboratory on plum island the dhs noted that with the exception of plum island each of the proposed sites resides in an area where the wildlife vegetation agriculture and human populations provide ample opportunity for each of the viruses fmdv rvfv and nipah virus to become established and spread once released from nbaf71 largely because of this risk only the plum island site qualified for the low sitespecific risk category while the other sites were deemed moderate risk72 in congressional testimony dhs has stated that modern biocontainment technology is sufficient to prevent an accidental release73 however in the eis dhs noted that despite improved engineering and design of highbiocontainment biological laboratories accidents due to human error or maintenance failures could cause releases and described three such incidents

draft continued crs18 some analysts and foreign governments have concluded that research on certain agricultural pathogens should only be done in geographically isolated laboratories75 according to the gao when the governments of denmark and germany faced the same question of whether to build new foot and mouth disease laboratories on the mainland or to replace aging island laboratory infrastructure both decided to keep the laboratories on islands76 the government of australia chose to contract its research using live fmd virus to locations in other countries in contrast fmd research is conducted in mainland laboratory in canada77 permission to work with foot and mouth disease despite the potentially higher costs of rift valley fever virus release in terms of economic costs and human lives lost78 most of the debate about mainland versus island laboratories has focused on fmd this likely arises in part from the legal restrictions placed on such research currently research on live fmd virus is statutorily limited to locations outside of the mainland of the united states only if the secretary of agriculture provides an explicit permit under 21 usc 113a may research on live fmd virus be performed on the mainland of the united states79 the gao concluded that dhs has not performed the necessary analysis to determine whether it is possible to safely perform fmd research on the mainland80 the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 pl 110329 forbids the obligation of fy2009 appropriated funds for the construction

mainland of the united states if nbaf is located on the mainland of the united states and is to perform highvalue foreign animal disease research researchers at the facility will likely need to receive such permission from the secretary of agriculture to perform fmd research81 while some experts might construe this permission as formality since under hspd9 dhs and usda are to coordinate their activities in food and animal disease research others might see it as potential barrier to effective and efficient use of nbaf the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 on june 18 2008 the food conservation and energy act of 2008 also referred to as the 2008 farm bill was enacted with provision section 7524 that requires usda to issue permit to dhs for live fmd virus research at one successor facility to the piadc the provision states that once issued the permit can only be suspended revoked or otherwise impaired if the secretary of agriculture determines that the fmd research is not being carried out in compliance with the select agent regulations this provision preserves the restrictions on fmd research that have existed in 21 usc 113a including usdas authority to control possession but provides one exception to allow dhs to possess and work with the virus hr 1717 before the 2008 farm bill was enacted the house committee on homeland security debated bill addressing fmd possession as reported hr 1717 would have instructed usda to issue permit to dhs for fmd research at nbaf other existing requirements under the agricultural select agent regulations would have continued to apply and dhs would have had to meet them for the permit to remain valid this is the basic provision that was adopted by the farm bill hr 1717 as introduced would have given dhs independent authority to possess fmd virus notwithstanding 21 usc 113a82 need for and scope of nbaf other agencies and organizations in addition to dhs have identified needs that could be met by nbaf at least as early as 1999 usda recognized need for 81 the administrator of the agricultural research service department of agriculture has testified it is our expectation that the secretary of agriculture will authorize fmd work to be done on the mainland in nbaf and that would be for all agencies the usda programs now at plum island will be component of the nbaf facility so yes the secretary of agriculture intends to do that see testimony by edward knipling administrator agricultural research service department of agriculture before the house committee on homeland security

constructing level 4 unit84 in 2005 the national research council nrc echoed the need for bsl4 facility capable of handling large animals the nrc also concluded that piadc was at the end of its life cycle and that it should be replaced urgently85 while usda and dhs have repeatedly stated their need for new bsl4 facility neither department has publicly detailed how they determined their space requirements for this facility in response to questions for the hearing record dhs asserted that site criteria and requirements for nbaf were developed by an interagency technical working group including dhs usda and hhs to evaluate sites that would best support research in highconsequence animal and zoonotic diseases in support of homeland security presidential directives hspd9 and hspd1086 the dhs has not publicly released supporting documentation relating to the working groups deliberations the dhs projects the size of nbaf to be approximately 504000 gross square feet87 approximately

training and support areas the ability of dhs to effectively use the newly constructed bsl4 and bsl3ag laboratories may depend on efficient interagency cooperation in order to identify other agency research activities that could benefit from being performed at nbaf the dhs and usda investment into research areas done currently at piadc may also need to increase to fill the expanded capacity analytic study assessing the current and future needs for bsl3ag and bsl4 research may aid dhs and usda in effectively using nbaf coordination of research activities with other agencies since nbaf would replace piadc research at nbaf is expected to be collaborative between usda and dhs at piadc dhs and usda cooperatively set research priorities based on risk assessment and other information generally usda performs basic research activities while dhs develops the results of that research and attempts to translate them into practical applications90 however since nbaf also represents an expansion in capacity and capabilities over piadc this relationship may change establishment of the new facility provides an opportunity to evaluate previous agreements and make adjustments assignment of lab space to 89 for example usda has invested in expanded bsl3ag laboratories at both the national wildlife research center in fort collins colorado and the national centers for epidemiology and

coordinating current work but longterm plans are being assessed gao 06132 december 2005 crs22 the department of health and human services or other agencies may require reevaluation and updates to these procedures91 the usda and dhs have testified that their current agreements have served them well at piadc with respect to both daily operation and transfer of technical information regarding research results and priorities92 such interagency coordination may be essential in case of crisis or in dealing with an outbreak of animal disease the extent to which all agencies engaged in nbaf agree on how to coordinate roles and responsibilities may prove to be key factor in maintaining clear lines of authority and information and may be crucial to effective oversight of the facility the 110th congress is considering these issues under hr 1717 reported by the house homeland security committee on august 1 2008 nbaf would be run by director appointed by dhs in consultation with usda the directors role would be limited to operating and maintaining the facility including ensuring security and emergency response plans this role is less broad than in previous version of the bill which would have also given the dhsappointed director authority over all research programming at the facility including usda research in the committeeamended bill in addition to the director separate directors of research would be appointed from dhs and usda to oversee the research programs of each department the usda and dhs would develop joint strategy defining the roles of usda and dhs at nbaf93 timeliness of construction activities when complete nbaf would eventually house all research activities underway at piadc the dhs considers piadc to be approaching the end of its design lifetime finishing construction of nbaf and achieving operational status before downsizing or decommissioning piadc is dependent on timely construction activity because of the unique research currently performed at piadc the smooth transition of this capacity may be an issue of congressional concern beyond the 91 because of nbafs focus on foreign animal disease agencies beyond usda and dhs

nbaf construction schedule increases the time that piadc will be in operation the piadc has historically had security coordination and other issues97 the dhs has developed and implemented multiyear corrective action plan to address these issues and maintain the operation of piadc98 since piadc has been identified as approaching the end of its design lifetime extended operation and maintenance of these facilities may not be as cost effective or as efficient for the research endeavor as completing and transitioning research to nbaf the dhs spent approximately 24 million in fy2007 and 17 million in fy2008 to upgrade the facilities at piadc the dhs did not request additional appropriation for upgrades in fy200999 and does not plan to in future years100 the upgrades include designing new animal

activities will transfer to it102 the fate of the piadc once current research activities are transferred from it remains unclear the dhs has stated that proper decontamination and decommissioning dd of the facility after the transition will be critical to meet regulatory compliance and eventual disposal of the site103 the dhs has not stated when or how this process might occur in discussing the development and construction of nbaf dhs has stated with regards to piadc that decision has been made as to the future of plum island104 the dhs is currently investing money to improve and upgrade the laboratory facilities continued use of piadc either by dhs in some other capacity or under the control of some other entity remains an option alternatively following decommissioning the laboratories might be removed and the site used for different purpose although many local officials have opposed expanding the number or type of pathogens researched at piadc some have expressed support for the continued operation and existence of the facility because of its economic value to the surrounding area105 selling plum island one option proposed by dhs has been to sell plum island and use the profit from such sale to offset the construction costs of nbaf the decontamination and remediation costs for the island and the demolition costs for the piadc under this proposal dhs would sell plum island in fy2009 or fy2010 arrange with the purchaser to allow operations to continue until nbaf construction was finished and transfer plum island to the purchaser only after clean up of the island had been completed106 most sales of surplus property are handled by the general services administration gsa and any funds received directed to the treasury107 the dhs has proposed adding statutory

remediation costs for environmental cleanup of the island and fluctuations in property values for example contribute sizeable uncertainties to any estimate of future sales proceeds the sale might provide net funds insufficient for nbaf construction or might provide substantial surplus funds even after nbaf construction is complete also mismatch may arise between when the construction costs are incurred and when dhs would receive money from the sale additionally the remediation and decontamination costs may need to occur prior to the sale if buyer is willing to purchase plum island in its
