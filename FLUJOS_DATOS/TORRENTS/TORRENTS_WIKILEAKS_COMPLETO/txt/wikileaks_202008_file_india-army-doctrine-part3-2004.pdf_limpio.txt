part iii chapter 6 logistics section 17 function principles and logistic support systems section 18 future trends in logistics 2 section 17 functions principles and logistic support systems mobility is the true test of supply system bh liddell hart thoughts on war 1944 61 the territorial vastness and the geogr aphical diversity of our country preclude application of standard logistic template the road and rail communications infrastructure in border ar eas is underdeveloped and availability of local resources is lar gely inadequate thus inter an d intra theatre moves are timeconsuming and switching of logistic re sources is difficult to execute from the operational point of view such conditions call for adequate stocks to be maintained at the theatre and sector levels to undertake operations at short notice 62 our logistic support system ensures t hat each theatre of operation is self contained and selfsustaining for the init ial phases in the long term there is need to integrate the logistic resources of the th ree services and utilise the existing national infrastructure more pr ofitably to economise on overall effort relationship between strategy logistics and operational plans 63 logistics is command function and is the lifeline of an operational plan operational plan can succeed witho ut sound logistic plan and commanders must view operations and logistics as being interdependent the three major responsibilities of military high co mmand are to create support and employ combat forces therefore all major milit ary decisions need blend of strategy and logistics which are inseparable 64 logistics govern the fundamental rela tionship between strategy military capability scope and timing of operations the composition balance and deployment of forces along with the rate of build up are all determined by the complex interrelationship between st rategic logistic and technical considerations in the course of an oper ation adequate logistic support must be ensured to sustain and regenerate com bat power so that the assigned operational and strategic objectives are effectively accomplished in time 65 the relationship between strategy logistics and operational plans may be expressed as follows strategy determines the requir ed level of military capability logistics sustain the military capability operational plans exploit military and logistic capability 3 66 the relationship between the levels of war and logistic support is given below strategic level involves national strategic security objectives and use of national resources to accomplish these objectives and encompasses the industrial base mobilisa tion strategic lift air and sea capabilities procurement material r eadiness strategic stockpiles and re generation operational level links the employment of forces to strategic objectives and includes reception st aging sustainment redeployment theatre distribution intermediate intr atheatre airlift and reconstitution tactical level deals with the employment and manoeuvre of units in relation to the enemy in order to use their full potential and involves arming manning feeding trans porting and sustaining soldiers principles of logistics 67 logistic planning must be simple and responsive to the needs of the operational situation it should be based on the principles outlined below foresight it is the ability to foresee operational requirements and involves identifying stocking and ma intaining the minimum resources and capabilities necessary to meet logistic requirements simplicity simplicity implies avoiding complexity in both planning and executing logi stic operations flexibility this is the ability to adapt logistic structures and procedures to changing situat ions and operational plans economy providing the most effi cient support to accomplish the mission exemplifies economy co mmanders must aim to achieve economy by prioritising and allocating resources coordination this implies exploiting synchronizing and coordinating logistic resources and infrastructure at the national and interservice levels protection logistic installations are vulnerable to long range and precisionguided weapons surv ivability can be enhanced by decentralized logistics limiting logi stic assets in forward area and dispersing them widely logistic support system 68 the basic tenet of logi stic philosophy is that the logistic support system must be responsive to the operational needs of the commander as philosophy defence logistic development should be integrated with the national infrastructure and national development plans it should determine the broad framework for the 4 countrys development of logistic infrastr ucture to meet national objectives the basic aim should be to ensure optimum utilis ation of national resources industrial mobilisation and achieve costeffectiveness 69 joint approach in interservice logistics is essential to ensure economy centralised agency is require d for higher direction cont rol and coordination of the logistic effort amongst the three rvices and to provide an interface between service headquarters and other gover nment and nongovernment agencies concurrently there is need to optimally utilise the consi derable infrastructure of the private sector trade and local resour ces to enhance the military logistic capability 610 an efficient logistic structure co ntributes greatly towards meeting the requirements of the field force this is par ticularly relevant in the context of the indian army which is deployed over va st geographical spread in varied terrain and climatic conditions catering to it s requirements in such an environment demands the following from the l ogistic infrastructure streamlined chain with lean organisa tions to eliminate multiplicity and repeated handling and thereby increase the velocity of logistic support sense and respond system working on the push model to increase user satisfaction an efficient inventory management system to reduce excessive stocks in this regard procurement of commercially offtheshelf equipment is viable alternative quick and effective casualty evac uation and management in addition existing civil medical facilities should be optimally utilised rapid recovery and redeployment of scarce logistic resources during various phases of operations specially tailored units for theatrespec ific logistic requirements for want of nail the shoe was lost for want of the shoe the horse was lost for want of the horse the rider was

backup provided for it general kv krishna rao prepare or perish 1991 611 revolution in military logistics is concept being evolved to create capabilitybased modular and flexible or ganisation capable of anticipating and predicting logistic requirem ents with the creation of ma tching infrastructure and facilities it proposes dynamic distribut ionbased logistic system that could be projected rapidly and operated efficiently to provide widelydistributed combat forces with uninterrupt ed fuel and supplies 612 with advancements in c4i2sr capabilities along with automation providing total asset visibility of the logi stic support system it will be possible to introduce major transformation in cateri ng to user requirements as under logistic support for the complete spectrum of conflict from ci operations to an allout conventional war against nuclear backdrop centralised logistic planning and execution at t he highest level incorporating all available nationa l resources and infrastructure and working towards synergy in the logi stic support system of the three services adopting logistic s upport system that is geared to limited preparatory period and high intensity s hort duration war this calls for an efficient mobilisation plan which enabl rapid move and deployment of formations to designated areas maintenance of high state of l ogistic readiness by reduction in critical logistic voids high state of equipment rviceability and adequate levels of stocks for selfcontained t heatrebased logistic support in the initial stages without dependence on intertheatre mo vement of resources maximum use of dualuse civil re sources and infrastructure to enhance military logistic capabilities adoption of information technologies and decision support systems to improve inventory management and to maximize efficiency improved survivability of logistic echelons in high technology weapon environment by dispersion and area air defence cover where possible adapting to short duration conflict situation by great er emphasis on intratheatre regeneration and res upply of logistic resources and adoption of maintenance concept of replacement instead of repairs 6 maximum reliance on aerial resuppl for maintenance of momentum especially in mountain and desert terrains establishing modular and tailo rmade logistic arrangements for different types of terrain and operational contingencies retaining flexibility an d redundancy in all theatres without resorting to crisis management redeployment of logistic resour ces in balanced manner to permit synergized and wellorchestrated operati ons without any logistic pauses 613 the diversity of terrain and the indian armys operational roles pose enormous logistic challenges these require dynamic new approach to logistic support the vision for the future is to develop logistic syst em which is highly effective responsive and provides t he operational commander the freedom and ability to execute his mission successfully t he footprint of logi stics for the army 7 should ensure seamless and fully network ed system that provides information and situation awareness to enable asset visibility and enhanced velocity of logistic support concurrently there is need to reduce inventories significantly and rely on predictive and realtime information coupled with rapid transportation to meet user demands 614 harnessing advanced information technol ogy use of sensors and reliance on decision support systems will improve logistic efficiency and enhance operational readiness and t hus reduce the number of personnel involved in the supply chain management these advancem ents will significantly impact our operational and logistic philosophy for which future commanders must prepare and ensure smooth change in logistic management preparing for war administration involves not only the management and welfare of men but also their families general nc vij 8 chapter 7 preparing for war section 19 force structuring section 20 training section 21 professionalism and military ethos 9 section 19 force structuring it is fact that infantry attacks always halt and fail at those points where preparat ion has been insufficient once more we see that the power of organisation is greater than the bravery of the troops ferdinand foch artois and champagne battles 1917 71 apart from good training and high morale the single most important factor which contributes to efficient conduct and success in war is wellstructured forces force structures need to be reviewed continually to keep pace with the dynamics of developing strategic scenarios advances in technology and shifts in operational concepts also impact signi ficantly on force structures basic considerations 72 very wide variety of factors determi ne the structures of armies in the indian context the following aspects have major influence on the force structures prevailing threats and future challenges operating environments which encom pass factors such as terrain and climate operational roles tasks and missions allotted to different types of formations quantity and quality of various weapon systems and equipment available to the army availability of funds to undertake changes and modernisation 73 the army will essentially be structured for its primary role nonetheless it should be able to perform its secondary ro equally well with change in organisation except that temporary modifi cations in terms of equipping pattern may have to be resorted to for the purpos as is being done presently in jammu kashmir and in the north eastern states in addition to this forces specially tailored to conduct ci operations such as rashtriya rifles and the territorial army units employed for such like tasks have to be suitably equipped structure and composition 74 the structure of the ar my should ensure that it is capable of the following contributing to the overall strategi c deterrence for preventing war 10 engaging in all types of operations extending from one to the other end of the spectrum of conflict by day and by night and in all weather conditions conducting offensive and def ensive operations with the facility of inter changing the roles of various formations when required operating in all terrain and climatic conditions taking to battle at short notice for conducting sustained operations in highintensity scenarios against the backdrop of nuclear weapons and the prevailing terrorism and insurgencies operating jointly with the indi an navy and indian air force through appropriate structures and mechanisms ensuring rear area security built in to all operational plans conducting ci operations employing specially designed forces in addition to other units if required towards this end it should be able to take under command andor operate in conjunction with state and central police forces ensuring sound and effective logi stic system at all times with adequate depth in all material stocks earmarking specially designated forces with requisite strategic mobility to assist friendly countries when such assistance is formally sought by them 75 future wars are likely to be short hi ghly intense and will involve the use of accurate and very lethal weapon system s battle will be fought in all the dimensions concurrently to achieve spec ified objectives as quickly as possible such battlefield milieu will encompass rge battlespaces involve variety of weapon and support systems and demand quick decision making from military leaders systems and personnel will have to display stamina robustness and staying power in trying conditions 76 to be able to prosecute operations successfully the indian army is gradually progressing towards widening the range of its ar senal thus in addition to the traditional elements of armour in fantry artillery air defence engineers and tactical communications it is adding newer force multipliers such as wider surveillance iw capabilities decisi on support systems target acquisition precision strike and enlarged integral aviation 77 the size shape and com position of the field forc will be tailored to encompass the following types of forces and systems specially earmarked offensive strike formations ranging from brigade to corps size to secure objectives in varying depths in mountain plains and desert terrains 11 pivot formations

78 training objectives must cater for management of change as well as operational adaptation to change they must be focused towards achieving the following training in conventional operations against nuclear backdrop at one end of the spectrum to fighti ng insurgency at the other end planning training and va lidation of the conduct of war at operational and strategic levels with the focus on offensive operations in joint services environment implementation of systems approach to training to make training more focused taskoriented objecti ve costeffective and responsive to future requirements raising the technical threshold of ll ranks to meet future challenges organisation for training 79 the conduct of training is co mmand responsibility organisation for training in the indian army envisages the control of ll aspects of institutional training under army training command with general staff backup being provided by the directorate general of military training at army headquarters issues pertaining to technical aspects of training are monitored by line directorates of various arms and services at army headquarters approach to training 710 training in the army shoul d be based on methodical and well researched scientific approach dynam ic comprehensive and operationally focused training philosophy is therefor mandatory requirement for producing combat ready troops and units 13 711 training culture the focus should be on creating positive and supportive environment within which unit and subunit commanders can train their commands in meaningful and rea listic manner with minimum distraction and diversion of effort personnel or resources superior commanders should clearly define the training objectives and then allow maximum freedom of action to subordinate commanders training mu st remain operati onallyoriented need based contemporary and structured towards practical applications 712 training of contingency forces it is imperative that the forces earmarked for specified contingencies be suitably trained for the assigned operational role these forces should ex ercise with and in the areas of their affiliated operational commands training schedules scope and location of training should be given out by the receiving command headquarters 713 training infrastructure we should pr ogressively standardise the minimum level of training infrastructure required at unit and formation levels in addition the creation of traini ng infrastructure in sele cted stations and training establishments must be accorded the highest priority efforts sh ould continue to ensure increased use of simulators computerbased training packages and promotion of self educati on and interactive elearning focus of training 714 operational level joint operations the planning and conduc t of joint operations at the theatre level should be further fi netuned all issues related to joint training will conform to polic ies enunciated by the cosc interoperability interoperability between pivot and strike formations at the operational level and frequent grouping and regrouping would be the norm in future operations complete synergy between the pivot and strike corps will be an oper ational imperative at the theatre level 14 strike corps must develop and refine their capability to operate in varied operational scenarios nonlinear operations increased ranges of weapon systems and improved mobility of all forc coupled with high technology communications and battlefield surveillance systems will result in wider geographical spread over which the available combat power can be employed training for fighting an integrated and simultaneous battle across the entire battlespace in the form of close deep and rear operations should therefore re ceive greater attention manoeuvre warfare as opposed to attrition warfare which focuses on physical destruction manoeuvre warfar is an approach to battle which lays emphasis on disrupting the enemy commanders ability to make correct and timely decisions rather than attempting to inflict physical causalities the need to lay greater stress on this approach during training requires further emphasis directive style of command intrinsically linked to manoeuvre warfare is the centrality of the role of the leader and the philosophy of directive style of command the di rective style of command must be practised to enable commanders and l eaders at appropriate levels to seize the initiative and generate action with maximum freedom in consonance with the higher commanders intent training in logistics recent experiences during operation vijay 1999 and operation parakram 200102 have highlighted the importance of sound l ogistic planning and its exec ution at all levels with the induction of high technology sophi sticated equipment into our army the management of equi pment and engineering should receive added attention 15 professional progression and intellectual development officers should be encouraged to develop critical thinking skills and continuously upgrade themselves and widen their hor izon concurrently there is need to train and encourage officers who think outside the box because tomorrows war could be unconventional not nbcw and it is the thinking officer who will carry the day additi onally officers need to be formally trained in analysing information and optimising new technological developments that have military applications 715 tactical level basics this approach implies high degree of physical fitness skill at arms with enhanced emphasis on refl ex shooting fieldcraft effective handling of equipment small team oper ations and the regimental ethos all training at small team level must be situationbased towards this end possible battle situations must be visualised analysed rehearsed and mastered on ground by practical training training of young officers our young officers are highly motivated exceptionally courageous and have always led from the front there is need to further build upon these sterling attributes through renewed focus on tactical and adventure training greater stress should be laid on developing the killer instinct audacity or iginality innovative thinking and the spirit of adventure as leaders t hey should also be adept at imparting grassroots level tactical training training of junior leaders nd personnel below officer rank the role of junior leaders is to tr anslate intentions of commanders into success renewed focus is being given on transforming regimental training centres into cradles of ex cellence human re source development is an essential command function and in this context it needs to be understood that the soldier of tomorro w has to be an innovator who can combine imagination and knowledge with action amount of emphasis on junior commissioned officers and non commissioned officers training will be enough training for subconventional operations and counter terrorism whilst training and prepari ng for warfighting all combat units should be equally trained and prepared to engage in ootw there is genius who tells suddenly and in secret what i must say or do in any circumstance unexpected by others it is reflection meditation napoleon principles of war 1813 16 section 21 professionalism and military ethos you are always on parade general george s patton jr in letter to his cadet george s patton iii 1944 the profession of arms 716 nature and legitimacy the laws of armed conflict encompassing the geneva and hague conventions set out the duties and res ponsibilities of commanders and soldiers and the legal pa rameters within which the military profession must operate governed by these longstanding moral and legal imperatives the profession of arms is calling establish ed on the following principles service on behalf of legitimate moral authority and being answerable to such authority the conduct of military operations within prescribed norms such as the laws of armed conflict and the concept of military chivalry the requirement for members of the profession to uphold high standard of discipline to protect the weak and defenceless and to always act for the common good 717 function the aspect of use and control of lethal force is what gives the military profession its unique standing and importance within the broader society that it serves it must be emphasised that only good citizen can become good professional soldier having become mber of the armed forces one must be an exemplary citizen 718 attributes responsibility expertise and loyalty to the nation and the organisation are the hallmarks of the milit ary profession these are defined within the military context as follows responsibility responsibility is reflected in the oath of allegiance that the indian officer and soldier take on joining the army as well as the dedicated apolitical and unbiased manner in which they must serve the nation responsibility fu rther requires commanders to render objective professional advice to polit ical leaders to implement loyally and effectively decisions and policies of the governm ent to be responsive to the needs and interests of the personnel under command and to be accountable for actions they take however the emphas is must be retained on the need to ensure that the armed forces under circumstances are influenced by any sectarian or parochial considerations 17 knowledge and expertise knowledge and expertise are the cornerstones of professi onalism application of knowledge and expertise to situations on ground with view to resolve problems constitutes professionalism this is reflected in the military professionals extensive and authoritative knowledge in all fields related to armed conflict including what constitutes appropriate military actions during peace and war it encompasses leadership and management skills required for planning preparing and executing comp lex military operations as well as sound understanding of the capabi lities of personnel w eapons and equipment there is requirement to put in concerted effort to enhance our knowledge and acquire expertise through formal education selfstudy training and application of the knowledge imbibed loyalty to the nation and organisation loyalty resides in the common military identity of members of the indian armed forces and their shared commitment as volunteer citiz ens in serving the nation it is derived from high standards of training selfregulating disci pline and strict adherence to the orders and directives of the service loyalty to the organisation includes loyalty to seniors colleagues and subordinates the military code 719 the military code by which we live is much the same as that which guides all honourable men the majo r difference lies in the consequences of observing or violating it for the officer the consequences go beyond his person as it affects the lives of all t he personnel that he commands 720 unlimited responsibility under this unwritten clause of the military contract members are obliged to carry out duties and tasks without regard to personal safety and ultimately be willing to risk and even give up their lives if the situation requires while unlimited responsibility is generally associated with service in war it is also present in military serv ice during peace 721 the military ethos in the army the concept of unlimited responsibility is inextricably linked to and at the same time sustained by shared set of beliefs values and moral code commonly known as the military et hos military ethos forms the basis of all aspects of service in the indian armed forces setting forth principles and ideals which men and wom of the army must subscribe to both collectively and as individual s its fundamental values are integrity courage loyalty selflessness and self discipline this ethos fu rther requires dedication to country the upholding of indian val ues and commitment to professional excellence maintaining the military ethos is critical to the armys effectiveness in war and its readiness and preparedness in peace 722 war and the professional soldier professional soldier is well aware of the horrors of war and of the need to be prepared for t he worst it is the preparation for war as an inherent part of his training and the requirement to 18 manage it within established constr aints and moral boundaries which necessitates the military ethos and ju stifies the profession of arms 723 regimental system the regimental system is of critical importance to the army as it is within the regiment or corps that the m ilitary ethos is most visibly embodied and practised its utilit and value lie in the strong sense of comradeship that it fosters amongst member s of regiment or corps and which bonds soldiers together the regimental system reflects indian values history geography and the particular character of the indian soldier regimental considerations must however never be allowed to impinge on professional or operational requirements nor should the regimental system be embraced in way which might fragment or weaken the armys need for institutional cohesion 724 the moral contract in democracy the profession of arms implies the existence of moral contract between the soldier and the broader society the soldier serves and is part of this contract is one of mutual trust confidence support and reciprocity it requires that members of the indian armed forces be provided the tools and resour ces to do the job expected of them in return they are entitled to receive appr obation and positive recogni tion from their fellow indians the families of the soldiers who die in battle must be looked after by the society as part of this moral contract 725 high morals and ethics in the rmy are necessary for efficiency effectiveness and maintenance of esprit decorps unless these aspects are nurtured throughout the career of the offi cer there may arise serious deficiency in the application of our honour code towards this end formal instruction in this subject is considered essential true victory can be won only with strategy of tactical positioning so that the moment of triumph is effortless and destructi ve conflict is averted sun tzu art of strategy 19 the safety honour and welfare of your country come first always and
