meeting september 9 presidential challenger dr abdullah abdullah told ambassador eikenberry that he had not anticipated the elections process taking so long while he wanted to let the process play out completely he might rethink his next move in view of whether second round would occur sufficiently soon truly to benefit the country end summary still under pressure but calm 2 s we met abdullah late at night alone with one notetaker after his long day which included ceremony commemorating the eighth anniversary of the death of his mentor massoud tired but relaxed abdullah exhibited some of his usual humor he noted that hed said hello to iec chairman ludin but not kissed him at the ceremony ludin said dont turn your face from and abdullah had replied i wont if you dont turn your face from mecca dari expression for lying the ceremony had been wellattended by former mujahedin who are currently on either side of the presidential race abdullah said that only massouds spirit could have unified such group he claimed he was the only one who got standing ovations from the crowd 3 s abdullah complained that the ministry of interior was circulating letter accusing him and his supporters such as balkh governor atta of distributing weapons reftel he called this an irresponsible allegation and counteraccused the government of distributing weapons to selfdefense groups in konduz and balkh as part of widespread program saying that he doesnt want anything to ignite anywhere he added that in this highly emotional time the difference between rumors and facts must be clarified eikenberry said that we have looked into these allegations and found areas of concern abdullah added that he has recently completed his round of consultations with all his provincial supporters and has discouraged demonstrations since they could become excuses for violence i didnt think it would take so long 4 s ambassador eikenberry stressed to abdullah that his conduct during the campaign and now has made him national figure with real future in afghan politics he reiterated the us position that we are committed to credible process and noted that the most senior us leadership was interested in learning about dr abdullahs thoughts on way forward eikenberry noted that we were now faced with an issue that complicates the process the possibility that the partial recount that the ecc has ordered could extend into the winter season if so second round if it were ordered could not be held until spring 2010 he noted that failure of the elections process would have huge impact in the united states given the many years of effort and commitment we have given to afghanistan successful campaign process and good day of voting all led by the afghans for the first time are being overshadowed by the current stalemate 5 s abdullah appeared subdued as he responded that he didnt want such long period of uncertainty he thought that disqualifying obvious fraud would have brought karzais number below 50 percent long before now i can take it for longer but what about the country he asked noting that karzai would keep making decisions anyway during the period of uncertainty and that his own followers were in danger of harassment or worse and some teachers who supported him had lost their jobs the ecc has guts he said but how long will it take process dragging on until april could jeopardize public opinion in the united states which like all public opinion is fickle us support once lost will not come back he said abdullah also admitted the strong possibility of karzai winning second round abdullah on karzai holding the nation hostage 6 s abdullah indulged in variety of criticisms of karzai saying that he was working for his own interests against those of the whole country abdullah said karzai reportedly asked his defense minister your ana can manage without the americans cant it but the answer was we get 400000 liters of petrol day from them without them wed end our operations in two days kabul 00002768 002 of 002 7 s when karzais people had approached him three months ago abdullah said he refused to join them because i couldnt influence him when he had good people around him and now he has bad people advising him he gave karzai two messages at that time dont run for president you will have great legacy and wipe away all your mistakes if you give up power or if you do run dont try to rig the elections now abdullah said karzai will keep digging in whatever the damage to afghanistan and were all stuck with him abdullah ended with the acerbic note that the one thing that bothers is that we shouldnt allow one person to hold the destiny of the nation hostage what next the good of the country 8 s abdullah admitted that he had been approached recently by karzais national security advisor about deal to end the election standoff but clarified that it was not dialogue since he wanted to take his time and let the process run its course he was also approached by the brother of karzais vice presidential running mate and fellow panjshiri marshall fahim who warned him that he would not have support in second round and should make deal now abdullah said that karzai has talked to some of his supporters such as former president rabbani but that he sees way that he himself would take part in karzai government leaving open the possibility that one of his associates may do so the ambassador noted that despite rumors that the united states was pushing national unity government we have never done so abdullah said he believed us and appreciated our support for the process 9 s looking at his future abdullah said that while he wanted to create national and crossethnic movement which could become true political party he could not see any point in focusing on parliamentary elections in 2010 given the iecs corruption and doubledealing in this election some good mps told him they wont survive the next election due to iec corruption he said the iec has had to put aside ballots in this election because the results cant possibly be entered into their computers due to the fraud controls but then they play with words and refuse to invalidate those ballots their actions are tragic joke he said adding that the problem for karzais camp and the iec turned out to be that they had planned on higher turnout which would have covered up fraud abdullah expressed anger at some of the most egregious examples of fraud noting that rural paktika province apparently had the same number of voters as balkh whose capital is populous mazaresharif 10 s being in the opposition would be hard and vulnerable position abdullah said but capitalizing on this new political movement was crucial because it is the only healthy movement with chance to expand abdullah noted that he had supported large number of provincial council candidates during the election after vetting them carefully first he believes that many did very well in their provinces and can become base for future political leadership he is maintaining network of linkages for such future movement karzai had had golden opportunity abdullah said but ruined it and is only declining the country is vulnerable to ethnic fascism extremism drug trafficking and organized crime all of which interests will oppose the national movement he hopes to create and all of which are allied with karzai he alleged 11 s abdullah exhorted the us not to give up on the process yet saying that expediency for immediate concerns could undermine the rule of law and that longer term interests should not be sacrificed to shorter term ones eikenberry acknowledged that there were competing imperatives of the credibility of the process and pressures of time telling abdullah he should make political choices to help the situation knowing that he is at period of maximum influence abdullah gave immediate indication of his next move but agreed to remain in close contact eikenberry
