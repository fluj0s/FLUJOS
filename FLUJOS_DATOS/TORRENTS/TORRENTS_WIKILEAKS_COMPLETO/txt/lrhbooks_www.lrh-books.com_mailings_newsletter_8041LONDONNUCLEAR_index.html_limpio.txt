bridge enewsletter lrhs congress lectures date the real danger is mans uncivilizednbspstate the dangerthe danger here is not radiation the danger is mans uncivilized state unless something can come along and cure him of his barbarism he is not going to survive he has many enemies if you want to pick enemies the locust of africa the various fevers of indiathese are enemies the hailstorms of kansasall sorts of enemies why focus only on radiation if man is to survive he must first be capable of facing his enemies and those enemies really arent manhe just thinks they are and until he can be brought to face his real true enemies on earth he cannot be really considered to be civilized being why because hes fighting the wrong targets how man making such slow progress on every frontier can waste time to turn around and fight his brother is little bit puzzling this excerpt was taken from the london congress on nuclear radiation control health lectures bringing about higher level of civilization an article by l ron hubbard excerpted from the london congress on nuclear radiation control health lectures mans inhumanity to man has always been present and he has always been able to reach over and put his hand on deadly and diabolical weapon whether that weapon was club with knot on the end of it or tower musket or new highpowered supervelocity bazooka or missile that guided an atomic bomb in at some tremendous velocity remember this it was handled by man who was being inhuman to men therefore solving of the atomic bomb would not prevent atomic warfare we have to enter this at our own reality our own level in an area that we understand and that is to say man can be and can be made to be by our technologies more civilized than he is happier than he is more capable of advancing than he has been that is our target were going all too slowly in that direction thats because to some degree we consider ourselves bucking the powers that be we shouldnt be ever considering that youll find that government will always accept helping hand but it is so scarce that it takes them long time to be convinced its being held out remember that they will always accept helping hand but so few people help the government that they dont really know what the hand is out for men use governments to feather their own nests and better their own ends but there are sincere men in government and there are men in government trying to do what is right now if we wish to go in any direction in the field of politics god forbid lets be sure that we go in the direction of giving the government and the powers that be hand in bringing about higher level of civilization and better understanding of things otherwise we will not have struck at these intermediate tiny problems such as the abomb smallpox bubonic plague and all the rest of the oddities that confront men as his enemies now what do we have then in scientology we have something which assists man not something that fights his enemies man will fight his real enemies he isnt fighting them now that means that we are going out and fight his enemies for him what are we bunch of mercenaries are we going to fight the abomb as the only people fighting the abomb are we the only people who are going to fight smallpox doing this all for man and sort of letting him sit there in the stew pot and do nothing our job is to buck him up to point of where he can confront these things and if we can do that on very broad level as we are doing it in smaller sphere then we will have brought better civilization to earth and that i think is what were trying to do i hope you agree with l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture the control of hysteria this lecture is available in the london congress on nuclear radiation
