assistance flags gravesites and headstones when they die the veteran population there were about 244 million veterans as of july 1 1999 of whom 193 million had served during at least one period defined as wartime the number of veterans is declining and their average age increas ing the median age of veterans was 577 years 36 were over 65 years of age bout 46 were female the va projects decline of about 26 in the number of veterans between 1990 and 2010 down from one of four men in 1994 to one of eight in 2010 half of whom will be over age 62 decline in the size of military forces nd the corresponding effect that decline has had on the number of persons entering veterans status means relatively stable numbers of compensated vete rans and fewer veterans seeking readjustment for postservice education and training the number of disabled wartime veterans receiving pensions is declining because of the deaths of existing beneficiaries and because veterans who might once have pended on va pensions as social safety net now have other sources of social insura nce primarily social security that bring their incomes above the va pension eligib ility levels however the increasing average age of veterans means additional demands for medical services from eligible veterans as aging brings on chronic c onditions needing more frequent care and lengthier convalescence

the federal government was significant contribution to the national goal of increasing the number of families who owned their own homes because of the guarantees lenders are protected against losses

continuing in the 106 th congress veterans medical services more efficient greater access introduction historical tr ends and modern challenges the va medical care system is experiencing steadily increasing number of veterans seeking care in va facilities va estimates that its medical services will be given to 39 million different patients in fy2001 up from 27 million in fy1997 initially medical care services were provided for these additional patients without substantially increasing appropriations to va for its medical care programs va improved its efficiency in the delivery of medical services by increasing the number of outpatient access points distributin g resources from underutilized facilities to underserved areas and identifying nonappr opriated funds that could be used to expand medical capabilities however congress appropria ted 19 billion for fy2000 17 bi llion above the administrati ons initial request and the administration requeste d and congress has appr oved 203 billion for fy2001 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs7 potential conflicts between medical judgements and administrative practices va medical care professionals and va administrative staff are attempting to increase the number of veterans served by va medical staff by becoming more efficient without sacrific ing the quality of care however these potentially competing objectives may be difficult to reconcile especially because the responsibility for meeting the objectives ar handled differently by medical personnel and administrators how efficiently and effectively can va administrators manage health care resources when resource decisions are often made by medical staff with differing objectives clearly if all 25 million veterans sought care in va facilities the system would be unable to meet all of the demands th ereby placed upon it on the other hand the provision of care to specific patients depends on the access such patients have to the services of individual providers va medi cal care personnel can operate with enough flexibility in the number of patients they s ee and the amount of time they spend with each patient so that the total amount of access that can be provided over period of time is largely indeterminable for any given level of resources reforming va medical care to meet the challenges the va hospital based medical care system is traceable to the end of world war ii and rapid construction of va hospitals to meet the ex pected medical needs of returning troops over the years however advances in medical care made it possible to have needed services available through clinics and ot her outpatient venues va was slower to adapt to these changes but in spite of ru that seemed to encourage hospitalization of veterans in order to ssure their treatment va began to find effective care could be more efficiently provided on an outpatient basis especi ally with the development of selfadministered drugs to treat many conditions to accommodate these changes in medical practice combination of administrative and legislative decisions made major changes to the va health care system eligibility reform the 104th congress reformed the rules governing access to va health care until pl 104262 many veterans had clear rights to acute care but not to basic services leaving many vete rans uncertain as to the medical benefits available to them and arguably resulting in inefficient use of resources substantial evidence existed that demands for va health care differed from one region to another and the distribution of medical resources around the country did not match that demand managing access theoretically access to va health care is governed through system in which veterans are enrolled in health plans according to schedule of priorities these priorities are based on eligibility criteria intended to preserve sufficient resources so that high priority veterans primarily those with serviceconnected conditions or who have disability compensation ratings for such conditions can be assured of receiving all care that might be medically indicated there is potential conflict between the objective of administrative staff to manage resources to stay within budgetary constraints while preserving resources to meet the medical needs of veterans with the highest priority for medical services and the objective of medical staff to see all pa tients with complaints about their healthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs8 the medical profession views the treatment of patients medical requirements to be the primary purpose of their decisionma king process and that professional commitment could transcend the administrative commitment to preserve scarce resources according to system of pr iorities unrelated to medical need generally appropriations have been sufficient so that priority categories 1 through 6 are assured of medical services in recent years because of greater efficiency in the managing of va medical resources priority 7 veterans have also been able to enroll in va medical plans if they choose to and thereby be assured of access to va medical services during the period of their enrollment while the enrollment period theoretically begins each october 1 coinciding with the beginning of fiscal year and the expected certainty of spending authority available for that fiscal year va does not re quire renewing enrollment nor does it have method for disenrolling veteran once the veteran applied for enrollment va plans on continuing to enroll all eligible veterans who apply during fy2001 veterans are not denied care currently va medical personnel can be expected to provide medical services to all veterans who appear at va medical facilities seeking care veterans seeking appoi ntments may sometimes be discouraged by va administrative staff from having their medical needs served through va and encouraged to seek health care services elsewhere in the community in practice however all veterans presenting health complaints to va medical facilities are sc reened to determine their dical condition the disposition of most cases occurs simultaneously with that screening for instance veteran complaining of sore throat asks to see doctor va medical staff examine the patient diagnos an infection prescribe an appropriate antibiotic which is then filled at an onsite va pharmacy if during this screening patient is discovered as having an emergent condition condition that left untreated could threaten the health of the patient the medical staff can be expected to initiate an appropr iate course of trea tment without regard to eligibility status in the event that the medical staff commitment to address all complaints was to come into conflict with resource limitations vas medical care professionals would allocate the services they could provide according to the traditional triage model applicants would be given access to care ba sed on the urgency nd type of conditions presented and those veterans most in need of care would be given high priority for services regardless of those veterans overall place in the priority schedule administered by va health care resource management this potential sharp contradiction between medical and administrative priorities has not occurred appropriated resources and the shift of more services from inpatient to outpatient settings has allowed va to serve all veterans applying for care without denying care to any particular vete ran with medical need identified by va medical professionals while some veterans have complained that services are not given to them in the same manner or locati on as they had previously experienced this change is not itself denial of care but rather byproduct of the efficiency efforts yet some areas of the country continue to feel the pinch of reduced va medical resources as programs dependent upon i npatient capacity give way to outpatienthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs9 1fy2000 va budget submission v 2 medical programs p 28services shifting resources from underutiliz ed inpatient care to outpatient clinics increases the number of veterans who can be served by the same number of va medical personnel 75 of the va medi cal care budget funds medical care personnel either as federal employees or through contract ed care at the same time this shift in resources can result in the rmination of programs that often rely upon inpatient capacity especially those concerne d with mental health and substance abuse programs va patients tend to be older sicker poorer and more likely to have social problems and mental illness than persons using private health care facilities1 regional administration the va reorganized the medical system into 22 regional entities called veterans integrated service networks visns each visn manages all resources within the region consolidating and in tegrating service capabilities to avoid duplication and increase efficiency annual evaluations

veterans with clearer sens of the medical benefits they could expect to receive each visn established h ealth plans to administer veterans health care these plans began enrolling veterans october 1 1998 curre ntly all veterans applying for enrollment are accepted this practice will continue at least through fy2000 veterans can enroll in advance of seeking care severely disabled are exempt from

measuring the relative needs for resources among visns called the veterans equitable resource allocation vera guides the shift of resources according to methodology that identifies underutilization and rewards efficiency according to the genera l accounting office gao the objective of vera is to provide comparable resour ces for comparable workload so that veterans within the same priority categories have the same availability for care to the extent practical throughout the va healthcar system vera is predicated on the assumption that reallocation is necessary when one network is allocated more funds per veteran than another network new sources of funds instead of additional appropriations to make up the difference between appropria ted funds and projected increases in medical care costs the administrations budgets for fy1998 fy1999 and fy2000 assumed revenues from new sources of funds va estimated that by fy2002 about 10 of the medical care budget could be derived from cost recovery medicare reimbursement and re venue from leases and service agreements the fy2000 budget revised this figure downward to 76 largely because the original assumption incorporated revenues from dicare that have not been authorized together with individual patient efficien cy savings of 30 va estimated that the reforms could permit serving 20 incr ease in caseload without an increase to annual appropriations while the guideline estimates may not be accurate the thrusthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs10 2although the law specifies that veterans with 50 or greater disability ratings

nonserviceconnected conditions although some vete rans who qualify for free care because of low incomes may be obligated to pay copaymen ts for prescribed medications it should be noted that va does not ope rate pharmacy in the same sense in which drugstore can be expected to fill prescriptions across the full spectrum of available medical supplies va operate s pharmacy in conjunction with the treatment plans developed by va medical staff for treating specific conditions among its patientveterans in order to improve the efficacy of its treatments and to maximize the bargaining position of va pha rmaceutical purchasin g agents va staff developed limiting list called formulary that guides the va physician in prescribing drugs from among those that have similar effectiveness3 thus va physician must see veteran in order to prescribe drugs for that patient both to assure that va quality of care criteria are respected and will continue to develop through statistical examination of patient outcomes and to match the veterans prescription needs with those available through va pharmacy stepped up collections of outstanding costsharing obligations on july 14 2000 va began notifying veterans with outstanding obligations for copayments and deductibles that the department would become more aggressive in its efforts to recover the owed amounts citing require ments on the va contained in pl 99272 and pl 101508 and with reference to the debt collection improvement act of 1996 va informed veterans that outstandi ng costsharing obligations would be offset from other federal payments including for the first time from social security benefits to which the veteran is entitled limited to 15 of the benefit in excess of 750 per month federal employees who are also veterans

taking into consideration how the leasing arrangement would affect local commercial and community interests va can enter into leases of up to 75 years if it determines that the activities would not interfere with va programs and woul d in some way serve the interests of veterans these leases may be additional sources of revenue to the facilities and may serve to increase the use of capacity that would otherwise be underused medicare subvention many veterans advocates have suggested that va should also be reimbursed for nonservice connected care va provides veterans who are also covered by medicare medicare subvention meaning transfer or subsidy from the medicare trust funds is the term by which this proposal is known if medicare were to transfer funds to cover the cost of vas services to its existing caseload of patients who are also covered by medicare medicare program outlays could increase and va would experience an increase in spending authority on the other hand if va served additional veterans whose care is currently paid by medicare and if va provided that care ss expensively than providers who would otherwise be reimbursed throug h medicare then real savi ngs could be possible both to taxpayers and to medicare offset ag ainst this potential savings would be any costs accrued by va for services to additi onal patients and fo r benefits that va provides that medicare does not cover for its participants such as prescription drugs if subvention caused the government to provi more in total services than wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs13 4there is category b common practice in veterans health care discussions divides veterans into these two categories one of wh ich has access to free va care while the other agrees to share in costs although the categ ories are not found in va law some years ago va law did categorize veterans according to access priority categories b and cotherwise have been provided overall fe deral spending would increase unless savings in the cost of providing those services through va instead of through medicare reimbursement of private health care providers equals or exceeds the cost of the additional services the 105th congress considered medicare s ubvention bills but ended with final action one bill hr 3828 to authoriz pilot project at three locations for 3 years was reported by the house committee on ways and means with approval of the house committees on veterans affairs and commerce the pilot project would have permitted veterans in those three locations whose priority status requires them to share in the cost of their medical care called category c veterans in the bill to enroll in va plan and have their medi care benefits provided through that plan medicare would then pay va the same rate per covered person that it would pay for those persons to enroll in similar private prepaid plan approved by medicare the bill would also have permitted veterans who live in geographically remote areas and who have highpriority access to va hea lth care called category veterans in the bill and who are also covered by dicare to receive their medicare benefits through one of vas visn health plans4 this approach to medicare subventi on would require va and the department of health and human services hhs to coordinate the collec tion of data which would be analyzed to make sure that medicareeligible veteran receives less in medical benefits through va than would be received directly through medicare and that reimbursements to va from medicare do not exceed established limits in the 105th congress bill medicare would have been authorized to reimburse va for up to 50 million in the year 2000 75 million in 2001 and 100 million in subsequent years for care provided to category ve terans and 50 million for each of 3 years for the category c veterans the approach had bipartisan suppor t with 92 cosponsors but the 105th congress ended with the bill not acted upon by the full house the substance of hr 3828 was included in hr 4567 wh ich passed the house on october 10 1998 but action was taken in the nate before the end of the 105th congress on february 24 1999 the senate passe d s 4 bill to improve pay and retirement equity for members of the arme d forces attached to the bill was an amendment to establish medicareva subven tion demonstrations in up to 10 sites the proposed pilot projects would meet criteria for providing medicare benefits through va health care plans for certain ve terans with coverage under the medicare program these plans would be regard ed by the medicare program as qualified medicare providers on november 16 1999 the senate fi nance committee reported the medicare subvention demonstration for veterans act of 1999 s 1928 srept 106222httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs14 which would establish up to eight demonstr ation sites to deliv er medicarecovered services to certain medi careeligible veterans va would be authorized upon agreement with the department of health and human services hhs to establish an equal number of coordinated care and f eeforservice plans one of each of which must be located within predominatel rural area va would provide at minimum medicare benefits equivalent to those benefits received by medicare beneficiaries in other plans the medicare trust fund would reimburse va for medicare services it provides to these duallycovered vete rans by up to 50 million annually va would serve the medicarecovered veterans in these plans in the most appropriate ve nue whether in va facility or through contracts with private health care providers unlike the house bill of the 105th congress only category 7 vetera ns those ineligible for higher priority free va care could join the demons tration projects the house bill of the 105th congress would have allowed enrollment in the demonstrations by veterans eligible for highpriority access to va care but who live in remote areas other requirements upon va and the dicare program are much the same as in the house bill of the 105th congress and would be c oordinated between va and hhs late in the 2nd session of the 106th congress an amended version of the evolving medicare subvention proposal wa s deliberated during the development of legislation to enact comprehensive changes to medicare various participants including the house ways and means committee the house commerce committee the senate finance committee together w ith house and senate leadership proposed an agreement called the medicare medicaid and schip benefits and improvement and protection act of 2000 which was then attached to hr 2614 bill to amend the small business investment act th agreement passed the house on october 26 2000 but the provisions to establish medicare subvention pilot program were dropped from the bill before action was taken currently there is active legislation to bring about medicare s ubvention project for coordinating medical benefits for veterans with rights to both va and medicare finally language was included in hr 5109 va health care personnel act of 2000 which addressed issues in vamedi care subvention the provisions were dropped when other provisions in hr 5109 were added to s 1402 before its enactment the subvention provisions gendered some debate among veterans service organizations with the american legion and the veterans of foreign wars endorsing the provision and the disabled american veterans and the paralyzed veterans of america opposed to its enac tment the provision would have permitted va to pay some of the costs associated w ith treatments given to veteran in non va medical facility when va determined that it is in the veterans medical interest to provide such care outside va for practical reasons such as the distance veteran might need to travel to reach an appropriate va dical facility four pilot projects were to be authoriz ed and the projects selected were to be located in such way as to limit the number of veterans participating to more than 15 of those living in the area 70 of the veterans in the area must have travel of more than 2 hours to reach facility and th total that could be spent on the projects in any fiscal year was to be limited to 50 million the pilot projects would expirehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs15 in 2005 and adverse effects on va medical facilities would have prompted changes in projects proponents of these provisions pointed to the increased access that would result from veterans becoming able to seek care cl oser to their homes and noted that the number of veterans seeking care from va is increasing fast enough to compensate for diminished demand at the facilities affected in effect the provisions would have allowed va to pay costs including copaym ents and deductibles for veterans in va plans who were also covered by ot her plans including medicare opportunities for veterans to seek care elsewhere alarms some veterans organizations who believe it could lead to an erosion of va specialization in veterans disability services and declines in the number of veterans seeking services at va medical facilities they conclude that such changes when combined with va efficiency moves shifting care from inpatient facilities to outpatient clinics would mean the eventual closing of va hospitals the millennium health care act pl 106117 near the end of the 1st session congress approved the millennium health care act hr 2116 the new law expands extended care services for ve terans including geriatric evaluation nursing home care domiciliary services adult day health care noninstitutional alternatives to nursing home care home or residence assistance and respite care the act also authorizes va to pay for emergency care on behalf of uninsured enrolled veterans who are within 2 years of having received va health care at the time of the emergency the act also authorizes the creation of such capability to the level sufficient to assure access to the services for any veteran who needs such care for serviceconnected condition and to any veteran with serviceconnected disability rated at 70

high priority acce ss to va medical services for military retirees regardless of their placement in the priority system that governs the access of all veterans to va medical care this change would have the effect of placing priority access for military retirees ahead of veterans who do not qualify for free relatively highpriority care because they do not meet the standards for service connected free care and they do not have incomes and assets below vas means tested threshold also veterans awarde d purple heart would be given access to free higher priority health care the new law also raises the visib ility and accountability of va efforts to manage its extensive capital stock of buildings and other permanent medical care capability and support va would be required to consider altern atives and to draw upon funds for furthering these alternatives in any situation in which building wing service unit or other facility is subject to closing the purpose of the provisions would be to enable va and the communities in which the facilities are located to determine if facilities threatened with closure could be used in some other manner to serve veterans such as for c onvalescent care or other assisted living arrangements before that building is liquidated by demolition or sale to the private sector va would be per mitted to retain any funds obtained through leasing

several bills affecting veterans bene fits were enacted resulting in th ree new public laws in order to expedite action the final versions of th bills incorporated features from number of other bills among the provisions adopt ed are ones which would provide cost ofliving adjustment for serviceconnected disability and survivor compensation benefits hr 4850 one whic h would revise the limits that

programs veterans cash programs are fully and auto matically adjusted each year for changes in the costofliving adjustment cola in the same manner granted to most federal benefit programs including social secu rity why these two important federal obligations are not also automatically linke d to the official measurement of changes to the costofliving is largely tactical instead of amending va

veterans obtain records relevant to claim they file with va only if it can be proved that the cl aim is wellgrounded by tradition and consistent with its in terpretation of the statutes governing veterans benefits va had ssumed considerable responsib ility for assisting veterans as they seek benefits from va program in practice va claims processors exercised some discretion with respect to the assistance provided sometimes discouraging veterans from filing claims for which there was ample precedent of similar claims being denied on the ot her hand these same processors provided valuable assistance to veterans with claims that had some potential merit helping them identify sources of potentially useful information and supporting documentation in reviewing the disposition of recent claim morton v west currently on appeal to the us court of appeals the court of appeals for veterans claims called into question the regulations and manuals that provided guidance as to the respective obligations of bot h the veteran claimants and the va with respect to the filing of well grounded or plausible cl aim with va the court asserted that vas statutory obligation was more limited than their practices indicated and that the veteran had the sole res ponsibility of developing information that would lead to finding by va that the claim was well gr ounded that is that there was at least some basis for proceeding with developing case file only at that point could va become involved in providing assistance to veterans as they develope d suppor ting evidence for their claims partially in response to the unfolding controversy about the departments obligations to assist veterans from the beginning of their claims process va proposed new regulations5 that would require most veterans to submit information demonstrating that their claims are pl ausible va would continue to assume responsibility to assist at all stages t hose veterans who may be presumed to be unable to prepare their own claims va be lieved the approach was consistent with existing law and would resolve the apparent conflict between the statutes and the practices of claims examiners by conti nuing to assist vete rans who cannot help themselves while asking veterans and their representatives to gather some information that would be needed to begi n the claims adjudication process the veteran service organizations were asked to participate in the refinement of the proposed regulations and to suggest categor ies of veterans w ho should be provided assistance even if their claims do not initially appear to be well grounded some veterans service organizations regarded the decision as significant step back in the kind of assistance that veterans seeking benefits had right to expecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs18 from the departments staff and that the proposed regulations were inadequate protection to veterans who could find themselves unable to proceed with their claims under the new procedures hr 4864 and s 1810 the senate version of this legislation received substa ntial support within the ve terans advocacy community the new law increased vas obligations to help veterans at the initial claims stage initially va voiced concerns that enactment of provisions could substantially increase va claims processing workloads w ithout substantially changing the ultimate approval rate of app lications for benefits althoug h va claimed that the additional workload could have the effect of slow ing down the claims process and lead to longer time periods before

commonwealth of the philippines were draw n into that war under authority of us armed forces on the basis of legislation enacted in 1934 preparatory to philippine independence many of these filipino veterans believe that their service was active duty service in the us military that shoul d qualify them for th same benefits as other veterans of active duty legisla tion passed in 1946 specifically excludes such filipino veterans from full veterans benefits and pressure to amend that exclusion has periodically surfaced since that time some of the filipino soldiers were disabled during the course of their service under us armed forces command and b ecame eligible for serviceconnected compensation from va because of differe nces between the economies of the us and the commonwealth of the philippines the compensation payments were provided under federal law to these disabled filipino vete rans at rate equivalent to 50 cents for each dollar that would be paid to similarly disabled veteran in the us armed forces regardless of whether the filipino veteran resided in the us or the philippine islands the disparity in payments for us residents entitled to va compensation has been recurring issue initially it was ar gued before congress by proponents of the lower payments that the distinction was necessary to prevent the benefits from becoming an inducement to seek residence in the us solely for that purpose some also argued that the commonwealth would reach political stability more easily if these disabled veterans remained in the philippines during the postwar period in recent years filipino advocates have pointed to the large number of filipino veterans in the us as legal residents nd have called for legisl ation to address their claims for full benefits the admin

reappears on the internet the internet has made possible the dissemin ation through chain letter postings of numerous reports which give every appearan ce of being factually correct but which are in fact totally false one such di sseminated false report tells of supposed dividend that congress has recently enacted and for which veterans are eligible if they apply rumors of this bonus have surfaced periodically through various forms of informal media for nearly 50 years defying vigorous attempts by va and congress to eradicate it from the common sense origin of the dividend rumor in 1950 va paid 27 billion in special dividends to 16 million world war ii ve terans who had national service life insurance policies with pr emiums paid to 1948 the 1948 special dividend from that point forward the possibility of dividends has led to periodic rumors that congress has again passed such bene fit or is considering doing sohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs24 for instance in 1965 for unknown reason some newspapers published stories reporting of the special dividends that had been paid in the early 1950s as if the dividends were being paid at the time the stories were published while va attempted to squash the misinformation w ith factual stories each time the false reports surfaced the stories w ould take on local circula tion life gradually drifting to more marginal print media such as newsletters flyers and local bulletins and sometimes accompanied by bogus application forms at some points va received as many as 20000 inquiries per week about this supposed dividend and in 1970 the volume of requesters prompted congress to enact legislation declaring steps to be taken whenever va was presented with such bogus applications the stories are false there has been recent legislation that would authorize special dividends divide nds are not payable to current service members insured under the servicemans group life insu rance sgli or veterans group life insurance vgli both of which are group policies without dividend concepts involved va does automatically pay divide nds on some policies of other programs that have that intended feature but then only to veterans who ve kept the policies in force in the event veteran is due one of these dividends it is paid automatically on the anniversary date of th policy and application fo r the payment is necessary transition from active du ty to civilian life are readjustment programs inadequate one of the traditional responsibilities of va is to assist veterans in readjusting to civilian life readjustment assistance is also provided to servicedisabled veterans to enable them to achieve maximum independence in their daily lives as result of the decline in the numbers of veterans the importance of these readjustment programs is perhaps less evident than it has been during periods in which large numbers of troops were mobilized the veterans affairs committees in both houses of the 106th congress are considering gislative proposals based on recommendations of recent congressi onal commission that examined these programs most of the current programs originated with the gi bill of 1944 under the gi bill and subsequent additions and vari ations the va has spent over 65 billion training or educating more than 20 million veterans over 14 million veteran home loans have been guaranteed all veterans are also assured assistance in preparing for and finding employment educational assistance job retention rights preferences in federal hiring and with employers having federa l contracts of 10000 or more per year guaranteed direct loans and insurance for veterans are among the kinds of assistance provided veterans some programs assisting in veterans readjustment are administered through agreements between va and other agencies including the departments of labor defe nse and transportation educational assistance the original gi bill was in part intended to help alleviate shortages in trai ned manpower as well as provi opportunities for veterans to better adapt to civilian life for many returning troops the gi benefits assisted

economic conditions the current version of the veterans edu cation and training program called the montgomery gi bill mgib meets somewhat different objective with the end of conscription and the move to an all volunteer force congress enacted program that serves as recruiting inducement to young people considering their opportunities for future economic improvement the montgomery gi bill provides educational assistance to veterans who agree to ve their military pay reduced by 100 per month for the first 12 months of active dut the money is not refundable if the participant does not elect to enroll in eligible educati on or training when the period of active duty is completed the mgib participant is eligible for monthly education benefits of 650 m onthly for 36 months for 3year active duty enlistment and 528 monthly for enlistme nts of less than 3 years other amounts may be added as inducements to join difficult to fill active duty job assignments other somewhat lesser amount s may

as civilian federal workers proposal to increase education benefits perhaps the major recommendation of the commission concerns the role va education benefits play in recruitment of an adequa supply of young and able military personnel at issue is key finding of the commission while college attendance is major goal of high school graduates and their pa rents the value of mgib benefits toward collegehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs26 education is relatively less attractive than it once was other programs targeting the same population have increased in scope and generosity causing military

without endur ing the risks and sacrifices inherent in military service vetera ns education conditioned on military service must offer substantial advantage over programs available to all americans the commission proposed substantial lib eralization of th mgib eliminating its pay reduction in the first year of ac tive duty and providing monthly stipend funds for books tuition nd fees to attend any ins titution of higher learning in america for which they qualify to an veteran who has co mpleted an enlistment of at least 4 years for enlistments of less than 4 years the commission recommends an increase to 600 monthly and providi ng the money at the beginning of an academic term versions of these change s were included in pl 106419 discussed above enacted late in the 2nd session of the 106th congress the ongoing issue of presuming service connections the relationship between risk exposure and subsequent disabilities introduction some veterans and their dvocates believe that exposure to environmental toxins or unknown and mysteri ous diseases during military service has left many veterans vulnerable to an array of disabilities ter in life in recent times congress has considered the concerns of veterans with claims arising from service in nuclear testing areas vietnam and the persian gulf authority for va to provide medical treatment for diseases presum ed linked to radiation has been made permanent similar authority to receive hi gh priority medical treatment for diseases presumed related to exposure to agent or ange and other herbicides in vietnam expires at the end of 2002 authority for medical treatment fo r veterans who may have been exposed to toxic substances or environmental hazard s during the persian gulf war expires at the end of 2001 authority to evaluate the health of spouses and children of persian gulf war veterans expires at the end of this year although major legislation has not been considered in the 106th congress the issue of presuming disabilities to be serv iceconnected and the implications of such presumptions is of ongoing concern to congress and to veterans service organizations the following discusses the history and current status of this issue giving veterans the benefit of the doubt the nation has accepted an obligation to veterans who incur injury disease or aggravate an existing condition va law calls all of these disabilities while in service to the country health services cash payments and other benefits may be given to veterans who experience disabilities traceable to peri od of military service these disabilities need not have occurred in the line of duty or even be re lated to active duty for condition to be regarded as serviceconnected veterans need show only that the condition occurred or was aggravated as result of military service or arose during that periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs27 to receive benefits for serviceconn ected disability vete rans are required to document that their condition is related to their service the claim is often clearly documented by pertinent military records however with some disorders evidence of serviceconnection is inconclusive congress has sometimes granted presumption of serviceconnection so that veterans can be treated and given appropriate compensation while scientific studies attempt to determine whether correlation can be found between risk s the veteran encountered during military service and the subsequent ma nifestation of disorder early in the 20th century these presumed serviceconnections permitted va and its administrative forerunners to treat veterans for variety of little understood ailments that they might have contracted during duty in faroff lands while many tropical diseases long defied routine diagnosis more familiar diseases such as malaria were diagnosed accurately and the sporadic recurrence of its symptoms over time were well known the pa ssage of time between ve terans exposure to risk and onset or recurrence of specific di sease made the use of presumptions an attractive alternative to protracted exa mination of claim that was necessarily difficult to validate or rebut recent presumption issues current concern that latent illnesses could be related to toxic exposure during gulf wa r service was preceded by similar concern that certain diseases could be related to exposure to agent orange or other herbicides in vietnam that concern was preceded by concerns that certain diseases could be related to exposure to nuclear radiation during world war ii or during atomic testing in the 1950s in these cases policy objec tives were based on the rationale that veterans should be given th benefitofthedoubt as to the treatment of illnesses potentially traceable to military service 1 these veterans were sick with serious diseases needing treatment 2 they di d serve their country often in war time combat zone and 3 capacity to provide the services existed if they were given high priority access from scientific standpoint the eviden ce necessary for va to conclude that particular presumption shoul d be expanded to include dditional diseases is not particularly high thres hold generally speaking the law excludes extending presumptions to disorders in which sc ientific evidence has found correlation between exposure to risk and the contracti on of disorder or when the disorder is attributable to another cause yet other scientific evidence even when inconclusive may be enough for the list of disorders with presumptive service link to be expanded presumptions and exposure to nuclear radiation from 1945 until 1963 the us exploded approximately 235 nuclear devices in the atmosphere potentially exposing an estimated 220000 military personnel to unknown levels of radiation some of these ve terans later claimed that low level radiation released during the testing may be cause of certain adverse health consequences they had experienced in addition so veterans who had been among occupation forces in hiroshima and nagasaki after the atomic bomb attacks on those cities also claimed that they had experienced adverse health effects because of that occupation

carcinogenic and other health eff ects of high radiation doses was well known scientific evidence about the longt erm health consequences of exposure to low levels was inconclusive in 1987 congress chose not to abide by its long standing tradition that benefits should be paid only where substantive evidence is clearly available to establish that the disabling conditions existed while on active duty or are clearly related to such period of service instead congress accepted the conclusion that because the evidence of expos urelevel risk could not be verified it should depend instead on correlation of vari ous diseases with radiation exposure pl 100321 included language establishing presumption that 13 diseases would be presumed to be serviceconnected if th ey manifested in veterans whose service histories included active duty in radiationrisk activity7 the va opposed passage of the bill arguing that existing law was sufficient to permit awarding benefits in cases in which the evidence linking diseases to radiation exposure was conclusive at the heart of the objection to the bill was the administrations claim that the overw helming majority of veterans covered by the bill received very low doses of radi ation whether they participated in the weapons tests or the occupati on of hiroshima or nagasaki va examined scientific data on correlations between various cancers and radiation exposure at the level that had been experienced by the veterans and projected that of the 32000 to 34000 deaths from cancer that would otherw ise occur among the 200000 veterans made eligible for the presumption under the law the additional exposure from their service experience would lead to 10 additional deaths the administration concluded that the issue really becomes whether the federal government should presume that all 32010 eventual cancers among atomic veterans are serviceconnected in order to assure that the 10 possible excess cases related to service are covered or whether it is better public policy to look at each case individually to separate the more deserving claims from those less deserving8 in spite of the va opposition the bill passed nd subsequently has been amended to include additional diseases radiationexposed veterans continue to have various illnesses considered for inclusion within the presumption on february 25 1999 the nate before passage of s 4 amended it to include language offered by sena tor wellstone that increased the number of diseases for which presum ption of serviceconnection would exist for disabilities experienced by radiationexposed veterans expanding presumptions to include exposure to agent orange congress also granted priority medical tr eatment to veterans who had been exposed to the defoliant agent orange the active ingredient in that defoliant is the chemical dioxin for which there is some evidence of diseasecausing potential by the time that congress enacted legislation authoriz ing the treatment of diseases possibly linked to radiation exposure increasing numbe rs of veterans of service in vietnamhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs29 9the dod medical registry and the va persian gulf health registry have had some clinical evaluation contact with about 100000 of the nearly 700000 gulf war veteranswere claiming serviceconnection for disa bilities that they belie ved were related to exposure to agent orange when concern mounted that exposure to herbicides in vietnam could have posed health risk the department of defense examined its records to determine which personnel may actually have been exposed and what level of exposure they may have experienced however depl oyment records and troop movement data could not pinpoint exposure with accuracy congress drew the conclusion that exposure to agent orange or to other herbicides regardless of their toxicity at sufficient levels to be potentially diseas ecausing had to be presumed given the widespread use of herbicides because exposure to toxic herbicides was presumed for any military personnel who served in vi etnam during the period in which agent orange was used science need only find so evidence suggestive of an association between particular disease and exposure to herbicides at any level in order to validate presumption that the disease is serviceconnected presumption for spina bifida in 1996 congress amended va law to grant the presumption of serviceconnection to claims on behalf of children stricken by the disease spina bifida who are born to vi etnam veterans spina bifida is birth related disease that can entail intensive and expensive assistance to the child for years the basis for this expansion wa s national academy of sciences nas report reviewing studies of correlation be tween toxic exposure of vietnam veterans and children born to them with spina bifida while the scientific studies were inconclusive nas did find some evid ence suggestive of such correlation expanding presumptions and the persian gulf war syndrome after returning from service in the persian gulf war some veterans began complaining of illnesses that they thought mig ht be attributable to their service there commonly reported symptoms included fatigue muscle and joint pain severe headaches and memory loss media reports began to characterize the array of symptoms as the gulf war syndrome although single illness with the multitude of symptoms has been diagnosed and common characteristics of the veterans circumstances have been identified other than persian gulf service on land or at sea although majority of ill vete rans have been diagnosed with recognized disease significant number remain undiagnosed nd appear to be suffering from multiple illnesses with overlapping symptoms and causes congress provided for all illness claims of persian gulf war veterans to be examined at va medical facilities illnesses diagnosed whenever possible symptoms treated if necessary and database created to facilitate further research into causes9 more than 100 federallyfunded research studies pertaining to gulf war illnesses are underway to date clinical studies ve not found an unexplained

servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs30 10report of the presidential advisory committee on gulf war veterans illnesses p 125evidence steadily emerges that gulf war veterans were in complex environment contaminated by multiple chemical substances some of which had been introduced to improve the safety an d comfort of friendly forces perhaps as many as 25000 american soldiers may have been exposed to chemical weapons while they were not actually used in combat some believe the destruction of the weapons released toxins that may have caused illnesses with layed symptoms so far medical experts report that conclusive evidence has been presented that persian gulf war illnesses ar related to chemical w eapons but studies of the possible effects of multiple chemical expos ure including the effects of lowlevel exposure to chemical weapons are underway the presidential advisory committee on gulf war veterans illnesses finding thatmany veterans clearly are experiencing medical difficulties connected to their service in the gulf war the advisory committee reviewed numerous studies of gulf war veterans and their health complaints the advisory committees report dated december 31 1996 concluded that scie ntific evidence had not produced causal link between symptoms and illnesses reported by gulf war veterans and exposure to pesticides ch emical warfare agents biological warfare agents vaccines pyridostigmine bromide infectious diseases depleted uranium oil well fires and smoke and petroleum products nevertheless the advisory committee recommended further research in several areas including the medical risks especially longterm risks that might be related to multichemical exposure lowlevel exposure to chemical warfare agents and other toxic substances with recognized carci nogenic potential that were known to be present in the persian gulf war fi nally the report of the advisory committee emphasized the need to examine closely the relationship between wartime stress and the broad range of physiological and psychological illnesses currently being reported by gulf war veterans10 priority health care authority to provide high priority medical

are related to the veterans gulf war servi ce and required va to seek advice from the national academy of sciences on ways in which these veterans could be more effectively treated the law also established an independent mechanism recommended by the academy so that research into gulf war illness claims could be evaluated outside of the federal government federal research the dod va and hhs through the persian gulf veterans coordinating board have established compre hensive research program to provide information about the preval ence distribution and causes of illnesses among gulf war veterans according to gao report federal agencies spent total of 37 million on research on gulf war veterans illnesses through fy1996 andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30099crs31 several additional proj

the persian gulf presumptions on future scientific studies in the absence of firm scientific evidence to the contrary congress has given veterans of the persian gu lf war the benefitofthe doubt that their ailments may be connected to their military service however the basis for establishing scientifically link between an exposure to risk and the incidence of disease coul d be further eroded persia n gulf war veterans were potentially exposed to large number of toxins and are now authorized to receive priority treatment for virtually unlimited list of symptoms researchers caution that it may be impossible to identify the causes of illness in many gulf war veterans because of the absence of baseline data on the health of military personnel and the lack of reliable data on levels of exposure to potential risks in their wartime environment in effect because both exposure to toxic risk and the presence of disorder are presumed the statistical rela tionship between the risk level for one and the incidence of the othe r may be indeterminable overcoming presumed serviceconnection tobacco related illnesses in the 105th congress action was taken to prevent serviceconnection to toxic risk after several years of study in 1997 va had concluded that nicotine addiction is disease that could be li nked to tobacco use that began during military service thus if nicotine addiction has its origins in military service then secondary diseases linked to tobacco use were arguably serviceconnected while there are actual data on the number of total possible claims the potential number of claims was in the millions moreover the echo of serviceconnected claims could have continued for decades through compensation automatically paid to the dependents and survivors of veterans who die from rviceconnected conditions at issue was the governments res ponsibility when its military personnel made unwise health choices which were at least facilitated if not openly encouraged by government actions some argued that am erican taxpayers should not be held liable for illnesses caused by veterans decisi ons to use harmful tobacco products however as former va official pointed out during recent hearing our veterans were in many cases provided that first ciga rette by our government as part of their daily food ration or as part of comfort pack clearly the government was the agent that ultimately gave those cigarettes to our veterans while some veterans advocates vigor ously opposed changing the law others focused on securing some of the saving s for veterans benefits provision restricting va from paying compensation to veterans for adverse effects of tobacco use was included in pl 105178 the tr ansportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 similar proposal in
