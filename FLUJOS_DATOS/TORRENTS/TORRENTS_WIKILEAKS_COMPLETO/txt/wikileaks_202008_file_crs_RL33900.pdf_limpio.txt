stage for renewed debate over iraq policy perhaps coming to head in september hr 2206pl 11028 as enacted establishes eighteen political and security benchmarks for the iraqi government to meet and it makes 16 billion in new economic assistance to iraq conditional on achieving progress toward those goals or on the president waiving the requirements the bill also requires series of reports on progress in iraq in july and again in september and in the house hres 438 the rule for considering hr 2206 requires vote on measure to withdraw most troops from iraq by june 30 2008 as the first item of business when the house considers fy2008 funding for iraq and afghanistan which will likely be in september in all hr 2206pl 11028 provides 994 bill ion for the department of defense of which 947 billion is for military operations 16 billion for military construction and 31 billion for military base realignment and closure the bill also provides 61 billion for international affairs including

the senate 1217 billion in supplemental funds the house and senate reached conference agreement on hr 1591 at the end of april but the president vetoed the bill when it was formally presented on may 1 subsequently on may 10 the house approved two bills hr 2206 and hr 2207 that together provided 1233 billion in supplemental funding hr 2206 divided funding for military operations into two pieces the bill made 428 billion available immediately and without conditions the bill also approved 528 billion for military operations but before those funds could be used it required by midjuly presidential report on progress in iraq and subsequent congressional approval of resolution of approval to release the funds the president promised to veto that bill as well rather than confront presidential veto

the department of defense of which 955 billion is for programs in the regular defense appropriations bill and 48 billion is for programs in the military construction appropriations bill in all the bill adds about 7 billion to the administration request of which almost 4 billion is in the regular bill and 31 billion for base closure is in military construction major additions the bill adds 21 billion for defense health programs 2 billion for readiness reserve fund include 1 billion for the national guard 11 billion for housing allowances and 12 billion in addition to 18 billion requested for mine resistant ambush protected vehicles initial information on the conference agreement provided initially by the house appropriations committee did not identify offsetting reductions compared to the request funding for iraq contractors the bill does not include house provision to reduce funding for payments to contractors by 815 million base realignment and closure funds the military construction funding includes 31 billion for base realignment and closure which restores funds that congress deleted from the fy2007 continuing resolution as an offset for increased nondefense spending transfers of defense funds the administration requested two provisions to increase the amount of money the defense department can transfer between appropriations accounts in the fy2007 defense appropriations act congress provided 45 billion of general transfer authority in the base bill and 30 billion of additional special transfer authority in the title ix bridge fund for war costs the 45 billion of general transfer authority allows shifts of funds between all defense accounts subject to nonstatutory advance approval of congressional defense committees which the 3 billion of special transfer authority allowed shifts to other accounts of the amounts provided in title ix one requested provision would increase general transfer authority from 45 billion to 6 billion an increase of 15 billion second requested provision would allow the defense department to transfer up 35 bi llion of the defense funds provided in the supplemental the conference agreement does not provide the increase in general transfer authority but does allow transfer of 35 billion of the new defense money in the supplemental the agreement also provides that amounts shifted to restore funds transferred to the joint improvised explosive device defeat fund and to the iraqi security forces fund shall not count against general transfer authority in effect this increases general transfer authority by 1625 billion825 million for the jieddf transfer and 800 million for the isff transfer if the defense department were to assume that this these provisions will eventually become law before the very end of the fiscal year this authority might allow the defense department to shift more funds temporarily to the army to avoid the planned slowdown in operations see below for domestic programs the agreement includes gulf coast hurricane relief the conference agreement provides 69 billion for gulf coast hurricane relief the administration had requested 34 billion all for the federal

military operations into two pieces one available immediately without conditions and the second available only after subsequent debate about iraq policy house appropriators also divided funding for

hr 2206 as approved by the house included 428 billion available immediately and without conditions for us military operations abroad which should be sufficient to avoid any further need for the army to slow down military operations in anticipation of funding delays

the house to vote against the second amendment to the bill on the house floorthe measure that provided most of the funding for operations in iraq the bill also includes number of reporting requirements on iraq and afghanistan including detailed reports on progress toward the benchmarks and reports on the progress of iraqi and afghan security forces the final bill drops however provisions that the house initially inserted into the hr 1591 the first supplemental requiring that forces being deployed abroad meet specific criteria for readiness and for time between deployments or that the president waive these requirements the bill also provides the defense department with 35 billion of authority to transfer funds provided in the bill between accounts subject to the usual

funds in effect increasing the amount of general transfer authority the defense department has available for regular fy2007 defense appropriations by 16 billion this should be enough to ameliorate any

upcoming fy2007 supplemental appropriations bill on funding for military operations in iraq including set of timetables for withdrawing most us forces from iraq that approach was reflected in the house version of hr 1591 the initial fy2007 supplemental appropriations bill as marked up by the appropriations committee on march 15 and approved by the full house on march 23 hr 1591 set three alternative timetables for withdrawal from iraq it required the president to certify by july 1 2007 that iraq is making progress toward specific security and political benchmarks and to certify by october 1 2007 that progress on the political benchmarks has been achieved withdrawals of us combat forces must be completed within 180 days after either date if the certification was not made withdrawal must begin in any event by march 1 2008 and be completed by the end of august 2008 the bill also established requirements for unit readiness and time between deployments and required either that the president certify the requirements have been met or formally waive them the version of the bill that the senate passed on march 29 also established timetable for withdrawing forces though the enddate was established as goal rather than as binding condition the senatepassed bill directed the pr esident to commence the phased withdrawal of us forces from iraq within 120 days of enac tment of

security benchmarks on schedule established by the government the conference agreement on hr 1591 approved in the house on april 25 and in the senate on april 26 included compromise provisions that would require the president to determine by july 1 whether the iraqi government had attained specific security and political benchmarks it then required the secretary of defense to begin redeploying troops out of iraq beginning on july 1 with goal of completing the redeployment with in 180 days by the end of december if the president did not determine that the iraqi government had achieved the benchmarks and beginning on october 1 with goal of completing the deployment within 180 days by the end of march 2008 even if the president determined that iraq had made the required progress in each

after the president vetoed hr 1591 the house and senate began to consider ways of addressing iraq policy that would allow congress to assert some control over policy but that would not lead simply to second veto congress was also under considerable and growing pressure to provide funds for military operations before the army began to run out of money see below for discussion in an effort to accomplish both goals the house leadership decided to divide money for operations into two piecesone piece availabl immediately and one after second later vote to release the funds that approach was reflected in the initial version of hr 2206 which the house approved on may 10 as passed by the house on may 10 hr 2206 made 428 billion for military operations available immediately and without conditions it also required the president to report to congress by july 13 on the progress the government of iraq had made in achieving progress on specific benchmarks including allowing us forces to pursue militias providing iraqi security forces in baghdad eliminating militia control of local security disarming militias reducing violence ensuring minority rights adopting law sharing oil revenues equitably reforming debaathification laws and allocating 10 billion of iraqi funds for reconstruction the bill provided an additional 528 billion for military operations but prohibited its release until the president submitted the required report and congress passed joint resolution of approval releasing the funds the administration objected to this approach however complaining that funding on an installment plan would not allow the armed forces sufficient certainty to plan operations and that good would be served by requiring second vote the white house said that the president would veto bill if it were similar to hr 2206 as passed by the house there was little sentiment in the senate therefore to follow the house approach subsequently senior congressional leaders of both parties expressed support for measure that include benchmarks for performance by the iraqi government key issue however appeared to be whether and how to enforce progress toward the benchmarks by linking

5244 on motion to close debate on the amendment which failed because it required 60 votes for approval most democrats opposed the measure so it appeared for time that majority still wanted somewhat stronger enforcement of benchmarks as part of any funding compromise in the end however congress approved proposal with benchmarks very similar to those in the warner amendment and as in the amendment

almost immediately after the administration s ubmitted its fy2007 supplemental appropriations request in february army and dod officials began to warn that unless congress approved supplemental funding by some time in april limits on available funding might require disruptive changes in army operations which consume the largest share of war spending this concern about the army running out of funds before pass age of supplemental has surfaced in the past several years and could well surface again in the fall when the army again faces the prospect of financing its operational war costs by tapping funds for its baseline program that are slated for the end of the year or transferring funds from other programs in early april of this year with army om war monies in the fy2007 dod appropriations hr 5631pl 109289 running out dod requested and received congressional approval to transfer 16 billion from military personnel funds of the other services to the army the army also adopted temporary slowdown in spending for nonwarrelated operational activities to conserve funds with bridge funds the transfer and the slowdown army estimates showed that the service could temporarily finance its warrelated om activities through the end of junecovering nine months of the fiscal yearwithout supplemental funding 5 this years experience suggests that the army can temporarily finance war costs well into the fiscal year before passage of supplemental by using several tools tapping bridge funds for war provided in dods regular appropriation 4 written by amy

expenses using funds slated for endofyear expenses in its baseline program slowing om spending and invoking the feed and forage act as last resort how long the army can last depends on the amounts that are provided in the bridge fund transferred from other accounts available from its baseline programs or saved temporarily through slowdowns and the current rate of spending dod pressed congress to pass the s upplemental be cause of concerns that as funds ran low the army would have to slow spending which offici als claimed could affect operations and because of reluctance to use transfer authority to finance army om spending temporarily dod values transfer authority because it provides flexibility to move other funds between programs after enactment in order to meet higher priority items based on unforeseen military requirements 6 g23g156g146g151g144g561g22g155g138g151g156g143g142g155g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561 in the fy2007 defense appropriations act and in the

in fy200810 for the earlier transfer dod tapped military personnel funds from the navy and air force which needed to be restored quickly to cover endofyear salaries and benefits presumably to offset dod concerns about tapping transfer authority to finance war costs congress essentially restored 14 billion in reprogramming authority in the fy2007 supplemental close to the 16 billion used by the

consideration of the fy2007 supplemental secretary of defense gates told members of congress in march 22 2007 meeting that the army would have to slow training beginning in midapril and that delays beyond the middle of may might lead the army to extend the deployment term of units already in iraq rather than send new units without full training in press statement on march 23 president bush warned that if funding were delayed beyond april 15 our men and women in uniform will face significant disruptions and so will their families on march 29 army chief of staff general peter schoomaker and acting secretary of the army peter geren wrote to senator mcconnnell to warn that without approval of the supplemental funds in april we will be forced to take increa singly draconian measures which will impact army readiness and impose hardships on our soldiers and their families on april 2 all four military service chiefs signed similar letter to congressional leaders on april 11 in letter to senator byrd and representative murtha secretary of defense robert gates provided time line of steps the army would take to limit its activities in midapril the army issued press release and guidance to unit and facility commanders listing the types of actions that were to be used to rein in funding for the next three months in that guidance the army excluded any restrictive actions that would affect war operations result immediately in the degradation of readiness standards for deployed unit deploying unit or nexttodeploy unit affect reset the repair and re placement of warworn

cancelling all nonessential travel training and conferences temporarily suspending shipments of goods not associated with support of deployed forces restricting the use of government purchase cards to essential items freezing hiring of civilians from outside the army except for interns senior executive service directed hires or those that could affect warrelated deployments13 processing but delaying the award of contracts for repair and upgrade of facilities logistics support contracts or environmental restoration contracts unless there would be substantial increase in cost or safety concern not ordering noncritical spare parts or supplies deferring repair of equipment to be prepositioned overseas unless needed by nexttodeploy units or those converting to modular status and deferring home station unit training for reserve units that incur activeduty om costs although these restrictions could disrupt daytoday activities it is unlikely that unit readiness was affected readiness is defined by the joint chiefs of staff as the ability to provide capabilities required by the combatant commanders to execute their assigned missions and is measured by an elaborate system that rates individual units 14 by excluding warrelated activities savings were focused on stateside facilities and units that are currently not scheduled to deploy the army has indicated that much of the temporary savings came from delaying contracts for repair of stateside facilities another significant source of savingsdelaying the reorder of suppliesrequired the services to temporarily tap current inventory which could be replenished with higher orders in later months the army did not anticipate any savings from the civilian hiring freeze where savings take time to accrue or travel restrictions where savings are small in its original guidance the army had also requested information from its components about potential savings and effects on readiness from cancelling training exercises identifying depot workload that may not be accomplished within the fiscal year or delaying shipments to bases in case further slowdown was necessary 15 with passage of the supplemental further slowdown is longer needed in testimony to the senate appropriations committee in early may secretary of defense gates stated that if we pulled out all the stops used everything possible available to us we could probably fund the war into july but noted that the disruption to the department and programs here at home in order to fully sustain the troops abroad and particularly in iraq and afghanistan has growing impact here at home in terms of contracts not let civilians not hired programs 13 army memorandum operation and maintenance army spending restrictions plan for fy07 april

from debates on earlier supplement appropriations bills was what funding should properly be provided as emergency supplemental appropriations17 that are not subject to annual caps on federal spending and what funding should instead be provided in the agency base budgets that are financed in regular nonemergency appropriations in recent years defense appropriations exempted from budget caps including bridge funds for overseas operations provided as separate titles in the regular defense appropriations bills have grown from 16 billion in fy2002 to 63 billion in fy2003 and fy2004 to 102 billion in fy2005 18 to 116 billion in fy2006 and to 163 billion approved or requested in fy2007 this reflects progressive expansion of the ki nds of equipment and operational support that both the defense department and congress have agreed to consider as sufficiently urgent to warrant inclusion in emergency funding measures even though the funding may not meet definitions either of the narrowly defined incremental costs of military operations or of what constitutes an emergency by congressional standards an early issue for congress in considering the fy2007 supplemental was whether some of the very large increase in weapons procurement that the defense department requested went beyond even the expanded definition of warrelated requirements that congress has accepted in recent 17 the term emergency appropriations is used loosely here to include all spending exempt from annual budget resolution caps on discretionary appropriations technically under language used in annual congressional budget resolutions exemptions from budget caps cover funds formally designated as emergency spending and also funding for military contingency operations in the house and for m ilitary contingent operations or for national defense in the senate 18 this counts 25 billion in bridge fund in the fy2005 defense appropriations bill as fy2005 money though it is technically scored by the congressional budget office and the office of management and budget as fy2004 funding b ecause it was made available on enactment which was before the beginning of fy2005 all but about 2 billion however was not obligated until fy2005 or later

joint strike fighters new system not yet in production on the basis that the aircraft will replace equipment lost in the war though f35s will not be available for another three years the house appropriations committee eliminated funding for these and for navy ea18g aircraft even before the administration amended its request to delay these programs the supplemental request for international affairs funding raised the same issue in testifying before congress about the fy2008 budget request secretary of state rice faced several questions about the continued practice of requesting emergency supplemental funds for foreign affairs expenditures that do not seem unplanned or unexpected on february 8 2007 senator biden the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee complained weve been in afghanistan for over five years and iraq for nearly four and spending in neither country can hardly be called an emergency some legislators have questioned in particular proposed funding for us embassy operations and security in iraq in the end however in the conference agreement on hr 1591 and in the final version of hr 2206 congress continued to designate both defense and nondefense spending as emergency funding or as its technical equivalent technically the term emergency does not apply to defense spending defense funds are exempt from budget resolution caps on discretionary when designated as being for overseas contingency operations in the house and for contingent operations or for national defense in the senate and significantly in the fy2008 congressional budget resolution congress continued to set aside funding for military operations abroad in separate category exempt from caps that limit other discretionary spending this approach may continue to leave unresolved what should and should not be considered as emergency spending rather part of agency base budgets

has repeatedly objected to the use of emergency defense supplementals as an indirect means of avoiding cuts in nondefense programs in each of the past several years it some funding that might normally be included in the base defense budget has migrated into the supplementals which frees up funding under discretionary spending caps not only for other defense programs but also for nondefense discretionary accounts the final full year fy2007 continuing resolution hjres 20 pl 1105 for example cut 31 billion from the administrations defense request for base realignment and closure brac which freed an equivalent amount for nondefense appropriations bills subsequently in action of fy2007 supplemental appropriations congress added the brac funding to other defense money in the bill which some may see as in effect using the supplemental to finance nondefense programs without violating fy2007 discretionary spending caps at some point some contend congress may need to assert more effective limits on emergency spending if it wishes to restore discipline over the budget as whole

reports of shortcomings in medical care for wounded veterans prompted congress to add substantial amounts to the supplemental for military medical care the initial conference agreement on hr 1591 added 21 billion for defense health programs and 18 billion for veterans health including related administrative and facilities costs the final enacted version of hr 2206 adds 18 billion for defense health and 18 billion for veterans health congress also took additional measures to improve delivery of health care services to veterans in separate legislation

funding for all of the programs the military services identified as priorities in february for example each of the armed services submitted an unfunded priorities list upl of programs that did not receive funding in the final administration fy2008 request to congress but that the services would like if more money were available the army fy2008 upl includes substantial amounts for force protection equipment including 22 billion for mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicles in addition many legislators complained that the readiness of army and marine corps units not deployed abroad had declined particularly because of shortfalls of equipment for training in addition it appears that the defense department initially underestimated costs of the surge of 21000 combat troops to iraq congress took number of steps in its action on the supplemental to address these issues the conference agreement on the initial vetoed supplemental bill hr 1591 added 2 billion for defense readiness reserve fund of which 1 billion was for the national guard 11 billion to make up service identified shortfalls in housing allowances and 12 billion in addition to 18 billion requested for mine resistant ambush protected vehicles for all the services not just for the marine corps the final enacted version of hr 2206 adds 16 billion for readiness reserve fund of which 1 billion is for

other legislation from being used to close walter reed that step brought counter response led in particular by senator warner for advocates of brac decision to reverse course on one facility was

the administrations policy in iraqincluding the ongoing surgeis likely to be effective concerned about ensuring that funding was prov ided to support the troops congress approved most of dods funding request but voiced concerns about the validity of some requests and included additional oversight mechanisms in response to reports of stress because of frequent deployments of army and marine corps units congress endorsed two initiatives which dod claims make troop rotations easieraccelerating the conversion of army and marine corps units to standard configurations and expanding the size of the army and marines although the immediate effects of these initiatives appears to be limited the decision to increase the size of the army and maine corps using war funds may be revisited in the fy2008 authorization and appropriations cycle where additional funds are requested congressional initiatives to provide more support for troops and respond to reports of low readiness ratings included adding funds for defense health setting up new strategic readiness reserve fund and increasing funding for the mine resistant ambush program while dod largely supported dods funding reque sts congress added various reporting requirements to increase oversight in addition to the extensive reporting on the 18 benchmarks for measuring progress in iraq congress added specific reporting requirements for the iraq security forces fund the joint improvised explosive device defeat fund and military construction as in previous years congress cut dods requests for increases in coalition support funds to reimburse equip and train allies conducting counterterror operations

by providing almost all of the funds requested for military personnel and operations and maintenance congress funded not only ongoing operations but also the presidents request for an additional 69 billion to increase troop levels by 21500 combat troops to 20 brigades in iraq and heighten the us naval presence in the gulf by deploying an additional aircraft carrier and marine expeditionary force that was announced on january 10 2007 29 the amended request covered both additional support troops in iraq and 9000 more troops in afghanistan and was at least in part response to cbo estimate that suggested that dods original estimate had failed to include funding for support forces if peak troop levels were sustained for four months cbo estimated that the troop increase in iraq alone was likely to cost from 9 billion to 13 billion rather than the 60 billion proposed by dod 30 the higher cbo estimate assumed that dod would need to deploy not only 21500 29 see omb estimate 3 amendment

provided funds for an additional 4600 support troops arguing that much of general support was already in place32 if the higher troop levels were sustained for 12 months rather than the temporary increase proposed by the president cbo estimated that the cost could range from 20 billion to 27 billion again assuming substantially more support troops 33 in march 2007 general petraeus now in charge in iraq acknowledged that the additional troops would need to be sustained certainly some time well beyond the summer position echoed in recent months by other generals secretary of defense gates decision this spring to extend the tours for all army units in iraq from 12 months to 15 months would enable the army to continue to deploy 20 brigades in iraq for 12 to 24 months according to cbo analysis 34 if the higher troop levels are sustained beyond this fall the administration fy2008 request for war costs would be inadequate because it is based on presurge troop levels35 in its amended request dod halved its 15 billion request to deploy an additional carrier strike group to the gulf as result of refining its estimate an acknowledgment that the original estimate was excessiveequal to about half of the navy cost for steaming hours for its entire fleet of 302 ships36 congress provided the lower level some woul d argue that naval presence is the everyday mission of the navy so that providing funds in an emergency supplemental is not appropriate similar issue arose last year when the navy underfunded its normal steaming hours request and requested the hours in the supplemental an action reversed by congress this cost shifting could be considered inconsistent with dod financial regulations that require that warrelated costs be confined to activities that would not occur without the contingency before the supplemental was passed dod funded the ongoing deployment of the additional troops using currently available dod funds because dod monies are appropriated for particular types of expenses eg military personnel costs rather than designated for particular operations the president can tap these fund to conduct military operations with enactment of the fy2007 supplemental dod is restoring these baseline funds to be spent for their original purposes 31 cbo cost estimate for troop increase proposed by the president february 1 2007 p 4 httpwwwcbogov ftpdocs77xxdoc7778troopincreasepdf this estimate assumes that peak levels are sustained for four months the range in the estimate reflects two alternative planning assumptionsone that about one support troop would be needed for each combat tr oop for temporary increase and the other that about 14 support troops would be needed for each combat troop standard army planning

the army and marine corps received total of 502 billion for reset according to dod sources 44 reset or reconstitution is defined as the repair and replacement of warworn equipment when troops andor equipment are redeployed or rotated45 with the 14 billion approved by congress in th fy2007 supplemental for replacing equipment total reset funds would reach ab out 64 billi on the fy2007 supplemental funds are an addition to the 237 billion already in the fy2007 title ix bridge funds for reset or repairing and replacing warworn equipment when congress approved those funds the army and marine corps assured congress that this amount fully met dods reset requirements for fy2007 requirements as well as covering previously unfunded fy2006 requirements46 so as of the fy2007 bridge fund army and marine corps reset requirements were fullyfunded army officials have frequently cited figure of 12 billion to 13 billion year for reset costs for the army as long as the conflict lasts at the current level and for minimum of two to three years beyond47 it appears that dods fy2007 supplemental request for reset or reconstitution front loads or funds in advance some of dods reset requirements as omb director portman acknowledged in testimony this february 48 further evidence of front loading is the fact that many of the items requested in the fy2007 supplemental request were the same as those already funded in the fy2007 bridge fund this front loading may reflect army and marine corps concerns that equipment replacement is expected to be needed for couple of years even

or equipment replacement for not only operations in iraq and afghanistan but also the longer war on rror on october 25 2006 deputy secretary of defense gordon england issued new ground rules for the services in developing their fy2007 supplemental requests stating that the services could include incremental costs related to the longer war against terror not just oefoif including replacem ent of warworn equipment with newer models and costs to accelerate specific force capability necessary to prosecute the war 49 there was specific definition of the longer war on terror now one of the core missions of the department of defense this new guidance may be the primary reason for the 40 increase in war funding between f2006 and fy2007 the new definition constitutes significant shift from longstanding dod financial regulations that require that costs be necessary to carry out specific operations strictly incremental ie costs would not have been incurred in the absence of the contingency requirement and executable within the current fiscal year 50 although these strictures were reiterated in guid ance issued to the services in developing fy2007 supplemental and fy2008 war cost requests it appears that some of the items included did not meet these tests in light of congressional cuts to the request for certain depot maintenance and procurement that was not considered executable or needed this year see below for examples51 dods recent reset requests include not only funds for war losses typically 10 of the total but also for anticipated replacement of equipment for future wear and tear and for upgrading equipment dod projects that equipment would be replaced not only when it is destroyed but also when the services decide it is uneconomical to repair washouts the services have also included substantial funds for recapitalization rebuilding and upgrading equipment for modifying equipment and for buying new versions of equipment substantial expansion of the traditional definition another issue raised by congress about reset requ irements was whether it is appropriate for the services to replace equipment that is longer being produced with new items that are just beginning or have not yet begun production dods regulations caution the services not to 49 deputy secretary of defense gordon england memorandum for secretaries of the military department

strike fighters 146 million for cv22 ospreys and 388 million for c130j aircraft for the air force and 375 million for ea18g electronic warfare aircraft for the navy questionable emergency requirements since the equipment ordered would not be delivered for about three years and hence not available for current operations 53 partly in response to congressional scepticism and partly because of the need to provide funds for support troops for the presidents surge dod withdrew these requests in its amended submit on march 9 200754

ongoing programs that predate oefoif operations congre ss largely approved these requests many of which were also funded in the fy2007 bridge for example the fy2007 supplemental included 520 million

million in bridge 573 million for family of heavy tactical vehicles 648 million in bridge 300 million for marine corps radio systems 189 million cut 850 million in bridge and 45 million for family of construction vehicles 98 million in bridge while front loading reset requirements may relieve funding pressures in later years it does not take into account the uncertainty in requirements uncertainty acknowledged by dod in report to congress last fall 55 although it is to be expected that reset requirements will grow as equipment is stressed by operations the validity of specific requests has not been substantiated recently gao testified that until fy2007 the army could not track reset expenditures sufficiently to ensure that funds appropriated for reset were in fact spent for that purpose56

determine the accuracy of its previous projections of when and how frequently particular items break down and need repair or replacement in order to assess the validity of its current estimates such information could be useful to congress in assessing dods fy2008 war cost request reset requirements may also be uncertain because the number of troops and intensity of operations may change in an estimate in the spring of 2006 the army projected that reset requirements would decrease from 13 billion year to 105 billion year for the next two years and then decline to 2 billion year if tr oops were withdrawn over twoyear period 57 other previous estimates of cost were also lower in march 2005 for example cbo estimated that annual repair and replacement costs would run about 8 billion year for all four services about 6 billion to 7 billion for the army and marine corps based on the thencurrent pace of operations and service data estimates far lower than dods current requests 58

provided 253 billion in procurement funds 500 million more than the administrations request and about 800 million above house and senate recommendations although congress largely endorsed dods request for procurement and reset or reconstitution the validity of reset estimates appears to be resurfacing during consideration of the fy2008 war costs as the authorizing committees question whether some items are in fact warrelated emergencies 59 despite approval of most funding conference and committee reports in both houses voiced concern and made cuts to some individual programs deemed not legitimately emergencies or war related characterizing certain items as premature or unexecutable within dods 12 month standard or as more appropriate to dods baseline rather than warrelated emergencies the senate cut 12 billion from the procurement request and the house cut 758 million 60 responding to congressional scepticism the administration eliminated some of the items considered unjustifiable for an emergency request such as six new ea18 electronic warfare aircraft and two jsf aircraft that would not be delivered for two or three years in its amended request at the same time

billion for national guard and reserve equipment to meet reported shortages as recommended by the senate with the remaining 600 million to be spent at dods discretion 63 signaling that action is urgent the secretary of defense is required to identify transfers within 120 days as well as provide 30day advance notifications to the congressional defense committees although the funds would be

readiness concern is the short tim between tours faced by some units according to dod testimony and reports some activeduty units are deploying to iraq with year or less of dwell time at home between tours far short of dods goalsone year deployed two years at home congress approved two dod initiatives that are intended to expand the rotation base that supports deployed unitsthe accelerated creation of modular units and expanding the size of the army and marine corps dod has again argued that accelerating its peacetime plans to convert army and marine corps units to new standard configurationsknown as modularity and restructuringshould be considered war cost because it is expected to reduce pressure on the rotation base by making more units available for deployments in th fy2005 and fy2006 supplementals congress with some reluctance agreed to provide 5 billion each year to convert units with the understanding that dod would move these funds back to its regular budget in later years this funding of modularity effectively gave the army an additional 5 billion for two years for other baseline requirements to implement this decision dod set aside 25 billion for army modularity5 billion year for five yearsin the future years defense plan its budget planning document 65 the fy2007 supplemental however again requested 36 billion to convert two army brigade teams to the new modular design and to create ad ditional marine corps battalions costs include 900 million for military personnel 300 million for om 23 billion for procurement and 100 million for military construction66 congress was again asked to finance reorganization of the army and the marine corps with supplemental rather than regular defense funds although dod identified the two army brigades and the three marine corps infantry battalions to be converted to meet deployments planned for fy2008fy2010 dod did not say how dwell time for units would increase because of modularity instead the army said that the acceleration would put the army on the path to meeting its goal of two years at home and one year deployed and would contribute to better ratio for the marine corps thus reducing stress on individuals and ultimately improving readiness67 previous studies by both cbo and the rand found that modularity would only marginally improve force rotation schedules suggesting that the entire modularity initiative would only make available an additional 6000 to 7000 troops68 dod is requesting an additional 16 billion for fy2008 gwot costs to accelerate the conversion of more units based on

at some indefinite time in the future is president bushs decision in january to endorse permanent increases to the size of the army and marine corps the activeduty army is slated to grow from its prewar strength of 482000 to 547000 and the marine corps from 175000 to 202000 by 2012 increases of 65000 and 27000 respectively until this year dod argued that the cost of the additional 30000 troops added since 911 should be funded in emergency supplementals because the increases were strictly warrelated and temporary and dod would eventually return to prewar levels some members of congress argued that these increases should be permanent in january 2007 the president announced plans to permanently increase the size of the army and marine corps by 92000 over the next six years to meet the needs of the long war on terror this proposal to add permanently to the size of the force marks major change in administration policy it is not clear however that this expansion will have significant effect on reducing current stress on troops because most of the additional forces would not be available until 2012 or 2013 at that time the us military presence in iraq is likely to be considerably lower instead it reflects new more demanding requirement that the united states be able to deploy troops at todays levels in major stability operations even with lower requirements in iraq and afghanistan in the fy2007 supplemental congress appears to have approved the 49 billion to cover the military personnel cost of additional troops plus 17 billion for equipment and infrastructure for the forces to be added in fy2007 and following years 11 billion in procurement and 600 million in military construction the fy2007 s upplemental promises that dod will start to include the cost of higher personnel levels in the regular base budgets of the army and marine corps starting in fy2009 69 recently cbo estimated that the presidents proposal to add 92000 active duty forces would cost 108 billion between fy2007 and fy201370 although congress endorsed these costs as emergency expenses in the fy2007 supplemental this issue is being revisited in dods fy2008 war costs where the senate armed services committee considers these expenses part of the base budget71 house proposal to cut om by 815 million for contractor efficiencies was dropped in the final version instead responding to concerns about the 125000 contractors in iraq conferees set an 85 limit on om funding until dod submits report on the use of contracts and contractor personnel in the war zone that is due to the

for pay and operations supports about 320000 troops conducting oif and oef operations including about 140000 in iraq and 20000 in afghanistan72 the 320000 figure for the number of deployed military personnel is higher than generally cited by dod witnesses and presumably includes not only boots on the ground but about 110000 additional troops deployed in the region or for other counter terror operations and another 50000 activated reservists in the united states who are either training up to deploy backfilling positions for activeduty troops or providing enhanced security at defense installations 73 the presidents surge proposal added about another 36000 troops for total of about 355000 the administrations guidance and initiatives to accelerate unit conversions and expand the size of the army and marine corps suggest that dod is also now planning for long war on terror rather than strictly operations in iraq and afghanistan dods original request also included 300 million for regional war on terror for counterterrorism operations outside of iraq and afghanistan in the phillippines and other unspecified countries dod dropped this request in its amended request in march however suggesting that the funds would be found elsewhere 74 another indication that dod is anticipating requirement for substantial deployments in future years was its request for 500 million in the supplemental to expand its inventory of spare and repair parts congress did not object to these funds this may also be another reflection of dods decision to expand the scope of costs permitted in supplemental requests to include costs of the long war on terror rather than strictly oif and oef costs

administration requests for new authority and funding that would allow dod to carry out veral new tasks with foreign policy as well as military implications for example congress approved re quests to restart iraqi factories and allow dod to assist iraq to disarm militias but turned down requests to train pakistani border police since the 911 attacks dod has expanded these types of authorities through new forms of military aid eg coalition support to reimburse pakistan and jordan who conduct operations in support of oif and oef and through the training and equipping of afghan and iraqi police as well as military forces perhaps recognizing the foreign policy implications congress has sometimes added requirements for state department concurrence in decisionmaking in the fy2007 supplemental congress endorsed 50 million to restart businesses in iraq halving the request 1555 million to provide assistance to the government of iraq to disarm demobilize and reintegrate militias and illegal armed groups contingent upon state department concurrence 77 200 million in additional coalition support funds to reimburse allies conducting operations in support of oif and oef cut of 100 million and approved 300 million for lift and sustain funds to sustain foreign forces in iraq and afghanistan as requested and agreed to provide 110 million in economic assistance from dod funds to be transferred to the state department at the same time congress denied dods request for 715 million to train the pakistani border police in the federally administered tribal areas in pakistan paramilitary force 50 million for global lift and sustain to provide funds to allies participating in combined operations to combat terrorism in countries other than iraq or afghanistan such as the phillippines and djibouti and 300 million for global train and equip funds to build the capacity of countries facing terrorism or counterinsurgency threats but encouraged dod to submit reprogramming

congress was under pressure from the army to pass supplementals quickly in order to ensure that the army would have enough funds to meet both its wartime and peacetime operations the fy2006 supplemental was enacted in midjune 2006 which the army claimed created considerable management problems because the army had to cash flow or temporarily finance war costs by tapping funds from its regular budget slated to be spent at the end of the fiscal year as well as transferring funds from other accounts in early april the army revised its earlier estimate that the supplemental needed to be enacted by the end of april instead its revised estimates showed the army could last until the end of june with recentlyapproved 16 billion transfer and slowdown in obligations in april may and

funds provided the army with additional funds to finance its operating costs using new army data crs estimated like the army that army om costs could be covered until the end of june 2007 with the current slowdown and the 16 billion transfer if nece ssary the army could also have requested additional transfers from the 46 billion in transfer authority that was available at that time in order to finance operations through three weeks of july though the army argued this would considerably disrupt ongoing activities this would have required however that the army use all army operation and maintenance funds in its regular fy2007 budget all om war funds in the fy2007 bridge fund and exhaust its transfer authority by moving funds from military personnel procurement rdte or other areas to army operations 80 using much or all dods transfer authority could reduce or eliminate dod flexibility to move funds between accounts after enactment for other higher priority needs making it

recent years supplemental appropriations have become significant source of additional funds for international affairs 150 account programs at time when regular appropriations have been constrained by budget pressures supplemental funding has been used not only to support expanded us efforts in iraq and afghanistan but also to respond to international crises and natural disasters in response there has been some criticism that the administration has relied too heavily on supplementals and that some items should be incorporated into the regular appropriations cycle the administration counters that given the nature of rapidly changing overseas events and unforeseen contingencies it is necessary to make supplemental requests for unexpected and non recurring expenses since fy1999 after the

funding of the nearly 6 billion for international affairs spending 48 billion was proposed for foreign assistance programs while 118 billion would fund state department operations public diplomacy and

afghanistan the supplemental request for iraq is in addition to 749 million requested in the fy2007 regular budget for total of 3 billion 82 other significant bilateral assistance funding was requested for kosovo lebanon and sudan additional supplemental funds for humanitarian assistance migration assistance peacekeeping operations and food aid were also sought for number of countries the

and international broadcasting the house fy2007 supplemental bill included total of 634 billion501 billion for foreign assistance and 133 billion for the state department operations and international broadcasting this represents about 347 million more than the administrations supplemental request for international affairs accounts the senate fy2007 supplemental bill included total of about 625 billion51 billion for foreign assistance and 115 billion for state department operations and international broadcasting 82 because the fy2007 continuing resolution pl 109289 as amended by pl 1105 was enacted late in the fiscal year estimates of country level funding are not yet available for fy2007 this analysis is based on the fy2007 request as iraq and afghanistan are considered critical programs by the administration and because the cr did not contain specific limitations on funds to iraq and afghanistan it is reasonable to assume that final levels will be similar to the request

projects that can be implemented with us funding and at the same time they seek to strengthen the capacity of iraqi officials to meet local needs in essence the new strategy envisions that as us and iraqi military forces clear an area of baghdad or anbar province prt staff would immediately work with local iraqis to further stabilize the area by drawing on all available spigots of us and iraqi government funding to create jobs and meet other basic needs the presidents plan would increase prts in baghdad from one to six and in anbar province from one to three to enhance us civilian staff security and improve program effectiveness greater effort would be made to integrate us ci vilian teams with us military battalions the militarys cerp and usaids community stabilization program csp

claims that local iraqis are too intimidated by insurgent threats to meet with us staff the state departments coordinator for iraq david satterfield asserts that the sigir views on this issue do not reflect current reality85 most observers however would not dispute that the ability of us and iraqi troops to secure and hold new areas of operation is key to the success of expanded civilian prt

could not be recruited however the sigir has suggested that the need for required specialized skills for such posts as local government economic and agricultural advisers is still not being fully met with this approach although secretary rice has asserted that most positions are filled it has been reported that about 129 of the new prt posts are going to be occupied temporarily by military
