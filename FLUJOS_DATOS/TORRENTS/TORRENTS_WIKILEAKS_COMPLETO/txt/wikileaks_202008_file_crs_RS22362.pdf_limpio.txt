law allows recruiters to inform students about the military opportunities available to them nd eases the task of recruiting volunteers to sustain the nations military forces on the other hand opponents contend that the provisions raise concerns about student privacy and should be changed to make it easier to opt out3 currently 95 of the countrys school districts are estimated to be complying with the new requirements4 although it is important to note that traditionally most schools had already allowed military recruiters to contact students long before the nclba provisions became mandatory5 the new nclba military recruitment provisi ons require high schools that receive federal funds to meet two re quirements first such sc hools must provide on request made by military recruiters access to secondary school stude nts names addresses and telephone listings6 and second schools must provide military recruiters the same access to secondary school students as is provide d generally to post secondary educational institutions or to prospective employers of those students7 schools that fail to comply with either of these two requirements acce ss to student information or equal access to students themselves risk losing federal f unds however private secondary schools that maintain religious objection to military service are exempt from the recruitment provisions8 access to student information as noted above schools must when re quested provide military recruiters with information concerning student names ddresses and telephone numbers unlike more personal information such as social security numbers this type of data is not protected by the family educational rights and privacy act ferpa9 which currently allows the release of student director information in the absen ce of parental objections10 thus even before the nclba provisions were enacte d such student contact information was potentially available to outside entitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22362crs3 11 id at 7908a2 12 aratani supra note 5 at b1 13 id see also michael dobbs schools and military face off privacy rights clash with required release of student information wash post june 19 2005 at a3 14 20 usc 7908a3 15 dobbs supra note 13 at a3like ferpa the nclba also provides th opportunity to opt out of the provisions requiring the release of directory information to military recruiters under the nclba students or their parents may request that the students directory information not be released without prior written consent in ddition the local educational agency or private school must notify parents of thei r right to make such request11 schools appear to have interp reted these opt out provisions in variety of ways for example some schools have as part of thei r compliance with an array of privacy laws issued general notice informing parents that they can opt out of the release of student contact information while othe r schools have issued separa and more explicit notice informing parents that such information may be released to the military for recruitment purposes if the parents do not opt out both of these types of notice appear to meet the statutory requirement regarding informing parents of their right to opt out but recipients of the latter type of notice may be more likely to exercise that option as result the type of notice that school elects to provi has been subject of debate12 in addition the notification provision has become controversial in part because schools have interpreted parental responses in different wa ys for example if parents fail to respond to the notice informing them of thei r right to opt out of the release of student information some schools interpret the lack of response as indicating that the parent does not wish to opt out while other schools interpre t lack of response as signifying that the parent does want to opt out as result so interest groups have pressed legislators to clarify the law with regard to this point13 equal access to students in addition to requiring schools to provide access to student information the nclba also requires schools to provide access to st udents themselves specifically schools must provide military recruiters the same access to students as is otherwise provided to other recruiters such as private employers or institutions of higher education14 as with the notification provisions schools have implemented the equal access provisions in variety of ways for example some schools allow extensive access permittin g recruiters to set up information tables visit classrooms and freely approach students anywhere on campus other schools permit lesser degree of access and some restrict military access even further by forbidding information tabl requiring appointments before recruiters can meet students and ot herwise limiting access to campus15 despite these variations in school policy schools are allowed to place as many or as few restrictions as they wish on military recruiters as long as schools treat ch recruiters the same way they treat other entities that wish to contact studentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22362crs4 16

nclba military recruitment provisions have raised legal concerns bout the new requirements in particular so critics have questioned whether the recruitment provisions violate students right to privacy but neither statutory nor constitutional analysis appears to support this argument indeed from statutory perspective the nclba provi sions regarding releas of student contact information are as noted above entirely cons istent with ferpa the longstanding law that protects the educational privacy rights of students likewise the nclba military recruitment provisions for the reasons discussed below do not appear to raise constitutional concerns under the auspices of the fourteenth amendment16 the supreme court has recognized that there is constitutional right to privacy that protects against certain governmental disclosures of personal information17 but it has not established the standard for measuring such violation in the abse nce of explicit standard s the circuit courts have tended to establish series of balancing tests that weigh the competing privacy interests and government interests in order to determine when information privacy violations occur18 in falvo ex rel pletan v owasso i ndependent school district i011 19 the court of appeals for the tenth circuit weighed the plaintiffs claim that peer grading and the practice of calling out grades in class resulted in an impermissible release of her childs education records in violation of ferpa the plaintiff also claimed that the practice of peer grading violated her childs constitutiona l right to privacy although the court in holding that was later reve rsed by the supreme court20 ruled that the practice of peer grading violated ferpa the tenth circuit nied the plaintiffs constitutional claim in rejecting this claim the court applied threepa rt balancing test that considers 1 if the party asserting the right has legitimate expectation of privacy 2 if disclosure serves compelling state interest and 3 if disclosure can be made in the least intrusive manner21 based on the first prong of this test the tenth circuit rej ected the plaintiffs constitutional claim because it ruled that stude nts school work and test grades were not highly personal matters that deserved constitutional protection22 like peer graded student homework assi gnments the release of student names addresses and lephone numbers to military recruiters would probably not be viewed by court as violating students constitutional right to privacy under such balancing testhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22362crs5 23 us const art i 8 cl 1 24

challenges to the nclba military recruitment provisions revealed resultsunlike social security numbers or medical reco rds for example it is unlikely that court would hold that individuals have legitimate expectation of privacy in the type of basic contact information that is typically found in phone book furthermore the government could argue persuasively that the release of such information serves compelling state interest in facilitating the maintenance of the nations armed forces finally court would probably view the disclo sure required by the nclba as minimally intrusive given that students can either opt out of the information release or decline to join the military or both ultimately court reviewing any privacy based challenge to the nclba military recruitment provisions would be likely to reject such claim especially in light of the fact that congress was clearly acting within the scope of its constitutional authority when it enacted the military recruitment provisions of the nclba under the spending clause of the constitution23 congress frequently promotes its policy goals by conditioning the receipt of federal funds on state compliance with certain requirements indeed the supreme court has repeat edly upheld against cons titutional challenge the use of this technique to induce governments and private pa rties to cooperate vol untarily with federal policy24 and the court recently reaffirmed this principle when in response to first amendment challenge it uphe ld similar military recruitment provisions that apply to colleges that receive federal funds25 thus the court would likely uphold the nclba provisions in part on the basis of congre ssional authority under the spending clause26
