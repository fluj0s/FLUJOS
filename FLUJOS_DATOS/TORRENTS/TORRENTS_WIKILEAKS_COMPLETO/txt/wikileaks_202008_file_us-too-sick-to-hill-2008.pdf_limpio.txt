the centcom aor including list of medical conditions that may be sufficient to deny medical clearance for or to disapprove deployment ofa service member civilian employee volunteer or contractors employee the list of deployment limiting conditions is not comprehensive there are many more conditions that could be cause to deny medical clearance for deployment possession of one or more ofthe conditions listed in this chapter does not automatically mean that the individual may not deploy rather it imposes the requirement to obtain knowledgeable physicians opinion as to the deployability status of the individual medical conditions as used here also include those health conditions usually referred to as dental oral psychological andor emotional uniformed service members will be evaluated for fitness according to service regulations and policies in addition to the guidance in the parent ppg modification mod the services parent regulations are as follows army ar 40501

comdtinst m6000lb the under secretary ofdefense memorandum titled policy guidance for medical deferral pending deployment to theaters of operation dated 09 feb 06 and assistant secretary ofdefense memorandum titled policy guidance for deploymentlimiting psychiatric conditions and medications dated 07 nov 06 are also useful references 2 the medical authority evaluating personnel for deployment must bear in mind the following facts medical care in theater is not as robust and amply available as that in the continental us ifmaintaining an individuals health requires frequent or intense medical management andor specialist care laboratory testing or ancillary services they should not deploy the individual must take all required medications and medical supplies with him or her replacements may not be available in theater medical maintenance support for personal medical devices is not available common household electrical current llov ac is not universally or consistently available in addition to the individuals duties the environmental conditions include extremes of temperature physiologic demand water mineral salt and heat management and poor air quality especially particulates while the operating conditions impose extremes of diet to include fat salt and caloric levels discomfort sleep deprivation emotional stress and circadian disruption ifmaintning an individuals health requires avoidance ofthese extremes or excursions shehe should not deploy 3 the rules and facts listed in 2 should assist the evaluating medical authority to make qualified judgements as to whether condition is deployable any medical condition that markedly impairs an individuals daily function is grounds for disapproval evaluation of functional capacity to determine fitness in conditions ofphysiologic demand is encouraged to make decision such as graded exercise testing when there is coronary artery disease or significant risk thereof the evaluating care provider should pay special attention to hematologic cardiovascular pulmonary orthopedic neurological endocrine dermatological psychological visual and auditory conditions which may present hazard to the individual or others andor preclude performing functional requirements in the deployed setting also the amount ofmedications being taken and their suitability and availability in the theater environment must be considered 4 nothing in this guidance document should be construed as authorizing use ofdefense health program or military health system resources for such evaluations ifit is not elsewhere previously authorized generally defense health program or military health system resources are not authorizel for the purpose ofpredeployment or travel medicine evaluations for contractor employees local command legal and resource management authorities should be consulted for questions on this matter 5 shipboard operations that are not anticipated to involve operations ashore are exempt from the deploymentlimiting medical conditions listed below and will follow service specific guidance 6 the general guidance from mod 9 section 15b applies to all personnel uniformed service members government civilian employees volunteers and contractor employees deploying to theater must be medically and psychologically fit for deployment and possess current periodic health assessment or physical fitness specifically includes the ability to accomplish the tasks and duties unique to particular operation and ability to tolerate the environmental and operational conditions ofthe deployed location b personnel who have existing medical conditions may deploy if 1 an approved medical waiver law section 15b3 is documented in the medical record 2 and all ofthe following conditions are met the conditions isare not of such nature that an unexpected worsening or physical trauma is likely to have medically grave outcome b the conditions isare stable that is currently under medical care and reasonably anticipated by the predeployment medical evaluator not to worsen during the deployment under available care in theater in light of physical physiological psychological and nutritional impacts and effects ofthe duties location and limited medical capabilities at the location c any required ongoing health care or medications must be available in theater within the military health system for dod personnel or the contractor health care system for contingency contractor personnel unless specifically authorized in the contracting officers letter ofauthorization and the synchronized predeployment operational tracker database and have special handling storage or other requirements eg refrigerationcold chain electrical power etc d need or anticipation ofduty limitations that preclude performance ofduty or an accommodation imposed by the medical condition there is need for routine evacuation out of theater for continuing diagnostics or other evaluations all such evaluations must be accomplished prior to deployment 7 documented medical conditions precluding medical clearance the medical evaluator must carefully consider whether the climate altitude nature ofavailable food and housing availability ofmedical behavioral health dental surgical and laboratory services or whether other environmental and operational factors may be hazardous to the deploying persons health because ofa known physical condition medical clearance to deploy with any ofthe following documented medical conditions may be granted law mod 9 section 15b ifpersonnel who are obviously medically unfit for deployment are found deployed contact the centcom surgeon with details ofthe case list of all possible diagnoses and their severity that may cause an individual to be nondeployable would be too expansive in general individuals with the following conditions based on an individual assessment as per dodi 649003 should not deploy conditions which prevent the wear ofpersonal protective equipment including protective mask ballistic helmet body armor and chemicalbiological protective garments regardless of the nature of the condition that causes the inability b conditions which prohibit required theater immunizations other than smallpox anthrax per current guidance or medications such as antimalarials chemical and biological antidotes and other chemoprophylactic antibiotics c any chronic medical condition that requires frequent clinical visits that fails to respond to adequate conservative treatment necessitates significant limitation
