and purpose 3 definition kill box is threedimens ional fire support coordinating measure 4 fscm used to facilitate the expeditious air tosurface lethal attack of targets which 5 may be augmented by or integrated with rfacetosurface indirect fires while kill 6 boxes are permissive fscms with respect to the deliverance of airtosurface weapons 7 they are also restrictive in nature trajectori and effects of surfacetosurface indirect 8 fires are not normally allowed to pass throug h the kill box kill box is unique fscm 9 that may contain other measures within its boundaries eg nofire areas nfas 10 restricted operations area roas airspace c oordination areas acas etc restrictive 11 fscms and airspace control measures acms will always have priority when 12 established in kill box 13 b purpose when established the primary purpose of kill box is to allow air 14 assets to conduct interdiction against surf ace targets without further coordination with 15 the establishing commander and without termi nal attack control kill box will not be 16 established specifically for close air support cas missions however this does not 17 restrict cas missions inside of established ki ll boxes if all cas requirements are met 18 when used to integrate airtosurface and rfacetosurface indirect fires the kill box 19 will have appropriate restrictions the goal is to reduce the coordination required to 20 fulfill support requirements with maximum fl exibility while preventing fratricide 21 22 2 establishment 23 kill box is established and adjusted by component commanders in consultation 24 with superior subordinate supporting and affected commanders and is an extension of 25 an existing support relationship established by the joint force commander jfc kill 26 box boundaries normally are defined using an area reference system eg appendix 27 common geographic reference system cgr s but could follow well defined terrain 28 features or may be located by grid coordinat or by radius from center point 29 changes in the status of established kill bo xes as with other fscms andor airspace 30 control measures acms must be coordinated as far in advance as possible all joint 31 force coordinating agencies must inform thei r forces of the effective times and locations 32 of new fscms andor acms following the direction to execute the change the 33 component operations cells should confirm th changes to ensure that affected forces are 34 aware of new fscm andor acm locations and that associated positive control 35 measures are being followed the two type s of kill boxes and the terminology used 36 during the life cycle of kill box are defined below 37 blue kill box blue kill box permits airtosurface fires in the kill box without 38 further coordination with the establishing headquarters 39 i2 b purple kill box same as above plus purple kill box permits the integration 1 of surfacetosurface indirect fires with ai rtosurface fires into the purple kill box 2 without further coordination with the establishing headquarters 3 c life cycle of kill box terminology figure i1 4 1 established term used to describe kill box that is in effect either planned 5 via the joint targeting cycle or immediate duri ng execution information about the time 6 it becomes established the duration and other attributes will be published and 7 disseminated using existing voice and digita l command and control c2 systems eg 8 automated deep operations coordination sy stem adocs advanced field artillery 9 tactical data system afatds theater ba ttle management core system tbmcs or 10 fragmentary order frag order from the establishing headquarters hq 11 open term used to describe portion or portions of kill box that are 12 open to fires without further coordination or deconfliction an established kill box is 13 inherently open until closed or cancelled 14 active an established kill box that has aircraft flying in the 15 space defined by the box or effects of air or other joint fires within the boundaries of the 16 kill box 17 cold an established kill box that is not active all portions of the 18 kill box are open to fires unless identified as closed 19 b closed term used to describe portion or portions of an established 20 kill box in which fires or effects of fires are not allowed without further coordination 21 2 cancelled the kill box is longer in effect 22 d area reference system primarily an operationallevel administrative 23 measure used to coordinate geographic area s rapidly for battlespa ce deconfliction and 24 synchronization this reference system provides common language between the 25 components and simplifies communications eg appendix common geographic 26 reference system and jp 360 joint doctri ne for targeting appendix d common 27 reference systems area and point 28 note combatant commanders will define the naming convention for the 29 employment of kill boxes within their area of responsibility aor 30 i3figure i1 life cycle of kill box 1 3 employment 2 kill boxes are normally used when support relationship already exists between 3 two or more functional or service components the goal is to reduce the coordination 4 required to fulfill support requirements with maximum flexibility while preventing 5 fratricide figure i2 6 kill boxes support the commanders objectives and concept of operations 7 conops as such all target engagement s within kill box must adhere to the 8 establishing commanders designated target priorities effects and timing of fires 9 b use of kill boxes is not mandatory 10 c c2 updates on kill boxes will be acco mplished eg altitude restrictions 11 frequency use established control measures within the kill box via appropriate c2 12 systems 13 d it is important to note that establishing kill box is similar to establishing 14 target this step only identifies an area where effects are desired additional action is 15 required to identify and task assets to conduct attacks in this kill box those actions 16 will be conducted within the standard join t and service targeting cycles and in 17 conjunction with the air tasking cycle 18 kill box cancelled life cycle of kill box ab12 ab12i need kill

surfacetosurface direct fires however are not restricted by the establishment 12 of kill box 13 h all available aircraft will be tasked on the daily air tasking order ato with 14 either scheduled or oncall missions aircraft to be used to conduct interdiction missions 15 in kill boxes should normally come from the same mission set most likely the oncall 16 interdiction missions without specific targets alternately kill boxes may be used as 17 target locations for preplanned request s for scheduled and oncall missions 18 i the first forward air controller airborn faca strike coordination and

hq dtg ii1chapter ii 1 kill box planning and development considerations 2 1 general 3 the jfc establishes detailed procedures and conops for successful kill box 4 employment within the joint operations area joa by promulgating guidance and 5 priorities additionally the jfc norma lly delegates to component commanders the 6 authority to establish and adjust kill boxes in consultation with superior subordinate 7 supporting and affected commanders comp onent commanders may further delegate 8 that authority the establishing commander is responsible for coordinating with and 9 notifying all affected forces 10 note for the purposes of this publication and the procedures described the 11 establishing commander is component commander eg jfacc jflcc 12 jfmcc or jfsocc 13 b an area reference system facilitates th structural and procedural requirements 14 for using kill boxes but it is not an absolute requirement 15 c kill box procedures will not be ideal for every situation considerations of 16 mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support availabletime available 17 mettt army adds civil considerations an d requirements for term inal attack control 18 may determine that other procedur would be more effective 19 20 2 planning considerations 21 kill boxes can be applied to different po rtions of the battlespace including rear 22 areas to facilitate expeditious target engagement also the kill box may be an 23 applicable tool where traditional coordination measures eg fscl do not exist or have 24 not been established kill boxes can be us ed in conjunction with existing fscms 25 b the component commanders must be able to communicate kill box status in 26 timely manner this will ensure systems and organization databases are updated the 27 architecture and means by which this information is disseminated should be identified 28 early in the planning process it must accommodate both planned and immediate kill 29 boxes communications methods may include joint and multinational digital and voice 30 systems units responsible for input of kill box status as well as the primary and 31 secondary systems which the information will be passed must be identified to ensure 32 timely dissemination of kill box status 33 c establishing kill box requires careful pl anning and coordination some of the 34 considerations for successful planning are 35 1 commanders guidance and intent 36 2 targeting priorities 37 3 intelligence preparation of the battlespace 38 ii2 4 location of other fscms and acms 1 5 conops and scheme of maneuver kill bo xes should not impede or adversely 2 impact the scheme of maneuver kill boxes are intended to facilitate rapid 3 engagement of targets in conjunction with the commanders concept of operation 4 6 friendly locations and capabilities including sof and other government 5 agencies ogas 6 restrictive fire support coordination measures eg restricted fire area 7 rfa nfa or closed portion of kill box take precedence over kill boxes in order to 8 protect friendly forces on the ground 9 b the burden of friendly deconfliction is the responsibility of the 10 establishing headquarters the establishing headquarters is also responsible for 11 clearance of fires within the kill box 12 c consider the impact on the range and trajectory of surfacetosurface 13 indirect fires 14 d surfacetoair fires responsiveness could be reduced due to additional 15 coordination requirements 16 weapons release may occur outside the confines of the kill box where 17 effects are intended special considerat ions may be required for certain standoff 18 weapons such as tomahawk land attack missiles tlams or conventional air 19 launched cruise missiles calcms with respect to flight path deconfliction 20 7 communication kill box frequencies must be considered in the development 21 of the communications plan and communication nets between c2 and fire assets must 22 be clearly established ideally there will be frequency associated with specific kill 23 box this will enable the assets entering the kill box to have common frequency for 24 coordination as the number of kill boxes established increases the available number of 25 frequencies decreases and reduces flexibility 26 8 roe target engagement within an tablished kill box must still adhere to 27 applicable elements of theater roe eg roe for air integration planners at the joint 28 and component level should determine if the current roe are appropriate or unduly 29 restricts target engagement within kill boxes and should request appropriate roe 30 adjustments as required 31 9 restrictions planners developing kill boxes must be aware that there are 32 many constraints and restrictions that may impact how operations are executed within 33 the kill box such restrictions could includ requirements regarding cd pid restricted 34 target list rtl or nostrike list nsl these restrictions will be published in the 35 appropriate conops andor spins 36 37 3 kill box development 38 kill boxes are tools for coordinating fires but they are not the only tools 39 commanders retain at their disposal their full range of fscms and acms to manage 40 the battlespace 41 ii31 planned planned kill box is developed du ring the planning process ie 1 joint targeting cycle air tasking cycle litary decision making process

vary 12 2 immediate an immediate kill box is developed and established during the 13 execution phase of an operation immediat kill boxes are established by the current 14 operations sections within each command and disseminated via appropriate means 15 voice and digital to ensure visibility across the joint force if the establishing 16 commander needs to establish kill box t hat cannot be promulgated through planning 17 documents heshe calls their liaison element such as battlefield coordination 18 detachment bcd or goes through the dire ct air support center dascair support 19 operations center asoc to inform the joint air operations center jaoc that kill box 20 was established and the time it will be open c2 systems must be updated to reflect the 21 new fscm 22 3 onorder an onorder kill box is planned without specific time for it to be 23 established the establishment may be triggered by an events this kill box may have 24 restrictions listed but more likely specific coordination for this kill box will occur with 25 the notification to change its status to current 26 note for detailed procedures for estab lishing kill boxes see appendix c 27 b while kill boxes are permissive fscms wi th respect to the delivery of airto 28 surface weapons they are also restrictive in nature trajectories and effects of surface 29 tosurface indirect fires are not allowed to pass through blue kill box also airto 30 surface munitions and their trajectories deliv ered by aircraft not assigned to the kill 31 box are not permitted to pass through an ctive kill box unless coordinated with the 32 designated controlling authority all aircraft not assigned to operate within kill box 33 are restricted from flying through an ctive kill box without permission of the 34 designated controlling authority 35 c the primary purpose of permissive measures is to facilitate the attack of targets 36 permissive measures require further tailed coordination for the engagement of 37 targets with conventional means restrictive measures eg restrictive fire line rfa 38 and nfa impose requirements for specific c oordination before engagement of targets 39 for example aircraft cannot drop on an established nfa and must abide by the 40 confines of an aca however kill box may ta ke priority over permissive fscms for 41 example fscl that crosses an established kill box does not automatically close that 42 kill box 43 d engagement authority is automatically granted by the establishment of kill 44 box but does not relieve the aircrew of the responsibility for complying with 45 ii4 requirements such as commanders designat ed target priority pid cd roe and 1 spins 2 3 4 blue kill box 4 primary purpose the primary purpose of blue kill box is to permit airto 5 surface fires in the kill box without further c oordination or deconfliction figure ii1 if 6 the kill box is active airtosurface muniti ons and their trajectories delivered by 7 aircraft not assigned to the blue kill box need to be c oordinated all aircraft not 8 assigned to an active blue kill box are re stricted from flying through it unless 9 coordinated with the kill box coordinator kbc the airspace included by blue kill 10 box extends from the surface up to the limit established by the airspace control 11 authority 12 note ordnance may be delivered from outs ide the airspace defined by the kill box 13 to include standoff surfacetosurface indirect and airtosurface weapons 14 figures ii1 and ii2 15 b permits rapid engagement blue kill box minimizes the restrictions on air 16 tosurface fires while also protecting aircraft effects and trajectories of surfaceto 17 surface indirect fires are not allowed to pa ss through the blue kill box land and 18 maritime force commanders must coordinate wi th the air component to deliver surface 19 tosurface indirect fires into or through an established blue kill box the primary 20 purpose of permissive measures is to fac ilitate the attack of targets permissive 21 measures require further detailed coordi nation for the engagement of targets with 22 conventional means restrictive measures im pose requirements for specific coordination 23 before engagement of targets 24 ii5 figure ii1 notional blue kill box 1 5 purple kill box 2 primary purpose the primary purpose of purple kill box is to reduce the 3 coordination requirements for airtosurfa ce fires while still allowing surface 4 component commanders to employ surfacetosur face indirect fires the purple kill box 5 allows the maximum use of joint fires in the kill box creating synergistic effect and 6 maximum potential for engaging targets 7 b permits integration of fires purple kill box permits the integration of 8 surfacetosurface indirect fires with airtos urface fires into the purple kill box without 9 further coordination figure ii2 airtosurfa ce and surfacetosurface indirect fires can 10 be deconflicted by altitude lateral or time separation the establishing headquarters 11 will coordinate with the air component to defi ne the appropriate deconfliction technique 12 for operations within the purple kill box all aircraft not assigned to an active purple 13 kill box are restricted from flying through it unless coordinated also airtosurface 14 munitions and their trajectories delivered by aircraft not assigned to the kill box will 15 not violate the purple kill box unless coordi nated ground units subordinate to the 16 establishing commander are required to obta in clearance from the air component for 17 any surfacetosurface indirect fires when their trajectories will violate the altitude 18 lateral or time restrictions ground units from other components must coordinate fires 19 with the establishing commander as well 20 c deconfliction

kill boxes 3 kill box execution begins with the establishment of kill box by component 4 commander and is dependant on two factors the method by which kill box is 5 established either planned or immediate and types of fires to be delivered either 6 integrated surfacetosurface indirect and air tosurface fires purple kill boxes or pure 7 airtosurface fires blue kill boxes 8 9 2 establishment and cancellation of kill box 10 kill box establishment and adjustment requires the establishing commander to 11 conduct detailed coordination and dissemi nation of information with superior 12 subordinate supporting and affected command ers within the joa the establishment 13 of planned or immediate kill boxes will use existing theater command control 14 communications and computer systems during execution communications nets 15 between c2 and air assets providing airtos urface fires will be clearly established and 16 used to terminate operations in timely manner if necessary 17 b component commanders initiate the establishment of kill box through their 18 operational c2 organization the recommended request format is provided in figure iii 19 1 they will coordinate their action with the airspace control authority who is 20 typically but not always the joint fo rce air component commander jfacc 21 coordination will include consultation with the jfaccs representatives on the

complex as performing scar at 4 minimum this coordination must deconfli ct flight paths and weapons deliveries 5 the functions associated with kill box coordination should not be confused with 6 those of the faca facas are direct extension of tactical air control party 7 tacp or joint terminal attack controllers j tac and specifically facilitate the conduct 8 of cas flights providing kill box

targeting appendix d introduces an area reference 5 system this appendix is more detailed ex planation of the process involved in creating 6 and using an area reference system based primarily on uscentcoms model during 7 operation oif 8 b cgrs is reference system based on lines of latitude lat and longitude 9 long which is established by jfc to provide an integrated common frame of 10 reference for joint force situational awar eness to facilitate attack coordination 11 deconfliction integration and synchronizat ion this reference system provides 12 common language between the components and simplifies communications cgrs 13 has proven highly useful in coordinating and facilitating rapid attacks on timesensitive 14 targets tsts the usefulness of cgrs is that it enables establishment of 15 appropriate control and coordination measur that can be mutually coordinated 16 deconflicted and synchronized via simple common mutually und erstood and agreed 17 upon reference system 18 2 cgrs labeling and identification 19 the grid should be labeled with simple common universal identifier 20 recognizable by each component and its associated c2 and attack assets latlong 21 references easily define cells since th ey are common and exist on most military 22 operational graphics and charts latlong may allow for easy interpretation using 23 digital displays common in the tactical weapon systems of all components 24 b the steps in creating cgrs are straight forward figure e1 25 1 designate grid originstarting poin t base latlong for the operating 26 area the origin point should be at the intersection of degree or 30minute lines of 27 latlong 28 2 designate grid end point upper righ t corner latlong for the operating 29 area the end point should also be at the intersection of degree or 30minute lines of 30 latlong 31 3 assign cell dimensions and subset cell dimensions 32 4 assign an alphanumeric labeling system to the grid 33 e2 note the cgrs cell labeling system is re ad up then read right process rather 1 than the military grid reference systems re ad right and then read up care 2 must be taken to ensure referenced cell is correctly identified 3 figure e1 common geographi c reference system example 4 5 the system used with great success in oif consists of an alphanumeric grid 5 overlay which creates cells of 30 minutes of lat by 30 minutes of long in far 6 northern or southern latitudes consider using 30minute lat by 60minute long cells 7 to more closely approximate the dimensions of square cell nomenclature consists of 8 number that defines the northsouth axis and letter that defines the eastwest axis 9 example cell 7f figure e1 10 c the approximately 30 x 30 nautical mile n m cells can be further subdivided 11 into nine keypads identified by using the familiar telephone keypad numbering system 12 numbered from left to right top to bottom 19 example keypad 7f9 figure a1 13 the keypads are 10 minutes of lat by 10 minut of long that roughly equate to 10 x 14 10 nm in far northern or southern latitudes consider using 10minute lat by 20 15 minute long keypad to more closely approximate the dimensions of square the 16 keypads can be further subdivided into pproximately 5 x 5 nm quadrants for special 17 applications and must be clearly labeled example 7f9sw figure e1 18 12345678 abcdefghi123 456 789123 456 789a cell is 30

quadrants 5 nm x 5 nm7f origin point 56 km x 56 km 19 km x 19 km 9 km x 9 kmend point e3d the cgrs should have an operational aread efined origin point global grid 1 origin point is impractical and undesirable 2 3 cgrs development 3 the jfc should develop the cgrs for the entire operational area including over 4 land and nearby maritime areas and should mandate use by all components the cgrs 5 should be developed in consultation wi th all affected commanders and agencies 6 guidance from the jfc and inputs from other component commanders are critical to 7 ensuring the reference system fits the needs of the joint force and more importantly is 8 accepted as mutual tool once developed the jfc should evaluate the system for its 9 potential to expedite coordination deco nfliction and synchronization within the 10 operational area once approved the refere nce system is passed to each component and 11 their associated c2 and attack assets ins tructions for establishing labeling and using 12 it should be published in appropriate component orders 13 b all agencies must operate on common map datum to prevent location errors 14 that could result in fratricide or missed targ ets although recent usproduced maps use 15 the world geodetic systems 84ellipsoid system older or foreign maps may use 16 different reference system that must have co rrection factor applied most tactical fire 17 support computer systems can automatically apply the correction if the map datum 18 information is entered during computer set up 19 c multiple reference systems within an op erational area will cause confusion and 20 must be avoided care must be taken to sure that proper deconfliction is conducted 21 on the fringes where two separate operational areas meet to ensure overlap does not 22 occur jfc may designate specific cells as inactive nonapplicable for hisher 23 operational area grid to aid in deconfliction should an overlap of cgrss occur 24 d cgrs origin point or orientation sh ould not be changed during combat 25 operations unless the adverse impact of co mpromised grid system outweighs the risk 26 of fratricide caused by potential cell confusio n keeping grid origin locations secret and 27 minimizingeliminating unsecured transmission s of cell targeting locations will aid in 28 keeping grid system secure even if cgrs is suspected to be compromised 29 disciplined use of secure communications c an mitigate any potential advantage to an 30 enemy 31 4 cgrs applications 32 the cgrs cells themselves are not fscms acms or maneuver control 33 measures but simply common reference sy stem that complements joint fire support 34 andor airspace control systems and measures 35 b control and coordination measure boundar ies can be delineated by cgrs cells 36 keypads and quadrants the cgrs is twodimensional construct but fscm and 37 acm areas delineated by cgrs cells may have titudes attached to them such as in 38 kill box 39 e4 c the cgrs can be tool for rapid deconfli ction during noncontiguous battlefield 1 operations such as sof operating behind enemy lines and may even be employed as 2 primary method to describe contiguous battlefield 3 1 the cgrs is flexible enough to be used for variety of purposes including 4 being used to identify littoral maritime warfare areas for antisubmarine warfare and 5 antisurface warfare forces 6 d the cgrs is not 7 1 replacement for the world geographic reference system or the military grid 8 reference system based upon the universal transverse mercator and universal polar 9 stereographic grids 10 2 used to specify grid coordinates for ta rget location or for platformweapon 11 targeting 12 if target is acquired and areas of inte nded attack are designated they can be 13 rapidly correlated to specific cell locati on the identifying component can then 14 establish appropriate control and coordinat ing measures such as fscms andor acms 15 as authorized to expedite and deconfli ct attacks with other components such as 16 designating cell as kill box etc some situations warrant simultaneous joint 17 engagements within single cell area fscms andor acms such as acas with 18 altitude separation are constructed appropri ately to allow for rapid coordination and 19 deconfliction of combined arms attacks 20 f the cgrs is not optimized for defining 21 1 air pictures the bullseye system is tried and proven 22 2 lines or boundaries that are not grid friendly ie 45 degree lines etc 23 3 natural terrain features cgrs may be combined with ground feature 24 references for easier use as demonstrated in the following examples 25 cleared to engage targets east side of river in cell 2c 26 b remain west of northsouth ridge in cells 1 and 2a 27 note geographical references are an impo rtant method of rapidly communicating 28 location information and cannot be completely replaced by cgrs 29 5 modernized integrated database midb integration 30 the cgrs must be built in the facilities po rtion of the local midb as point target 31 that represents 30 x 30minute area as technique the lower left corner of 30 x 32 30minute cell could identify the cell figure 2 multiple suffixes could then be 33 built to identify subset cells keypads or quadrants once the cgrs is built into the 34 local midb it can be transmitted to othe r components to be used for target 35 development 36 e5figure e2 midb latlong

facilit ate the expeditious attack of 18 surface targets of opportunity beyond the coordinating measure 19 an fscl does not divide an area of operations by defining 20 boundary between close and deep operations or zone for close air 21 support the fscl applies to all fires of air land and seabased 22 weapons systems using any type of ammunition forces attacking 23 targets beyond an fscl must inform all affected commanders in 24 sufficient time to allow necessary reaction to avoid fratricide 25 supporting elements attacking targets beyond the fscl must 26 ensure that the attack will not pr oduce adverse attacks on or to 27 the rear of the line short of an fscl all airtoground and 28 surfacetosurface attack operations are controlled by the 29 appropriate land or amphibious force
