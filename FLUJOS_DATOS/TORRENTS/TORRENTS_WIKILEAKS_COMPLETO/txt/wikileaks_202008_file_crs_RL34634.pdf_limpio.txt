additional carbon dioxide co2 released to the atmosphere due to land use changes approximately 20 of total anthropogenic greenhous gas ghg emissions nnually2 deforestation results in carbon emissions when trees and underlying vegetation are burning or decomposing deforested ar eas that are later cultivated also release carbon to the atmosphere when soil carbon is oxidized further deforested areas converted to other land uses eg pastures might quester less carbon than forests enabling greater levels of co2 in the atmosphere forest s store approximately 45 of terrestrial carbon and in the 1990s were estimated to remove 26 billion tons of carbon mtco2 from the atmosphere per year this sequestered amount is equivalent to approximately 33 of anthropogenic carbon emissions from fossil fuel and land use changes3 data on carbon sequestration and missions are not available for many regions making global estimates uncertain much of the deforestation responsible for co2 releases occurs in tropical regions specifically in deve loping countries such as brazil indonesia and the democratic republic of the congo tropical forests stor approximately 25 of the total global terrestrial carbon sc ientists estimate that tropi cal deforestation and other land use changes may have been responsib for releasing approximately 15 billion metric tons of co2 per year to the atmosphere during the 1990s and may be contributing similar amounts of car bon to the atmosphere today4 some contend that deforestation due to logging might resu lt in small carbon emissions because timber converted into products will not release co2 immediately others disagree stating that the percentage of wood transforme d into wood products is probably small in tropical and temperate regions deforestation rates vary across the worl d yet are generally higher in tropical regions see figure 1 by continent the highest rate of net forest loss is in south america which lost approx imately 43 million hectares h of its forest 05httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34634crs2 5 global forest resources assessment 2005 rome italy fao 2006 global tables at httpwwwfaoorgforestryfra2005enannually from 2000 to 2005 this is followe

organization global forests resources assessment rome italy 2006 320 pp note dark lines represent the tropics of cancer and capricorn international deforestation in climate change legislation the role of forests in the carbon cycle and the extent of deforestation and its impact on ghg emissions are primary reasons deforestation is ddressed in climate change legislation many experts conte nd that protecting forests or preventing deforestation may be less expensive than other technologies to reduce co2 emissions and provide other environmen tal and socioeconomic bene fits such as preserving biodiversity others contend that increas ing carbon sequestration through restoration and preventing deforestation though compelling in theory might be challenging and more expensive in practice bills that address defore station propose in their findings that international deforestation is major contributor to ghg emissions and that foreign countries with forests have role in preventing defo restation and engaging in restoration and figure 1 global change in forest cover 20002005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34634crs3 6 for example see robin chazdon tropical fo rest recovery legacies of human impact and natural disturbances perspectives in plant ecology evolution and systematics vol 6 12 2003 5172afforestation activities some argue that congressional intent to address deforestation is misplaced with funding initiatives to pr event deforestation in foreign countries they question the ability of some foreign countries to implement and monitor forest restoration and preservation programs nd the potential value to the united states of implementing these programs further they argue that funds should be focused on domestic efforts to address forest restoration and carbon sequestration technologies this crs legislative analysis covers ke issues and policies addressed by three selected climate change bills introduced in the 110th congress that include international defore station s 3036 hr 6186 and hr 6316 objectives and definitions these bills would address deforestation and climate change by authorizing funding to eligible foreign countries to reduce deforestation increase fore st restoration and affore station and improve forest management forest carbon activities or deforestation reduction activities would be supported by programs proposed in the legislation the definitions of forest carbon activities are specific and include activities directed at reducing ghg emissions from deforestation and forest degradation activities that increase sequestration through restoration of forestsand degraded land that has not been forested prior to restoration and increasing sequestration through fforestation and improved forest management restoring recently deforested tracts is not an eligible fore st carbon ac tivity under these bills the intent to exclude this activity might be to dissuade countries from deforesting new areas with the expectation of financial assistance for restoration afterwards for example it has been argued by some that countries could receive the economic benefits from selling tropical timber in the international market and then potentially receive internati onal assistance to replant w ithout requiring countries to assume the economic costs of preventing forestation this would subsidize tropical timber production with perver effects in both trade and ghg emissions however some argue that excluding recently forested areas from the program might neglect the potential for restoration in large areas of tropical and temperate forests indeed some may contend that previously forested nd might offer the best ecological conditions for successful restoration for example in tropical forests where soils are fragile several studies report that re forestation is most successf ul soon after deforestation and sometimes is least successful when lands have been used for grazing agriculture or other humanrelated activities for several years6 eligibility for assistance most deforestation and net forest carbon emissions occur in developing countries some of these countri have little capacity to undertake forest carbon activ ities and effectively monitor and measure results allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34634crs4 three bills acknowledge this possibility and authorize set of ligibility requirements for countries that could partic ipate in their programs c ountries eligible for receiving financial assistance under fo rest carbon programs roughly fall into two categories category i countries with dem onstrated capacity to monitor and measure carbon stocks capped ghgs ghg reduction program or an emission reduction plan for the fo rest sector and data on natural forest carbon stocks and category ii countries that n eed assistance to achieve the eligibility requirements of category i these would be countries that have demonstrated co mmitment to conduct preparatory activities to build their capacity to engage in deforestation or forest degradation activities or need to develop the capacity to measure and monitor forest carbon changes hr 6186 and hr 6316 distinguish these two categories and would provide funding for both categories s 3036 includes onl countries under the first category as eligible authorization for funding allocation for funding countries under each category varies among the bills for inte rnational forest activ ities countries under the first category would receive all funds provided by s 3036 at least 60 of the funds provided by hr 6186 and up to 50 of the funds provided by hr 6316 the percentages of funding for countries in each of the two categories does not change over time yet presumably the intent of the policy is to assist countries in category ii to reach category i status standards for forest carbon activities some policies support standards for forest carbon activities all three bills provide for the administrator of the us environmental protection agency epa along with other agency heads to develop standards for forest carbon activities these standards include implementing activ ities according to widely accepted sustainable environmental practices promoting native species and ecosystems promoting fair compensation and involving public and indigenous participation and consent these standards address in part potential negative collateral effects of forest restoration and afforestation activities eg unfair treatment of indigenous people who use fo rest resources and the introduction of non native species the bills also require that forest carbon activities be real permanent additional verifiable and enforceable with reliable measuring and monitoring see table 1 for definitions also see crs report rl34560 forest carbon markets potential and drawbacks by ross w gorte and jonathan l ramseur existing programs some contend that deforestation and climate change legislation should integrate forest carbon activities with existin g federal programs this would provide established infrastruct ure for programs offer framework for implementation and monitoring and avoid duplication with other initiatives others counter by suggesting that existing progra ms are not broad enough to address all forest types and all potentially eligible countries with fo rests none of the bills attempts to integrate forest carbon activities with existing us international forestry programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34634crs5 7 for more information see http21912713674 livepagedisplayhandlerpageid225 8 the united states provides approximately 10 million annually to the ittotable 1 definitions of terms related to forest carbon activities term definition real requirement that forest carbon activity must be real means that the activity must actually occur and must sequester quantifiable amount of carbon permanent permanent is requirement that forest carbon activity achieve reductions in emissions or sequestra tion that last permanently this addresses concerns that forestryrelated projects might be halted or reversed by range of factors related to human activities or natural causes eg disease forest fires and decomposition some contend that true permanence is difficult to achieve with forest projects and that alternative approaches might be necessary additional additional is used to define carbon sequestration in addition to that realized under businessasusual activities the purpose of additionality is to assure new carbon sequestration activities that otherwise would not have occurred rather than providing payment for activities that would have happened anyway verifiable verifiable carbon sequestration implies that sequestration must be real and measurable techniques for measuring and monitoring include the use of satellite imagery and remote sensing to quantify forest cover and ontheground measurements to confirm carbon stocks in forests enforceable enforceable means that ghg reduction and carbon sequestration activities can be enforced by authorities or through contracts enforcement can be accomplished through contract such as an easement to require continued forest cover or through the creation of federal laws that create enforcement authorities this would depend on the quality and stability of countrys legal system source definitions derived by crs from terms used in s 3036 hr 6186 and hr 6316 the us government is involved in seve ral international prog rams that address forest degradation and defore station particular programs include the international tropical timber organization the tropical forest conservation act and two regional us initiatives the international tropical timber organization itto was founded in 1986 because of cerns over tropical deforestation7 t h organization has 60 members i ncluding the united states8 that together have about 80 of the worlds tropical forests and conduct 90 of the global tropical timber trade itto promotes sustainable fore st management and forest conservation strategies and assists tropi cal member countries to dopt such strategies in timber harvesting projects

11 william laurance et deforestation in amazonia science vol 304 2004 1109 1111the tropical forest conservation ac t tfca pl 105214 22 usc 2431 authorizes debtfornature tran sactions where developing country debt is exchanged for local funds to conserve tropical forest s conservation funds in local currency from these transactions are deposited in tropical forest fund for each country interest earned from this principal balance and the principal itself is usually given in the form of grants for tropi cal forest conservation project s eligible conservation projects include 1 establishing mainta ining and restoring forest parks and protected reserves 2 training to increase the capacity of personnel to manage reserves 3 developing and supporting comm unities near or within tropical forests 4 developing sustainabl ecosystem and land management systems and 5 identifying the medicinal uses of tropical fo rest plants and their products to date 12 countries have participated in this program establishing 13 agreements that will reduce at least 200 million from the face valu of their debts to the united states and generate 1625 million in local currenc in the next 1226 years for tropical forest conservation projects the united states has two regional in itiatives that involve restoring and conserving tropical forests the am azon basin conservation initiative and the congo basin forest partnership are bot h managed by the us agency for international development9 the amazon initiative aims to conserve biodiversity managed by indigenous and traditional gr oups and promote regi onal cooperation for sharing knowledge and improving governance to help conserve resources in the amazon basin these objectives include maintaining forest cover and maximizing use of nontimber forest products eg fruits and nuts the congo partnership is similar initiative but focuses specifi cally on projects supporting network of managed protected areas improving forest governance and developing sustainable management practices for resource use in the congo basin the us agency for international development nd the us department of agriculture have number of additional related programs and activities challenges for implementi ng proposed legislation implementing forest protection programs in the tropics can be challenging for several reasons some assert that the cause s of deforestation vary in different regions and that one size fits all approach to reduce deforestation might not be successful10 for example deforestation in th amazon basin is driven in part by livestock and soybean production which leads to the conversion of forests to pastures and farms11 in contrast in parts of central frica deforestation is driven in part by fuelwood extraction and charcoal productio n policies that are flexible and addresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34634crs7 12 for example addressing corporate drivers of deforestation is supported by rhett bulter and william laurance new strategies for conserving tropical forests trends in ecology and evolution article in press 2008 13 implications of deforestation 14 ibid 15 the convention on the international trade of endangered species of wild flora and fauna cites attempts to monitor the implementation of the convention through centralized office however each country is responsible for implementing and enforcing the provisions of the treaty individually diverse economic social and cultural influences are expected to be most successful according to some12 observers also contend that deforestation programs will require consistent and effective monitoring and measuring systems that quantify changes in forest cover and provide accurate accounting of forest carbon stocks13 for example some contend that the coverage and quality of satellite imagery in tropi cal countries is inadequate to estimate forest cover and rates of deforestation on small scales some also suggest that consistent and tested methods for blishing baseline and historical changes in forest cover and carbon stocks need to be implemented in any global plan to address deforestation14 in some developing countries monitoring and enforcement capacity may be lacking some contend that fundi ng should be first directed at improving infrastructure and the capacity to measur carbon stocks monitor emissions and land use and enforce forest carbon activities enforcement obligations to prevent deforestation might be challenge in developing countries if multilateral program is implement ed with individual countries responsible for enforcing and mon itoring forest cover obligations problems related to corruption weak governance nd inconsistent enforcement may hinder the program there are few if any models for an international entity to successfully enforce natural resource laws or policies in other countries15 some argue that programs to redu ce deforestation should cause minimal disruptions to rural livelihoods some ru ral people in tropical countries depend on forest resources for subsistence and economic gain forest uses include fuel wood charcoal wild game fruit and timber strict forest protection programs may affect subsistence use of forest products and cause significant economic harm to rural and indigenous peoples who depend on forests some examples demonstrate success where local populations benefit directly and there are incentives to enforce forest protection
