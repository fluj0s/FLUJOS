response framework overview and possible issues for congress summary in response to the terro rist attacks of september 11 2001 congress and the president moved to consolidate numerous federal emergency plans into single unified national response plan the end product of these efforts was the national response plan nrp which established broad lines of authority for agencies responding to emergencie s and major disasters perceived problems with the impleme ntation of the nrp during hurricane katrina led congress to enact the postk atrina management reform act pl 109 295 to integrate preparedness and respons authorities the legislation directed dhs to issue successor plan to the nrp entitled the national response framework nrf implemented in march 2008 the nrf establishes new approach to coordinating federal and nonfederal resources and entities the department of homeland security maintains that the nrf is an improvement over the nrp some however assert that the nrf is not an improvement because it does not fully address the problems and challenges associated with the nrp in the 110th congress members of congress focused in part on policy options that addressed issues concerning the nrf as well as attempts to coordinate federal state and local preparedness and response efforts more fully some examples of federal laws enacted in the 110th congress that have affected

the hurricane katrina response in august 2005 the problems that arose from hurricane katrina prompted numerous studies some of these studies attributed the poor response in part to the implementati on

coordinated fede ral response16 in response to the postkatrina legisl ation and perceived problems with the implementation of the nrp dhs revised the plan and issued the nrf the following section describes the va rious components of the document overview of the nrf general approach the nrf is part of na tional strategy for homeland security it provides the doctrine and guid ing principles for unified response from all levels of government nd all sectors of communities to all types of hazards regardless of their origin17 although the primary focus of the nrf is on response and shortterm recovery th document also defines the roles and responsibilities of the various actors involved in all phases of emerge ncy management18 the nrf is not an operational plan that dictates stepbystep process for responding to hazards rather the nrf ppears to be an attempt to build flexibility into response efforts by setting up framewo rk that dhs believes is necessary for responding to hazards within this framework the nrf gives users degree of discretion as to how they choose to respond to the incident components of the nrf document the nrf is organized into five parts the introductory chapter presents an ove rview of the entire document and explains the evolution of the nrf and identifies th various actors involved in emergency and disaster response the chap ter also discusses the cepts undergirding emergencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34758crs5 19 these are 1 engaged partnership the nrf advocates for open lines of communication among various emergency management entities and for support partnerships during preparedness activities so that when incidents take place these various entities are able to work together 2 tiered response responses to incide nts begin at the local level when local capacity is overwhelmed state authorities assist the locality likewise should the state be overwhelmed assistance from the federal government is requested 3 scalable flexible and adaptable operational capabilities as incidents change in size scope and complexity there needs to be corresponding change in the response apparatus 4 unity of effort through unified command clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities of each entity is necessary for effective response moreover effective response requires unit of effort within the emergency management chain of command 5 readiness to act all emergency management agencies to the extent possible should anticipate incidents and ma ke preparations to respond swiftly to them 20 situational awareness refers to monitoring information regarding actual and developing incidents 21 ics establishes management system that he lps agencies responding to an incident work together in coordinated and systematic approachpreparedness and response by providing list of what dhs describes as the five key principles of response doctrine19 the first chapter of the nrf entitled roles and responsibilities provides an overview of the roles and res ponsibilities of federal state and local governments the nonprofit and private sectors and individuals and households the first chapter also discusses the roles and responsibilities of those who hold various positions within these entities the second chapter entitled response ac tions describes and outlines key tasks as they pertain to what dhs calls the three phases of effective response these phases include prepare respond and recover preparing includes planning organizing equipping training exercising and conducting evaluations activities related to responding include gaining nd maintaining situational awareness20 activating and deploying resources and capabilities coordinating response actions and demob ilizing recover activitie s are broken down into two broad categories these are shor tterm and longterm recovery the third chapter of the nrf entitled response organization discusses the organizational structure and staffing us ed to implement response actions all of which are based on nims and ics21 the nrf describes the organization and staffing structure of every entity responsib for preparedness nd response in

chapter of the nrf entitled additional resources describes the 15 emergency support function esf annexes to the nrf eight support annexes and ven incident annexes22 these annexes are listed in tables 1 and 2 of this report the final chapter also explains that the nrf and its annexes are posted online through the nrf resource center which allows for ongoing revisions to the document23 reasons for replacing the nrp as mentioned earlier in the report several studies attributed th problematic response to hurri cane katrina partly to the implementation of the nrp although th nrp was used for smaller emergencies and disasters prior to hurricane katrina the hurricane marked the first time the nrp was used for catastrophic in cident the section that follows discusses how some of the changes in the nrf have addressed these criticisms difficulty in understanding the nrp the nrp was widely criticized as complicated and overly bureaucratic some said it was long and weighed down with technical language additionally users of the nrp reported that the document failed to clarify roles and res ponsibilities and that the fede ral chain of command was confusing24 it was further pointed out that the name national response plan was misnomer and hence misleading because it was not true operational plan in the sense that it did not provide stepbystep process for responding to an incident the nrf uses less technical language than the nrp and attempts to make the roles and responsibilities more tr ansparent the nrf is also shorter whereas the nrp contained over 400 pages the nrf is roughly 80 pages still some have contested the clarity of the nrf this will be discussed in greater detail later in the report national versus federal focus despite efforts to make the nrp nationwide response plan the nrp was widely seen as not sufficiently national in its focus because it emphasized federal prepare dness and response some have furtherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34758crs7

excluded nonfederal stakeholders such as states and localities25 according to dhs the nrf more clearly articulates the roles and responsibilities of nonfederal entities26 additionally when drafting the nrf dhs held outreach sessions to solicit the feedback of nonfederal partners27 the extent of nonfederal participation in the creation of the nrf has been questioned and is discussed later in this report confusion concerning the fco and the pfo one frequent criticism of the nrp was the ambiguity surrounding th relationship and role of the federal coordinating officer fco and the principle federal officer pfo the fco determines the types of relief most urgently needed establishes field offices and coordina tes relief efforts28 the fco position is authorized by the stafford act immediately upon declaring major disaster section 302a of the stafford act requires the president to appoint an fco29 the pfo on the other hand is not legi slatively authorized position rather the pfo position was created by dhs in the nrp the pfo is designated by the secretary of dhs and represents the secretary as the leading federal official and serves as the primary point of contact for state and local officials in hurricane katrina michael brown who was serving as the director of fema was additionally designated as the pfo william lokey served as the fco for louisiana to some observers such as the inspector general fo r dhs these roles created great deal of confusion during hurricane katrina because it appeared that two people were in charge of the relief operations30 congress focused on the confusion invol ving the pfo in the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110181 sec tion 526 of the act states that none of the funds provided by this or previous appr opriations

the pfo position has not been used some have indicated that th position may be in the process of being phased out31 however dhs secretary chertoff designated pfos before the start of the 2008 hurricane season the move was view ed as controversial by some house transportation and infrastructure committee chairman james oberstar reportedly focused on the fact that congress had ef fectively eliminated the position and that designating pfos violated the consolidated appropriations act32 as previously pointed out the pfo position has not been used since the nrf was implemented reports on progress made since hurricane katrina several emergencies and disasters ve taken place since implementation of the nrf in general responses to the nrf have been mixed some have indicated that its implementation has been successful33 one observer stated that coordination among federal state and local governments has improved34 in the case of hurricanes gustav and ike officials in texas relate d that the federal response to the hurricanes was good35 other officials have been ambivalent regarding the nrfs implementation noting that the scale of recent disasters has not warranted enough federal involvement to unders tand how well the nrf works36 review of various reports may hint at some problems however for instance during hurricanes gustav and ike state officials in texas said it was the local governments responsibility to set up distri bution points for supplies however the local government claimed it was unaware of this responsibility37 such confusion may indicate that the nrf still does not clearly articulate the roles and responsibilities of state and local governme nts during emergencie s and disasters other more serious criticisms of the nrf have surfaced since its

quires dhs to establish standardized federal planning process that integrates plans among all levels of government to date this standardized pla nning process has not been released the absence of standardized planning pro cess was discussed in gove rnment accountability office gao tesitmony on preparedne ss for catastrophic disasters38 in the testimony gao pointed out that two supplements to the nrf are not completed these are federal partner response guides and the integrated planning system the partner guides are intended to provide ready refe rence of key roles nd actions for federal state and local governments as well as nongovernmental and privatesector response partners the planning system is intende d to assist all levels of government in working together collaboratively to creat plans for various types of incidents39 similar concern over lack of operational plans was voiced by representative bennie thompson chairman of the hous committee on homeland security in letter to the secretary of dhs representative thompson expressed concern that the incident annexes lack operational plans th at detail how the federal government will respond to natural and humancaused disasters40 the catastrophic incident cyber incident and terrorism incident law forcement and inves tigation annexes have yet to be updated41 some would argue that using these annexes which were developed for the nrp may create problems if they are invoked under the nrf for example the catastrophic incident anne x discusses how catastrophic event may be designated as an incident of nationa l significance ins an ins was intended as triggering mechanism for certain types of response strategies however the ins term has been eliminated from the nrfs lexicon some could argue that lack of ope rational plans in the nrf may warrant congressional oversight shoul d dhs fail to release the federal partner response guides and the integrated planning system or update the remaining incident annexes in timely fashion congress might elect to consider the matter integrating nonfederal stake holders in na tional planning criticism of the nrp was that input from nonf ederal stakeholders such

included nonfederal stakeholder input in the creation of the nrf but later deviated from the process43 rather than disseminating the first draft of the nrf to stakeholders dhs conducted an inte rnal review of the document gao f ound that the issuance of later draft to nonfed eral stakeholders wa s delayed reducing the amount of time for the stakeholders to res pond with comments on the draft additionally gao reported that dhs failed to establish femas national advisory council nac by the december 2006 deadline that was set forth in section 508 of the postkatrina act according to the act the nac is responsible for incorporating the input of state local and tribal g overnments and the private sector in the development and revision of the nrf44 the importance of meeting the congre ssional mandate has been addressed by one analyst donald kettl public po licy professor at the university of pennsylvania has emphasized the importan ce of including local officials in the planning process according to kettl amount of national pl anning can sidestep the fact that the first indi cator that something bad is happening is report from the frontlines45 in consideration of these conclusions some may argue that failing to integrate feedback from local emergenc officials could 1 omit hazards that are known at the local level but not recognized by federal fficials 2 miss an opportunity to integrate the lessons learned from local responders who have firsthand experience with emergencies and disasters and 3 fail to establish buyin to the plan at the state and local level thereby creating possible reluctance to execute the plan faithfully if the issue of nonfederal stakeholder i nput were of concern to congress it might move to conduct oversight on the extent to which

children are vulnerable during emergencies and evacuations according to shriver the needs of children are commonly overlooked before during and after disaster shelters for example often have unsanitary conditions and many communities lack sufficient stockpiles of diapers formula pediatric medications and childsize respirators48 in various legislative provisions congre ss has focused on the needs of children during disasters for example the postk atrina act contains provision to reunite children with their families by establishing within the national center for missing and exploited

nrfs current coverage include the following first there are primary agencies designated as responsible for addressing childrens need s only supporting agencies have this designation second some may argue that the annexes are flawed because the public health and medical services annex esf 8 and search nd rescue annex esf 9 do not explicitly mention children in their various functions third some may argue that having multiple annexes focused on the needs of children may create service gaps and that when several orga nizations are assigned with responsibility it becomes unclear what agency

would seem to add to the nrfs flexibility it also gives users easy access to the document however it is unclear what mechanisms are in place to ensure users know the document has been changed is it possible that state or locality may use protocols that have b een removed or revised the nrf is always in effect whereas the nrp had to be invoked when an emergency or disaster struck according to dhs this has the benefit of speeding response time because it eliminates the need to wait for some form of announcement that the plan is in effect some may argue that plan that is always in effect lacks triggering mechanism to alert responders nd create situational awareness does the nrf benefit response activities by always being in effect reporting requireme nts and metrics the postkatrina act requires the administrator of fema to submit to c ongress annual reports that identify the resources needed to enhance regional offi ces and undertake planning training surge capacity and logistics reporting must also include information about state compliance with the nrf and the extent to which the use of federal assistance during the preceding fiscal year ach ieved prepare dness priorities52 additionally homeland security grants require broad state complia nce with national pr eparedness policy some may argue that emergency management practices are strengthened when states and localities dopt federal standards for emergency preparedness and response others may argue that manda ting compliance has at least two negative consequences first not all states have the same set of hazards onesizefitsall approach may not be the best method of addressing hazards because states and localities are better positioned to make decisions about how to conduct

second requiring compliance and creating standards increases federal involvement in emergenc policy again some may argue this is beneficial because it can help save lives and reduce property loss but others might argue that the requirements infringe on state sovereignty emphasis on terrorism all of the nrfs incident annexes are oriented toward terrorism since hurri cane katrina some have argued that there has been an emphasis on planning for highimpact lowprobability incidents at the expense of lowimpact highprobability incidents additionally it is possible that planning for terrorism underemphasizes preparedness for natural disasters for example in testimony before the house natural resources committee david applegate pointed out that earthquakes are among the most ex pensive of natural disasters in terms of destruction according to applegat this underscores the importance of preparedness and mitigation however there is incident annex addressing earthquakes54 the president of the international association of emergency managers iaem and director of emergency manageme nt hillsborough county florida also addressed the terrorism emphasis direct or larry gispert responded favorably to presidentelect obamas plan to suppor t firstresponders prepare effective emergency response plans improve inter operable communications systems and work with state and local governments and the private sector and allocate funds based on risk gispert objected to plans that focus on terrorism because state and local emergency managers primarily deal with natural disasters according to gispert the plan would have the benefit of allowing state and local governments to prepare for both types of incidents rather than predominantly terrorism55 on the other hand others would argue th at planning for terrorism is of the utmost importance and that terrorist att ack would have the same consequences as natural disaster56 they may conclude that pla nning and preparedness for terrorism can be applied toward natural disasters and therefore fits the allhazards model of emergency managementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34758crs14 57 based on search on the crs legislative information system lis

enacted legislation57 several laws enacted in the 110th congress have affected the nrf p l 11053 implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 was signed into law august 3 2007 section 408 amends 510 of the homeland security ac t of 2002 by requiring the administrator of fema to create standards for credentialing and classifying58 incident management personnel for federal state local and tribal government agencies that have responsibilities under the nrf section 510 of the homeland security ac t as amended requires that later than six months after receiving the standards each federal agency with responsibilities under the nrf must ensure that incident ma nagement personnel emergency response providers and other personnel including temporary personnel as well as resources likely needed to res pond to disaster be credentialed and typed in accordance with those standards59 section 1407 of pl 11053 requires that security exercises for public transportati on agencies be consistent with the nrf60 pl 110181 the nati onal defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 was signed into law january 28 2008 sec tion 351f requires the national guard to submit an

information service lis using the terms national response plan and nati onal response frameworkpending legislation62 the following is list of selected legislation pending at the end of the 110th congress that if acted upon in later congress might have implications for the nrf s 3260 the financial services and ge neral government appropriations act 2009 was introduced july 14 2008 section 516 of the bill would have authorized the general services administration gsa to allow volunteer and other nongovernmental organizations supporting the nrf to have access to gsa sources of supply the intent of the bill was to imp rove logistics in response efforts some may contend that the confusion during hurricanes gustav and ike concerning distribution points for supplies may have been lessened through access to gsa supply schedules s 3260 was placed on the senate legislative calendar under general orders calendar 877 hr 1333 the civil air patrol ho meland security support act of 2007 introduced in the house on march 6 2007 would have directed the secretary of dhs to enter into memoranda of understa nding or other agreements with the secretary of defense to use civil air patrol personnel and resources to support homeland security missions the secretary of dhs would have been authorized to consider the civil air patrol an av ailable resource for purposes of national preparedness and response planni ng activities including the national response plan meaning the nrf hr 1333 passed the house and was referre d to the senate hr 6147 the federa l emergency management advancement act of 2008 was introduced may 22 2008 the intent was to establish fema as an independent agency if enacted section 1046 would have required the director of fema to consolidate existing federal government emergency response plans into single coordinated national response plan hr 6147 was referred to the house subcommittee on emergency communications preparedness and response june 2 2008 concluding observations in response to directives from congress and the president the bush administration issued the nrf to establish new approach to coordinate federal and nonfederal entities in times of emergencies and major di sasters the nrf does appear to respond to some of the challeng identified by congress and others the document is more concise s less jargon and has made an attempt to clarify roles and responsibilities on the other hand part s of the nrf may have retained some of the problems associated with the nrp the nrf still contains the pfo arrangement nonfederal stakeholder input appears to be lacking and the incident annexes have yet to be fully updated some observers might say that not enough emergencies and disasters have occurred since the nrf has been issued to form clear picture of its effectiveness also they may contend that insufficient implementation studies have been conductedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34758crs16 on the nrf to assess its efficacy as some observers point out the only way to find out whether the nrf is an improvement over the nrp may be to subject it to major catastrophe comparable to hurricane katrina
