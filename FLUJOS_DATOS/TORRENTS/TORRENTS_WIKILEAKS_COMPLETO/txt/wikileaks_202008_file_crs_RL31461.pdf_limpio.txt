as well as differences in policy proposals most of the funding differences associated with policy differences among proposals for the upcoming fiscal year are often relatively small compared to the budget as whole although these small changes may have large implications over time budget totals should be expected to change over time the clinton administrations original budget proposal for fy2001

remained relativ ely modest over the forecast both ombs and cbos original nd revised estimates showed receipts remaining fairly stable nd outlays falling as percenta ges of gross domestic product gdp in fy2001 as shares of gdp receipt s rose towards levels last seen during world war ii while outlays continued d ecline that began most recently in fy1992 what to do with the nonsocial security portion of the surplus remained focus of the budget debate an understanding veloped in the previous year that the social security surplus essentially the offbudget surplus would be used only for reducing the debt held by the public4 the house adopted two bills hr 5173 and hr 5203 in midseptember 2000 that cont ained essentially th same procedural lockboxes to reserve both the social security and medicare surpluses for debt reduction the remain ing part of the total surplus the onbudget surplus was the focus of policy proposals and debates over increased spe nding reduced taxes and

caps through fy 2002 when they expire and allows it to grow at the rate of inflation thereafter the surplus reflects the 20 billion in unspecified revenue reductions or spending increases in the

fied the administration so proposed reserve for americas future of unspecified future sp ending increases or tax cuts that would grow from 20 billion in fy2001 to 27 billion in fy2005 before expanding to 85 billion in fy2010 the msr also included proposed changes in budget accounting that would move the medicare hospital in surance hi trust fund offbudget where it would join social security and the postal service this accounting change would drop the onbudget surplus reported in the msr from 68 billion including the surplus of the medicare hospital in surance trust fund to 9 billion5 the summer 2000 msr june 26 2000 rev ealed continuing improvement in the budget outlook it showed fy 2001 surplus of 228 billi on and 5year cumulative surplus of 1211 billion the 5y ear cumulative current service baseline surplus the surplus without the proposed policy changes was 1497 billion the msr had an onbudget surplus of 9 billion in fy2001 if the medicare surplus off budget in the msr is added back into the onbudget amounts which makes them comparable to the presidents original request the congressi onal budget resolution and cbo baseline estimates and forecasts the onbudget surplus jumps to 68 billion in fy2001 the three revised baseline estimates in the cbo update july 2000 had total surpluses ranging from 268 billion for the i nflated baseline to 329 billion for the capped baseline the cbo onbudget surpluses these include the medicare hi trust fund surpluses ranged from 102 billion to 163 billion for fy2001 these summer 2000 budget revisions from both omb and cbo continued several yearlong pattern of rising budget surplus estimates in each new budget report the better summer budget estimate s and projections came from continuing steady economic growth and larger than exp ected receipts rather than any substantial legislative changes revised budget estimates for fy2001 were released in association with the fy2002 budget estimates proposals and acti ons beginning early in 2001 for the most part these revised estimates showed continued improvement in the overall budget outlook for fy2001 the january and february timates from the administration and cbo budget documen ts contained fy2001 surplus of 281 billion congress in adopting the budget resolution for fy2002 hconres 83 included reconciliation instructions for an 11year tax cut that would increase outlays through an advance tax reba by not more than 100 b illion over fys 2001 and 2002 for economic s timulus the fy 2002 budget resolution put the fy2001 surplus at 186 billion the tax cut legislation became law in june 2001 pl 107httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31461crs5 6the smaller cbo deficit estimate assumed growth in discretionary spending after fy1998 and the larger number assumed discretionary spending growing with the rate of inflation after fy199816 subsequent estimates from omb and cbo measured the cost of the tax cut wholly as reduction in receipts uncertainty in budget projections all budget estimates and projections are inherently uncertai n their dependence on assumptions that are themselves subj ect to substantial variation makes budget estimates and projections susceptible to fairly rapid and dramatic changes one can get sense of this uncertainty by comparing projections for fy2000 made 5 or more years ago with the actua l results the presidents budget for fy1996 came out early in 1995 cbos budget and economic outlook for fiscal years 1996 through 2000 was also released early in 1995 the administration projected for fy2000 deficit of 1944 billion cbo projected deficit of between 243 billion and 284 billion6 these 1995 projected deficits fo r fy2000 turned into substantial surplus of 236 billion the 400 billion to 500 billion turn around in the budget balance outlook in five years may produce some wariness when contemplating policy changes based on budget estimates that exte nd five to 10 years into the future cbo made this caution more explicit in its january 2000 report in addition to the three baselines cbo provided an optimis tic and pessimistic scenario for each the optimistic one assumed that the cu rrent favorable economic and budgetary conditions continue indefinitely into the futu re the effect is to further boost receipts and hold down spending the pessimistic scenario assumed that the then existing favorable conditions were tem porary and that they would revert to the less favorable conditions of the 1980s and early 1990s these assumptions slow the growth of receipts and force up federal spending the results of these alternative forecasts were dramatic in the optimistic scenario rpluses double over the 10 years in the pessimistic scenario the expected surpluse s turn into deficits by fy2003 in one of the three baselines the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios are not more likely to occur than one of the three baselines but like the histori cal example above they serve as warning when one considers how to resolve the surplu s issue surpluses can be used to reduce taxes increase spending or pay down the portion of the federal debt held by the public if the surpluses are reduced through additional spending commitments or reduced taxes and these changes are combin ed with an economy that turns sour the governments budget outlook deteriorates budget projections are dependent on the underlying assumptions about the direction of the economy and future po licy any deviation from the expected underlying assumptions such as faster or slower economic growth higher or lower inflation or changes in assumed spending nd tax policy can have substantial effects on the budget projectionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31461crs6 7appropriations mostly for discretionary spe nding account for approximately

prominent can increase or decrease the apparent effect of proposed policies when compared to the baselines for example the president clintons tota l discretionary spending proposals showed little difference over the 5year period from the current services baseline estimates baseline that incorporated an inflation adjustment assumption for discretionary spending if instead the ba seline assumed that discretiona ry spending was frozen for the 5 years which is not very realistic assumption the presidents discretionary proposals would have shown increases when compared to this alternative baseline whatever the comparison with the current services baseline shows in the way of proposed policy changes all broad measures of fe deral spending except net interest grow in the numbers of

the budget in cluded another 442 billion in net receipt increases made up of both increases and decreases to receipts that the administration called other provisions that affect receipts the major component of this increase was proposed 312 billion increase in tobacco related excise taxes and levy on youth smoking the overall net impact of the proposed policy changes on receipts over the 5year period was 104 billion reduction in receipts the msr in the summer of 20 00 although making some changes to these numbers ended with similar sized mix of increases and decreases in receipts and

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31461crs14 10 unless the surpluses are used for increased sp ending or decreased receipts tax cuts they will be used by the treasury pretty much auto matically to reduce federal debt held by the public the treasury can and has taken more active role in retiring debt held by the public by purchasing securities on the market nd retiring some callable federal debt the treasury could also hold the surplus cash and build up government cash balances but this would make little sensewhat to do with the surplus remained one focus of the budget debates in 2000 as it had in 1999 surpluses can be deliber ately used up by increasing spending or decreasing receipts if unused they w ould reduce the debt held by the public10 the clinton administration and the fy2001 congressional budget resolution included combinations of spending increases tax cuts and debt reduction although in different amounts and with different mixes the policy proposals would reduce the surplus from baseline levels reducing the amount of surplus available for reducing federal debt held by the public an agreement that budget debate par ticipants reached in 1999 was meant to reserve surpluses from the social security accounts essentially the offbudget surplus for debt reduction this left the onbudget surplus as the focus of efforts to adopt either spending increas or tax cuts or to do ne ither and use it for additional debt reduction reserving the offbudget surplus means that at least that part of the surplus would be used to reduce the publicly held debt any unused onbudget surplus would contribute to debt reducti on to further limit the onbudget surplus available for use and to protect medi care the administration in the june 2000 msr proposed taking the medicare

portion of the deficit reduction in th latter 1990s resulted from the many and varied policy changes in particular the decreases in defense and net interest spending that was adopted or occurred si nce the early 1990s the constraints on non discretionary spending added to the deficit reductions substantial portion of the changes resulted from steady strong economic growth that resulted in substantially higher revenues than forecast the surplus as currently defined is m easured by the difference between total federal receipts and total federal outlays it represents the extra money the government collects from the public over wh at the government spends on the public the budget and the economy the budget and the economy affect each ot her the relationship is an unequal one with the economy shoving and pushi ng around the budget with every economic twinge while even relatively large ch anges in the budget as measured by policyinduced changes in the size of the deficit or surplus may bounce off the economy with little consequence this imbalance became obvious in the second half of 2001 as the continuing weakness in the economy persistently reduced the size of subsequent surplus estimates the clin ton administrations originally proposed change in the governments budget balance for fy2001 was very small when measured against its current service ba seline estimate the economy at over an expected 10 trillion in 2001 is just too large to be measurably affected by the less than 15 billion in originally proposed policy changes for fy2001 since large part of the improvement in the budget situation since the early 1990s resulted from strong and sustained ec onomic growth one should remain aware that what the economy gives growing surp luses it can also take away which it seems to have begun to do at least in the shortterm sustained recession or slower than expected economic growth w hich has happened or deterioration in other economic variables may disrupt at least for time the expectations of continued budget improvement cbos budget report the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20012010 january 2000 in its chapter on the uncertainties of
