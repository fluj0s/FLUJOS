united nations office of internal oversight services unhcr audit service assignment ar200516104 audit report r06r003 5 may 2006 review of unhcr implementing partners audit certification auditors rachel roy huiming june tan united nations nations unies office of internal oversight services unhcr audit service review of unhcr implementing partners audit certifi cation ar200516104 executive summary in october and november 2005 oios conducted revi ew of unhcr implementing partners audit certification process the objective was to p rovide unhcr with an assessment of the adequacy of the current arrangements and whether i t was carried out in accordance with the revised policy issued in december 2003 the review included instalments paid to implementing partners in 2004 of approximately us 350 million w ith related audit cost of some us 17 million submission of audit certificates oios review established that audit certificates we re required for 672 subprojects 449 partners amounting to us 305 million this meant that the expected coverage for 2004 was 87 per cent of the total instalments paid to partners as of 11 november 2005 three months after the 31 j uly 2005 deadline for submission of audit certificates unhcr reportedly attained 37 per cent certification coverage of the 2004 instalments paid significantly short of the expect ed coverage of 87 per cent moreover the figure of 37 per cent was not entirely accurate as it included 58 audit certificates relating to sub projects that were not subject to mandatory audit these nonmandatory certificates represented only 2 per cent of partners expenditures but cost about us 160000 9 per cent of the total audit cost maintenance of statistics for summary progress repo rt to compile the statistics on the level of audit cer tification coverage expenditures according to msrp were used instead of the amounts actually cert ified oios review found variances for one third of audit reports and recommended that ac tion be taken to ensure systematic comparison of the expenditures certified with those recorded in msrp the statistics compiled did not distinguish between the opinions expressed unqualified qualified and unable to give an opinion an unquali fied opinion giving assurance that unhcr funds were appropriately used was expressed for ss than 80 of the subprojects audited this low figure is fairly significant and more attention should be given to categorising the type of opinions expressed in order to highlight the percen tage of qualified opinions factors contribution to low audit certification rat in oios view one of the major factors contributin g to the low rate of audit certification was lack of planning by representations auditors were not engaged early enough tight deadlines were given to auditors and documents necessary for the audit were not always locally available another factor was ineffective monitoring and follo wup by the desks oios did not find evidence that the desks were always properly involv ed in the process by identifying those where audit certificates were required the desks perception of its involvement and responsibilities differed between bureau and desk some desks saw the analysis of audit certificates as their responsibility others conside red it too time consuming costs associated to audit certification in 2005 the annual budget for audit fees was us 1 4 million this was an underestimation and had to be revised upwards to us 18 million as of 31 december 2005 the average audit fee was us 2900 per subproject but the actual cost varied considerably between operations for instance it was as low as us 485 in rwanda compared with us 9000 and us 20000 in burundi and liberia respect ively similar situation was observed in asia where the average fees ranged from us 750 in india to us 10800 in indonesia the unhcr guidelines provide for flexibility to hav either an audit certificate per subproject or per partner in most of the cases audit certif icates were obtained for each subproject oios estimated that if representations had requested aud it certificates for aggregate subprojects per partner it would have reduced the number required by 30 per cent this would have generated some economies of scale evaluation and followup of audit certificates and management letters of the audit certificates and management letters re ceived there was standardisation and the objective of having similar type reports was not ac hieved some auditors issued audit certificates per site others issued lengthy report s which failed to express clear audit opinion notwithstanding the ambiguity in some audit opinion s it appeared that there was still lack of understanding of the difference between qualified and unqualified opinion the main reason for qualified audit opinions in 200 5 was the lack of locally available documents for international partners as the guidel ines suggests in these instances local branch of the international partners audit firm co uld have been contracted to review the local activities moreover in oios opinion the lack of documentation should have been noticed by unhcr during regular project monitoring and as it was not this could highlight weakness in the project monitoring process oios review of management letters found the recomm endations were relevant and deserved proper followup despite this oios could not obt ain evidence that representations did this adequately most programme officers had not submitt ed the required matrix developed to facilitate this followup may 2006

implementing partners audit certification of 2004 subprojects this was the first year of implementation of unhcrs new policy the policy outlined in iom612003fom612003 dated 8 december 2003 was introduced to address the recommendations made by the board of auditors wh ich had expressed concern about the recurring unsatisfactorily low percentage of audit certificates the new requirements were applicable to all subprojects beginning on 1 janua ry 2004 the new policy and guidelines were aimed at increasing compliance with audit cert ification requirements improving the financial accountability of unhcrs implementing pa rtners and establishing uniform requirements for the audit of unhcr projects 2 the major change from the previous policy w as the requirement of international ngos to submit specific audit certificate for s ubproject or aggregate of subprojects within the same country where the budget exceeded u s 300000 previously they were required to submit the audit reports of their globa l financial statements the responsibility for engaging local audit firms was delegated to represe ntations who were provided with new guidelines for contracting the auditors the new p olicy was also more explicit in what action should be taken where qualified opinion was expre ssed management letters became mandatory with representations delegated the respon sibility of followingup on the implementation of the recommendations moreover summary progress report of audit certificates received at headquarters would be subm itted to the oversight committee every six months 3 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the controller and the audit coordinator during the exit conference held on 14 november 2005 draft of the report was also shared with t hem and their comments received in april 2006 have been reflected as appropriate in this f inal report ii review objectives 4 the overall objective of the review was to provide unhcr management with an assessment of the adequacy of the current arrangeme nts of the audit certification process for funds provided to unhcrs implementing partners by reviewing sample of audit certificates oios aimed to determine whether the udit certification process was in accordance with unhcrs expectations as stated in t he unhcr manual in terms of accountability of the partners in compliance with unhcrs policy and whether it was an efficient use of resources oios also aimed to iden tify areas where the new policy as well as the management systems renewal project msrp could be further enhanced with relation to managing the audit certification process iii review scope and methodology 5 given that the policy was applicable for bprojects starting on 1 january 2004 the review included audit certificates for subprojects implemented in 2004 the review consisted 2 of interviewing staff and management reviewing ava ilable audit certificates and management letters as well as analysing the financial informa tion available in msrp iv findings and recommendations submission of audit certificates for 2004 audit certificates required and received 6 the deadline for submission of 2004 audit c ertificates was for most subprojects 31 july 2005 ie six months after the liquidation da as of 11 november 2005 the audit certificates received covered including instalment s paid to the agencies us 1279 million representing 37 per cent of the total insta lments paid to partners in 2004 7 at the time of oios review unhcr was unaware of t he total number of audit certificates required for 2004 while the requireme nt for an audit certificate is dependent on the type of partner unhcr longer centrally main tains information to identify which sub projects require an audit certificate the categor ization of partners as national ngos international ngos governmental or agencies doe s not exist in msrp oios recommended that this information which is essenti to manage the audit certification process as well as to prepare progress reports for the oversight committee be made available in msrp 8 unhcrs audit coordinator stated that request had been made to the msrp support team to include the information on the cate gory of implementing partners in the system but so far the feedback from msrp support t eam indicated that this might not be possible programme assistants also indicated the u sefulness of such report which should include budget details the audit coordination unit will pursue with the msrp support team the feasibility and expected timeframe for this rep ort recommendation head2right the unhcr division of finance and supply management with the assistance of the msrp support team shoul d develop reporting tool including budget informat ion which would automatically generate list of partne rs for which an audit certificate is required rec 01 9 for the purpose of the review oios establi shed the list of required audit certificates by analysing the instalments paid to implementing p artners in 2004 subsequently oios found that the ngo unit already had database cont aining partners per category this information could be useful in the shortterm for p reparing progress report on audit certification for the oversight committee pending t he development of an appropriate management tool in msrp 10 oios determined that audit certificates we re required for 672 subprojects totalling us 305 million out of the us 350 million paid in 2004 the results of our analysis are presented in the table below from this informatio n the expected coverage for 2004 is 87 per cent of the total instalments remitted to implement ing partners this is close to the estimate of 3 85 per cent coverage of the total budgets for imple menting partners made by oios in its 2003 feasibility study table 1 oios analysis of unhcr msrp records for 20 04 type of implementing partners of sub projects of partners total instalments us000

governments less than established threshold and agencies 611 576 44097 13 total 1283 1025 349412 100 11 oios review noted that the total instalme nts for 2004 recorded in msrp amounted to us 3499 million this figure was not entirely acc urate since it included us 05 million for disbursements related to unhcr directly implemented activities undertaken by 14 different cost centres there was also an amount of us 8020 00 charged to an unidentified partner this corresponded to instalments paid to alisei it aly by unhcr gabon although the amount was correctly recorded in fmis it was incorr ectly mapped when downloaded to msrp therefore instalments paid to alisei were sho wn as us 85000 instead of us 887000 to ensure the integrity of information in msrp quality control procedures such as the comparison of msrp data with other sources loi s and subproject agreements should be established b audit certificates obtained when not required 12 the records maintained by the audit coordi nator included audit certificates for sub projects with an actual budget of less than us 300 000 for international ngos or less than us 100000 for national ngos and governmental part ners as these were not mandatory under the new guidelines oios is of the opinion th at they should have been excluded by 11 november 2005 58 audit certificates which were not required in accordance with the policy had been submitted this corresponds to instalments of approximately us 65 million as an example out of the 22 audit certificates received from angola 12 were not required in accordance with the policy assuming an average aud it fee for each project of around us 2900 oios estimated that fees related to non mandatory audit work amounted to approximately us 160000 in response to the draft report it was stated that this should be seen as positive step taken by field offices wher eby audit certificates are being received for all subprojects to improve oversight and the accou ntability of partners 13 the guidelines annex 88 par 13 foresaw that representations may request audit certificates even if they are not strictly required by them nonetheless due to the absence of information it was not possible to know whether th above cases were the result of decisions to have all subprojects audited or decisions to au dit specific projects or misinterpretation of 4 the rules and procedures to ensure the cost effect iveness of the resources spent oios recommended that representations document the reaso ns for decisions to audit subprojects not subject to mandatory audit this should be subm itted to the desk together with the audit certificate unhcrs controller indicated that an official memor andum will be issued to clarify audit requirements as well as the roles of the all those concerned at both field offices and at headquarters c audit certificates not obtained when required 14 some audit certificates were not obtained although required mainly because the aggregated budget amount per partner was not taken into consideration as stipulated in the guidelines this particularly concerned internatio nal partners namely for subprojects implemented in kosovo democratic republic of congo and namibia this error was not detected since the notion of an aggregated amount f or subprojects was generally not well understood unhcr needs to clarify and reinforce th application of the guidelines b maintenance of statistics for summary progress r eport discrepancies between the certified amounts and instalments paid 15 the statistics compiled by the audit coord inator for preparing the summary progress reports were not entirely accurate by comparing th amount of instalments paid according to the audit certificates received with those paid as recorded in msrp oios found variances for one third of those reviewed totalling approxima tely us 22 million absolute numbers this is result of the audit coordinator not compa ring the amount of instalments certified by the auditors with the amount paid as recorded in ms rp there was an assumption that both amounts agreed unhcrs audit coordinator stated that the unit does not have the resources to do this and it would be outside its c oordination functions 16 oios also found that there was not suffici ent documentation on the reconciliation of figures on audit certificates with fmis or msrp rec ords by the desks and representations oios suggested that in order to ensure the expendit ures certified in the audit certificates agree with msrp records the desks should verify and info rm the audit coordinator of any discrepancies between them alternatively represen tations when submitting audit certificates should attach table with the descrip tion of the subprojects the total of instalments and expenditures certified the total xpenditures recorded in fmis pending the implementation of msrp in the field and an explana tion for any differences unhcrs controller agreed with oios recommendation and sta ted this issue will be emphasized and reiterated in the abovementioned memorandum recommendation head2right the unhcr division of finance and supply management should emphasize the necessity for representations and desks to reconcile the total expenditures according to the audit certificates to either fmis or msrp records s appropriate rec 02 5 b absence of statistics on qualified audit opinio ns 17 the statistics collated on the audit certi ficates received were misleading and further analysis were required since they did not disclose the number of certificates per opinion expressed unqualified qualified or when the audit ors are unable to express an opinion from our sample of 64 audit reports received at headquar ters 15 23 per cent of them gave qualified opinion this should be red flag for active followup as it does not provide reasonable assurance that unhcr funds were used in accordance with the subproject agreement 18 the audit coordinator explained that stati stics on qualified audit certificates could not be compiled since the desks andor representations did not always indicate the type of opinion issued when forwarding copies of the audit certificates oios would emphasize that without this information desks cannot perform effe ctive followup on field office activities and the audit coordinator cannot submit the necessa ry information to the oversight committee for consideration 19 oios concluded that only limited number of representations analyse audit certificates as only few of them summarized thei r concerns in their transmission letters to the desk in most of the cases reviewed when the audit certificates were submitted there was mention that qualified opinion had been expres sed by the auditors or of any other problems outlined in the management letter 20 there was diverse attitude among the des ks on this issue some desk officers stated they had read the audit certificates on their own i nitiative others felt that it was the responsibility of programme managers in the field t analyse audit certificates as it was time consuming exercise in oios opinion dfsm should r emind representations and desks on their respective responsibilities when qualified opinion is expressed according to the rules and procedures programme managers should follow up on issues raised by the auditors and it is the desks responsibility to ensure that adequat followup has been done 21 some unhcr staff members at headquarters nd in the field were unfamiliar with the terms qualified and unqualified for audit opinions and there was confusion between the two for instance one representation stated in memorandum to headquarters that all partners received qualified audit opinion when th contrary was true oios understands that measures will be introduced by msrp to record wheth er an audit opinion is unqualified or qualified oios is pleased to note this but for it to be effective and generate reliable data there needs to be clear understanding of the term s if not the information input into the system will be incorrect oios recommended that the terminology be further explained to unhcr programme staff unhcrs controller stated that representations will be asked to follow up with audit firms to ensure audit opinions are clearly stated to facilitate the work of programme managers at headquarters when filling suc h information in msrp the controller also indicated that dfsm is working with the msrp support team to resolve the technical problem of uploading such information int msrp recommendation head2right the unhcr division of finance and supply management should ensure representations and desks are aware f their 6 responsibilities when qualified opinion is expres sed representations should actively followup on the is sues raised by the auditors and the desks should monito r their progress rec 03 c inadequate filing of information in livelink 22 the audit coordinator is responsible for c ollating and summarising information to identify country operations that are not complying with unhcrs audit certification requirements the statistics are currently maintain ed per partner instead of per country and are filed according to the filing structure previou sly adopted when the international partners submitted their global financial statements oios r ecommended that with the new policy and procedures new structure for compiling the data b implemented oios suggested that statistics be available per country and per project in order to initiate the action in case of non compliance or to assist country operations facing d ifficulties in obtaining the required audit certificates unhcrs audit coordinator agreed with oios recommen dation and will modify the filing structure of information in livelink th is issued was discussed with and the changes accepted by the desks and other users of the inform ation c factors contributing to the low audit certificat ion rates inadequate planning by unhcr field offices 23 delay in contracting audit firms is one of the causes of the late submission of audit certificates oios did not have detailed informatio n on how representations selected audit firms there were indications however that many aud it firms were contracted in mid2005 and the audit carried out in the second semester of 200 5 this is too late and means that in most cases the deadline for submission of audit certific ates is not met for example as at 31 july 2005 the time the audit certificates should have b een submitted to headquarters only 23 per cent of the budgeted audit fees had been spent oio s noted that there was marked increase in the submission of audit certificates at the latt er part of the year which also indicated delay in contracting auditors oios found that betw een midnovember 2005 and the beginning of january 2006 the percentage submitted had increased from 37 to 49 per cent 24 to accelerate the process audit firms sho uld be contracted during the relevant year eg during 2004 for the 2004 subprojects moreov er as the audit certificate threshold is based on the budgeted amount and not the actual exp enditure there is need to wait for the actual expenditure figures before contracting the udit firm moreover early contracting of auditors allows them to conduct work prior to the nd of the project site visits bank confirmations etc which is the normal practice for auditors this ensures that the audit certificate can be issued in timely manner after the end of the liquidation period 25 another factor in the late engagement of uditors was the selection process which was new for most representations oios understands that it was time consuming for them to become familiar with the guidelines to identify au dit firms to initiate the tendering process to establish the terms of reference and prepare the contract however this investment in time is not required annually if unhcr is satisfied wit h the quality of services provided the audit firm can be recontracted for further two years to ensure the timeliness and completeness 7 of audit certificates for implementing partners oi recommended that dfsm reminds representations to initiate the selection or ctual renewal process as soon as possible and preferably before the end of the implementation period of the subprojects unhcrs controller agreed with oios recommendation and stat ed that this will be included in memorandum to representations to ensure the timelin ess of the engagement of auditors 26 the late contracting of audit firms has an impact on the quality of the audit for instance the unhcr representation in chad engaged auditors in late july 2005 for 15 partners 30 subprojects with total expenditure of over us 27 million and gave them deadline of 10 august 2005 for the submission of th reports this gave the auditors only three weeks to conduct the audit despite the fact t hat sites were scattered over large geographical area although the audit certificates were submitted within the deadline they were not able to visit some partners offices becau of bad weather they also faced difficulties in obtaining the necessary documentati on from most of the international partners as the documents supporting expenditures were nger available locally the auditors issued audit certificates without forming any opini on for instalments paid amounting to us 77 million b lack of monitoring by the desks 27 in oios opinion desk personnel did not d emonstrate proactive approach in monitoring the implementation of the audit certific ation policy they had to be reminded of their responsibilities by the controller through memorandum issued on 7 june 2005 and subsequent meeting with finance and programme assis tants from various desks on 28 september 2005 at the time of the oios review in october 2005 the majority of the desks still did not have list of the audit certif icates required per country and per partner consequently they were not in position to monitor the engagement of auditors to ensure audit fees had been properly budgeted for and to ve rify the completeness of the audit certificates received 28 oios interviews with unhcr desk staff foun d that they were not fully aware of the importance of audit certification as result th ey did not give high priority to audit certification among the other daytoday operationa l issues they faced some desks officers and heads of desk admitted that they had not read i n detail the new guidelines and others questioned the necessity of obtaining independent udit certification as field representations are responsible for performing quarterly reviews of subprojects with partners one desk mentioned that the requirement was not considered priority since it was not mentioned in the iom822004fom862004 instructions and guidel ines on reporting on 2004 implementation in 2005 and planning for 2006 whic h provided list of the various reports to be submitted in 2005 oios was of the opinion t hat to ensure better planning the annual iomfom should make reference to the deadline for t he engagement of the auditors and the submission of audit certificates to headquarters 29 the monitoring of the receipt of audit cer tificates was also perceived as task to be performed by desk assistants and senior resource manager declined to participate in meeting with oios as the followup of audit certif ication was too technical task and it was felt that it was not senior resource managers re sponsibility this is contrary to the suggestion made by oios in its 2003 feasibility stu dy where it was thought that senior resource managers should be designated focal points for monitoring the planning reception 8 and followup of audit certificates and management letters oios recommended that dfsm clarify who is responsible for monitoring the proce ss at headquarters unhcrs controller stated this was raised at department of operation s meeting as well as with the financial reform team srms are aware of their responsibilit ies but did not give it top priority among other competing ones this issue will be addr essed in the memorandum mentioned earlier in the report d costs associated with audit certification 30 in the initial approved budget the total cost for audit fees within the established thresholds was us 14 million as of 16 november 2 005 the total amount budgeted for audit fees for 2005 was approximately us 16 milli on rising to us 17 million as of 31 december 2005 out of which us 095 million had b een disbursed 31 oios highlighted that this amount may not be fully accurate since unhcr guidelines on budgeting for audit fees were not always adhered to oios noted that as of 16 november 2005 some 17 cost centres had not made any budget provision for audit fees relating to an accumulative number of 40 subprojec ts with total instalments of approximately us 18 million alternatively representations in 7 cost centres had budgeted for audit fees of us 20000 although projects at these locations fell into the established threshold under the present policy average budgeted cost per audit certificate 32 according to the current budget the avera ge audit fee per audit certificate in 2005 will be approximately us 2900 based on one audit cert ificate issued per subproject this amount varies considerably from one country to anot her for instance it was the equivalent of us 485 in rwanda compared with us 9000 in bur undi and us 20000 in liberia similar variances to audit fees were observed in as ia and the average audit fees were us 750 in india compared to us 10800 in indonesi 33 given that the charges have not yet been f ully recorded the costs of audits should be further analysed an average cost should be establi shed per country operation and compared with others in the same region any excessive fees should be investigated and the reasons determined with the aim of reducing costs b absence of economies of scale 34 unhcrs policy on audit certification give s flexibility to have either an audit certificate per subproject or per group of subpro jects implemented by the same partner in given country most unhcr representations opted fo r an audit certificate per subproject meaning that the number of audit certificates requi red was approximately 672 whereas taking the other option would have resulted in only 449 t his could have generated some economies of scale c possible savings by increasing the current thre shold 35 oios analysis of instalments revealed tha t by increasing the current threshold for national partners could reduce audit fees and still maintain adequate coverage of expenditure 9 of 80 per cent or above please see annex for det ails an increase of the current threshold would reduce the number of audit certificates and m anagement letters resulting in reduction in analysis and followup 36 oios also understands that the current thr eshold of us 100000 was aimed at obtaining audit certificates for large number of national ngo partners which present higher risks to and require more capacity building from unhcr unlike international ngos national ngo partners may not receive any other for m of audit while it would be premature at this stage to change the current threshold dfsm should periodically review the situation to see whether any revision may be warranted evaluation and followup of audit certificates nd management letters variety of audit certificates submitted 37 despite having established standard terms of reference as well as samples of audit report formats large variety in the nature and t ype of reports were submitted oios noted cases where the audit certificate was onepage do cument with the spmr attached in other cases it was 90page document ie subproject implemented by gtz in sierra leone moreover an audit firm in india issued an audit ce rtificate of approximately 90 pages that did not clearly express an opinion in sudan the audi tor issued audit reports per project site instead of per subproject or the aggregate of sub projects at one particular site the auditor issued two audit reports with conflicting figures 38 the cause of these problems might be the f ailure either by the auditors to adhere to the terms of reference tor provided by unhcr or of r epresentations to communicate the established tor and the samples of the audit report format the requirement to comply with unhcrs reporting formats should be clearly stipula ted in the contractual agreement any lack of compliance with the tor should be taken int consideration in the assessment of the quality of services provided by the auditing firm and could effect the decision on whether or not to renew the contract with the exception of ga bon oios was not aware of any cases where the representation questioned the quality of the services provided 39 oios was of the opinion that the briefings given to audit firms were not adequate oios noted that some auditors did not have sufficie nt knowledge of unhcr regulations and rules and some of the audit findings as outlined i n the management letters referred to insignificant issues this could have been avoided with better knowledge of unhcr practices if required oios could during field m issions meet representatives of audit firms to provide additional information about unhcr rules procedures and practices recommendation head2right the unhcr division of finance and supply management should remind representations of their responsibili ties to provide proper briefing to audit firms to make th em fully aware of the terms of reference and the procedures necessary to assess the audit services provided rec 04 10 b lack of adequate financial records 40 the main reason that audit firms expressed qualified opinion was the lack of documents available in the international partners field offices for example this was observed in chad angola and congo it seems that both unhcr and the partners did not anticipate this problem which should have been noticed by pro gramme managers when carrying out financial monitoring it also raises the question of whether financial monitoring was properly carried out unhcr should communicate to partners t he requirement to maintain adequate supporting documents at their field offices for aud it purposes on the other hand it could be agreed with the partners to engage local branch f their international audit firm to provide sufficient audit coverage if records are maintained both locally and at its headquarters in these cases unhcr would make financial contribut ion to the cost of the audit oios was not aware of any such option taken in 2005 recommendation head2right the unhcr division of finance and supply management should request representations to make sure that l international partners are aware of their responsib ility to ensure that documents are available for audit incl uding copies of documents of expenditures disbursed at th headquarter level or other documents that are norma lly sent to their headquarters the engagement of local br anch of the international implementing partners audit firm s in order to provide sufficient coverage for audit purposes s hould be considered where necessary rec 05 c followup on management letters 41 under the new policy on audit certificatio n the issuance of management letters is requirement oios assessed from its review of the m anagement letters that most of the findings and recommendations made were relevant and deserved proper followup 42 oios did not obtain any evidence of action taken by representations to followup on the implementation of audit recommendations even t hough they are required to analyse management letters to determine the action necessar to implement the recommendations moreover although programme officers are required to submit matrix for followup on recommendations per partner few of the programme m anagers had done so at the time of oios review 43 in most of the cases reviewed the partner s comments were obtained and added to the management letter there was however comment f rom unhcr such comments would have been important in cases where the partner disa greed with the auditors moreover some findings and recommendations made by the auditors s hould have been raised at headquarters for instance gtz and arc in sierra leone had subc ontracted large part of their unhcr activities to local partners without in gtzs case informing unhcr and without properly monitoring these subcontracted partners this shou ld have been followedup at headquarters one of the gtz partners was under investigative au dit 11 44 in the course of future field missions oi could provide if required some assistance and advice on analysing and following up audit certificates and management letters recommendation head2right the unhcr division of finance and supply management should reinforce the requirements for the analysis of audit management letters and their followup programme fficers should be reminded of their responsibility to submi t matrix of the recommendations issued to facilitate the fol lowup and in cases where the partner disagrees with the recommendation made comments from the representati on should be provided rec 06 45 unhcr controller stated that he appreciated the ggestions made in recommendations 4 5 and 6 and will make sure that they are included in memorandum to be addressed to all field offices and bureaux at he adquarters the controller is aware of the significance of strengthened audit certification system in improving transparency and accountability in respect to expenditure incurred the controller informed the march standing committee of oios review and is committed to improve the system v
