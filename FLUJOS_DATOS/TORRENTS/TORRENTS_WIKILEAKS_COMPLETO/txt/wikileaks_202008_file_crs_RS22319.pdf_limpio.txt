berne union members have also recently expressed concerns about doing business in china they argue that there is lack of available information concerning the nature and performance capability of many of the firm s in china that are involved in trade or investment transactions with berne union mbers the rapid growth of joint ventures with chinese firms is also creating confusion for some of the publicsector berne union members because many of them are charged by their respective governments with participating in transactions that support economic activity in their home countries as result of this confusion membership in th berne union is growing fastest among firms from the private sector where those firms are not charged with promoting national content another key issue for berne union members is insurance against terrorist risks and how such risks should be defined and wh ether they should be included as part of investment insurance in november 2006 the berne union members adopted

partnering with commercial bilateral multilateral and other organization involved in export trade and investment business issues for congress congress plays direct role in the bern union but its presence is felt indirectly through two us government agencies that are members of the union and over which it has oversight responsibility the us ex portimport bank and the overseas private investment corporation these agencies also provide information back to congress and to the administration about developments in the areas of export credit finance and foreign investment us private sector firms that are members of the berne union also often look to congress for support and leadership in the areas of export credit finance and insurance especially with the increased risk s many firms now believe exist as result of terrorist activities as result of its vast interna tional economic and secu rity interests the united states is directly affected by and therefore plays leading role in developments in the areas of international trade international finance and foreign investment the vast us international presence also means that us national interests are tied to the successful operation and stability of the international trade and finance markets which means that congress is often involved in re solving issues that affect important us interests that rely on stability in the inte rnational financial sy stem and the successful operation of global trade and investment markets
