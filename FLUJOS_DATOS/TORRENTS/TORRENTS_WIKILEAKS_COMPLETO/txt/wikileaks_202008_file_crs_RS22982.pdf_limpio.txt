relator ie whistleblower for the person and for the us government in what is termed qui tam action the ability to initiate qui tam action has been viewed as powerful weapon against fraud in that it may be initiated by private party who ma have direct and independent knowledge of any misconduct popularity of qui tam actions brought under the fca may be attributed in large part to the fact that successful relators can receive between 15 and 30 of the monetary pro ceeds of the action or settlement that are recovered by the government overview of the allison engine decision in allison engine co v us ex rel sanders the navy contracted with two shipyards to build destroyers the shipyards subcontracted with allison engine company to build generator sets gensets whic h would provide electrical power for the destroyers allison engine subcontracted with general tool company which also used subcontractor to manufactur different parts needed fo r the gensets the navys contracts with the shipyards required that ll parts of the destroyers including the gen sets be constructed in accordance with navy specifications this requirement was included in the contracts with the subcontract ors in addition the contracts required that each genset come with certificate of conformance that certified the unit met the navys requirements all of the money used to pa the contractors for the work on the gensets ultimately came from the us treasuryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22982crs3 3 united states ex rel sanders v allison engine co 471 f3d 610 613 6th cir 2006 4 united states ex rel sanders v

roger thacker the relators brought actions against allison engine company and other subcontractors under 3729a13 of the fca alleging fraud with respect to the construction of the gensets the relators conte nded that the subcontractors kne w that there were defects in the construction of the gen sets and that the gensets did not conform to navy specifications still the subc ontractors submitted invoices to the shipyards for payment which constituted false or fraudulent claims paid by the government in violation of the fca3 during the jury trial before the district court the relators produced evidence that the subcontractors had issued certificates of conformance containing false statements that the gensets complied with navy requirements as well as invoi ces that the subcontractors presented to the shipyards however th relators did not provide evidence of the subcontractors or the shipyards submitting false claim to the navy while the subcontractors argued that the relators claim failed because there was demonstration that the false claims were presented to the government the relators asserted that their claim under the fca was sufficient because gove rnment funds had been used to pay the invoices that were presented to the shipyards4 the district court agreed with the subcontractors and granted their motion for j udgment as matter of law the court concluded that in order to sustain cl aim under 3729a1 and a2 of the fca there must be showing that false claim was presented to the us government5 on appeal the sixth circuit reversed the di strict court in releva nt part and found the subcontractors liable under the fca6 the court of appeals evaluated the statutory language and found that wh ile liability under 3729a1 depends on whether claim has been presented to the government the language in 3729a2 and a3 contains indication that presentment is required so as long as there is showing that the claim was paid with government funds the court of appeals opined that the legislative history of the fca supported this view7 additionally while the sixth circuit articulated that 3729a2 requires causal c onnection between the defenda nts false statement and the payment or approval of th claim by the government the court focused its decision on the idea that proof of presentment is not required in order to bring successful fca claim under 3729a2 and a3 the supreme court granted certiorari on the issue of whether false claims for federal government money made by subcontr actors are actionable under 3729a2 or 3729a3 of the fca if the claims were not presented to the us government in unanimous decision the suprem court vacated the sixth circuit decision and remandedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22982crs4 8 allison engine co v united

claim does not have to be presented to the government under 3729a2 and a3 the court found that under 3729a2 plaintiff must prove th at the defendant intended that the false record or statement be material to the gove rnments decision to pay or approve the false claim9 similarly under 3729a3 plaintiff must demonstrate that the conspirators agreed to make use of the false record or statement in an effort to defraud the government and that the statement would have material effect on the governments decision to pay the false or fraudulent claim the court found that the language of 3729 a2 did not support the sixth circuits finding that plaintiff can establish liab ility under the fca by showing that false statement resulted in the use of government f unds to pay false or fraudulent claim the court pointed to the language of the subsecti on in particular the phrase to get false claim paid by the government as the cour t articulated to get denotes purpose and thus person must have the purpose of getting false claim paid or approved by the government in order to be liable under 3729a210 without this element of intent the court elaborated the reach of the fca would expand beyond its role of combating fraud against the government further the court explained that recognizing cause of action under the fca for fraud directed at private entities would threaten to transform the fca into an allpurpose antifraud statute additionally the court agreed with the sixth circuit that while plaintiff must present claim to the government under 3729a1 3729a2 does not require proof that defendants false record or statement was submitted to the government but instead that the defendant submitted the claim for the purpose of getting the claim paid by the government the court also found that under 3729a3 it is not necessary to show that conspirators presented false claim to th government but instead that conspirators agreed that the false record or statement would have material effect on the governments decision to pay the claim ramifications of allison engine decision on health care cases as mentioned above the fca is often i nvoked due to fraud in federal health care programs such as medicare and medicaid although allison engine does not address its application to health care cases there has been speculation over how the case could affect fca health care litigation especially since cl aims for payment from federal health care programs like medicare and medicaid can be pa id for with federal funds but are often paid through some type of intermediary some commentators have suggested that allison engine could make it more difficult for plaintiffs to bring an fca claim against health care entities11 however it remains to be seen how courts will interpret the allisonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22982crs5 11 continued health care providers see also supreme court narrows scope of false claims act implications for medicare medicaid health care

need for impr oved federal oversight june 2005 16 idengine decision and whether the decision will have significant effect on health care litigation under the fca the social security act gives private entities large role in the administration of medicare which includes making coverage determin ations as well as processing and paying claims for example under medicare parts and b nongovernment organizations contract to serve as the fiscal agent between health care providers and the federal government12 it has been proposed that on the basis of allison engine defendants may be able to argue for dismissal of an fca claim by alleging that the claim at issue was merely relied upon by the private entities that pr ocessed and paid the claim that the claim was not submitted with the purpose of inducing payment by the government or that the falsehoods were not material to the g overnments decision to pay the claim13 on the other hand plaintiff may be able to argue that health care providers and others submitting medicare claim are fully aware that while they are submitting claim to contractor the claims are ultimately paid by medicare this awareness could possibly demonstrate an intent to defraud the government as opposed to private contractor14 perhaps more difficult question is how allison engine will affect medicaid claims medicaid is stateadministered program that is jointly financed by states and the federal government when some medicaid beneficiaries receive care from health care provider the provider bills the state medicaid program for the services15 other medicaid enrollees receive their care through managed care orga nizations mco entities that are usually paid monthly in advance for each enrollee typically the state pays the provider or mco from combination of state funds and federa l funds which the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms advances to the state each quarter the state later files an expenditure report with cms in which the state may claim federal reimbursement for medicaid expenditures and there is reconciliation of the expenditures with the federal advance16 applying the reasoning of allison engine it has been suggested that plaintiffs will have difficulty proving that defendant intended to defraud the federal governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22982crs6 17 memorandum from harry silver laurence fr eedman and laura lae

claim for government money or property paid or approved will be liable under the fca when the claim was submitted to state medicaid program17 however it still seems possible that plaintiffs may be able to bring successful fca claims for medicaid fraud under the reasoning of allison engine for example if plai ntiff could demonstrate that defendant intended state dicaid program to rely on false record or statement in order to receive federal reimbursement court may be willing to find that the plaintiff meets the requirements of 3729a2 proposed legislat ion in the 110th congress the false claims correction acts s 2041 as reported in the senate and hr 4854 as introduced in the house aim to clarify the meaning of several provisions of the fca due to restrictive judicial interpretations of the statute that are said to run contrary to congressional intent18 the bills which would make several changes to the fca could make it easier for plaintiffs under certain circumstances to bring an fca claim proposed amendments to the fca included in s 2041 and hr 4854 could also potentially limit the application of allison engine section 2 of s 2041 would amend 3729a2 to provide that person who know ingly makes or uses false record or statement to get false or fraudulent claim paid or approved can be liable to the government for penalties19 both bills remove the phrase by the government from 3729a2 for the purpose of clarifying that this section of the fca covers false claims which are paid for by private parties with g overnment grant or contr act funds while the bills would retain the phrase to get which the allison engine court relied on as basis for its determination that must be an element of intent to defraud the government in successful 3729a2 claim the remova l of the phrase by the government could allow plaintiff to have successful fca claim in circumstances where the plaintiff cannot prove that the defenda nt intended to defraud the g overnment but can prove that defendant did intend to defraud priv ate party of government funds
