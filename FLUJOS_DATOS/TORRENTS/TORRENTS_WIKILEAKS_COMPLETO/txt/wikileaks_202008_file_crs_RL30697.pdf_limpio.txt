workforce and labor standards summary under section 13a1 of the fair bor standards act flsa persons who are employed in bona fide executive administrative or professional capacity may be exempt from minimum wage and overtime pay protection if they meet certain criteria set forth by the department of labor dol such criteria can be difficult to meet which some argue is the nature of an exemption during recent years some confusion and litigation s developed about the appli cation of this exemption to licensed funeral director s and embalmers in orde r to eliminate any doubt about applicability legislation has been proposed that would bypass section 13a1 and declare any employee employed as licensed funeral director or licensed embalmer to be exempt by definition ie simple categorical exemption during the past two decades there have been major changes in the funeral industry it has moved from group of momandpop enterprises to domination by series of megafirms process known in the industry as consolidation with corporate consolidation have come economies of scale bulk buying centralized use of facilities and staff by clusters of tablishments under single ownership new marketing arrangements etc other changes have affected the industry as well eg shift from inground burial to cremation nd the advent of venders offering discount caskets and related merchandise these changes have given rise to corporate culture and to increased visibility of the industry in the world of policy similarly there have been shifts in the labor force where funeral directing and embalming had been largely domain of white males it has become increasingly open to women and minorities consolidation appears to have led to less personal pattern of labormanagement relations than in the past societal change has suggested the need for bettereducated funeral industry workforce for reasons of image and considerations of skill and in turn this s led to efforts to enhance general licensing standards and to make them consistent throughout the nation currently licensing requirements are left to the determination of the individual states and the district of columbia bu t if funeral directors and embalmers are highly skilled are they professional as dol defines the concept for section 13a1 purposes should they be covered by flsa wage and hour protections or if not why should they be excluded from such protection legislation concerning the status of funeral directors and subsequently embalmers has been introduced in seve ral congresses beginning with the 105th but none of them

the funeral industry licensed f uneral directors and embalmers be covered by the minimum wage and overtime pay protections of the fair labor standards act flsa if not what might justify exempting these workers from such protections should such an exemption be sp ecific cat egorical dealing narrowly with funeral directors and embalmers or should it flow from more general criteria set forth by congress or by the departme nt of labor dol how have such wagehour concerns been impact ed by social and cultural change during recent years and by structural and economic shifts within the deathcare industry although there may be some differe nce of opinion public policy embodied through the flsa has been to protect such workers in their overtime rights in general funeral directors would seem to have more in common with retail sales embalmers conversely woul d seem to have more professional status but even so they have not traditionally satisfied re quirements set down by the department that policy has been of concern to th industry which would like to see the definition altered nd has resulted in recent litigation it also became the focus of legislative proposals in 105th congress and beyond aside from the regulatory context per this paper reviews the structur of the deathcare industry the character of its workforce and the pot ential impact of the changes in wagehour requirements context of the issue for the 107th congress death does not occur on fixed schedule thus by the nature of their work funeral service employees are often calle d upon to work irregular hours and to be available upon demand but the funeral industry is not entir ely unique in that respect utilities workers public safety personnel medical staff some construction crews journalists etc work under similar consider ations of time their work requires measure of flexibility when enacting the flsa the primary federal statute dealing with minimum wages overtime pay and related issues congress sought to limit the number of hours worked to reasonable number ie not more than 40 per week however cognizant of work patterns within particular industries it made the act flexible for example although the act requires that 1½ time s workers regular rate of pay time andahalf be paid for hours worked in excess of 40 per week there is daily restriction thus worker can be assi gned to work any combination of hours httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30697crs2 1 there are variety of options open to empl oyers see 29 cfr part 778 the stated motivations of congress in this respect have been mixed in part economic

wage require ments have long been concern of employers including those in the funeral industry2 generalized concerns evolved into litigation when in 1998 the us dist rict court for the western district of michigan rutlin v prime succession inc examined the wagehour treatment of michigan man engaged as funeral director and embalmer the case was subsequently appealed to the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit and decision was rendered in july 2000 rutlin v prime succession inc 6th cir 99 1042 july 20 2000 under section 13a1 of the act certain bona fide executive administrative or professiona l employees including li censed funeral directors and embalmers may be exempt from flsa wa ge and hour requirements if they meet dol standards exemption however is not automatic nor is it universal th qualifying criteria are technical in general dol has rega rded funeral directors and embalmers as technical or as retailservice employees not as professionals in the rutlin case the court of appeals found that the plainti ff was professional even though in this instance he performed additional duties th at did not require pr ofessional training it held that those duties that were of principal importance to prime succession were those related to directing funerals and embalming bodies the case also involved the mode of payment salaried or hourly and payment for periods of time when rutlin was off duty but on call here the court of appeals ruled that given the particular circumstances in this case the plaintiff shoul d have been compensated for off duty but on call hours while paid on an hourly basis3 whether other cases given factual variations would result in similar interpretation may be problematic4 in 1998 in order to bring clarity to the issue legislative solution was proposed the legislation had it been dopted would have exempted any employee employed as licensed funeral director from minimum wage and overtime pay protection under the flsa5 senator lauch faircloth when presenting the proposal pointed to the economic hardship and financial strain such requirements placehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30697crs3 6 congressional record july 31 1998 p s9562 7 hr 793 introduced by representative lindsey graham rsc on feb 23 1999 was referred to the house committee on education and the workforce and later to the subcommittee on workforce protections 8 for an example of this approach see crs report rl30537 computer services personnel overtime pay under the fa ir labor standards act by william g whittakeron small business owners w ho have to allocate revenues for that purpose ie to pay their employees at least the minimum wage and ove rtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 per week6 action was taken on th is legislation during the 105th congress early in the 106th congress following the decision in the rutlin case new legislation was introduced hr 793 g raham somewhat expanded it proposed elimination of minimum wage and overtime pay protection both for licensed funeral directors and licensed embalmers7 action was immediately taken on hr 793 but its language was incorporated within hr 3081 lazio tax legislation that would also raise the federal minimum wage and make certain other changes in the flsa on january 28 2000 the committee on education and the workforce was discharged from further responsibility for the measure hearing had been held on the graham now lazio funeral indus try provision on march 9 2000 hr 3081 was passed by the house and s ubsequently dispatched to the senate but when the 106th congress came to an end ne ither bill had been approved early in the 107th congress new legislation hr 546 quinn and hr 648 graham was introduced that would have exempted employers of licensed funeral directors and embalmers from the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements of the flsa the bills were referred to the committee on education and the workforce and the tax provisions of hr 546 to the committee on ways and means neither bill was enacted in the 108th congress two new bills of similar intent were introduced hr 2065 tiberi and s 292 graham of south carolina but like their predecessors neither wa s approved by the congress the purpose of the proposed funeral indus try exemption is fairly direct it would allow funeral industry employers to avoid having to pay their employees those employed as licensed funeral directors andor licensed embalmers the flsa minimum wage and timeandahalf for overtime hours worke d that result could be achieved through at least two routes first under the flsas section 13a1 bona fide executive administrative or professional employees may be exempt from wage and hour protection if they meet certa in tests discussed be low established by dol congress could modify section 13a1 so that licensed funeral directors and embalmers would qualify as exempt presumably as professionals but possibly as administrative or executive employees were it demonstrated that they actually were professional for section 13a1 purposes that is highly educated and highly paid8 however it appears that many could not meet that standard often being lowwage entrylevel employees see discussion below second congress could write into the statute categorical exemption by declaring that licensed funeral directors and embalmers are by finition exempt from minimum wage andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30697crs4 9 there is ample precedent for excluding specific categories of workers from flsa protections such exemptions may be justifie d either as economic policy or as legislative accommodation and compromise or both 10 in the us code the sections are 206 207 and 213 respectively wage and hour policy is also concern of the states and the latter may have more rigid standards than the federal government where there is overlapping cove rage the higher standard normally prevails 11 the section 13a1 designation the eap ex emption needs to be approached with some caution see for example james prozzi overtime pay and the managerial employee still twilight zone of uncertainty in labor law journal mar 1990 pp 178182 and continuedovertime pay protection9 the latter course categorical exemption was the approach that has been proposed in the past severa l congresses this report will examine both the professional and categorical appr oaches and their policy implications the regulatory context under the flsa section 6 specifies the federal minimum wage that must be paid to covered employees section 7 requires that covered wo rkers must be paid 1½ times their regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of 40 per week then in section 13 congress wrote into the act seri of exemptions from section 6 or section 7 or from both for exam ple section 13a1 provides the provisions of section 206 and section 207 of this title shall not apply with respect to 1 any employee employed in bona fide executive administrative or professional capacity the definition of bona fide and of executiv administrative or professional has been left by congress to the secretary of labor to be established through the rulemaking process10 in the case of licensed funeral directors and licensed embalmers the issue has focused upon the concept of professional though such workers might also be exempt as executive or administrative staff speaking generally to be exempt under section 13a1 two criteria must be met first the worker must be paid salary above threshold established by the secretary the salary test second the worker must be engaged in duties that would meet standard of professional the duties test as specified by the secretary through the years employers have often sought to expand this exemption section 13a1 in order to avoid payment of overtime rates workers conversely have tended to resist expansion of the ex emption the several tests are imposed so that title alone cannot establish the exem ption for example professional must actually be professional in order to be exempt the designation and exemption being rooted therefore both in duties test that he doe s the work of professional and in salary test that he is paid pr ofessionals wage th tests however have been impacted by changes in educational nd training practices and by fluctuations in the economy11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30697crs5 11 continued us general

the economist sept 28 1996 p 79 precise estimates are difficult involving complex disaggregation of data and of holdings see also gary continuedin attempting to distinguish prof essional person from worker who is technically trained and highly skilled the department established certain criteria of assessment for example the work of professional must require knowledge of an advanced type in field of science or learning customarily acquired by prolonged course of specia lized intellectual instruction and study as distinguished from general academic education and from an apprenticeship and from training in the performance of routine mental manual or physical processes dol has emphasized the original and creative character of such work and the exercise of discretion and j udgment in its performance it must be predominantly what the worker actually does ie the major portion of his or her work12 in the rutlin case the circuit court in the absence of categorical exemption conducted its review under the old section 13a113 i t h l d t h t r u t l i n s licensed funeral director and embalmer in michigan was professional and that although he had spent much of his time on nonprofessional duties he met the duties time test because of the relatively greater importance of the work he performed within his professional field each case of course is different and even here judge moore of the circuit court filed lengthy and detailed dissenting opinion it is not clear how other courts might view the several tests the funeral industry during recent years the funeral industr has undergone stark change both in its structure and economic orie ntation dol regulations and the ambiguities of the rutlin case aside there are forces within th industry that could encourage efforts to secure

burial or cremati on and 3 memorialization through monuments markers or inscriptions15 funeral arrangements are made in variety of ways but often they are prepaid in order to be certain the wishes of the deceased are complied with and to ease the burden on survivors c oncept known as preneed in 1994 about 760000 individuals prearranged their funera ls spending over 34 billion in the process16 for little ove r decade primary theme within the funeral industry has been consolidation where most deathcare establishments had been relatively small and locally owned or at most small chains the 1990s saw rapid growth of mega corporations with nationwide and international holdings there are estimated to be about 23000 funeral homes and 9500 cemeteries in the united states in the late 1990s the consolidators the industry term for the gacorporations were said to control about 25 percent of industry revenue dollars17 at middecade about 85 of industry facilities were thought to be familyowned18 percentages however may be difficult to assess since the cons olidators operate seemingly independent funeral businesses under one parent company19 in any case the percentage may be of little importance while the independents still account for the majority of firms in number of operating units states tom fisher columnist for mortuary magazine and close observer of the industry t heir power

independents fo r whom bulk buying may not be feasible and to whom discounts may not be an opti on thus they could be placed under even greater pressure to economize in other areas such labor costs45 in urban centers where firm has more than one mortuary it is reported that conglomerates can jockey expensive equipment and underu sed personnel between funeral homes46 rather than retain an embalmer for each home bodies may be shipped to centralized prep center for processing similarly funeral directors normally staff employees can be shifted from one place to another wherever their services may be required one switchboard operator may handle reservations for all of the associated establishments single fleet of hearses and limos can serve number of mortuaries providing more efficient utilization of equipment and personnel with reduced cost47 but such clustering need not be confined to strictly urban environments nor to high volume blishments now the big companies are at the point where they are acquiring mid and smallsized firms notes fred bates of national selected mortic ians where they can network in geographic area with employees and equipment48 economic pressures have

to the various categories of workers81 common body of duties though the duties of an embalmer may be relatively clear the distinct responsibilities of funeral directors morticians and funeral attendants may raise some questi ons where the funeral director is not simultaneously an embalmer his duties would appear to be largely organizational ie arranging the logistics of the fune ral consoling the fa mily and conducting the business aspects of the proceeding he may also be involved depending upon the makeup of the unit in placing obituaries and polishing hearses the distinction in terms of duties between licensed funeral director and staffer who may not yet be licensed may be ambiguous and dependent upon the size of the funeral home the volume of business conducted tradition etc clearly the duties of funeral director might vary substantially depending upon whether the funeral home it is free standing owneroperated facility or part of cluster operated by consolidator an employee not necessarily an ownermanager what may be more clear is that the funeral director is often not or at least need not be the owner of funeral home the bureau of labor sta tistics notes that

funeral directors are still not defined as professionals by the federal department of bor nfda says it is investigating possible action to challenge current interpretation but has not yet established policy99 it had been evident for many years th at there is funda mental disagreement among practitioners as to whether funeral rvice is vocation or profession if it is vocation trade stated dan flor of the cincinnati college of mortuary science then the federal government is correct in classifying funeral service among personal services such as massage barbering and drycleaning100 after years of debate the american board of funera l service education abfse the accrediting agency for the funeral serv ice industry bega n to lobby the nfda membership for higher sense of professionalism in late 1990 it proposed an enhanced professional course of st udy and recommended that an associates degree be the minimum academic requirement for licensure101 within the nfda there were divergent views the boards spokesman gordon bigelow reassured the associations members the technical area will remain at the core of the mortuary science curri culum because embalming is what is unique about funeral

specialized body of knowledge he suggested that the bachelors degree was the minimum requi red but he added that an occupation does not become professi on by simple proclamation105 reiterating his appeal for at least an associates degree requirement dr bigelow carefully explained that professional funeral service courses focus the mind on specific technical tasks required of the funeral directorembalmer while liberal arts courses open the mind to learn how to deal with unanticipated situations both he felt were important106 while some remained dubious or outright hostile to such enhanced some might say gratu itous requirements ra lph klicker posed doubleedged query are our professions entry level and continuing education requirements adequate to m eet the demands of the future and will the public expect the funeral directors they deal with to be as educated as they are107 the debate would continue through the remainder of the century in 1995 the newly elected president of the nfda bru ce overton argued that high school plus an associate degree was longer sufficient we must change the picture where the educational requirements for th funeral director are far less than the occupations of client families sitting in his or her arrangement room108 the issue of education in the summer of 1999 david r pearson of the nfda asserted todays state laws are

its credit hour equivalent to be accredited bigelow notes that it had taken 10 years to implement this level which had been discussed for 70 years114 almost immediately thereafter campaign was launched to set the requirement for funeral directors and embalmers at the ba level these initiatives met mixed reception with in the industry the reasons varied while some viewed increased education as an essential requirement for professional status and for dealing with the challenges of the field others saw it as superfluous115 there were structural impediments to change as well generally speaking educational institutions cannot grant b achelors degree without approval from some type of state higher education board it is unlikely observed john kroshus of the university of minnesotas program of mortuary science that community colleges and private mortuary colleges would be able to secure any such approval somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30697crs24 116 afd college executives p 28 see

scope of training and the rights and duties of the parties at interest are formalized and monitored under by the apprenticeship bureau at th department of labormay have feared that the traditional schools would be sw allowed up by the fouryear colleges116 finally there was the matter of costs not the costs of education but those flowing from heightened expectations on the part of better educated workers board director bigelow observed lot of fune ral directors feel that if you upgrade the degree then the graduating students will demand higher salaries and thats going to cost their businesses more he added the fi nancial issue and th fear of driving costs up is on their minds117 kroshus of minnesota affirmed the funeral business would have to demonstrate that re wards in the form of salaries fringe benefits and personal satisfaction are present in sufficient quan tity to make the educational effort worthwhile118 but eugene ogrodnik of the pittsburgh institute of mortuary science was not optimistic pr actically speaking the funeral service industry unfortunately is not ready to deliver the compensation package that goes with bachelors degree truly shame119 the apprenticeship requirement apprentice training normally is part of the licensing program for funeral direct ors and embalmers and is thus one of the qualifying criteria for entry into the field the process varies somewhat from state to state and is governed by state regula tion ordinarily the prospective apprentice secures employment and then enters fo rmal program of instruction leading to licensing in the craft the length of pprenticeship differs from one state to another it is usually from one to two years again depending upon state practice apprenticeship can be served before during or after mortuary school120 speaking generally because state requirements may vary apprenticeship in the funeral services industry is organized nd conducted by the employer usually it appears under the general supervisi on of the state licensing agency121 generally there is union involved the apprentice works with the employer training is onthejob and at least in some st ates without direc tly related classroom instruction the latter it appears ma be conducted separate ly and independently from apprenticeship salary is arranged between the employer and the apprenticehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30697crs25 122 sacks opportunities in funeral services careers pp 3839 123 louis misantone teaching our most important skills an obligation of the elders the

utility worker122 onthejob training suggests louis misantone president funeral institute of the north east happens in situations with little structure the content of the instruction and the manner of its presenta tion appear to rest with the individual employer or licensed practitioner in his employ misantone notes that students consistently report resistance by their on the job instructors in part perhaps because of reluctance to impart skills to potential competitors who may be younger and command lower wages123 but the system can be effective observes marvin grant of east mississippi community college provided that the embalmer preceptors are trained in proper instruction techniques and are willing to commit themselves to actually teaching in stead of looking for cheap labor124 licensure all states it appears except colorado require f uneral directors and embalmers to be licensed but licensi ng requirements vary from state to state some states have separate licensing requirements for directors and for embalmers some issue joint license this may lead to separate or joint curricula in the various states and within the states variety of licenses may be allowed125 regulations are about as varied as the united states notes nick verrastro in the american funeral director with 24 different types of licenses equally diverse are the requirements for securing license for individual licenses initial application fees range from nil to 300 while renewal fees are from 10 to 300 licenses have to be renewe d annually in 29 states and every two years in 19 he explained126 further terry mcenany of commonwealth institute of funeral service houston states that licensure requirements reflect the minimum education and training an individual is re quired to obtain to practice127 and since educational and apprenticeship requirements vary from state to state evaluating the relative strength of license may be somewhat problematichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30697crs26 128 pearson improving funeral service through education p 5 129 bruce overton positive movement in licensing mobility the american funeral director jan 1999 p 22with wagehour requirements depende nt upon licensure under the pending legislation during recent cong resses some uniformity may be desirable lack of uniformity could raise other concerns there are now 50 different licensing laws that effectively restrict persons ability to practice observes david pearson of the nfda128 the states however may have some reluctance to recognize each others requirements in 1999 the nfda proposed reciprocity standard for submission to the states recognizing beforehand that each state will attempt to tweak the plan the nfdas bruce overton opined that the best way to achieve universal endorsement or reciprocity is to have universal educational standards129 meanwhile however statebys tate variation persists some policy considerations through the past several c ongresses legislation has been proposed that would have excluded any employee employed as licensed funeral director or licensed embalmer from minimum wage and overtime pay protec tion under the fair labor standards act had the gislation been adopted th ere would be minimum wage required under federal law for the targeted workers and requi rement that overtime rates be paid after 40 hours of work per week the motivation for such an exemption seems to be twofold first to reduce the cost to the em ployer of doing business and second to enhance employer flex ibility in manpower utilization in support of the pr oposed exempti on some have argued that the funeral industry operates under conditi ons that make flsa oblig ations unusually onerous eg that deathcare employers are small businesses that the hours of work are often irregular that the requirements of the flsa are convoluted and difficult to understand none of these basic contentions appears to be especially unique to the funeral industry nor are the underlying ssumptions upon which they rest necessarily beyond challenge others have suggest ed that licensed funeral directors and embalmers are professionals and should be exempt from minimum wage and overtime pay coverage on that basis it may be difficult to argue that deathcare at large constitutes small business during the past 10 to 15 years there have been major changes in the funeral services industry the primary change it appears has been its ongoing transformation from collection of small family firms into substantial national and international corporate entities small firms however remain more numerous than the consolidated firms though some suggest that it is the latter that are now the driving force in the industry with consolidation there has been change in the industrys economic structure the manner in which it does business ie bulk purchasing economies of scale clustering of facilities and c ooperative utilization of staff nd equipment all of this has widened the gulf between the cons olidators and the traditional momandpop operations t hough i ndustry spokespersons s till present funeral directors as

deathcare profession in an independently ownedoperated establishment today in deathcare june 1999 p 16 in her article the richmond va funeral director explains with respect to the consolidators performance and loyalty from an employee are often oversha dowed by what is most profitable for the company its matter of culture she sugge sts profitability is just as important in independent firms but the employee answers to one person and not to board of directors and stockholders in smaller family owned setting she concludes professional performance and loyalty to the company are important qualities 133 obviously individual cases may differ and be viewed differently the rutlin case is one example further the changes implied by the new section 13a1 standard will need to be taken into account beings and neighbors and fune ral homes as one of the last of the true family owned small businesses left in america130 the quintessential small business131 the proposed exemption from minimum wage nd overtime pay however would apply to small firms and to the consolidators like and one might argue the exemption might prove more useful to the larger firms in which labormanagement relations may be more impersonal and in which empl oyment patterns may be more concerned with immediate profit enhancement132 similarly there have been changes within the workforce serving the deathcare industry what was largely fiel d dominated by white males is becoming increasingly open to women and minorities there have also been changes in the amount of education required for licensed funeral directors and embalmers the associate degree 2 years of college w ith embalming school seems increasingly to be the norm with some states requiring further education and others requiring less the craft remains overwhelmingly nonunion with individual bargaining between employees regardless of education level and management and with management becoming increasingly corporate and distant although the work of embalmers and perh aps of funeral directors where the fields are not joined is clearly technical requiring significant levels of skill the department of labor has determined that it does not in general fit the concept of professional as set forth in regulations implementing flsa section 13a1 work requiring knowledge of an advanced ty pe in field of science or learning customarily acquired by prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study as distinguished from general academic education and from an apprenticeship in fact the traininge ducation of funeral director or embalmer seems more nearly to resemble that of skilled worker for example journeyman electrician acquired throug h onthejob training and related instruction in an academic setting133 it might be argued that the dol concept of professional for section 13a1 purposes is obsolete and in need of revi sion such revision if warranted could be effected through the rulemaking process or directly through gislative enactment recent legislative proposals would have acted directly provi ding categoricalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30697crs28 134 metcalf the 64000 question p 6 135 some have expressed concern about the phrasing employed as in the exemption suggesting that anyone doing the work of lic ensed funeral director or embalmer could be minimum wage and overtime pay exempt even though they might not actually be licensed 136 even if exempted from federal wagehour coverage under the flsa licensed funeral directors and licensed embalmers could be protected under state wagehour lawexemption for employers of the targeted funeral directors nd embalmers from flsa minimum wage and overtime pay requirements thus there have been qualifying tests for exemption as is currently pr ovided under section 13a1 of the act neither with respect to the worker nor the employer with respect to the targeted workers the minimum wage and overtime pay protections of the flsa would have disappeared licensing for funeral director s and embalmers is left to the states with standards differing in various ways from one jurisdic tion to another requirements for securing license are left up to the states some are stringent others far less so the states are also allowed to determine when license is to be issued that is whether the license functions in effect as an entr permit or certifica tion elimination of minimum wage and overtime pay for licensed funeral directors and embalmers would seem to set arguably premium upon licen sing prospective funeral director or embalmer early in the training process for example tommy metcalf of sci and the state licensing board of texas when questioned about increased educational requirements for funeral directors suggested that it could result in institution of tier license program as in the nursing fiel d ie practical nur licensed vocational nurse registered nurse etc134 in effect the legislation which does not define licensed or set qualifica tions for being licensed w ould transfer authority over definition of the flsa exemption from the department of labor where it now rests under section 13a1 to the indi vidual states thus one impact could be for some states to reduce the stringency of the licensing requirement per while at the same time mandating period of postlicensing apprenticeship thereby securing cheaper and more flexible body of workers135 much would depend upon the political dynamics of the state which under the proposed legislation would potentially become the arbiter of wagehour standa rds for funeral dir ectors and embalmers apprenticeship requirements like those for licensing vary from one state to another depending upon the jurisdiction apprenticeship can be served before during or after mortuary sc hool usually through one to two years critical question might be whether apprenticeship necessarily precedes licensure could license be awarded under state regulation following ones academic training and requisite board examinations but prior to completion of term of apprenticeship for labor standards purposes timing may be of some importance where the proposed changes of law are concerned would apprenticeship be prelicensing requirement served at time when the apprentice is protected under flsa minimum wage and overtime pay standards or would it be mandated as postlicensing continuing education requirement served at time when the apprentice would not be covered by flsa wage and hour protections unaddr essed in the legislation the issue would be left to state regulatory boards136httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30697crs29 137 james r fernald funeral service industry bangor daily news apr 21 2000 138 fields grim time for funeral firms part c p 1 139 bryce merchant of death p

of meeting these pressures though it would impact both large and small fi rms would be to cut labor costs an exemption from the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements of the flsa could be viewed as step in that dir ection what benefits it might have for individual workers may be less clear in the 108th congress and beyond all at once during the 108th congress the system seemed to change yet on the other hand it may not have changed at all the implications are somewhat less than precise and may require deciphering amendment of the flsa as during recent congresses proposals dealing with the minimum wage and overtime pay treatment of licensed funera l directors and licensed embalmers were introduced in the 108th congress identical bills hr 2065 tiberi and s 292 graham sc would have amended the flsa by addi ng new paragraph section 13a4 which would directly exempt an employer of any employee employed as licensed funeral director or licensed embalmer from the overtime pay and minimum wage requirements of the act there would be under the proposal exemption tests neither of earnings nor of duties the bills were referred respectively to the house committee on education and the workforce and to the senate co mmittee on health education labor and pensions neither bill was acted upon each died at the close of the 108th congress but if the past is any indication one mig ht expect to see additional bills proposed with time altering department of labor regulations on april 23 2004 the department of labor promulgated new regulations governing section 13a1 of the flsa the provision as noted above deals with exemptions from overtime pay and by ex tension of minimum wage for certain workers identified as executive administrative or professional the exemption is now in

register apr 23 2004 p 22266under its terms there is twofold test of exemption first it provides an income test if person earns less than 23660 he or she is automatically non exempt the worker may also have been ex empt under the prior arrangement because of his or her duties second if an employee is engaged in activity that is deemed by the department to be of character suggestive of executive administrative or professional and he or she earns in excess of 23660 then he or she may also be exempt while the earnings test may have little impact good many funeral directors andor embalmers may earn more than 23660 the duties test could have significant impact thus are funera l directors andor embalmers actually professional as defined by dol for exem ption under section 13 a1 or merely highly trained technicians john h fitch representing the national funeral directors association before committee of the congress explained the disparity between the department and the industry on the matter of over time pay the nfdas pos ition is based on the belief that licensed funeral directors and embalmers comply with the duties test of the current flsa implementing regulations for professionals the department of labor he stated has historically disagreed with nfda on this issue he explained that the final rule was changed slightly but it is the first time the department of labor has r ecognized licensed funeral directors and embalmers as professionals140 the final rule provides licensed f uneral directors and embalmers who are licensed by and working in state that requires successful completion of four academic years of preprofessional and professional study including graduation from college of mortuary science accredited by the american board of funeral
