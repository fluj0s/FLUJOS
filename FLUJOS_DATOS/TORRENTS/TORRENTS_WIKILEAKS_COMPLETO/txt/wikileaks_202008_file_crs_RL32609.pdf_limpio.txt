also recommended that the overall amount of money being appropriated for national intelligence longer should remain secret and that congress should pass separate ppropriations act for intelligence3 it also said that because it believed that c ongressional oversight for intelligence is not functioning adequately congress should establish ither joint committee on intelligence based on the model of the joint committee on atomic energy or single committee in each house of congress that combines au thorizing and appropriating authorities4 the commission made this recommendation after it concluded that the director of central intelligence dci has too many jobs ie to run the central intelligence agency to manage the loose confederation of 15 agencies or parts of agencies that comprise the
