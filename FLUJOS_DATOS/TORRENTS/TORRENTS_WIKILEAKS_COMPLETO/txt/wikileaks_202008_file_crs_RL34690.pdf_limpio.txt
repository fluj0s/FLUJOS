1971 the 1971 act protects wild horses and burros on federal lands and places them under the jurisdiction of the bureau of land management blm and the forest service fs management and potential slaughter of wild horses and burros have long been controversial current blm assessment of options to reduce the number of wild horses and burros on the range and reduce costs of program management has renewed focus on the issue under the 1971 act the agencies inventory horse and burro populations on federal land to determine appropriate management levels amls they are authorized to remove animals exceeding the ranges carrying capacity first the agencies are to destroy old sick or lame animals by the most humane means available second they are to remove healthy animals for private adoption third if adoption demand is insufficient the remaining healthy animals are to be destroyed however the agencies have not used this authority since 1982 the 108 th congress enacted changes to wild horse and burro management one change provided tool in addition to adoptions for reducing wild horse and burro populations the agencies were directed to sell without limitation excess animals or their rema ins that essentially are deemed too old or otherwise unable to be adopted blm has not achieved reduction to the national aml27219 for all herds there were an estimated 33000 wild horses and burros on blm lands as of february 29 2008 another 30489 animals were in agency holding facilities as of october 2008 blm estimates that nearly three quarters of its fy2008 appropriation for wild horses and burros is used to hold animals in facilities blm has been examining options to achieve aml and reduce program costs one is whether to cease the removal of animals from the range second option is whether to destroy healthy animals under the authority provided in the 1971 act third option is whether to sell animals without limitation as provided in the 108th congress changes thus far

individual has expressed interest in purchasing thousands of excess animals which possibility is being discussed and developed with blm several other issues remain controversial they include the priority given wild horses and burros in land use decisions whether and to what extent to remove animals from the range the disposal of healthy animals through the adoption and sales programs the

thought to have been first brought to the americas by spanish explorers around 1500 those that escaped became the first wild horse herds in north america with feral populations spreading throughout the southwest in the 16th and 17th centuries native americans incorporated horses and burros into their culture and wild and domesticated populations spread throughout the west wild populations increased when animals escaped from or were released from ranching and mining activities in the 19 th and 20th centuries1 at the turn of the 20th century an estimated 2 million wild horses may have lived on the range by the 1950s their population was thought to be fewer than 20000 public concern developed over falling populations and instances of inhumane treatment by profiteers who captured and sold the animals for slaughter protection movement culminated in the wild horse annie act of 1959 18 usc 47 and later in the wild freeroaming horses and burros act of 1971 hereinafter the 1971 act 16 usc 1331 et seq 2 the 1971 act seeks to preserve wild horses and burros on federal lands as living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the west it imposes criminal penalties for removing converting to private use killing harassing selling or processing into commercial products wild horses and burros with some exceptions under federal jurisdiction unless given federal authority management responsibility is assigned to the bureau of land management blm in the depa rtment of the interior and the forest service fs in the department of agriculture the anim als are to be managed

sick or lame anim als by the most humane means available second they are to remove healthy animals for private doption blm takes the lead in gathering animals and holding adoptions for both agencies third if adoption demand is insufficient the remaining healthy animals are to be destroyed however the agencies have not used this authority since 1982 the 108 th congress enacted changes to the 1971 act re garding wild horse and burro management on federal lands pl 108447 142 to provide an additional tool for reducing wild horse and burro populations one change directed the agencies to sell

products third change removed criminal penalties for processing into commercial products the remains of wild horse or burro if it is sold under the new authority these changes have been supported as providing costeffective way of helping the agencies achieve aml to improve the health of the animals protect range resources and restore natural ecological balance on federal lands the changes have been opposed as potentially leading to the slaughter of healthy animals in the 110 th congress the house passed hr 249overturn the 108th congress changes further action was taken specifically the bill sought to repeal the sale authority reimpose ban on the sale of wild horses and burros and their remains for processing into commercial products and reinstate criminal penalties for processing the remains into commercial products4 horses greatly outnumber burros on federal land about half of all the animals are in nevada blm has set the upper limit for aml for all herds at 27219 there were an estimated 28500 wild horses and burros on 199 blm herd management areas hmas as of april 1 2007 this was the lowest level since the early 1970s and was the closest to aml since that time in part due to reduced emphasis on removals the number of wild horses and burros on the range increased to an estimated 33000 as of february 29 2008 this diminished the possibility of achieving aml at least in the nearterm there were another 3180 wild horses and burros on 37 active territories fs management areas as of september 30 2006 5 thousands of additional animals are in agency holding facilities see below reaching the national aml has eluded blm blm had reached aml in 145 of the 201 hmas that existed in 2006 but estimated decline to 96 of 199 hmas for 20086 likely reasons may include underestimates of populations on the rang the high population growth rate of horses and burros virtual absence of natural predators inadequate funding insufficient interest in adoptions and sales and poor program management currently animals that are removed are offered for adoption or sale or sent to holding facilities g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 federal management of wild horses and burros has generated controversy and lawsuits for years key issues for congress have included the adequacy of authorities for managing wild horses and burros and achieving aml on federal lands the effectiveness of agency management of wild horses and burros and of options for achieving aml and the sufficiency of funding for managing wild horses and burros and achieving aml 4 some of the debate on this bill extended to horse slaughter more generally and consumption of horses by humans these issues and related legislation

of wild horse and burro management has renewed attention to the issue the agency is evaluating management options on the grounds that current and projected program funding is insufficient for the ongoing removal of animals from the range and their longterm care in holding facilities the agency cites recent increases in energy prices as contributing factor noting that the energy cost for transportation and feed increased by nearly 4 million from fy2007 to fy2008 the agency further contends that additional management options are needed because leaving wild horses and burros on the range given current rates of reproduction would be an ecological disaster 7 the blm has been focusing on whether to implement three specific options which have been contentious one is whether to destroy healthy animals under the authority in the 1971 act the euthanization of healthy animals has been opposed by horse advocates as inhumane and as unnecessary given other management options the second option is whether to sell animals without limitation as provided in the 108 th congress changes in law thus far the agency has focused on sales to buyers intending to provide longterm care this option has been opposed on the grounds that these animals could end up being sold for slaughter the third option is to cease the removal of animals from the range8 blm has expressed that stopping removals would be destructive to the range view shared by some range users these options are discussed in the pertinent sections below more recently blm has been evaluating options fo r managing wild horses and burros included in an october 2008 report by the government accountability office gao9 the agency also is examining the recommendations agreed to by the wild horse and burro advisory board at its november 17 2008 meeting further the agency is in discussions with private individual who has expressed interest in purchasing thousands of excess wild horses and burros this idea as well as the recommendations of gao and the advisory board are discussed in the final sections of this report

and burros versus domestic livestock in decisions on forage and land allotments critics assert that amls are set low to favor livestock the secretaries may designate specific ranges exclusively for wild horse and burros in practice most areas also have livestock currently livestock graze on approximately 160 million acres of blm land and 93 million acres of fs land while wild horses and burros roam on 290 million blm acres and 25 million fs acres together with intermingled state tribal and private lands wild horses and burros roam on 343 million acres in the west this is reduction of 192 million acres from the level that existed following enactment of the 1971 act535 million acres of the 192 million acres about 13 million were in blm ownership these lands were closed to wild horses and burros by blm due to new laws regula tions or land use planning decisions the remaining 6 million acres were in private or other ownership which the owners closed to wild horses and burros 10 7

g20g142g150g152g159g138g149g561 longstanding controversy is whether to remove wild horses and burros from the range some animal rights and conservation groups believe they should roam freely others stand by 1990 government accountability office gao conclusion that removals have not demonstrably improved range conditions in part because livestock consume more forage and cause more degradation to riparian areas 12 other wildlife conservation and livestock interests agree that reduction of horse herds protects range resources and balances wild horse and burro levels with wildlife and domestic livestock many livestock groups contend that wild horses and burros are more environmentally destructive than domestic stock because they graze yearround without limit whereas the time place and quantity of cattle grazing is controlled where drought fire and other emergencies reduce forage domestic livestock usually are removed first to protect forage for wild horses and burros according to blm the debate on the extent of damage by wild horses and burros versus livestock continues because of value differences and lack of definitive data on forage consumed and range degradation determining amls and removing animals to achieve amls are controversial concerns involve the lack of an overall environmental analysis of removal efforts throughout the west removal of animals below aml and removal of entire herds blm is determining amls based on population censuses and range monitoring in tandem with removal efforts objectives include establishing or maintaining an ecological balance on the land and providing for land health the determinations involve maintaining multiple use in the area according to blm the agency takes into account natural resources such as wildlife and vegetation and land uses such as grazing and recreation other considerations include the biological and social needs of the herds and the genetic diversity needed to maintain healthy wild horse and burro populations amls generally are reviewed every four years as part of horse gathers and removals and may be revised as circumstances and conditions change while 317 herd areas were identified initially blm currently manages wild horses and burros in 199 herd management areas some herds were combined while others were removed because they roamed on private lands or were not suitable to retain according to blm other removal issues have included the effect on the genetic viability of herds increased reproduction of remaining horses and accuracy of supporting data as shown in table 1 more horses and burros were removed from the range in recent years than could be adopted specifically over the nineyear period from fy2000 through fy2008 total of 87867 animals were removed while 53738 were adopted 61 however the number of burros adopted during the period exceeded the number of burros removed while only 56 of the removed horses were adopted 11 an aum is the amount of forage to

reach aml another factor contributing to the higher removal rates was the reduction of available forage due to fire drought and other weather conditions blm has asserted that the 2007 closing of all three commercial processing plants within the united states has put an additional 90000 domestic horses annually in the adoption market13 the competition for adoption between these domestic horses and the wild horses and burros removed from the range may increase the difficulty of adopting the wild animals further blm claims that recent higher fuel and feed costs have weakened interest in adoption critics contend that removals have been high because disproportionate share of funding is used for removal versus adoption blm has been considering whether to cease removing animals from the range in part because adoptions have not kept pace with removals and because of the costs of placing removed animals in longterm holding facilities however the agency has expressed that this option would result in insufficient nutrition for increasing larger horse and burro herds and would lead to damage of soil vegetation riparian areas and wildlife habitat 14 ceasing removals would likely be opposed by ranchers who depend on federal lands for forage g3g141g152g153g157g146g152g151g561 the primary disposal method for healthy animals has been through adoption from fy1972 to fy2008 279961 horses and burros were removed of which 225420 were adopted others died of natural causes were sent to holding facilities or were sold the base fee to adopt wild horse or burro is minimum of 125 although the blm director may reduce or waive the fee in most cases competitive bidding is used and the fee is the highest bid over the base new owners can receive title after oneyear wait with certification of proper care during that time an individual may receive title to more than four animals per year blm has established other conditions for the transportation feeding and care of wild horses and burros the current adoption process stems in part from past concerns that some adopted animals were slaughtered from 1984 to 1988 approximately 20000 horses were placed with largescale adopters without fee hundreds of them died of starvation or dehydration during the oneyear probationary period and thousands were slaughtered soon after title passed according to the 1990 gao report public protest led blm to resume charging an adoption fee further changes followed reports in 1997 that wild horses were sold to slaughterhouses and charges denied by blm of related misconduct by some employees changes required adopters to certify that they have intent to sell their animals for slaughter established monitoring program with slaughterhouses and federal inspectors to return untitled animals intended

longer be considered as falling within the purview of this chapterupon passage of title 16 usc 1333d1 the agency seeks to protect horses and burros through efforts to place them with qualified adopters and subsequent monitoring for one year by contrast animal advocacy groups contend that the legislative history and intent of the 1971 act show that titled animals were to be protected indefinitely from slaughter they further note that adopters are to certify that they have intent to sell their wild horse or burro for slaughter or bucking stock or for processing into commercial products controversy over this at testation has centered on how long it should last and the extent to which it can be enforced in court g21g138g149g142g561 as result of stepped up removals in recent years large numbers of excess animals for which there is demand for adoption are being held in facilities see below in this context the 108 th congress provided tool in addition to adoption to reduce wild horse and burro populations congress directed blm to sell excess animals that were older or deemed unadoptable under law these animals are to be sold without limitation for instance the law does not set minimum purchase price maximum number of animals an individual may purchase or standards for the type or length of care to be provided support for the sales has been strong among livestock groups and others animal activists and other groups have questioned its desirability primarily due to concerns that sold animals may end up being sent to slaughter according to the blm approximately 8000 animals are available for sale with approximately 2900 sold since the inception of the programfar fewer than the agency had anticipated blm negotiates sales of excess animals for instance with ranchers tribes and humane organizations with the price determined on casebycase basis the average price per animal sold during fy2006 was about 15 the most recent data available on april 25 2005 blm temporarily suspended the sale of wild horses and burros because some of the animals it sold ended up being sent to slaughter the agency did not sell animals directly for slaughter and was requiring purchasers to give written affirmation of an intent to provide humane care nevertheless 41 sold animals were resold or traded and then sent to slaughterhouses another 52 animals were so ld to slaughterhouses but ford motor co committed to purchasing them on may 19 2005 the agency resumed sales after revising its bill of sale and presale negotiation procedures to protect against slaughter purchasers now also must agree not to sell or transfer ownership to those intending to resell trade or give away animals for processing into commercial products sales contracts also incorporate criminal penalties for anyone who knowingly or willfu lly falsifies or conceals information some horse advocates question whether the penalties would withstand legal challenge because the 2004 law provides for the sale of animals without limitation also according to blm purchased animals are classified as private property free of federal protection blm currently is considering whether to sell an imals without limitation as specified in law this might include discontinuing the conditions the agency has imposed to promote longterm care this has renewed concerns among animal supporters and other groups that these animals might once again end up being sent to slaughter

considering whether to use its authority in law to destroy healthy wild horses and burros blm had used this authority to euthanize about 2000 healthy animals before 1982 when the agency suspended euthanization due to negative public reaction15 the agency has focused subsequently on providing longterm care for healthy unadoptable animals at contracted holding facilities pastures further blm was specifically prohibited by the annual interior appropriations acts for fy1988fy2004 from usin g its authority to destroy healthy animals16 this prohibition was omitted from the fy2005 appropriations act pl 108447 which instead made changes to wild horse and burro management to reduce excess populations one change directed the agencies to sell excess wild horses and burros while another removed ban on the sale of animals for processing into commercial products as outlined in the background section above euthanization of healthy wild horses and burros has long been controversial and the current blm assessment of whether to use this authority has renewed the debate the agency has expressed need to consider all management options due to the inability to date to reach aml and the improbability of doing so under current management practices and funding levels some animal advocacy and other groups have opposed euthanization as inhumane instead some have advocated expansion of existing programs or practi ces such as fertility control or new options for instance tax benefits for landowners who would allow wild horses and burros to roam on their property

which for some animals may be years the unadoptable ones such as older animals will be sold or live out their lives in longterm facilities extensive use of holding facilities has prompted number of issues including whether to remove more horses than can be adopted whether the cost of holding is too high see below and whether animals in longterm facilities receive appropriate care blm has been

wild horses and burros are thought to reproduce at rate of about 20 yearly to slow reproduction research is developing fertility controls in selected areas blm has tested one and twoyear vaccines on mares the primary agent being testedporcine zona pellucida pzpis not commercially available but is being tested under an investigational exemption issued by the food and drug administration since 2004 blm has administered the two year contraceptive to 1808 captured mares in 47 hmas the animals were then returned to the range one limitation is that the vaccine has not been approved for general use 17 second limitation of the vaccine is that it must be administered three to four months be fore breeding for maximum effectiveness still third limitation is the difficulty of capturing enough mares in herd for the treatment to be effective the extent of its effectiveness in the areas being tested will be assessed when the 47 herds are next gathered depending on the herd the gather will occur between 2008 and 2012 blm continues to work with the us geological survey and the humane society to assess the effectiveness of vaccines over several years and to develop vaccine that would last at least three years and could be approved as safe for general use other research efforts focus on improving the current vaccines and the methods of administering them such as through remote delivery advocates of fertility control assert that it improves the genetic viability and health of the horses as well as foal survival by delaying pregnancy in younger mares some view fertility control as less stressful and disruptive to horses than removals and worth more emphasis opponents contend that fertility control meddles with nature and that its longterm effect on the behavior and size of herds is uncertain some favor natural controls such as disease and starvation g5g152g156g157g156g561 whether funding is sufficient to care for wild horses and burros achieve aml and reduce long term budgetary needs has been unclear appropriations for blm for managing wild horses and burros increased 78 from fy2000 204 million to fy2008 363 million18 the biggest increase occurred from fy2000 to fy2001 when blm received 69 increase to 345 million to achieve aml over several years and by fy2010 reduce budgetary needs below the fy2001 level the fy2009 request of 370 million would be 2 increase over fy200819 an annual appropriation for wild horses and burros for fy2009 has not been enacted to date concerns over costs have prompted questions about managing wild horses and burros one question is whether the average cost of adoptio n estimated at 994 per animal can be reduced another question is whether animals can be moved more quickly through the adoption and sales systems or into longterm facilities as the cost of shortterm facilities is relatively high508 per animal per day this cost has increased from 300 per animal per day in 2001 by comparison the average cost paid to contractors to care for animals in longterm facilities is 127 per animal per day nearly the same as the cost in 2001122 20 blm estimates that the cost of holding animals in all facilities in fy2008 will be nearly threequarters of its 17 blm fact sheet on blms wild horse and burro fertility control program available on the blm website at httpwwwblmgov 18 figures used throughout this report represent current dollars 19 total appropriations to the fs for wild horses and burros are not available for fy2008 the fs expected to transfer 15 million to the blm as reimbursement for gatherin g

agency estimates that to support its current removal and holding practices the agencys appropriation would need to rise to 85 million in fy201221 other questions involve whether additional funds could supplement appropriations for instance one question is whether longterm facilities could become financially selfsufficient through fundraising and donations as some had expected when the first facilities were created related issue is whether the current base adoption fee of 125 could be increased to generate more money for the program for fy2008 blm estimates collecting 650000 in adoption fees contrarily some support reducing the base adoption fee to promote adoptions collection from sales of wild horse and burros in fy2006 were estimated at 9447 this is significantly lower than expected in large part because the number of animals sold and the purchase price per animal have been relatively low still other ideas have included allowing proceeds of land disposals to be used for wild horse and burro management selling horse sponsorships and creating privately managed sanctuaries

conducted yearlong review of blms wild horse and burro program specifically the agency examined blms progress in setting and meeting aml management of animals through adoption sales and holding facilities controls to ensure humane treatment of animals and long term management challenges gao reached several conclusions about the program and recommended that the secretary of the interior direct blm to take related actions it found that while blm has made significant progress in setting and meeting aml the agency has not provided specific guidance to field offices to achieve consistency in establishing amls gao recommended that blm issue wild horse and burro handbook that contains policy for determining aml to ensure that amls are set consistently across herds further gao concluded that the directcount method many blm field offices use to conduct population counts which reports the number of animals actually seen on the ground results in undercounting the animals such undercounts in turn lead to the removal of fewer animals than needed and costlier gathers of animals in the future gao recommended that blm use statistically based methods to improve the accuracy of estimations of animal populations such as those being developed by researchers under one approach for instance two or more separate aerial counts are performed during each count the animals are photographed then the photos are compared to determine which animals were identified and which were not seen during each count an estimate of the total number missed is based on the number that were missed during each count gao also concluded that blm has implemented many controls to foster humane treatment of wild horses and burros including for animals gathered held in facilities adopted and sold the controls involved establishing standard operating procedures conducting inspections and monitoring collecting data and implementing protections against slaughter of sold animals however blm does not regularly provide information to the public on treatment of animals and doing so would improve transparency according to gao 21 blm factsheet

at its november 17 2008 meeting the wild horse and burro advisory board made 19 recommendations to blm regarding management of wild horses and burros the blm is evaluating the recommendations and expects to address them at the next meeting of the advisory board currently scheduled for february 23 2009 the recommendations relate to enhancing the adoption and sale of animals euthanizing animal s slowing population growth securing sufficient funding and providing care through livestock permits among other matters 22 in the area of adoptions the advisory boards recommendations included that blm explore the feasibility of semiprivatizing the adoption program another was that the blm support an expansion of the work of the mustang heri tage foundation nonprofit organization that facilitates the adoption of wild horses and burros several recommendations pertained to increasing the sale of animals one was for blm to offer animals for sale if they are 10 years old or younger if they have not been adopted after three attempts as provided for in law other proposals to sell eligible animals were that blm market them overseas and explore opportunities to sell them abroad for agricultural nonfood use still another was that blm offer organizations with existing adoptionsale networks the option of adopting or purchasing groups of animals for virtual adoptions or sale to approved homes except for this last recommendation these recommendations to boost sales included the specific proviso that the animals be sold with the intent clause which was designed to protect against slaughter the intent clause is currently used for animals sold by the blm under the sale authority enacted in the 108 th congress the language which is included on the bill of sale states that the purchaser agrees not to knowingly sell or transfer ownership of any listed wild horses andor burros to any person or organization with an intention to resell trade or give away the animals for processing into commercial products blm began using this language in 2005 after some of the animals it had sold were later sent to slaughter however the board recommended that as last resort animals that are eligible for sale but that are not sold or adopted after 30 days be offered for sale without limitation and without the intent clause or be humanely euthanized under current law without limitation would imply making the animals available for sale without restrictions and without provisions designed to foster humane care for instance the bill of sale currently also includes language that the purchaser agrees to provide humane care to the listed wild horses andor burros removing the intent clause would allow for sale without buyers commitment not to resell for slaughter the possibility of sale without limitations and without the intent clause has accentuated concerns 22 the recommendations are on the blm website at httpwwwblmgovwosteninfonewsroom2008november nr_11_19_2008html

for slaughter further the inclusion of euthanization among the recommendations even as last resort also has been controversial the blm subsequently expressed that the agency prefers not to sell the animals without limitation or to humanely euthanize those for which there is adoption demand as provided in the 1971 act23 issues associated with selling and euthanizing healthy animals are discussed in above sections of this report also with regard to euthanasia the advisory board recommended that veterinarian be present at all emergency gathers of wild horses and burros animals should be humanely euthanized if they show signs of disease stress or other conditions that would make them susceptible to life threatening illness if moved into holding facilities to slow population growth the advisory board developed several recommendations among them were that blm explore additional fertility control methods that might be permanent for stallions or mares consider establishing nonreproductive herds make changes to the ratio of females to males in herds to favor males and consider and utilize unproven field techniques on conditional basis the board recommended that blm not use spaying and vasectomies unless proven safe practical and effective recommendations to secure sufficient funding included that blm seek additional dedicated funding for at least two herd management areas in nevada per year the money would be used in herds that were at or near aml in order to reduce population growth to offset the costs of long term holding the advisory board proposed that blm explore assistance agreements with wild horse advocacy groups for instance with the save the mustang fund to raise money specifically for longterm care two other proposals pertained to livestock permitspermittees they involved having blm provide information to groups and individuals who may be interested in acquiring grazing permits to provide longterm private care for adopted or purchased animals or in contracting with existing permittees to provide longterm care

limitations according to the proponent the horses would be ca red for in sanctuary in order to protect the wild horse as living icon of the american west the sanctuary also may be refuge for other horses such as thoroughbred exracehorses it would be open to tourists with the hope that it would be popular tourist destination like some national parks formal proposal to purchase wild horses has
