admitted2 the federal courts when called upon to establish ethical standards for attorneys appearing before them generally adopted the rules of the states in which they were located early in 1980 the

of that tribunal which in the vast majority of cases would be federal rather than state court otherwise they are bound by the rules of the local federal court where they ordinarily perform their

associations model code of professional conduct declares that in representing client lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized by law to do so the earlier aba code of professional responsibility declares that during the course of his representation of client lawyer shall not 1 communicate or cause another to communicate on the subject of the representation with party he knows to be represented by lawyer in that matter unless he has the prior consent of the lawyer representing such other party or is authorized by law to do so 2 give advice to person who is not represented by lawyer other than the advice to secure counsel if the interests of such person are or have reasonable possibility of being in conflict with the interests of his client dr 7104a disciplinary rule 7104a is itself successor to provision in the early aba canons of ethics aba canon 9 lawyer should not in any way communicate upon the subject of controversy with party represented by counsel much less should he undertake to negotiate or compromise the matter with him but should deal only with his counsel it is incumbent upon the lawyer most particularly to avoid everything that may tend to mislead party not represented by counsel and he should not undertake to advise him as to the law murtha amendment ie remote from the enforcement mechanisms of state bar counsel whenever they are employed in state other than the one in which they have chosen to be licensed the proposal also addresses potential limitations on the use of undercover investigations stings and other forms of undercover investigation are highly valued law enforcement techniques for any number of reasons including the fact that federal prosecutors are now more likely to direct supervise or advise those conducting undercover investigations conflicts have arisen under two sets of rules the contact rules and the honesty rules the contact rules formulated in order to prevent lawyers from taking unfair advantage of unsophistica ted laymen prohibit attorneys from approaching represented client unbeknownst to the clients lawyer9 for any number of reasons law enforcement undercover investigations will ordinarily not be considered violation of the contact rule in most jurisdictions but there are exceptions eg united states v hammad 858 f2d 834 83940 2d cir 1988 the bill leaves thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31221crs6 10 in order

c engage in conduct involving dishonesty fraud deceit or misrepresentation its predecessors disclipinary rules dr7102a5 and dr1102a4 of the aba model code of professional responsibility are similarly worded in one form or another they are in effect in virtually every jurisdiction 12 the response of the oregon bar to criticism of its interpretation of its rule is that law enforcement agents are not bound by ethics rules and can continue to conduct undercover operations without attorney involvement this reflects completely unrealistic view of contemporary law enforcement and is terrible public policy to boot prosecutors conduct investigations because they have to there is way to conduct gang investigation or an organized crime investigation or investigation of largescale drug operation effectively without the active involvement of prosecutors moreover this is how it should be the value of attorneys direct involvement in investigations cannot be overestimated attorneys are wellschooled in the law and can help ensure that investigations stay within constitutional bounds there are many areas of the law that are highly complex and specialized in these areascivil and

uniform rules it anticipates will follow from the study it mandates10 the bill deals with the honesty rule issue more directly the honesty rules ban attorneys from making false statements during the course of their representation of client or from engaging in dishonest deceitful or fraudulent conduct under any circumstances11 the oregon supreme court has held that an attorney violates the honesty rules when he misidentifies himself and his purpose in the course of investigating possible fraud committed against client in re gatti 330 ore 517 8 p3d 966 2000 in doing so it refused to recognize law enforcement exception for either state or federal authorities 300 ore at 53033 8 p3d at 97476 it has been suggested that the problems presented by gatti could be overcome if federal prosecutors simply disassociated themselves from undercover investigations until the case was ready for prosecution the justice department replies that early attorney participation helps prevent constitutional violations and is more conducive to successful prosecution12 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31221crs7 13 the summary accompanying senator leahys introductory remarks makes it clear that the provision was drafted in response to gatti subsection d specifically addresses the situation in oregon where state court ruling has seriously impeded the ability of federal agents to engage in undercover operations
