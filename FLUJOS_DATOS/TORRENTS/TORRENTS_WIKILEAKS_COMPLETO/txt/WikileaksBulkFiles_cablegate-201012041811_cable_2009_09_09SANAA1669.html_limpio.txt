national security advisor john brennan president saleh pledged unfettered access to yemens national territory for us counterterrorism operations suggesting that in the process the usg assumed responsibility for the success or failure of efforts to neutralize aqap in yemen saleh expressed dissatisfaction with the usgs current level of aid for ct and security operations and insisted the royg began its war against the alhouthi rebellion in northern yemen on behalf of the us saleh stated his preference for saudi arabia over jordan as potential rehabilitation site for guantanamo detainees of yemeni origin but claimed the royg was willing and able to accept them in yemeni prisons in oneonone that followed brennan extended an invitation to saleh to visit president obama at the white house on october 6 end summary open land air and sea for us strikes against aqap 2 snf in september 6 meeting with deputy national security advisor john brennan president saleh insisted that yemens national territory is available for unilateral ct operations by the us dissatisfied with current levels of usg funding and military training provided to the roygs ct forces saleh asserted that the usg has produced only words but solutions to the terrorism issue in yemen saleh repeatedly requested more funds and equipment to fight alqaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap while at the same time placing responsibility for any future aqap attacks on the shoulders of the usg now that it enjoys unfettered access to yemeni airspace coastal waters and land note the usg has been actively engaged since 2001 in training elements of yemens ct forces including the counterterrorism unit ctu the yemen special operations force ysof the presidential guard the yemeni border troops yemen air force yaf and the yemen coast guard ycg the usg has expended over 115 million equipping ct forces since fy02 in 2009 alone us teams have instructed yemeni ct forces in training valued at 5 million end note 3 snf while saleh offered assurances that the royg is determined to continue the war against alqaeda because theyre targeting us and yemeni interests he continued to link increased us access to aqap targets with full responsibility for achieving ct goals highlighting the potential for future aqap attack on the us embassy or other western targets saleh said i have given you an open door on terrorism so i am not responsible the saada war the houthis are your enemies too 4 snf president saleh expressed his frustration with the usg refusal to view the saada war against the alhouthis in the north in the same light as the fight against aqap claiming need for increased aid and support saleh asserted that this war were launching is war on behalf of the usthe houthis are your enemies too citing videos of alhouthi followers chanting death to israel death to america note the houthis have not attacked us interests or personnel in the six rounds of fighting between the royg and the houthis that began in 2004 end note the usgs failure to view the houthis as terrorists and equip royg forces to fight them in saada undermines the usgs claims of friendship and cooperation according to saleh commenting on the status of royg forces in saada saleh said we are suffering lot of casualties and loss of material renewing his requests for armored personnel vehicles aircraft and medical evacuation vehicles saleh echoed his criticism of us efforts we need deeds not only words he said brennan responded that the usg is prohibited by law from providing military support to the royg to be used against the houthis since the usg considers the group domestic insurgency 5 snf restating claims of iranian support to the houthi movement royg officials present said they had provided files supporting an iranianhouthi connection to usg officials and would provide more if necessary note the ambassador acknowledged receiving file that was reviewed here and in washington however conclusive evidence of an iranianhouthi link has been made from these or other records brennan said that he would request fresh scrub of all available intelligence to see if it turned up any evidence of iranian involvement end note saleh said iran is trying to settle old scores against the us by ruining relations between yemen and gcc countries and the us he also made tangential reference to hezbollah claiming the organizations influence in the region also rendered the royghouthi war fight on behalf of the us referencing the high poverty rate and illicit arms flows into both yemen and somalia saleh concluded by saying if you dont help this country will become worse than somalia muddled messages on guantanamo detainees 6 snf saleh expressed his preference for the existing saudi arabia option as potential site for rehabilitating guantanamo detainees of yemeni origin over proposed jordanian option citing closer familial ties and cultural bonds in saudi arabia as mechanisms for more effective treatment saleh commented that he thought the jordanians were too poor8 to support rehabilitation program but did not dismiss jordan as an option however he signaled that rehabilitation is not his concern but rather the uss problem as he is ready and willing to accept all yemeni detainees into the yemeni prison system comment saleh would in our judgment be unable to hold returning detainees in jail for any more than matter of weeks before public pressure or the courts forced their release end comment saleh urged the usg to design and implement rehabilitation and education program for the detainees and to build rehabilitation center in yemen but reiterated that the us would have to fund these projects repeatedly asking how many dollars is the us going to bring however when brennan offered 500000 as an initial investment currently available for the crafting of rehabilitation program saleh dismissed the offer as insufficient saleh also assured brennan that he was committed to freeing the innocent people after complete and total rehabilitation suggesting lack of clarity on his own policy and on the status of guantanamo detainees in the royg legal system economic reform and corruption 7 snf saleh welcomed the letter from president obama that brennan handcarried and expressed appreciation for us concern over the stability and economic hardships facing the country he agreed to move forward with the 10point plan outlining necessary economic reforms reftel but did not provide details regarding dates or implementation goals responding to brennans concerns that economic and other assistance might be diverted through corrupt officials to other purposes saleh urged the us to donate supplies and hardware rather than liquid funds in order to curb corruptions reach saleh also told us officials that they could have full access to financial records to ensure proper usage of donor funding comment salehs preference for infrastructure and equipment over cash displays lack of confidence in his own regimes ability to handle liquid assets and hardly provides viable solution for stemming the curb of corruption in the long run end comment visit to washington other issues 8 snf saleh again asked to visit the us arguing that it was necessary to resolve issues regarding the guantanamo detainees and increased military assistance we see this visit as very important to reach mutual understanding and so that you understand our requests and demands brennan undertook to look into salehs claims of promised military equipment that has not been delivered in oneonone session that followed the formal meeting brennan extended an invitation to saleh to meet president obama at the white house on october 6 saleh also stated that there would be more delays in the us embassys request to purchase lands for the building of more secure housing facilities and that the sharia council would approve the transfer of the lands from waqf or publicly held status to freehold status comment 9 snf comment saleh was in vintage form during the two hours he spent with dnsa brennan at times disdainful and dismissive and at others conciliatory and congenial one might easily conclude that his repeated assertion that yemens national territory is open to the us to conduct operations against aqap reflects his interest in outsourcing the ct effort in yemen to the usg especially in view of his somewhat ominous claim that should aqap attacks occur in the future they will be the result of the us having failed to do enough to put the organization out of business additionally concerted usg antiterrorism campaign in yemen will free saleh to continue to devote his limited security assets to the ongoing war against houthi rebels in saada the net effect and one we strongly suspect saleh has calculated of both the american and royg iron fist unleashed at the same time in yemen will be clear message to the southern movement or any other party interested in generating political unrest in the country that similar fate awaits them 10 snf comment continued not surprisingly saleh was far less animated when brennan attempted to focus his attention on the need for immediate action to relieve yemens deteriorating socioeconomic situation largely limiting his response to pitch that the usg persuade recalcitrant donors to speed up and increase their assistance to yemen after stating petulantly in the group session that he was longer interested in an invitation to the white house telling brennan that my relationship with you is sufficient salehs mood changed noticeably for the better when the invitation was extended and he had captured the prize he has been chasing after for months end comment seche
