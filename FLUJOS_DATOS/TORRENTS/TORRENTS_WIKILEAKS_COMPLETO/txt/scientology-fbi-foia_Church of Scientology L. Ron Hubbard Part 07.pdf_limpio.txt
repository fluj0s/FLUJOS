well as engaging 4n disruptive actions as they did in the 1960s and 70 s under cointelpro operations run by the fbi these operations were discredited the church of scientology recently disclosed video tapes made during an undercover sting operation in which former church employee now turned government agent revealed detailed multigovernment agency plan to oust the current church management and replace it with people under control of the government agents involved the video tapes tell the story the fbi in 1971 made it broadly known that it cancelled its cointelpro operations and vowed to longer undertake these broad programs of unconstitutional assault on us citizens and groups the fbi left loophole in that counter intelligence operations could be continued as long as national

poses the greatest threat inour nations history to the right and freedoms guaranteedto every american you have it in your hands to do something about this call for thorough and public investigation into the illegal cointelprostyle activities sincerely member of the international association of scientologistsus senator lawton cha ussenate hmay 1983 i washington dc 20310 dear senator chiles situation has com to attention indicating that the constitutional rights of americans are being assaulted and denied by 4th xmry agencies which have been put there to ensure that these rights are held inviolate z am referring to the latest flapin the church of scientologys ongoing investigation into ill and criminal acts on the part of the fbi irs cid _and the us at tourneys office it has come to light in an investigation by the church the results of which were presented as evidence recently in litigation occurring in portland oregon that ultiagency jpl ot to ajxsgc 1jjwmjbtjiaatjxrar 1 recruit disaffected church staff mbers to use as government egents 2 have these agents then originate false incriminating documents duplicating the format of usual crurch documents and policy directives _ _ r _ _ 3 have these agents plant these in church filesincriminating documents 4 then have these agents allege publicly various criminal activities on the part of the church and its executives setting the stage for legal action by the government agencies 5 the government agencies would then be informed where the incriminating documents were those originated nd planted as in 213 above and using search warrants etc issued based on this inside information find the incriminating documents thereby giving grounds for indicting the current executives and board members of the church _ 6 the next steps were for the agents to declare themselves to be the new management of the church and with various governmental and private legal maneuvers the assets and management of the church would be placed into the hands of these agents ousting current church management and bringing the entire church under full control of the irs fbi and some private individuals helping in this takeover for personal gain these activities are thoroughly documented including video tapes of the recruiter the names and phone numbers of the actual government agents this entire scene brings to mind an earlier similar practice of the fbi called coinjelfro counter intelligence program banned over 10 years ago as result of congressional hearings into these practices such practices were used against or martin luther king jr and many other individuals and organizations andare now matter of public record due to thi excel lent ork of the us congress at the time these activities were as x mentioned btnnmd however loophole was left and this recent revelation leads as to believe that the practice of cointelpro possibly under different name still exists and is still violating the constitution of this great nation while professing to uphold it _ v _jl _ i tms data is well documented and being covered by newspapers and television news currently so x will not try to document the ntire issue herein x have kept myself abreast of this situation and find that the basic problem here is that the governmental agencies usuallyexpected to handle such matters rm all involved to greater or lesser extent the level to which this criminality extends is hot known and resounding comment is so far forthcoming from the senior officials of these agencies to illusatrata in angeles california where these facts were uncovered the govermental action currently taking place is mainly in the form of reprimands directed at the local police department for their inadvertant cooperation with the private investigator who uncovered and videotaped this plots and character assasination of the privmtm investigator himself rather than an investigation into the documented criminal activities of the government employees themselves the victims and their agents and the local authorities ikrrn being attacked for exposing them x am writing to you to get your assistance in getting congressional investigation underway which will expose thaue criminal activities and clean up these agencies so that americans can live with certainty that our basic rights guaranteed by crsr canstitution mrm valid and will not be ignored indeed trampled in an attempt to destroy us or our organisations by the vexy government on which we the people depend to safeguard nd uphold thj vpaul hawk1n i washington d c10

that federal undercover agents are engaging in cointelpro which are the exact same operations that the fbi engaged in and said it stopped in 19711 another fact is that the church of scientology has released video tapes made during an undercover sting operation the subject of the video tape is how former church employee who is now government agent is planning as part of multiagency plan to disrupt the church of scientology internally and then oust current church management replacing them with persons under the control of the government agents involved this is the truth and when you see

restraining order was filed by plaintiff supported by as affidavit of terry bibbs an officer of plaintiff who averred mat as she was attempting to place call from one of plaintiff s telephones she was interrupted by male voice which stated bis name was bob wiclomore that he was special agent of the fbi and that he was operating switchboard for fte fbi was monitoring the call on that phone fat hearing on the motion we submitted as affidavit of jdm m iccdermott the special agent in charge of the washington field office of the fbi the affidavit stated mat search of the fbi files indicated feat hataotimehas the fbi conducted any form of electronic surveillance on fee founding church of scientology and that fbi files indicate that there is past or present employee by the aame bob widomore or any phonetic variation thereof we argued that this affidavit dearly orercome the allegations of plaintiff supported by the hearsay speculative wad rather remarkable affidavit ot tarry bibbs and required denial f the motion for temporary restraining order as well as dismissal of the mtit _ 2 judge richey denied the application for temporary restraining order but indicated that plaintiff would be allowed to take an expedited deposi tion of mr mcdermott to clarify certain points in the general affidavit one of the judges concerns was whether wiretap would be encompassed by the term electronic surveillance as used in the affidavit the deposition was taken on june 21 1974 mr mcdermott equivocally confirmed the statements in his affidavit and further explained that any requests for fbi wiretaps in dc would come through his office that fbi index cards relating to plaintiff would reference whether electronic surveillance was ever conducted on plaintiffs telephone either in conjunction with an investigation of the church or any individual known to use the telephone at tiie deposition plaintiffs counsel attempted to make detailed inquiry into the internal operations of the local fbi office including staffing details of processing wiretap applications investigative techniques and the technical method of conducting wiretap t ob jected to theee questions being outside the scope of the deposition as we interpreted judge ridleys order as being irrelevant in light of mr mcdermotts testimony mat wiretaps had even been placed on plaintiffs telephones and in part on grounds of privilege on advice of counsel mr mcdermott refused to answer these questions plaintiff has now filed motion to compel answers copy of which is attached our response is due on august 14 1974 ve hope to be to position to not only oppose the motion but also file motion for summary judgment since most of the law in area of alleged illegal wire tap has apparently developed in

one essential to the use of the testi mony as an adequate factual basis for obtaining an order of dismissal or suimary judgment for the federadefendantewas the jr cooperation of the supervisorspecial
