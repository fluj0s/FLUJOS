china plans to protect local car makers after wto chinaonline december 7 1999prospects for us business rising chinese demand for imported cars chinas accession to the wto would lower tariffs and prohibit other trade barriers eliminate domestic content requirements allow foreign financing and grant foreign jointventure partners greater decisionmaking powers and control over distribution wto provisions would make imported products more economical to the rising chinese middle class and investment more profitable for foreign companies an indication of the likely rise in imports is the estimated 30 drop in car sales in china since the uschina wto agreement was signed this decline has reportedly been triggered by the anticipation of cheaper imports once china accedes to the wto21 according to industry experts companies that already build cars in china have advantages of name recognition existing distribution networks and government contacts that would facilitate sales possible impediments to greater imports political and economic obstacles may hamper production and constrain foreign car sales in china excessive bureaucratic regulations and fees and low productivity have made many joint venture projects unprofitable22 even successful foreign companies may face formidable competition from chinese manufacturers in the long term the prc government welcomes foreign investment as means to develop domestic automobile industry that can compete on its own the state which owns significant share of the largest car manufacturers provides capital to the domestic companies and requires foreign partners to transfer cuttingedge technology economic and other factors may impede auto sales in general and demand for imported cars in particular myriad taxes and fees artificially raise the cost of vehicles both foreign and domestic beyond the reach of most consumers auto services including maintenance parking insurance and gasoline distribution remain underdeveloped which discourages auto purchases some chinese experts suggest that for the next ten to fifteen years sedans will be unaffordable and unsuitable to chinese peasants who comprise three quarters of the national population23 state agencies and corporations are required to buy domestically produced vehicles some provinces and municipalities have favored cars produced in their own localities24 shanghai for example has required its taxi fleets to buy shanghaimade volkswagens and charged additional licensing fees for cars made outside the municipality
