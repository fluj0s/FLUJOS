successor corporation the hubbard dianetic foundation of wichita kansas now that organization still kept alive this other organization hubbard di anetic research foundation then in rather misguided effort to push dianetics and so forth and because i was hounding them not to use my name it temporarily dropped the word hubbard and was called the dianetic research foundation for the membership corporation and the dianetic foundation for the business corporation these two were both interlocked and interdependent and were essentially and would have been in the eyes of the law the same corporation that corpor ation handed over to the hasi an entire quitclaim and deed corporation title and the members of the dianetic research foundation recognizing of course themselves as really the hubbard dianetic research foundation voted and elected president of the corporation and 313 it itself became transferred the corporation which is organized here in arizona is fresh set of incorporations but it is all of these corporations to date that is the original foundation its respon sible for all debts bills and everything else of the original foundation it also owns all of its materials now thats the hubbard dianetic research foundation which is the original founda tion and has been put back together now exactly as it was in elizabeth new jersey with the bugs out of it the hubbard dia netic research foundation reincorporated in arizona is not dupl icate directorate of anything of the hasi the hasi is religious fellowship this is slightly different than the hubbard

tions hdrf and hasi has certain depen dencies other affiliated organizations if you see this as two positive groups youll have good grip on the entire picture of organiza tion of this the one group the oldest group headed by the hubbard dianetic research foundation has two appendant groups it has been in these two businesses for long time it was interested in civil defense and was doing things about civil defense those activities have been po oled together in an allied affiliate cor poration known as the american society of civilian defense it knows dn works and says so loudly that organization stands 100 behind dn as the only process it would even vaguely use on hysterical or distressed people the other is the freudian foundation of america organized to be free offer to any of the people in russianheld vienna who wish to take advantage of it it is the only authorized agency of any kind in the united states authorized to use the name and works of sigmund freud all other freudi an foundations have charter or franchise from the old master nobody has but we have one from the freudian institute of vienna which makes us the only legal freudian foundation this organization knows that as sequence to the great work of sigmund freud dn is the solution to psychoanalysis and it freely says so so we have the hubbard dianetic re search foundation being ably supported by the freudian foundation of america and by the american society of civilian defense civilian defense is simply the eight dynamics people interested in the fields of healing who would listen to such thing as freudian analysis will find out they can do it better with dn so we have stepping stones up to an organization the hdrf makes triangle of organizations for its dissemination lines 541oc04 5 hubbard
