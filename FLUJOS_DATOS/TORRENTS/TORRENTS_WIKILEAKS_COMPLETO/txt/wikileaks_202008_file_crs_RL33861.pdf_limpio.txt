earthquakes seismic hazards are greatest in the wester n united states par ticularly california alaska washington oregon and hawaii the rocky mountai n region portion of the central united states known as th new madrid seismic zone and portions of the eastern seaboard pa rticularly south carolina also have relatively high earthquake hazard compared to the loss of life in other countries relatively few americans have died as result of eart hquakes over the past 100 years the united states however faces the possibility of large economic losses from earthquake damaged buildings and infrastructure until hurricane katrina in 2005 the 1994 rthridge ca earthquake was the costliest natural catastrophe to strike the united states some damage estimates were 26 billion in 2005 dollars estimates of total loss from hypothetical earthquake of magnitude more than 70 reach as high as 500 billion for the angeles area the may 12 2008 magnitude 79 earthquake in sichuan china has raised some concerns about the possibility of s imilar devastating eart hquake occurring in seismically active and densely populated parts of the united states such as california given the potentially huge costs associated with severe earthquake an ongoing issue for congress is whether the federa lly supported programs aimed at reducing us vulnerability to earthquakes are an ad equate response to th earthquake hazard under the national earthquake hazards reduction program nehrp four federal agencies have responsibility for longt erm earthquake risk reduction the us geological survey usgs the national science foundation nsf the federal emergency management agency fema and the national institute of standards and technology nist they variously assess us earthquake hazards send notifications of seismic even ts develop measures to re duce earthquake hazards and conduct research to help reduce overall us vulnera bility to earthquakes congress established nehrp in 1977 and its early focus was on research that would lead to an improved understanding of why earthquakes occur and to an ability to predict their occurrence precisely understanding has improved about why and where earthquakes occur however reliably predicting the precise date and time an earthquake will occur is not yet possible congress most recently reauthorized nehrp in 2004 pl 108360 and authoriz ed appropriations through fy2009 the 2004 reauthorization designated nist as th lead agency to create better synergy among the agencies and improve the prog ram congress may wish to determine whether the reorganized

hazards and risk figure 1 indicates that good information ex ists on where earthquakes are likely to occur and how severe the earthquake magnitude and resulting ground shaking are likely to be the map in figure 1 depicts the potential shaking hazard from future earthquakes it is based on the frequenc at which earthquakes occur in different areas and how far the strong shaking exte nds from the source of the earthquake in figure 1 the hazard levels indicate the pot ential ground motion expressed as percentage of the acceleration due to gravity g with up to 1 in 10 chance of being exceeded over 50year periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33861crs2 1 magnitude is number that characterizes the relative size of an earthquake earthquake magnitude is often reported using the richter scale magnitudes in this report are generally consistent with the richter scale richte r magnitude is calculated from the strongest seismic wave recorded from the earthquake and is based on logarithmic base 10 scale for each whole number increase in the richter scale the ground motion increases by ten times the amount of energy released per w hole number increase however goes up by factor of 32 the moment magnitude scale is another expre ssion of earthquake size or energy released during an earthquake that roughly corresponds to the richter magnitude and is used by most seismologists because it more accurately describes the size of very large earthquakes intensity is measure of how much shaking occurred at site based on observations and amount of damage intensity is usually reported on the

maps and new earthquake forecast for california on april 21 2008 the usgs released new national seismic hazards maps that update the version published in 2002 compared to the 2002 version the new maps indicate lower ground motions by 10 to 25 for the central and eastern united states based on modifications to the gr oundmotion models used for earthquakes the new maps indicate that estimates of ground motion for the western united states are as much as 30 lower for certain types of ground motion called longperiod seismic waves which affect taller multistory buildings ground motion that affects shorter buildings of few stories called s hortperiod seismic waves is roughly similar to the 2002 maps the new maps show higher estimates for ground motion for western oregon and washington compared to the 2002 maps due to new ground motion models for the offshore cascadia subduction zone in formulating the 2008 maps the usgs gave more weight to the probability of catastrophic magnitude 9 earthquake occurring along the cascadia subduction zone that fault ruptures on average every 500 years and has the potential to generate destructive earthquakes and tsunamis along the coasts of washi ngton oregon and nor thern california according to report released on apr il 14 2008 california has 99 chance of experiencing magnitude 67 or larger earthquake in the next 30 years the likelihood of an even larger earthquake ma gnitude 75 or greater is 46 and will likely occur in the southern part of the stat the fault with the highest probability of generating at least one earthquake of magnit ude 67 or greater over the next 30 years is the san andreas in southern california 59 probability for northern california it is the haywardrodgers creek fault 31 the earthquake

riskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33861crs4 2 seismometers are instruments that measure and record the size and force of seismic waves essentially sound waves radiated from the earthquake as it ruptures seismometers generally consist of mass attached to fixed base during an earthquake the base moves and the mass does not and the relative motion is commonl transformed into an electrical voltage that is recorded seismograph usually refers to the seismometer and the recording device but the two terms are often used interchangeably 3 see usgs earthquakes facts and statistics at

75 earthquake struck the north western margin of the sichuan basin resulting in approximately 9300 fatalities some concerns have been raised about the possib ility of an eart hquake of similar magnitude occurring in seismically active region of the united states such as southern california where fault movement similar to the eastern sichuan earthquake may occur on may 22 2008 the usgs released hypothetical scenario for magnitude 78 southern california earthquake called the shakeo ut scenario in the scenario scientists hypothetically simulated the ground shaking and fault rupture associated with magnitude 78 earthquake and estimated the resulting damage to buildings and infrastructure the scenario estimated approximately 1800 fatalities and 213 billion in economic losses as result of the earthquake the report points to aggressive retrofitting programs that have increased the seismic re sistance of buildings highways and other critical infrastructure in southern californi as one reason why the number of possible fatalities is relatively low some scientists have raised the possib ility that earthquakes such as the may 12 sichuan event may sometimes exhibit cascading behavior where bursts of seismic energy are released along different places in single fault or jump between connected faults earthquakes that occur along the sie rra madre fault in southern california for example could trigger series of cascading ismic events along other faults such as the san andreas seismic hazards estimates may not fully account for the damage that could be caused by cascading earthquakes along conne cted fault system scientists are hoping to examine the sichuan earthquake in more detail to better understand the nature of cascading seismic events and how they affect the us

over the winter of 18111812 centered close to the town of new madrid mo some of the tremors were felt as far away as charleston sc and washington dc the mechanism for the earthquakes in the new madrid zone is poorly understood14 and earthquakes of comparable magnitude have occurred in the area since these events such factors contribute to the difficulty of making reasonable da mage estimate for lowfrequency high impact event in the region based on the probability of an ear thquake of similar magnitude occurring this uncertainty has implications for policy decisions to ameliorate risk such as setting building codes and for designing and building structures to withstand level of shakin g commensurate with the risk developers of building codes tend to err on the side of caution table 4 also shows annualized earthquake losses for the cities of new york boston and newark where destructive ear thquakes have struck for generations15 those cities represent areas of relatively low seismic hazard but have high populations and dense infrastructure which produces significant risk to people and structures according to some timates16 in the absence of any significant or damaging earthquakes

regional networks18 in the original conception for anss approximately 6000 of the planned stations are to be installed in 26 high risk urban areas to monitor strong gr ound shaking and how buildings and other structures respond currently five highri sk urban areas have instruments deployed in sufficient density to generate the data to produce near realtime maps called shakemaps19 which can be used in emerge ncy response during and after an earthquake approximately 1000 new instruments are to replace aging and obsolete stations in the networks that now monitor the nations most seismically active regions the current regional networks contain mix of modern digital broadband and high resolution instruments that can provide realtime data they are supplemented by older instruments that may require manual downloading of data universities in the region typically operate the regional networks and will likely continue to do so as anss is implemented lastly approximately 100 instrument s
