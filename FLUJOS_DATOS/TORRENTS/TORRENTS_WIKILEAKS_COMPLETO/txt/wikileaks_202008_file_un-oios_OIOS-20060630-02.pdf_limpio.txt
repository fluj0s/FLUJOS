refugees auditor huiming june tan united nations nations unies office of internal oversight services unhcr audit service audit of unhcr confidence building measures for western saharan refugees ar200613103 executive summary in march 2006 oios conducted an audit of unhcr fidence building measures for western saharan refugees the audit covered activities wit h total expenditure of us 12 million in 2004 and 2005 draft of the report was shared wi th the bureau for caswaname in april 2006 the comments received in june 2006 are reflec ted as appropriate in this final report the bureau stated that although the recommendations wer sensible from technical point of view some of them would be difficult to implement or not feasible due to the highly politicised nature of the project limiting unhcrs standard staffing and implementation arrangements overall assessment oios assessed the management of unhcr confidence bu ilding measures for western saharan refugees as average taking into consideration the delicate political s ituation that poses constant threat to the sustainability of the prog ramme in general the programme was adequately run but the application of certain impor tant controls lacked consistency or effectiveness in order not to compromise the syste m of internal control timely corrective action by management is required programme management oios appreciated the sensitive nature and complexit of the operation and the reasons cited for the development of shortterm approach for progra mme implementation also the little influence that unhcr has on when the involved parti would reach an agreement to the plan of action nonetheless in oios view if the parti fail to reach an agreement on future plans of action before the beginning of calendar year unhcr should make decisions in timely manner to ensure efficient use of resources unhcr should avoid spending significant resources while waiting for an agreement to be reac hed many of the documents for 2004 could not be made av ailable it appears they were not prepared misfiled or lost for 2005 improvements were noted the bureau stated that the filing might not have been at an acceptable level s the field offices are temporary in nature for the period reviewed there were guidelines nd procedures to assist field staff in programme execution and monitoring oios was please d to note that action had recently been taken and local guidelines have been drafted these still have to be cleared by the desk as of 8 march 2006 total of 2086 persons repres enting 11 per cent of the total number of registered persons had benefited from family visits there were still 17367 persons waiting for family visit oios estimated that assuming all co nditions remain unchanged unhcr would need 620 return flights over 12 years for all the r egistered persons to benefit from the programme considering this oios was of the opinio n that further efforts could be made to assist as many beneficiaries as possible human resource management local personnel were hired under individual contrac tors contracts issued by minurso which is not satisfactory unhcr contractual agree ment oios appreciated that there had already been discussions and consultations by the d esk with dhrm and minurso to regularize the staff contracts the bureau was of t he opinion that regularized staff would not give the required flexibility or staffing efficienc ies given the nature of the operation oios was of the opinion that the staffing levels sh ould be reassessed with flights only twice week and most of the dataentry now completed th number of staff should be reviewed this could result in cost savings to the operation action is being taken by the bureau to review staffing levels human resources management required to be improved job descriptions were incomplete roles and responsibilities were unclear and unhcrs policies and procedures with regard to attendance records payment of overtime and compen satory time off were not complied with proper checkingout procedures were not in place fo r separating staff local staff member was separated without settling outstanding liabilit ies of approximately us 3500 this mainly consisted of the cost of repairs of an official min urso vehicle involved in an accident due to the staff members negligent conduct and unpaid pr ivate telephone calls and unaccounted petty cash disbursements this issue should be formally f ollowedup by the desk and brought to the attention of the headquarters asset management boar d and the controller to be dealt with financial management financial management needed to be improved to provi assurance that unhcrs rules and procedures are complied with there was proper d elegation of authority petty cash ceilings had not been established and expenditure was incorr ectly recorded monitoring and reporting the integrity of the databases required to be enhan ced oios found some discrepancies in the data and one of the databases could not be fully ac cessed as the password was lost although the head of operations has copy of the original b ackup of the final registration list unhcr had not backed up the updated databases with inform ation on refugees who had benefited from the cbm flights and the telephone service provided there was risk of losing records if the computers were corrupted june 2006

measures cbm for western saharan refugees the udit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the professional pr actice of internal auditing oios reviewed the activities of the cbm in laayoune western saha ra and rabouni algeria 2 cbm programme commenced in 2004 and there were previous reviews by oios or the board of auditors 3 the confidence building measures was first initi ated in 1999 by the security council sres1238 as part of the preparatory work for th repatriation of western saharan refugees to their territory of origin the repatria tion did not take place and the cbm initiatives were shelved in 2002 the security cou ncil revived the cbm programme the authorities of morocco the frente polisario and th algerian authorities the country of asylum however only reached an agreement on how to implement the programme in early 2004 by then the programme was not linked to any repatriation plans and the primary goal of the programme has evolved to meeting the humanit arian needs of refugee families separated by the conflict allowing them to communi cate and stay in contact while waiting for their final voluntary return to their territory of origin 4 unhcr and united nations mission for the referen dum in western sahara minurso work in partnership for the implementatio n of this programme the special representative of the secretarygeneral srsg to m inurso plays an important role in the negotiations with the parties involved in additio n unhcr has benefited from minurso receiving logistical support such as provision of w eekly flights between locations in western sahara and refugees camps in tindouf of civil poli ce to monitor movement of visitors during family visits of medical doctors and nurses accomp anying the flights and of communication equipment for telephone services between the refuge camps and locations in western sahara 5 the findings and recommendations contained in th is report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activitie s during the exit conference held in april 2006 draft audit report was sent to the directo r of the bureau for caswaname in april 2006 the comments received in june 2006 are refle cted in this final report ii audit objectives 6 the main objectives of the audit were to evaluat the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and the memorandum of understanding with minurso 2 iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit focused on 2004 and 2005 programme act ivities with expenditure of approximately us 712000 our review concentrated on the activities implemented jointly by unhcr and minurso for facilitating family visits using minursos flights 8 the audit also included review of the administ ration of cbm operations in laayoune and rabouni with expenditure totalling us 488000 for the years 2004 and 2005 at the time of audit in march 2006 there were 35 persons working for unhcr cbm this included staff on regular posts united nations vol unteers unvs staff on nonstandard unhcr contracts and staff on mission 9 the audit activities included review and asse ssment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations programme management planning 10 the continuity of cbm activities is dependent n the cooperation and support from the moroccan authorities the frente polisario and the algerian authorities the country of asylum it is also dependent on the availability of funding for the project which is under supplementary programme budget oios is aware of th delicate political situation between the parties involved and this is constant threat to the sustainability of the programme for instance unhcr was not able to arrange family visi ts for refugees during the period from september to midnovember 2004 and from january 200 5 to late november 2005 because of the delay the parties took to agree on the plan of action of the programme 11 as result of the nature and complexity of the operation shortterm approachstrategy has been devised for programme implementation ther efore even in april 2006 an appeal although we were informed that it was inprogress had not been launched for the 2006 and 2007 activities the bureau indicated that the issuance of an appeal was not urgent as they had funds of approximately us 1 million carried fo rward from 2005 this would finance the programme for the next five to six months 12 oios appreciates that there was immediate fu nding problems for the programme however the insecurity of lack of funding as well as the lack of mediumterm strategy has an impact on staff morale and hence programme imple mentation posts on the staffing table were approved for period shorter than one year an d thus did not attract staff they were only filled by shortterm missions for example si nce 2004 there were seven heads of operationsofficersincharge managing the programm the bureau indicated the uncertainties surrounding the programme do not allo w unhcr to establish any medium or longterm strategy for example the parties took more than 12 months 1 to agree on the action plan for the second phase as result duri ng the period from january to november 2005 although family visits were arranged unhc r had kept some staff on standby not 1 the bureau stated that the plan of action was subm itted to the parties in october 2004 but the agreem ent from all parties was only reached in november 2005 3 knowing when the parties would reach an agreement this clearly demonstrates the difficult position unhcr is in oios fully understands unhcrs situation with regar d to the implementation of the programme however to ensur more efficient use of unhcr resources oios believes decisions should be made i n timely manner if the parties fail to reach an agreement on future plans of action within the prescribed deadlines for example while unhcr cannot control when the parties will ag ree on the future plans of action unhcr can postpone cbm implementation for minimum predefined period thus saving some valuable resources for more efficient use recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname should start the consultation process on programme implementation wi th the parties early on and determine the latest date appr oval date that might be obtained to determine if activities could proceed in the forthcoming year based on this the bureau should take decisions on programme implementation in timely m anner to ensure efficiencies rec01 13 the bureau stated that given the political context within which the cbm have been framed it is highly questionable that the bureau w ould be in position to dictate to the parties deadlines to ensure efficient programme im plementation on the contrary the parties normally dictate deadlines to unhcr srsg nd minurso oios appreciates the bureaus comments but believes that unhcr could gai n some form of control over the use of its resources and programme implementation unhc r should try to avoid incurring significant expenditure for instance the disagree ment among the parties in 2005 stopped the exchange of family visits for over 10 months in 200 5 despite this unhcr spent over us 500000 in 2005 for which about 67 per cent was sta ffing related costs b programme implementation 14 for programme implementation except for the pl an of action there were guidelines or procedures documented to facilitate its executio n and to measure the effectiveness of programme implementation during 2004 and 2005 2 oios noted that with the change of team leaders and heads of operations programme imp lementation differed with regard to the process of selection verification and finalisa tion of beneficiaries for family visits oios was pleased to note that in early 2006 the team ader in laayoune had drafted some operating procedures however at the time of audit there were indications as to who had reviewed and approved them 15 similarly there were established filing sys tem to ensure the completeness and easy retrieval of programme related documents oios obs erved that other than the registration databases and forms the present cbm team could not locate reports and documents for 2004 3 considering the high staff turnover including th head of operations it is important that the desk take the initiative to ensure that gu idelines and policies are in place for effective and consistent programme implementation if these re not developed and introduced it is 2 in 2005 the approved period for family visits was during the month of november and december 3 the present cbm team was not aware that monitoring reports were not prepared in 2004 staff attendan ce reports for 2004 could not be located and important documents such as job descriptions were not proper ly filed 4 likely that reports are not prepared and important documents are misplaced or lost with the departure of staff recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname should ensure that clear guidelines and procedures including for the filing of documents are developed for programme implementati on in line with the programme strategy this should ensure mor effective and consistent programme implementation and will gu ide staff assigned to the operation rec02 16 the bureau stated that relevant information such as reports plan of action mou with minurso loi and project vouchers are properly file d and kept at unhcr headquarters in geneva given the temporary nature of the off ices in laayoune and rabouni the filing of management information may not have been at an cceptable level this condition will improve with the incoming head of operations that w ill be in place for the next six months giving some stability to field management and proje ct implementation oios is pleased to note that action will be taken to formalize and imp rove procedures and will close the above recommendation on receipt of copy of the approved guidelines and procedures c cost efficiency 17 for family visits unhcr had arranged for 80 cb ms return flights 40 return flights from tindouf and 40 return flights from laayoune s ince the commencement of the programme in march 2004 to 8 march 2006 total of 2086 persons have benefited from the family visits programme this number represented 1 1 per cent of the total number of registered persons leaving 17367 persons eligible for family visit 18 in the first phase of the plan of action unhcr had stated that the number of participants per flight should be between 15 and 20 persons oios observed that in most cases the number of passengers exceeded this and w as pleased to note the initiative taken to reassess the target upwards to 28 this new target was reflected in the second phase of the plan of action considering this oios has analysed the utilization of flight capacity against the target of 28 19 oios found that the number of beneficiaries pe r flight ranged from 18 to 32 persons and 48 of the 80 flights 60 per cent had less tha n 28 beneficiaries in the first phase and second phase in addition during the approved per iod 4 of programme implementation explanation was documented for the nonscheduling f flights for about six weeks spread over 2004 to 2005 oios estimated that if these fl ights had been carried out as scheduled and took at least 28 beneficiaries per flight the tota l number of beneficiaries would have increased to 2662 instead of the 2086 the bureau indicated that there were instances when at the last minute beneficiaries pulledout of the family visit also there was policy whereby if the whole family group did not present t hemselves the other members were not allowed to travel moreover there were occasions when flights were ca ncelled which was out of unhcrs control for example in march 2006 two cbm flights had to be cancelled due to the visit of the king of morocco to laayoune 4 january 2004 to august 2004 mid november to decem ber 2004 and 25 november 2005 to date 5 20 oios estimated that assuming cbm flights are on weekly basis and each flight carried at least 28 beneficiaries unhcr would need 620 return flights over 12 years to assist the 17367 registered persons assuming that annual expenditur is approximately us 35 million 5 the programme of family visits would take 12 years to i mplement at cost of at least us 42 million even target of assisting 50 per cent is dauntin g task oios also noted however that other communication means were used to enable beneficiari to contact their relatives according to unhcrs statistics the refugees have made approxim ately 47000 telephone calls to their families in western sahara oios made some suggestions to in crease the number of assisted beneficiaries by facilitating family visits between camps and cit ies by road this possibility was ruled out by the bureau stating security reasons difficult road and political conditions 21 the bureau stated that not all of the 17367 regi stered refugees are eligible and this can only be ascertained when unhcr conducts the ver ification exercises prior to each cbm flight programme sustainability is constantly unde r threat due to the delicate political relations between the parties and their cooperati on is imperative for the programme implementation these factors are beyond unhcrs co ntrol and thus unhcr is not able to establish any medium or long term planning to clear the backlog of refugees awaiting family visits however unhcr has managed to gradually inc rease the number of beneficiaries per flight oios appreciates the constraints unhcr is facing bu t considering the percentage of persons not yet assisted by way of family visits an d the significant costs involved in implementing the programme oios believes that unhc r could seek ways to maximise the utilization of minurso flights this may include tablishing firm waiting list of one to two families that are approved by the parties for ach cbm flight to ensure full capacity of the flights in case beneficiaries pull out at the l ast minute d partnership with minurso 22 unhcr and minurso have signed memorandum of u nderstanding mou that outlines the terms and conditions for the implement ation of the cbm programme for 2004 and 2005 the last mou of 2005 had expired and the 2006 mou had not been finalised at the date of the audit in march 2006 23 generally unhcr and minurso are enjoying goo d partnership and the terms and conditions in the 2005 mou were adhered to except f or the following unhcr did not make quarterly advance payments t minurso b minurso had not processed the recruitment of cal staff in accordance with the united nations regulations and rules minurso had i ssued individual contractors contracts to unhcr cbms local staff as discussed i n paragraph 25 below recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname should ensure that t he terms and conditions of the memorandum of understan ding are met if it is found that they are still relevant and can be complied with by both parties rec03 5 based on 2006 lois the actual costs may be higher if the costs of fuel continue to rise 6 24 the bureau stated that the new mou is under revisio n and should be issued by the end of june 2006 oios will record the above recommendation as imple mented on receipt of copy of the new mou b human resource management local recruitment 25 there were 28 local staff not hired under regu lar unhcr contracts working for the unhcr cbm programme 9 in laayoune and 18 in raboun i the local staff included 1 administrative assistant 14 drivers 4 telephone perators 4 data entry clerks 3 night guards and 2 cleaners 26 in 2004 the local cbm staff in rabouni were hi red under service contracts known as contrat prestation service issued and signe d by the head of suboffice in tindouf the cbm staff working in laayoune were hired under individual contractors contracts issued by minurso on behalf of unhcr these contrac tual arrangements changed in 2005 with all local staff in rabouni and laayoune hired under individual contractors contracts issued by minurso in 2004 local staff salaries of those with contracts issued by the unhcr suboffice in rabouni were charged to pro ject expenditure whereas in 2005 all local salaries were charged to temporary assistance under the administrative budgets oios also noted that in 2004 entitlements to staff diffe red dependent on the type of contract staff were hired under 27 the mou signed by unhcr and minurso provided th at minurso recruit local staff for unhcr in accordance with minursos regula tions and rules despite this individual contractors contracts were issued this type of contract is not appropriate for the type of work and the length of the contract issued moreover oios would like to highlight that individual contractors contracts are meant fo r the hiring of persons that services were required from time to time and not on continuo us basis the contract should be limited to six or in special circumstances nine months in any period of twelve consecutive months therefore in accordance with the instruction s tai19997 the cbm staffs employment terms and conditions did not meet the cr iteria of individual contractors 28 the local staff members were supervised and man aged by unhcr and therefore facto unhcr employees although the conditions of servic for individual contractors stated that the organization will compensate the individua l contractor or hisher dependents in case of death injury or illness when performing their c ontractual services they did not have standard staff benefits such as annual leave sick leave training pensions and medical benefits 29 oios is aware that dhrm has been consulted and there have been discussions between them and the desk as well as with minurso on how t regularize the staffing situation oios is also aware that the bureau is of the opinio n that to regularise these staff will not give them the flexibility or staffing efficiencies given the nature of the operation and the uncertainty of how long the programme will run oi appreciates this but would highlight that under unhcrs present rules and procedures thi s contractual arrangement is not correct for hiring staff even if it is fully delegated to minurso and proper staffing arrangements 7 are established by them as agreed under the terms of the mou unhcr would still be managing and supervising them as result oios wo uld suggest that further consideration be given to regularizing these staff under fixed rm appointments these contracts can be shortterm and terminated as and when necessary and may provide the flexibility that the bureau believes it needs 30 oios was also of the opinion that the staffing levels need to be reassessed since there were only flights twice week and most of the data entry had been completed this could result in cost savings to the operation oios was u nable to assess the adequacy of the level of drivers as logbooks showing number of hours ondu ty was not available recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname in conjunction with the division of human resources management should resol ve the contractual issues of the local staff in laayoune nd rabouni the bureau should also assess the staffing levels t ensure it correlates with the present level and type of tasks required rec04 31 the bureau stated that they would send staff memb er on mission from unhcr headquarters to address this issue oios is pleased to note that action will be taken to review staffing numbers and arrangements for the pr ogramme oios will consider the above recommendation as implemented on receipt of the res ults of the staffing assessment and confirmation that the contractual arrangements for local staff have been regularised b job descriptions 32 job descriptions and terms of reference for cbm team members were outdated andor incomplete the post of the head of operations rema ined unclassified although it had been created in january 2005 although some internationa l staff on mission had terms of reference these documents were not shared with the head of op erations who was their direct supervisor oios reviewed the available job descrip tions and noted that much work was required to clarify staff roles and responsibilitie s as well as assure adequate internal controls were in place for example the functions assigned in the job description to the field clerkfinance assistant defied all good controls fo r segregation of duties furthermore the title of clerkassistant does not conform to unhc r job classification more importantly the functions assigned allowed the incumbent to be responsible for the registration of beneficiaries to make changes to registration form s count and update registration statistics prepare beneficiaries for family visit as well s request and distribute cash grants to refugees these functions are not compatible this field clerkfinance assistant was to be supervised by senior desk officer in the bureau f or caswaname and in close collaboration with unhcr cbm field officer oios sh ared the field clerkfinance job description with the senior desk officer head of perations in laayoune and the team leader in rabouni none of them have seen this job description before the names and titles of the persons who prepared and approved the job scription were not available 8 recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname should clarify the r oles and responsibilities of staff working on the confid ence building measures programme job descriptions andor terms f reference should be drafted and approved by the cbm head of perations and cleared by the desk and dhrm rec05 33 the bureau agreed to take the necessary corrective action oios is pleased to note that action will be taken and will consider the above r ecommendation as implemented on receipt of revised and approved job descriptions andor ter ms of reference for staff working on the cbm programme c level of vacancies 34 in 2005 there were nine posts on the staffing table five professional and four general service but these posts remained vacant throughout the year the professional posts were not advertised in the compendium instead staff were as signed on shortterm missions to fill the positions oios noted that the team leaders based i n laayoune and tindouf were generally only on mission for periods of two to three months and consequently the turnover was very high also as mentioned above since 2004 there w ere seven heads of operationsofficers incharge managing the programme this has resulte d in lack of leadership and continuity in the management of the programme the bureau indicated that they have identified st aff member as head of operations with commitment to s tay until the end of 2006 oios was pleased to note this but is still of the opinion t hat to ensure continuity and more effective programme management the posts in the staffing tab should be filled recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname should classify the post of head of operations and formally fill the po sts on the staffing table to minimise staff turnover to ensur continuity and more effective programme management rec06 35 the bureau stated they would request minurso to iss ue fta fixed term appointments contracts for one to three months for the staff being paid against existing posts and ta temporary assistance contracts for those w ho are not charged against the post oios would like to clarify that as stated in paragr aph 29 above even if minurso is able to issue fta contracts to the local staff working for unhcr this arrangement was not in conformity to unhcr rules and procedures these loc recruits are facto unhcr employees since they are under unhcrs supervision and management oios would suggest that if this is seen as the only alternativ left to unhcr to hire local personnel the reasons for this be documented and endorsed by seni or management nonetheless oios would continue to encourage the issuance of unhcrs compliant contracts oios will consider the recommendation as implemented upon rec eipt of confirmation that the post of head of operations has been classified and the loca l staffing contracts have been regularized either by the issuance of regular contracts or the granting of an exemption 9 d staff administration 36 the practice of payment of overtime and compens atory time off cto was inconsistent in 2004 the head of operations had uthorised overtime and cto but due to the contractual status of staff it was not applied across the board staff in tindouf with contrat prestation service had an entitleme nt of two days annual leave per month while those in laayoune with individual contractors contract did not receive leave entitlement oios was not able to properly review t he adequacy of the payment of overtime or cto for 2004 as attendance records were maint ained for local staff 37 the new head of operations in 2005 stopped the payment of overtime and made changes to staff members working hours this meant that cto was always given in lieu of payment the arrangements made were informal and gain as attendance records for local staff were not maintained and as office working hou rs were not properly established it was difficult to confirm the validity of cto recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname and the head of operations should ensure that proper human resource s policies and procedures are established locally standard of fice working hours should be put in place attendance records ma intained and entitlements to compensatory time off or overtime payment made in accordance with unhcrs rules and procedure s rec07 38 the bureau agreed to take the necessary corrective action oios is pleased to note that action will be initiated oios will consider the ab ove recommendation as implemented on confirmation that office hours have been standardiz ed and entitlements are in accordance with unhcr rules and procedures separation process 39 the head of operations did not ensure that prop er checkingout procedures were in place for separating staff for instance in late 2 005 the head of operations was aware of the outstanding claims against local staff member of approximately us 3500 mostly for the cost of repairs of an official minurso vehicle invo lved in an accident due to the negligent conduct of the staff member as well as unpaid priv ate telephone calls and unaccounted petty cash disbursements despite this the head of opera tions authorized the final salary payment of this staff members salary of 7967 mad approxi mately us870 consequently the staff left without returning the office keys identifi cation card and did not settle any of the abovementioned claims the head of operations did not report this loss to the desk also in oios view although this was not unhcr vehicle this loss should be brought to the attention of the headquarters asset management boar d hamb and dealt with accordingly moreover the controller must authorise the writing off of cash losses suffered recommendation head2right the unhcr head of operations for confidence buildin g 10 measures for western sahara refugees should ensure that proper checking out procedures are established for separat ing staff the head of operations in conjunction with the desk sho uld bring these losses to the attention of the headquarters sset management board and to the controller so that thes losses are properly dealt with rec08 40 the bureau agreed to take the necessary corrective action oios will consider the above recommendation as implemented on receipt of ction proposed by the headquarters asset management board and the controller on the re ported losses c financial management 41 financial management needed to be improved to p rovide assurance that unhcrs rules and procedures are complied with and unhcr assets re safeguarded delegation of authority 42 the addressee of the letter of instruction loi was the deputy director bureau for caswaname formal authority had been delegated t the head of operations in laayoune western sahara or the team leader in rabo uni algeria according to the mou with minurso prior to each new payment financial reports inc luding all necessary supporting documents should be reviewed and certifi ed by the unhcr project manager as unhcr had not clearly defined and formally assig ned the project manager mentioned in the mou minurso processed payments simply based on memorandum from the head of operations in oios opinion anyone could have sign ed as the officerincharge of cbm as delegation of signing authority cards or similar document had been given for the authenticity of the signature to be verified recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname should ensure formal delegation of authority is in place the addressee of the letter of instruction should delegate and designate certif ying authorizing and approving functions for the cbm sta ff specimen signature card should be completed and the desk should formally notify minurso of the names of the designated officials rec09 43 the bureau will arrange for the lois to be addresse d to the new head of operations should there be clear indications that the parties would be willing to extend the programme at least until end of 2007 oios will consider the above recommendation as imp lemented on receipt of conformation that the appropriate delega tion of authority documents have been established and copied to minurso b recording of cash grants 44 oios noted that while the plan of action for th cbm programme stated that beneficiaries be given cash grants of us 30 to us 150 dependent on the family size the 11 cash grants were distributed in algerian dinars documentation could be provided to support the exchange rate used for recording purpos the bureau stated that it is more practical for the beneficiaries to receive algerian dinars as they usually make their purchases in tindouf algeria before travelling to laayoune or before receiving their families from laayoune at the refugees camps oios would suggest therefore to avoid unnecessary recording of exchange gains and losses and in acco rdance with unhcr programme management procedures project budgets be calculate d and presented in the currency of expenditure recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname should determine the currency that is most appropriate for the disbu rsement of cash grants and subsequently make the necessary rev ision to the criteria and the subproject budgets the burea u should also ensure the controls over the distribution of c ash grants be strengthened rec10 45 the bureau agreed to take the necessary corrective action oios will record the above recommendation as implemented on receipt of confirm ation that internal controls over the distribution of cash grants have been strengthened and the currency of disbursement of the cash grant corresponds to the currency of the budge ts c recognition and recording of expenditure 46 in 2004 the head of operations had requested u nhcr suboffice in tindouf in many occasions to record disbursements for cbm as receiv ables at the time of payment the head of office only provided the necessary information t reverse the receivables as expenditure when reminded by the tindouf suboffice in august 2 004 as result expenditure was not recorded on time and the information on the unused budgets was inaccurate oios suggested that the forthcoming mission as referred to above b requested to confirm that adequate controls have been established to ensure that expen ditures are recorded in timely manner 47 in 2004 unhcr finance section had recorded 200 4 expenditure of approximately us 42000 under the administrative budgets as 2005 expenditure moreover in 2005 unhcr finance section had not recorded and provided for fuel expenditure although there were nine cbm flights during the period from 22 nov ember 2005 to 31 december 2005 on the other hand unhcr finance section had recorded cash advance of us 5500 in december 2005 for payment of cash grants as expendi ture oios recommended that the finance section ensure expenditures are recorded in the correct accounting year and that advances are not recorded directly to expenditure the bureau agreed to take the necessary corrective action d classification of expenses 48 the unhcr finance section is responsible for cl assifying and coding cbms expenditure based on the debit advice and the suppo rting documents from minurso oios found the classification and coding of 2004 and 200 5 expenditure to be inconsistent for example the payments of cash grants to refugees we re coded under three different general 12 ledger accounts ie 612230 registration tuition related fees 612300 subsistence living room and board allowance and 612999 unspe cified payment for individualfamily similarly the payment of trave l costs and travel allowances to unvs were coded in five different general ledger account s as result information such as actual cash grants paid could not be easily determined fro m the financial reports and the financial data was distorted oios recommended that the finan ce section ensure consistent classification of expenditure in accordance with th approved detailed budgets the bureau agreed to take the necessary corrective action cash management 49 petty cash ceiling had not been established and the amounts held and advanced for disbursement operational advances was left to the discretion of the team leader in rabouni and head of operations in laayoune oios suggests t hat the head of operations assess the cash needs and request the finance section to forma lly establish the petty cash ceiling the bureau agreed to take the necessary corrective acti on d monitoring and reporting reporting requirements 50 the method of implementation of the cbm program is unique with the addressee of loi in geneva and the daytoday management of the operation by the two teams in laayoune and rabouni and the partnership with minur so consequently standard reporting requirements for unhcr programmes were t applicable as consequence in oios opinion the bureau and the desk should have stablished formal reporting requirements to properly and effectively monitor pr ogramme implementation the bureau stated that the desk has established periodic repor ting including report indicating the number of beneficiaries per flight and telephone us age as well as any incident worth reporting during monitoring visits updates are fur nished to the desk on regular basis oios takes note of the bureau comments and would suggest that these reporting requirements should be formalized considering the high staff tur nover at the field level b integrity of information 51 oios found that there are two versions of the t ables in the database concerning family visits in rabouni the statistics reported by cbm w ere based on later version but the reports generated from the database were from the arlier version this has resulted in some discrepancies between the cbm report on statistics and the detail reports generated from the database 52 oios was not able to review the database in laa youne because the tables were password protected the cbm team did not have the p assword and thus cannot create any other new query and can only print existing reports 53 the cbm team did not reconcile the statistics i n the database against the actual number of beneficiaries travelling based on the final trav manifest from minurso oios found that the actual number of beneficiaries travelled d iffered from unhcr database in 9 out of total of 80 cbm flights representing 11 per cent rror rate the net difference is small ie 13 actual number of beneficiaries who travelled on cbm flights was 2091 based on minurso records as compared to the 2087 reported by unhcr however the differences for these nine flights ranged from 1 to 7 persons oios takes note that corrective measures have been implemented since the audit c backups of critical information 54 cbm has maintained two databases one in laayou ne and one in rabouni tindouf to record and monitor the registered refugees refugee s who have benefited from the cbm flights and those who have benefited from the telep hone calls although the head of operations has copy of the original backup of th final registration list unhcr had not backed up the updated databases with information of refugees who had benefited from the cbm flights and the telephone service provided as result there was risk of losing the records if the computers were corrupted corrective action has been taken v acknowledgement 55 i wish to express my appreciation for the assis tance and cooperation extended to the auditor by the staff of unhcr and minurso eleanor burns acting chief unhcr audit service office of internal oversight services
