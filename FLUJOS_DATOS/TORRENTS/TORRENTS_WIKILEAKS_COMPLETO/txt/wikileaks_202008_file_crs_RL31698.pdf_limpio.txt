increase in earned income or hours of employment however congress expanded workrelated tma benefits as part of the family support act of 1988 pl 100485 requiring st ates to provide at least six and up

is required for families who meet certain conditions these expanded tma requirements are outlined in section 1925 of the social secu rity act and congre ss has acted several times to extend them beyond their original sunset date of september 30 1998 most recently tma requirements under section 1 925 were extended through june 30 2009 by pl 110275 this report provides an overview of tm while section 1925 of the social security act outlines the provisions requiri ng states to provide tma for up to 12 months states have considerable flexibility in designing and implementing their tma programs to better understand thes programs the congressional research service crs conducted survey of stat tma policies in effect on july 1 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31698crs2 this report summarizes the results of the survey and discusses legislation introduced to extend and in some instances to modify tma family medicaid coverage and cash welfare medicaid is health insurance prog ram jointly funded by the federal government and the states while states have considerable flexibility to design and administer their programs certain groups of individuals must be covered for certain categories of services generally eligibility is limited to lowincome children pregnant women parents of dependent children the elderly and people with disabilities the federal government finances more than half of all medicaid expenditures annually medicaid eligibility under section 1931 as described throughout this report states are required to provide tma to families who lose eligibility for medicaid under section 1931 of th social security act following is description of how medicaid eligibility works for these families prior to the creation of the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program individuals qualifying for welfare under the aid to families with dependent children afdc pr ogram were automatically eligible for and in most states automatically enrolled in medi caid the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 pl 104193 herein referred to as the welfare reform law formally delinke d medicaid and cash assistance and created new medicaid eligibility category for lowincome families under section 1931 of the social security act medicaid entitlement under s ection 1931 was retained only for individuals who meet the income and resource eligibility standards of their states former afdc program in effect on july 16 1996 herein referred to as eligibi lity under section 1931 regardless of whether they receive tanf or ever received afdc however states were given flexibility to modify their income and resource eligibility standards for medicaid in three ways 1 states may lower their income standards but not below those used for afdc on may 1 1988 2 states may increase their income and resource standards by an amount that is more than the percentage increase in the consumer price index cpi or 3 states may use less restrictive income and resource methodologies than those in effect on july 16 1996 since the welfare reform law of 1996 num ber of states have aligned section 1931 medicaid eligib ility with ligibility for tanf and many use less restrictive methods for counting income and resour ces to allow individuals and families to qualify for medicaid at higher income and resource levels than those in place on july 16 1996 as part of their methodology fo r determining medicaid eligibility some states have policies in place to disregard portion of earnings or income for limited period of time for example state might disregard the first 120 plus 90 of earnings during familys first four mo nths of section 1931 medicaid coverage after month four the disregard drops to 120 as result the amount family canhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31698crs3 2 in 2001 the most recent comprehensive data available 36 states including dc did not have timelimited disregard policies for section 1931 coverage meaning that the amount family could earn and still qualify for medicai d would not vary from month to month in the 15 states with these policies the length of the disregard period ranged from four to 12 months see kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured can medicaid work for lowincome working families april 2002 available at httpwwwkfforgmedicaid4032indexcfm 3 although parents and children are eligible for family medicaid coverage under section 1931 number of eligib ility pathways with higher income and asset thresholds eg mandatory eligibility for ages 6 and under with family income less than or equal to 133 fpl may be available for children depending on state practices children may be enrolled via these other pathways rather than secti on 1931 in contrast section 1931 is one of the few medicaid eligibility pathways available for parents and more generally adults who are not pregnant disabled or d r l s t t s t h t w i s h t work outside of the regular medicaid rules can do

eligible federal statute speci fies that families must have received medicaid under section 1931 in at least thr ee of the six months preceding their loss of eligibility and have dependent child in the home10 during this initial sixmonth period of tma states must provide fa milies with the same amount duration and scope of benefits offered under section 1931 that is the medicaid coverage the family was previously receiving however states may opt to meet this requirement by using medicaid funds to pay familys premiums deductibles coinsurance and similar costs for employerbased health c overage referred to in statute as wrap around tma may not be terminated dur ing this initial sixmonth period so long as the family continues to have dependent child in the home second sixmonth period

tma enrollees in their medicaid populations the vast majority of tma enrollees are eligible for workrelated reasons as nearly all states indicated in the crs survey that less than 10 of their tma population lost medicaid eligibility under section 1931 because of an increase in child or spousal support collections table 1 also illustrates that expenditures for the 20 states reporting totaled

capitation payments were not made in that monthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31698crs9 state tma program policies as table 1 illustrates enrollment and expenditures for tma vary treme ndously by state due both to differences in stat characteristics such as population size and in medicaid program design as disc ussed above section 1925 of the social security act requires states to provide up to 12 months of tma to certain families however some states have made consid erable efforts to expand and extend their tma programs expansions and extensions of state tma programs have occurred through number of avenues within the st ates these include waivers of federal requirements also referre d to as section 1115 waiv ers medicaid state plan amendments that expand eligibility under section 1931 through modified income and resource eligibility standard s or other means and th use of stateonly funds the july 2002 crs survey asked states to respond to number of questions designed to determine the extent to wh ich states have extended or expanded tma coverage for example several states ngthen the period of medicaid coverage by providing 12month disregard of all earned income at the point when an increase in income jeopardizes their medicaid ligibility under section 1931 this disregard allows the family to retain section 1931 medicaid eligibility for 12 months after the disregard is exhausted at the end of this 12month pe riod families are then eligible for up to 12 months of tma ot her states extend tma coverage through the use of stateonly funds states also use various options to modi fy the three of si x months requirement for tma as previously discussed federa l statute requires that individuals receive medicaid under section 1931 in three of th six months immediately preceding their loss of eligibility in order to qualify for tma however some states will effectively bypass this rule by using earned income disregards for example family whose earnings are low enough to qualify for s ection 1931 medicaid may see an increase in earnings immediately in months two or three after receiving coverage this increase in earnings may mean that they longer qualify for section 1931 medicaid and they would not qualify for tma because they did not receive medicaid in three of the immediately preceding six months some states would allow this family to remain eligible for medicaid by disregardi ng all earnings for two months and as result also meet the three of six months requirement for tma other states conduct lookback reviews to provide retroactively coverage to lowincome families who would have qua lified under section 1931 medi caid had they applied table 2 below summarizes state responses to the crs tma survey which reflects state policies in effect as of

year 2006 and provided scaledback version of welfare reauthorization through fy201012httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31698crs11 although welfare reauthorization was ach ieved through other means s 667 is noteworthy in that it would have provide d fiveyear extension of section 1925 tma and given states statutory options for modifying their tma policies as described earlier and shown in table 2 number of states ve already implemented changes through other avenues unde r s 667 states could have opted to provide continuous eligibility for tma for 12 months by waiving quarterly reportin g requirements extend coverage for an additional 12 months for total of up to 24 months of tma so long as familys gross monthly earnings less necessary child care costs remained below 185 fpl waive the requirement that fa mily must have received section 1931 medicaid in three of the previ ous six months to qualify for tma s 667 also would have allowed states to meet section 1925 tma requirements by extending medicaid coverage under s ection 1931 to families whose gross monthly earnings less necessary child care costs are at or below level that is at least 185 fpl in state choosing this option families whose earnings exceed the eligibility standard for section 1931 medicaid would receive further medical assistance families whose earnings remain at or below the states eligibility standard at least 185 fpl would continue to receive section 1931 medicaid in effect this provision would have preven ted states with relatively high section 1931 eligibility standards from having to pr ovide the automatic six months of tma coverage outlined in section 1925 to familie s whose earnings exceed those relatively high standards it would not have allowed states with lower less than 185 fpl section 1931 eligibility standards to opt out of providing the automatic six months of tma even in cases where family ear nings exceed 185 fpl and it still would have required them to provide up to six additional months of tma to families whose earnings remain at or below 185 fpl in addition s 667 would have required states to coll ect information on average monthly tma enrollment and participation rates for adults and children to make the information publicly available and to and submit the information to the secretary of hhs in turn the secretary of hhs would submit annual reports to congress concerning these rates the bill also would have required administrators within hhs to work together to develop guidance or other technical assistance for states regarding best practices in guaranteeing access to tm finally the bill would have required states to notify all families whose tanf be nefits are terminated of their ongoing eligibility for medicaid benefits or if family is longer eligible for medicaid to supply onepage notification describing eligibility and how to apply for medicaid and schip coverage recent action legislation to temporarily extend section 1925 tma

could opt to waive the requirement that family have received medicaid in at least 3 of the last 6 months in order to qualify and would be required to collect and submit to the secretary of hhs and make publicly available information on average monthly enrollment and participation rates for adults and children under workrelated tma and on the number and percentage of children who become ineligible for workrelated tma and whose eligibility is continued under another medicaid eligibility category or who are enrolled in schip in turn the secretary would submit annual reports to congress concerning these rates discussion research shows that lowincome indi viduals are more likely to be without health insurance than those with higher incomes in 2006 34 of people under age 65 with family incomes below the federa l poverty threshold went without health insurance compared to 12 of individuals with incomes at least two times the poverty threshold among lowincome indi viduals who are working health care coverage is not always available or ffordable only 18 of people under age 65 with incomes below the poverty threshold received health care coverage through employment in 2006 compared to 79 of pe ople with incomes of at least two times the poverty threshold15 for lowincome families tma continues health care coverage on temporary basis when they might otherwise lose eligibility for medicaid due to their earned income hours of work or child or spousal support this continuation is especially valuable for parents since income eligibility limits for medicaid coverage of adults who are not pregnant disabled or elderly are quite low in some states as shown in figure 1 and since private health insurance may be unavailable or unaffordable although congress has not yet

reporting requirements for tma could pose barriers to family receipt of tma and recommended that the congress consider allowing states to lessen or eliminate these
