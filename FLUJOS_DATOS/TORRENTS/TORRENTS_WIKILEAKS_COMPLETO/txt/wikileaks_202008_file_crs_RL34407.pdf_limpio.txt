1105 of title 31 united states code as amended by 801804 of pl 108173 mma president bush was required to submit gislation to congress responding to the warning within the 15day period beginning on the date of the budget submission to congress this year1 the presidents bill was submitted on february 15 2008 and introduced in the house of representativ hr 5480 and the senate s 2662 on february 25 2008 this repor t summarizes the legislativ proposal submitted by the president as required2 the presidents proposed bill is divided into three titles covering 1 value based health care 2 tort reform

plan under 29 usc 10023 4 part b of medicare currently requires that hi gher income beneficiaries pay larger share of premiums however the income limits are indexed the presidents 2009 budget included

percentage of thei r part d prescription drug premiums the income thresholds begin at 82000 for an individual and 164000 for couple the thresholds would not be indexed so that they would not increase each year4 the savings estimate for this incometesting proposal in the presidents budget is 3180 billion for fiscal years 20092013 issues in certifying whether the presidents bill lowers spending below the trigger level before examining the specific com ponents of the presidents proposed legislation it is important to consider the more general question of how congress would be able to certify whether or not this bill or any others that are subsequently introduced would successfully lower genera l revenue funding be low the 45 level there are some potential issues that should be taken in to consideration as required by statute th official determination of medicare fund warning was issued by the medicare board of trustees the centers for medicare and medicaid services office of the actuary is responsible for providing the estimates of medicare spending and re venues used to determine wh ether funding warning is required their estimates were included as part of the 2007 nnual report of the board of trustees of the federal hosp ital insurance and federal supplementary medicare insurance trust funds issued on april 23 2007 in this report the actuaries estimated that the general reve nue funding would first exceed 45 in 2013 within the critical sevenyear period in their 2006 report they had also estimated that general revenues would exceed 45 during the critical sevenyear period having made this termination in two consecutive years medicare fund warning was issued similarly the 2008 annual report of the boar d of trustees included an estimate that general revenue funding would exceed 45 in 2014 which is inside the new critical sevenyear period the actuaries indicated that this estimate creates new warning based on the estimates of excess general revenues for 2007 and 2008 as result the president will be required to submit legislative proposal in responsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34407crs3 5 this requirement may be waived if before the deadline for the presidential response 1 congress enacts legislation to eliminate exce ss general revenue medicare funding for the new sevenfiscal year reporting period and 2 if within 30 days after enactment the board of trustees of the medicare trust funds certif ies that the legislation eliminates the funding warning 6 the discharge process in the senate could otherwise occur if the committee on finance has not reported bill reflecting any required medicare funding legislation by june 30 then any senator may move to discharge that committee from single medicare funding measure to the warning within 15 days of th presidents fy2010 budget which will be released in early february 20095 the mma specified that the chairman of the house committee on the budget is responsible for certifying whether an medicare funding legislation or any subsequent amendments to it eliminates the excess general revenue medicare funding the statutes do not specify how this certification is to be made the rules for the senate only require certification by the chairman of the senate committee on the budget for enacted legislation as an exception to the discharge process6 in general for bills reported out of committees in either the house or the senate the congressional budget office cbo is statutorily required to provide cost estimate the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 93344 requires that whenever committ ee of either house reports bill or committee amendment to its house it must accompany that bill with statement or the committee shall make available such statement in the case of an approved committee amendment which is not reported to its house projection by the congressional budget office of how such measure will affect the levels of such budget authority budget outlays revenues or tax expenditures under existing law for such fiscal year or fiscal years and each of the four ensuing fiscal years the cbo also makes its own independent estimates of medicare spending and receipts each march the cbo issues an estimate of baseline spending an estimate of federal spending and r eceipts under existing policies in its march 2007 baseline the cbo estimated that gene ral revenue funding would first exceed 45 in 2014 which was not within the critical seve nyear period thus based on its 2007 estimates medicare was already below the trigger level during the prescribed seven year window even before savings of the pr esidents proposed legislation or any other bills introduced to lower ge neral revenue spending were included in its march 2008 baseline the cbo estimated that general revenue fundi ng would exceed 45 within the new critical sevenyear period in 2013 on march 12 2008 cbo released its co st estimates of hr 5480 and s 2662 the house and senate bills reflecting the presidents gislative response to the general fund warning cbo estimated that the legislative proposal would reduce general revenue funding as percentage of total outla ys to 45 in 2013 compared with 451 under its most recent 2008 current law baseline estimates in 2014 under both its current law ba seline estimates and its estima tes including the savingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34407crs4 from the presidents legislative proposal cbo estimated that ge neral revenues as percentage of total outlays would exceed the 45 level the mma requires the medicare board of trustees to issue the medicare funding warning but does not include specific provision that would alter cbos role in the congressional process whether the cbo or the centers for medicare and medicaid services office of the actuary will be responsible for providing the budget committees with an estimate of the potential savings for the presidents legislation or any other bill introduced to lower general reve nue funding may make large difference another consideration is the effect on ge neral revenue spendi ng of any potential increase in payments to medicare what effect might legislation that increases medicare spending have on the trigger if such legislation is enacted after the board of trustees issues warning as an example congress has shown interest in ensuring that medicares payments to phy sicians do not decrease the current update formula for medicare physici an payments mandates 05 increase in the physician fee schedule for the sixmonth period from january 1 2008 through june 30 2008 payments for the remaining six months of 2008 and afterwards will be computed as if the modification to the conversion factor for the first six months of 2008 had never applied absent new legi slation medicare payments to physicians will decrease beginning july 1 2008 however if congress passes legislation desi gned to alleviate this problem it could result in an increas in medicare spending unless the costs of increasing physician payments were offset by other legislation affecting the medicare program if congress enacts legislation to increase physician payments and the costs are not offset within medicare then the increased spending would further increase general revenue spending for the medicare program title i introducing principles of valuebased health care into the medicare program section 101 introducing principles of valuebased health care into the medicare program current law proponents of valuebased purch asing in health care emphasize the focus of each decision maker such as an insurer employer or patient on assessing differences in perceived value whether it be in efficiency quality cost or some other measure when choosing among options the value assessment can be specific to each decision maker and pr oponents of the concept prefer the positive connotation of maximiz ing value typically emphasizi ng quality when making health care purchasing decisions valuebased purchasing approaches emphasize the collection and analysis of data on quality the dissemination of quality information to providers and beneficiaries and the selective rewarding of identified highquality achievers through contracts partnerships or incentives see for example the testimony of robert berenson md be fore the subcommittee on health of the house committee on ways and means ptember 29 2005 many health care industry leaders and policy makers have urged the fe deral government through publicly funded health care programs such as medicare medicaid and schip to payhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34407crs5 7 inpatient services provided by acute care hospitals are reimbursed based on the inpatient prospective payment system ipps medicares ipps payments are increased annually by an update factor that is determined in part by the projected increase in the hospital market basket index 8 for more information about the presid ents initiative see httpwwwwh itehousegov newsreleases 200608200608222htmlhealth care providers different amounts based on variation in the quality of their services proponents of these payforperform ance systems in health care assert that such programs could help improve the quality of care while also helping to control the rate of growth in health care costs congress has passed legislation to pr ovide the groundwork for implementing valuebased payments to providers including hospitals physicians and skilled nursing homes section 501b of the mma provided an incentive for an eligible hospital to submit quality data for ten quality measures know n as the starter set in order to avoid 04 percentage point reduc tion in its annual payment update from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for fy2005 2006 and 2007 section 5001a of the ficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 dra required hospitals to report additional quality meas ures to receive the full market basket increase to their payment rates7 payment rates were redu ced by 2 percentage points for any hospital that did not submit certain quality data in form and manner and at time specified by the secretary the dra required cms to develop nd implement method for hospital valuebased purchasing in 2009 the valuebased purchasing system must be budget neutral while creating incentives for highquality hospitals and minimum benchmarks for lowquality hospitals the tax relief and health care ac t of 2006 pl 109432 trhca requires hospital outpatient departments to submit data on quality measures in order to avert 2 percentage point re duction in their annual payments starting in 2009 in august 2006 the president issued an executive order titled promoting quality and efficient health care in federal government administered or s ponsored health care programs8 also referred to as the health care transparency initiative or the valuebased health care initiative this order aims to promote valuebased purchasing principles in health care through number of activities including transparency in pricing and quality measures as well as encouraging payfor performance systems presidents proposal the secretary would develop and implement system for encouraging the nationwide adop tion and use of interoperable electronic health records and would make the personal health records of medicare beneficiaries available through this system the secr etary would make publicly available 1 information on prices and payments unde r the medicare program for treatments including episodes of care items and services to assi st medicare beneficiaries in making choices among providers plans nd treatment options and 2 information on the quality of care provided to medicare beneficiaries to assist them in making choices among providers plans and tr eatments to ensure the continuedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34407crs6 development and evolution of quality m easures the secretar would develop and implement plan for ensuring that by the year 2013 quality measures are available and reported with respect to at least 50 of the care provided under the medicare program determined according to the amount of payment made under such program for items and services with respect to which such measures are available the secretary would report to the committees on ways and means and energy and commerce in the house of representativ and the committee on finance in the senate annually on the pr ogress of these goals to accomplish these objectives the presidents proposal would put in place incentives for providers and suppliers as we ll as for beneficiaries for providers and suppliers the secretary would design nd implement system for use in the medicare program under which portion of the payments that would otherwise be made under such program to so or all classes of indi viduals and entities furnishing items or services to beneficiaries of such program would be based on the quality and efficiency of their performance the secretary would first implement such system in settings where measures are wellaccepted and already collected including hospitals physicians offices home health agencies skilled nursing facilities and renal dialysis facilities the initial focus of such efforts would be on quality but the secretary would add measures of efficiency as they are identified the system would also include incentives for reducing unwarranted geographic variations in quality and efficiency the provision would also clarify that the secretary would have the authority to implement the system described above for medicare beneficiaries the secretary would provide incentivesto use more efficient providers and preventive services known to reduce costs the secretary would assure transition into the medicar program for individuals who own health savings accounts and would also provide for the availability of highdeductible health plan options in the medicare program the secretary would use and release medicare data for quality improvement performance measurement public reporting and treatmentrelated purposes with the goal of broadly transforming the private health care marketplace the secretary would apply risk adjustment techniques wh ere appropriate and would determine the circumstances under which it is appropriate to release such data the secretary would ensure that individually identifiable benefi ciary health information is protected in accordance with the regulations adopted unde r the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and ch other laws and regulati ons as may apply the secretary could implement sy stem described in this s ection by regulation but only if such regulation were issued after public notice and an opportunity for public comment these proposals could be implemented on ly if they achieve savings for the medicare medicaid and schip programs specifically the chief actuary of cms would be required to certify that 1 the total amount of payments made under the medicare program over the 5 and 10year periods beginning january 1 of the year in which the above proposals are implement ed is less than the amount that would have been made if such implementation had not occurred and that 2 the totalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34407crs7 amount of medicaid and schip payments over such periods as result of such implementation is greater than the amount that would have been made had such implementation not occurred the secretary would carry out the provisions of this section subject to the availability of appropriations and to the extent permitted consistent with the savings require ment described in this paragraph section 102 release of physician performance measurements current law section 101 of title i of the tax relief and hea lth care act of 2006 trhca authorized the establishmen t of physician quality reporting system by cms cms has titled the statutory program the physician quality reporting initiative pqri the pqri establishes financial incentive for eligible professionals to participate in voluntary quality reporting program eligible professionals who successfully reported pq ri quality measures on claims for dates of service from july 1 through decembe r 31 2007 could have earned an incentive subject to cap of 15 of total allowed charges for c overed medicare physician fee schedule services furnished july 1 through december 31 2007 the medicare medicaid and schip ex tension act of 2007 extension act pl 110173 authorized the continua tion of the physician quality reporting initiative pqri for 2008 the financial in centive for eligible professionals who successfully report the designated set of quality measures du ring 2008 is 15 of total allowed charges for c overed services payable under the physician fee schedule financial incentives earned for 2008 repor ting will be paid in mid2009 from the federal supplementary medical insurance part b trust fund the 15 financial incentive and its funding source for 2008 are the same as for 2007 presidents proposal the proposal would modi fy the existing physician quality reporting program under dicare to permit the secretar to 1 release to the public physicianspecific measurements of the quality or efficiency of physician performance against standard reflecting m easurements that have been recognized through consensusbased pro cess that has been endorsed by the secretary and 2 release to an entity that will generate or calculate such measurements data that the entity may use to perform such task the secretary would be able to make an endorsement of such standards by publication of notice in the federal register title ii reducing the excessive burden the liability system places on the health care delivery system introduction preemption of state laws medical malpractice suits are governed by state law but because they affect interstate commerce the us constitution would permit congress to regulate them and to preempt state laws that regulate them title ii of the medicare funding warning response act of 2008 which is titled the help efficient accessible low cost timely healthcare health act of 2008 would impose fe deral standards on some aspects of medical malpractice suits but would leave other aspects to continuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34407crs8 9 crs report rl31692 medical malpractice liability refo rm legal issues and fiftystate survey of caps on punitive damages and noneconomic damages by henry cohen 10 this provision does not mention sellers of medical products which leaves it uncertain whether title ii would preempt state laws th at impose greater protections for sellers of medical products 11 this provision raises the question whether state that wishes to have cap may enact cap that is so high say 1 billion that it is effectively cap and thereby not be subject to title iis cap 12 section 204c provides that for pur poses of applying the 250000 cap future noneconomic damages shall not be discounted to present value thus even if an award was is excess of the 250000 cap and the present value of an annuity for the award would be below the 250000 cap the award would still be limited to the cap itself at 250000 it would not be reduced to the present valueto be governed by state law actually title ii would apply to all health care liability claims which it defines to include not only medical ma lpractice suits but product liability suits that allege injuries resulting from defectiv medical products this section summarizes the main provisions of title ii and does so not in the order of the sections of title ii but in the order of the following subjects that title ii addresses 1 cap on noneconomic damages 2 standard for and cap on punitive damages 3 limiting joint and several liability 4 modifying the collateral source rule 5 limiting lawyers contingent fees 6 creating federal statute of limitations and 7 periodic payment of future damage s another crs report without making reference to any particular legislation discusses thes same subjects in the same order explaining the legal concepts each involves in greater depth than the present report does and offering pros and cons of each9 even with respect to those aspects of medical malpractice suits on which title ii would impose federal standards title ii would not preempt every state law as noted above it would not preempt any state law that imposes greater procedural or substantive protections for health care pr oviders and health care organizations from liability loss or damages than those provided by this act or create cause of action 211b210 title ii would also not preempt any state law whether effective before on or after the date of enactment of this act that sp ecifies particular monetary amount of compensatory or punitive damages or the total amount of damages that may be awarded in health care lawsuit regardless of whether such monetary amount is greater or lesser than is provided for under this act 211c thus under title ii caps on damages would be the one aspect of liab ility law that states could make more favorable to plaintiffs than title ii would11 1 cap on noneconomic damages section 204b would impose 250000 cap on noneconomic damages in any health care lawsuit regardless of the number of parties against whom the action is brought or the number of sepa rate claims or actions brought with respect to the same injury as noted above this cap would pply only in states that have cap before enactment of title ii and that do not enact one subsequently12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34407crs9 13 regarding the burden of proof for punitive damages those states that impose the lesser burden of preponderance of the evidence on plaintiffs would be preempted see crs report rl31721 punitive damages in medical malpra ctice actions burden of proof and standards for awards in the fifty states by henry cohen and tara alexandra rainson 14 21 cfr 31480bc 31481b2economic damages refer to monetary losses that result from an injury such as medical expenses lost wages and rehabilitation costs title ii would not cap economic damages noneconomic damages consist primarily of damages for pain and suffering both economic and noneconomic damages are compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages 2 standard for and ca p on punitive damages section 207a provides that punitive da mages may be awar ded if otherwise permitted by state law if the claimant proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant acted with malic ious intent to injure the claimant or deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury that the defendant knew the claimant was substantially certain to suffer title ii would thus preempt state law regarding the burden of proof and standard for awarding punitive damages except in states that provide greater prot ection for defendants13 section 207b2 would also impos cap on punitive damages of 250000 or two times the amount of economic not of all compensatory damages awarded whichever is greater as with title iis cap on noneconomic damages the cap on punitive damages would apply only in states that have cap before enactment of title ii and that do not enact one subsequently section 207c1 would provide that punitive damages may be awarded against the manufacturer or distributor of medical product or supplier of any component or raw material of such medical product if the product has been approved by the food and drug administration or is generally recognized as safe and effective under fda regulations this prohibition of punitive damages would not apply however if person 1 knowingly misrepresented to or withheld from the food and drug administration information th at is required to be submitted that is causally related to the harm which the claimant allegedly suffered or 2 made an illegal payment to an official of the f ood and drug administration for the purpose of either securing or maintaining approval clearance or licensure of such medical product fda regulations require that even after drug is approved drug companies report to the fda new information they obtain about adverse drug experiences14 therefore company that fails to do so could under title ii apparently be subject to punitive damages state law permitting on february 20 2008 the supreme court limited the potential import of prohibiting punitive damages with respect to products that have been approved by the fda it held that federal law the medical device amendments of 1976 21 usc 360k bars state tort claims not just punitive damages claims regardinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34407crs10 15 riegel v medtronic inc 06179 us february 20 2008medical devices that receive premarket approval from the fda and comply with federal requirements15 3 limiting joint and several liability section 204d would eliminate joint and several liability in health care liability claims joint and several liability is the commonlaw rule that if more than one defendant is found liable for plaintiffs injuries then each defendant may be held 100 liable with joint and several liability the plainti ff may not recover more than once but may recover all hi s or her damages from fewer than all liable defendants with any defendant who pays more than its share of the damages entitled to seek contribution from othe r liable defendants the main argument for eliminating joint and several liability is that it allows plaintiff to recover his entire damage aw ard from deep pocket defendant who was only minimally liable the main argument for retaining joint and several liability is that it is preferable for wrongdoer to pay more than its share of the damages than for an injured plaintiff to recover less than the full compensation to which he is entitled 4 modifying the collateral source rule the collateral source rule is the commonlaw rule that allows an injured party to recover damages from the defendant even if he is also entitled to receive them from third party collateral source ch as health insurance company an employer or the government to abolis h the collateral source rule would be to require courts to reduce damages by amounts plaintiff receives or is entitled to receive from collateral sources often collateral source such as health insurer or the government has right of subrogation against the tortfeasor the person responsible for the injury this means that the collateral source takes over the injured partys right to sue the tortfeasor for up to the amount the collate ral source owes or has paid the injured party although the collateral source rule may enable the plaintiff to recover from both his insurer and the defendant the pl aintiff if there is subrogation must reimburse his insurer the amount it paid h im if the collateral source rule were eliminated then the defendant would not have to pay the portion of damages covered by collateral source and the collateral s ource would apparently not be able through subrogation to recover the amount it paid th plaintiff in the medical malpractice context therefore eliminating the collateral source rule would benefit liability insurers at the expense of health insurers and other collateral sources section 206 would provide that in any he alth care lawsuit any party usually the defendant may introduce evidence of co llateral source benef its and the opposing party usually the plaintiff may introduce evidence of amounts paid to secure those benefits eg health insurance premiums title ii does not state that collateralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34407crs11 source benefits minus amounts paid to s ecure such benefits would have to be deducted from damage awards section 206 would also eliminate the right of subrogation in cases in which collateral source benefits ar deducted from damage awards the plaintiff would not recover any money from the defendant ag ainst which the collateral source would have right of subrogation even if section 206 did not liminate the right of subrogation in cases in which collate ral source benefits are not deducted the plaintiff could apparently recover from both the defendant and the collateral source 5 limiting lawyers contingent fees contingent fee is one in which lawyer instead of charging an hourly fee for his services agrees in exchange for repres enting plaintiff in tort suit to accept percentage of the recovery if the plainti ff wins or settles but to receive nothing if the plaintiff loses payment is thus tingent upon there being recovery plaintiffs agree to this arrangement in order to fford representation without having to pay anything outofpocket lawyers agree to it despite the risk of not being compensated because the percentage they receive if they wi n or settle usually from 33a to 40 generally amounts to more than an hourly fee would section 205 would impose cap with s liding scale in medical malpractice cases 40 of the first 50000 the plaintiff recovered 33 of the next 50000 25 of the next 500000 and 15 of any additional amount 6 creating federal statute of limitations the statute of limitations the period within which lawsuit must be filed for medical malpractice suits under state law is typically two or three years starting on the date of injury sometimes however the symptoms of an injury do not appear immediately or even for years after malpractice occurs many states therefore have adopted discovery rule under which the statute of limitations starts to run only when the plaintiff discovers or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered his injury or sometimes his injury and its cause section 203 provides the time for the commencement of health care lawsuit shall be three years after the date of manifestation of injury or one year after the claimant discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury whichever occurs first in event sh all the time for commencement of health care lawsuit exceed three years after the date of manifestation of injury unless tolled ie the three years does not start to run for any of the following 1 upon proof of fraud 2

damages are paid in installments over period of time and attorneys fees arrangements in relation thereto 31 alr4th 95 96respectively on the date of manifestation of injury and discovery of the injury title ii defines neither term but in its report on the 108th congresss version of this bill the house committee on energy and commerce explained the former term the term manifestation of injury means the injury has become reasonably evident thus if someone unknowingly receives tainte d blood manifestation of injury is not the date of receiving the blood instead it is the date on which adverse symptoms become reasonably evident16 the discovery of the injury then would apparently occur on the date that the patient learns that his blood is tainte d which date may not occur until after manifestation of injury suppose that medical tests reveal the tainted blood one year after the plaintiff experienced his first symptoms there would still be two years to run on the threeyear manifestation peri od but the plaintiff would apparently have to sue within one year of discovering that his blood is tainted even if it takes more than one year to learn that his blood is ta inted as result of transfusion patient could also apparently discover his injury perhaps through routine medical test before symptoms become manifest and again the oneyear discovery period would apparently apply it is not clear whether this provision is strictly speaking statute of limitations title ii does not call it that statute of limitations is typically an affirmative defense which means that the defendant must raise it if the defendant fails to raise it then the plaintiff may sue regardless of how much time has passed17 section 203 by contrast could be interpreted to place the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show that his injury occurred within the time period allowed 7 periodic payment of future damages traditionally damages are paid in lump sum even if they are for future medical care or future lost wages in recent years however attorneys for both parties in damages actions have occasiona lly foregone lumpsum settlements in favor of structured settlements which give the plaintiff steady series of payments over period of time through the purchase of an annuity or through selffunding by an institutional defendant18 section 208 provides in any health care lawsuit if an awar d of future damages without reduction to present value equaling or exceeding 50000 is made against party with sufficient insurance or other assets to fund periodic payment of such judgment the court shall at the request of any party enter judgment ordering that the future damages be paid by peri odic payments in any health care lawsuit the court may be guided by the uniform periodic payment

b premiums see crs report rl32582 medicare part b premiums by jennifer osullivanpromulgated by the national conference of commissioners on uniform state law though this provision states that an award of future damages shall not be reduced to present value to determine whether it equals or exceeds the 50000 minimum necessary for party to require the court to order periodic payments it does not state whether the amount of th award of future damages would be converted to present value not to requi re such conversion could be very major change significantly reducing awards if it is intended to allow defendant to pay for example 1 million award over 10year period at 100000 year on the other hand if it requires the jury award to be converted into present value terms an annuity with present value of 1 million the reform doesnt mean that much as practical matter the defendant woul d be paying the same amount as before19 the defendant that is would have to spend 1 million for an annuity that as it earned interest over the years of its distri bution would yield the plaintiff more than 1 million had the defendant paid the plai ntiff lump sum of 1 million then the plaintiff could have purch ased that same annuity title iii increasing highincome beneficiary awareness and responsibility for health care costs background section 301 of the presidents bill include s statutory language for proposal to income related premiums for drug plans under medicare part d the proposal itself was included in both the presidents fy2008 and fy2009 budgets the proposal builds on the current law provision which incomerelates premiums for medicare part b part b premiums20 medicare part b is financed through combination of beneficiary premiums and federal general re venues in general beneficiary premiums equal 25 of estimated program costs for the aged the disabled pay the same premium as the aged fe deral general reve nues account for the remaining 75 the basic 2008 premium is 9640 incomerelated part b premium the medicare prescription drug improvement and moderniz ation act of 2003 mma p l108173 provided that higherincome enrollees pay higher percentage of part b costs beginning in 2007 the increase was to be phased in over five years however the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl109171 reduced the phasein pe riod to three years in 2008 they pay total premiums ranging from 317 to 617 of the value of part b when fullyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34407crs14 phased in during 2009 higher income indivi duals will pay total premiums ranging from 35 to 80 of the value of part b the income calculation is based on modified adjusted gross income in general the taxable year to be used is that begi nning in the second calendar year preceding the year involved thus 2006 income is used to calculate the 2008 premium amount in 2008 singles with incomes over 82000 and couples with incomes over 164000 pay higher amounts under current law the income levels are increased each year

coverage for outpatient prescription drugs for medicare beneficiaries coverage is provided through private prescription drug plans p dps or medicare advantage prescription drug mapd plans the program relies on these private plans to provide coverage and to bear some of the financial risk for drug costs federal s ubsidies covering the bulk of the risk are provided to encour age participation unlike other medicare services the benefits can only be obtained th rough private plans further while all plans have to meet certain minimum requirements there are significant differences among them in terms of bene fit design drugs included on plan formularies ie list of covered drugs and costsharing applicable for particular drugs medicare part d is financed through co mbination of benefi ciary premiums and federal general revenues in addition certain transfers are made from the states beneficiaries pay different pr emiums depending on the plan they have selected on average beneficiary premiums account for 255 of expected total part d costs for basic coverage except for persons entitled to lowincome subsidies all persons selecting particular part d plan pay the same monthly premium amount section 301 the presidents proposal would establish incomerelated premiums for part d under the proposal the income thresholds would be the samehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34407crs15 21 the presidents budget included proposal th at would also eliminate the current annual cpiu adjustments for part b premiums consequently each year the number of beneficiaries subject to the higher premiums would increase the budget included estimated savings of 110 million in fy2009 and 257 billi on over the fiveyear budget period for this part b proposal 22 see crs report rl34280 medicare part d prescrip tion drug benefit primer by jennifer osullivanas those established for incomerelating part b premiums as shown in table 2 further the income thresholds w ould not be updated in future years21 calculation of increased premium the bill specifies how the increased premium would be calculated the calculation is linked to the base beneficiary premium this is national figure based on specified percentage of the national average monthly bid amount fo r part d basic coverage the percentage is roughly 255 of the value of coverage nationwide after removal of reinsurance payments22 the 2008 base benefici ary premium is 2793 the calculation is designed so that higherincome benefi ciaries would pay roughly the same proportion of the value of coverage nationwide for basic part d coverage as they will pay for the nati onwide value of part b beginning in 2009 table 2 shows the estimated additional amounts that these beneficiaries would pay in 2009 based on the 2008 base beneficiar premium the actual calculation would be based on the 2009 base beneficiary premium the addon amount also referred to as the subsidy reduction would be the same regardless of the partic ular plan selected by the beneficiary the total amount that beneficiary would pay in part d premiums would be the addon amount which would be the same nationwide plus the premium for the particular plan selected which would vary by plan note that when both members of couple are enrolled in part d both would pay the applicable increase table 2 estimated beneficiary part d monthly adjustment amounts 2009 based on 2008 base

inflationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34407crs16 administrative provisions the proposal includes number of procedural provisions by september 15 of each year beginning with 2008 the secretary of the department of health nd human services hhs would disclose to the commissioner of social security the amount of the base benefi ciary premium by october 15 the secretary would disclo to the commissioner the monthly adjustment amount and any other informati on the secretary determined necessary to carry out the incomerelated reduction in the premium subsidy the monthly adjustment amount would be collected through reduction in the beneficiarys social security check if the individuals monthly benefit payments were insufficient provision w ould be made to allow othe r agencies to collect the necessary amounts this would likely aff ect some federal retir ees and retirees from the railroad retirement board this is the way part b premiums including the increased premiums for higher income enro llees are currently collected it should be noted that beneficiaries would still have the option of paying the basic part d premium directly to the plan alternativel they could elect to have both amounts deducted from their social security checks the provision would also make conf orming amendments to the internal revenue code it would ex tend to part d the applica tion of the current provisions relating to disclosure of return information necessary to carry out the part b premium adjustments it would add provision provi ding that return information used for both the part b and part d adjustments c ould be disclosed to officers and employees of hhs and the department of justice to the extent necessary and solely for their use in any administrative or judicial preceding ensuing from premium adjustment further the provision would specify the timing for disclosure of return information to officers employees and c ontractors for the social s ecurity administration for persons currently entitled to social security or railroad retirement benefits the disclosure would have to be made within the four months prior to when the taxpayer first becomes entitled to part or eligible to enroll in parts b or d for other persons the disclosure would be made after the taxpayer applied for benefits under part or b and was eligible to enroll in part d potential impact the savings estimate for this proposal in the presidents budget are 350 million in fy2009 and 318 billion over the fiveyear budget period fy2009fy2013 the budget did not include an estimate of the number of beneficiaries who would be affected by higher premiums at the time the 2008 part b premiums were announced in octobe r 2007 cms estimated that about 5 of beneficiaries would be affected by the incomerelated premium increase in 2008 it is thought that slightly lower percentage would be affected by the part d proposal this is because some highincome medicare beneficiaries have alternative sources of prescription drug coverage such as thr ough former employer and therefore do not enroll in part d the additional part d premium amount w ould be recalculated each year based on the new base beneficiary premium am ount over time this amount is likely to increase the income categories would not however be updated consequently each year the number of beneficiaries subject to the higher part d premiums would likely increase
