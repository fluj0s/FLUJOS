part of the chinese empire mongolia achieved independence in 1921 in revolution backed by the soviet union after this the communist mongolian peoples revolutionary party mprp ruled for almost 70 years maintaining tenuous balance between the soviet union and china and receiving substantial financial assistance from each public demonstrations for political pluralism in 1990 led to the resignation of the communist mprp government whose leaders declared the end of oneparty communist state since then mongolia has been undergoing political and economic transition to parliamentary democracy under new constitutional rules adopted in 1991 after decades of dependency on soviet aid at one point worth nearly 40 of the countrys gdp mongolia has sought to broaden its foreign contact and trade political trends and conditions2 despite the official demise of communism in mongolia in 1990 the formerly communist mprp has continued to play dominant political role3 in the first popular elections ever for mongolias parliament in 1990 the formerly communist peoples great hural the mprp won 80 of the seats in turn the same year this mprpdominated parliament elected an mprp member p ochirbat as mongolias first president while new constitution in 1992 created new parliament the state great hural to replace the peoples great hural the mprp also won significant majority in the new body its 71 out of total of 76 seats gave it firm control while mongolias fledgling opposition parties remained essentially powerless but the balance began to tip away from the mprp in 1994 when the party turned against ochirbat after he vetoed legislation passed by the parliament when ochirbat lost the mprps backing in mongolias first direct presidential election in 1993 he ran and won as an opposition candidate weak governmental institutions corruption mongolias legal and financial institutions remain underdeveloped and are serious impediment to improving the countrys economy and business climate in part because of these weak institutions the existence and enforcement of laws protecting private property is extremely limited even though the government passed land ownership law in 2002 that allows the sale of farmland to individuals governmental corruption also is becoming more acute problem and was the subject of demonstrations and protests during the 2005 presidential election campaign in some respects and with considerable assistance from western democratic organizations the fledgling government has made great strides in the 15 years since it adopted multiparty 2 sources for this section include the far eastern economic review the wall street journal and the foreign broadcast information service 3 the mprp having shrugged off communism nevertheless did not officially adopt new socialist agenda until march of 1997 when it amended its party platform crs3 politics4 still mongolias legislative processes remain in their infancy it was only in 2004 for instance that mongolias parliament the state great hural sgh passed measures giving parliamentary committees separate budgets staff and rules of procedure the first public hearing by parliamentary committee was held only in 2002 although western groups providing assistance are encouraging the sgh to hold public hearings as routine part of the legislative process legislative elections of 1996 mongolias parliamentary elections on june 30 1996 were the first in which an effective organized opposition existed to challenge the mprps 75year rule the democratic union formed over period of about five years by coalition of eight opposition parties was the only party to field clear recognizable political platform to challenge mprp candidates5 it achieved stunning electoral victory in what was widely regarded as free and fair election with 91 of the electorate turning out to vote the democratic coalition took 50 of the 76 seats giving it majority in the parliament as well as the support of president ochirbat the new mongolian leadership was quoted as crediting the victory to help from us political strategists and to study of american political devices the contract with america in particular economic issues political reform and foreign relations dominated the 1996 election campaign in political strategy that many came to view as the cause of the mprps downfall the party offered firm prescriptions for mongolias political problems or for its relations with other countries democratic union coalition candidates on the other hand put forward more specific policy agenda vowing to make government more transparent sell stateowned media organizations establish pension plans increase teacher salaries and reform mongolias judicial system finally the coalition placed strong emphasis on friendship with the west primarily with the united states which mongolia calls its third neighbor instability in 1997 mongolia held two related elections in 1997 in the presidential election on may 18 the results of the 1993 presidential election were reversed and the presidency was won by natsagiin bagabandi the mprp candidate leaving the government divided between the executive and the parliament bagabandi won with 608 of the vote against two other candidates the incumbent of seven years president ochirbat from the democratic union coalition which retained its majority in the great hural from the 1996 elections and gombojav from the mongolian unity party mup on august 20 1997 mongolia held an interim parliamentary election to replace bagabandi who had to give up his seat in the great hural in order 4 the international republican institute iri in particular has an extensive democracy building program in mongolia conducting election training programs and assisting with parliamentary development 5 the two largest parties in the coalition were the mongolian national democratic party mndp and the mongolian social democratic party msdp crs4 to become president bagabandis former parliamentary seat was won by mprp member nambaryn enkhbayar to some extent political analysts at the time regarded bagabandis election as symbolic gesture of public frustration over the drastic and painful economic reforms imposed by the new government after the 1996 elections under those reforms unemployment crime and taxes rose while other financial and economic policies were not entirely successful in addition some believed that the democratic coalition majority elected in 1996 did not communicate its goals and policies effectively enough to the public to sustain its popularity in the 1997 presidential election cycle most believed that bagabandis election would not change the overall direction of democratic development and reform in mongolia for one thing mongolias 1991 constitution reserves only limited powers to the president in principle the power to veto while giving most political power to the great hural including the power to appoint government ministers nevertheless the democratic coalitions 50seat majority in the great hural though substantial was still one vote short of the margin needed to override presidential vetoes breakup of democratic coalition 19982000 mongolias political situation became more tumultuous in 1998 with series of political crises leading to much legislative maneuvering between the mprpled government and the ruling democratic coalition on april 17 1998 prime minister enkhsaikhan announced his resignation in the wake of public discontent over harsh reform measures he had adopted to strengthen mongolias economy on april 23 1998 enkhsaikhan was replaced as prime minister by mndp member tsakhiagiyn elbegdorj the majority leader in parliament who was elected with 60 votes out of the 76 members in the great hural elbegdorj in turn was forced to resign by confidence vote in the great hural on july 24 1998 making his government the shortest in mongolias brief democratic history because of his controversial decision on may 27 1998 to allow the stateowned renovation bank to merge into the privately held golomt bank the parliamentary group of the mprp charged that the decision on the bank merger violated the mongolian constitution and posed threat to national economic security in the ensuing months the ruling parliamentary coalition struggled with president bagabandi over the naming of new prime minister with bagabandi repeatedly rejecting the great hurals choice of davaadorj ganbold in december 1998 the new mndp leader janlavyn narantsatsralt became prime minister but his government fell in scandal in july 1999 on july 30 1999 the great hural endorsed as prime minister rinchinnyamyn amarjargal another democratic coalition candidate ultimately in 2000 the strain of these political crises proved too much for the democratic coalition it collapsed setting the stage for dramatic comeback by the mprp in parliamentary elections in july when mprp candidates won 72 out of the 76 seats in the great hural that month the mprp leader nambaryn enkhbayar became mongolias 5th prime minister in two years in december 2000 the remnants of the former democratic coalition including the mndp and the msdp merged to form the democratic party dp president bagabandi was elected to second term as president in may 2001 crs5 coalition government collapse 2006 mongolias latest political crisis was born in the 2004 parliamentary elections when an assortment of democraticminded parties under the umbrella title motherland democracy coalition mdc won 34 parliamentary seats out of total of 76 to the mprps 38 seats after weeks of political gridlock the two groups compromised to form workable coalition government the democratic party leader tsakhiagiyn elbegdorj became the new prime minister and the mprp assumed 10 positions in elbegdorjs 18member cabinet but the troubled government struggled with growing unemployment allegations of corruption and factional differences the increasing popular disillusionment with the coalitions rule was reflected in presidential elections in may 2005 when mprp candidate and former prime minister nambaryn enkhbayar won the presidency less influential though still powerful position than that of prime minister with 534 of the vote compared to the 197 garnered by his democracy party rival mendsaikhani enkhsaikhan on january 11 2006 the fragile government collapsed altogether when all 10 mprp cabinet members resigned in protest to what they said was the alliances ineffective governance and loss of public support the collapse was followed by days of protests in the capital some protesting government corruption and economic deprivation some accusing the mprp of attempting to seize power for itself the official government response to the mprp resignation however followed established political procedures on january 25 2006 the parliament chose miyeegombo enkhbold mprp chairman as the new prime minister succeeding elbegdorj according to reports the democratic party declined the mprps offer to join in national unity government and instead chose to function as an opposition and establish shadow cabinet6 the next parliamentary elections are in june

nominal exchange rate data in order to determine the actual purchasing power expressed in dollars of countrys gdp using nominal exchange rates mongolias per capita gdp in 2006 was only 870 however the ppp data indicated that because the cost of goods and services is much lower in mongolia than in the continued crs6 sector especially herding accounting for about onefifth of gdp 2005 it employs about half of the population mineral production accounts for 68 of industrial output 46 of foreign direct investment fdi and 59 of mongolias export earnings9 the collapse of the soviet union in the early 1990s had severe impact on mongolias economy which had employed sovietstyle economic policies and heavily relied on soviet assistance10 after that aid abruptly ended the economy suffered real gdp fell by 92 in 1991 and by 95 in 1992 leading to significant decline in mongolian living standards11 subsequently the central government moved to privatize its stateowned economy and adopt other free market reforms from 1990 to 2006 the proportion of gdp accounted for by the private sector rose from 4 to 80 such reforms enabled mongolia to join the world trade organization wto in 1997 mongolia has struggled to reform the economy while promoting economic growth from 1997 to 2002 real gdp growth averaged only 2812 in 2003 mongolia agreed to pay russia 250 million an enormous sum for the government to resolve most of its debt obligations in an effort to strengthen investor confidence from 2003 to 2006 real annual gdp growth averaged 75 much of that growth resulted from increases in
