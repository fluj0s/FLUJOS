glossary 51 1 introduction the purpose of this report is to document the validation of computer online forensic evidence extractors cofee generated thumb drives which were created using the two nw3c collection profiles nw3c volatile data and nw3c incident response tool tested computer online forensic evidence extractor version 112 run environments windows xp service pack 2 and windows xp service pack 3 supplier microsoft nw3c purpose and scope this validation study was conducted in conjunction with the validation study titled cofee gui console to verify that the cofee suite functions properly this document focuses on the validation of the cofee generated thumb drives cofees primary purpose is to create thumb drive which contains predetermined set of applications which are set to run on suspects live machine upon connecting cofee generated thumb drive to suspects machine the investigator executes runnerexe program located on the thumb drive which in turn executes all of the programs specified by cofee and stores the data collected on the investigators thumb drive the programs placed on the generated thumb drives are identified by profile loaded into cofee while any user can create their own profile this validation study will focus only on the profiles created by nw3c nw3c volatile data and nw3c incident response this validation study was conducted to ensure that when runnerexe is executed all of the programs identified by the profile are executed that the collected data is stored on the investigators thumb drive that applications were run from the suspects machine and that unacceptable writes were made to the suspects machine cofee is currently only supported on the microsoft windows xp operating system other operating system was tested during this validation study test result summary overall result testing conducted on runner and the nw3c profiles verified that both the runnerexe application as well as the selected programs functioned as expected and are well within acceptable practices for data collection on live system 2 nw3c volatile data profile there were writes to the suspect drives file system using this profile there were updates made to the windows registry on the suspects machine however none of the registry updates were of obvious forensic value for specific information on what keys were written to see test results nw3c incident response profile this profile caused three writes to the suspect drives file system all three writes were caused by the program handleexe and were made to the file procexp100sys the reference to the file procexp100sys is hardcoded into handleexe product of sysinternals and as such it is not possible to restrain handleexe from writing to this file however this file is specifically written as part of the sysinternals toolset and is not of evidentiary interest there were also updates made to the windows registry on the suspects machine however none of the registry updates were of obvious forensic value for specific information on what keys were written to see test results during the testing of the incident response profile one test runnertest012 fell outside of normal parameters during this test handleexe did not write to the file procexp100sys or any registry entries related to procexp100 this anomaly occurred during only one test and as it caused even fewer writes does not affect the overall outcome of this validation test assertions the following assertions were based upon the listed features of cofee as well as adherence to accepted forensic practices on live machine 1 all programs identified in the profile were executed 2 results of the tools were properly stored on the investigators thumb drive 3 executing runnerexe did not cause any direct writes to the suspect drive file system 4 executing runnerexe did not cause any direct writes to the suspect drive registry 5 the tools executed were run from the thumb drive not from the suspects machine testing

immediately after the completion of runner the tester stopped the process monitor capture and saved the log file to the thumb drive the log file was examined later for testing of the assertions listed above the results of the analysis are detailed below assertion 1 an examination of the thumb drives file system indicated that all of the programs associated with the nw3cincident response profile were successfully copied to the disk an examination of the process monitor logs indicates that all of the programs 42 associated with the nw3cincident response profile were successfully run during the testing period assertion 2 an examination of the contents of the thumb drive indicates that runnerexe successfully saved the output files on the thumb drive and in the appropriate directories assertion 3 an examination of the process monitor logs indicates that there were three direct writes made to the suspects hard drive this test was done by filtering the process monitor log results to show only file system information and searching for any writefile operation the results indicate that the program handleexe made three writes to the file cwindowssystem32driversprocexp100sys reference to the file procexp100sys is hardcoded within handleexe and as such it appears that it is not possible to restrain handleexe from writing to this file however this file is specifically written as part of the sysinternals tool and would not be of evidentiary interest assertion 4 an examination of the process monitor logs indicates that there were 262 total writesupdatesdeletions were made to the registry by runner and its processes to include all of the programs within the selected profile these results will also include attempts to change that were not allowed ie an attempt to delete key

notes this validation was conducted to test the functionality of the two nw3c profiles as they would run on suspects system this is not validation of the full cofee suite additional references leo dorrendorf z g 2007 cryptanalysis of the windows random number generator the hebrew university of jerusalem bowser m wykes j 2009 cofee gui console national white collar crime center glossary entropy random data mouse position processor statistics local time etccollected by an application or operating system for use in cryptography file system in relation to this document file system refers to active files on the suspects system incident response the actions and approaches taken to network security breach such as system being hacked registry the registry consists of number of separate hive files which store various types of information when system is powered on the operating system combines these hive files in ram to create the registry when changes are made to the registry the changes are made to the registry that is located in ram the point at which these changes are actually written to the hive files on the disk varies depending upon number of factors therefore it is difficult to determine if any of the changes made to the registry by the profiles discussed in this report would actually affect the data stored on the suspects hard drive for example if the investigator removes power from the suspects machine by pulling the power cord immediately after running the volatile data profile it is possible that none of the changes made to the registry would have actually been stored to the suspects disk volatile data any data that is lost when power is removed from the system windows random number generator pseudorandom number generator prng that uses collected entropy from windows machine to establish cryptographic keys each windows process has its own copy of wrng instance entropy collected is used to generate an rc4 key that is stored in its internal state for random number generation each instance of the wrng uses eight rc4 streams entropy collection occurs when an rc4 stream is initialized or it reaches the 16kb threshold the entire 3584 bytes of collected entropy are hashed to produce an 80byte digest which is then fed into an rc4 algorithm as key the key is used to encrypt the clear text contained in the hkey_local_machinesoftwaremicrosoftcryptographyrngseed registry key this key contains the latest seeded value obtained from windows entropy sources and is used by all instances of the wrng run on the machine the result is another 80byte digest that is again fed into an rc4 52 algorithm that is used to encrypt 256byte entropy source read from windows device driver the result of the final encryption is used as key for the rc4 instance that is used in the wrng internal state leo dorrendorf 2007
