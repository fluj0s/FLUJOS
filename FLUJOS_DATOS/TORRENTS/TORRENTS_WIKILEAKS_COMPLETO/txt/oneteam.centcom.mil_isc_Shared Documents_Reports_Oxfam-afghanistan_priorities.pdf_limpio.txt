this paper outlines urgent action necessary to addr ess immediate challenges in afghanistan and to avert humanitarian disaster it does not see k to address all issues of concern but focuses on essential policy change in development and human itarian spheres while aid has contributed to progress in afghanista n especially in social and economic infrastructure and whilst more aid is needed th development process has to date been too centralised topheavy and insufficient it is has been prescriptive and supplydriven rather than indigenous and responding to afghan needs as res ult millions of afghans particularly in rural areas still face severe hardship comparable with s ubsaharan africa conditions of persistent poverty have been significant factor in the sprea d of insecurity donors must improve the impact efficiency relevan ce and sustainability of aid there needs to be stronger coordination and more even distribution of aid greater alignment with national and local priorities and increased use of afghan resour ces indicators of aid effectiveness should be established and commission to monitor donor perf ormance despite progress in some ministries government cap acity is weak and corruption is widespread which is hindering service delivery and undermining public confidence in state building as whole further major reforms are requ ired in public administration anticorruption and the rule of law urgent action is required to promote comprehensive rural development where progress has been slow through building local government to iver essential services reforming sub national governance and channelling more resources directly to communities whilst provincial reconstruction teams may be neces sary in some areas they have significantly exceeded their interim security mand ate through diverting resources they have impeded the development of effective institutions f local government and prt projects are substitute for longterm communityled development work military projects can also compromise the neutrality and scope of humanitarian work prts should therefore adhere to their mandate to facilitate the development of sta ble and secure environment and should only undertake relief or development work where there is critical need and civilian alternative in accordance with their interim status each prt shou ld develop phased conditionsbased exit strategy agriculture and connected trades is the mainstay of the nation supporting 80 of all afghans yet it is severely underfunded multistakeholde r strategy should be developed to ensure the provision of agricultural support at local level c overing arable and livestock farming rural trades and improved land and water management it must ensure relevant support for the economic and occupational activities of rural women neither aggressive eradication nor licensing will r educe opium production the afghan government and donors should support longterm c omprehensive approach which seeks to promote sustainable rural development and which pri oritises support for licit agriculture and not only in those areas which grow poppy there needs to be rigorous and balanced implementation of the existing counternarcotics st rategy with greater outreach to community elders and action against major traffickers despite dramatic improvements in education still h alf of afghan children predominantly girls are out of school and drop out rates for girls are particularly high largescale investments are required in teachers education infrastructure com bined with systemic reform whilst significant progress has been made in the pr ovision of health care overall public health remains poor donors and the government should do m ore to expand the provision of health care in remote areas strengthen institutional capa city coordination and security at subnational level expand and improve hospital care and increa the number of female health workers 3 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 high numbers of civilian casualties are being cause d by all parties to the conflict there must be continued condemnation of the actions of armed oppo sition groups which cause civilian casualties including summary executions suicide b ombs roadside attacks and the use of civilian locations from which to launch attacks l of which are wholly unacceptable international forces must ensure that the use of fo rce is proportionate both in air strikes and house searches and even more determined efforts mu st be made to ensure the security of afghan communities in insurgencyaffected areas ac tions that undermine the goodwill of the people ultimately undermine both stability and oppo rtunities for development the separation of nato and usled coalition command s creates inconsistencies in operating standards and in civilmilitary coordination there should be unified nato command of all international forces close coordination with afgha n forces and universally applicable standards of operation rigorously enforced new multistak eholder entity should be established through the to investigate and monitor alleged abuses i nternational forces should establish system to ensure compensation or other reparation f or civilian casualties and the destruction of property the uns capacity for humanitarian respon and coordination at both central and regional levels should be strengthened significant ly according to the there are 130000 longterm dis placed people in afghanistan and recent fighting has displaced up to 80000 there has also been substantial influx of refugees and deportees from pakistan and iran respectively don ors should ensure sufficient resources are available to respond to these increasing population movements local level disputes have significant cumulative impact on peace development and the wider conflict there should be national strategy for c ommunity peacebuilding which strengthens social cohesion and enhances community capacities t resolve conflict it should be led by community leaders and civilsociety and fullysupp orted by donors it should include measures to ensure the participation of women in peacebuild ing activities as landlocked country with vast largely porous borders afghanistan is unavoidably affected by the policies of its neighbours they should do m ore to help the country on refugees security narcotics and trade which is in their own longte rm interests to address underlying problems the international community in afghanistan must ach ieve deeper level of engagement on regional issues military action by foreign power against iran or against groups in the afghan border areas of pakistan could be seriously destab ilising for afghanistan clear majority of afghans support the internation presence in afghanistan 1 but the development process has made only limited differe nce to their lives and with spreading insecurity change of course is now essential the policy changes proposed in this paper would represent step towards achieving that and t hey should therefore be incorporated into the revised afghan national development strategy 2 peace in afghanistan cannot be achieved without imp roving the lives of ordinary afghans this requires strong leadership by the afghan government and sustained and concerted action by donors and neighbouring states it requires more termined efforts by all donors with greater direction from the united nations which is severel underresourced and the joint coordination and monitoring board jcmb resolut substantial and longterm commitment by the international community is essential not onl to secure development progress but to halt the spread of insecurity as by far the largest donor and troopcontributor the role of the united states in afghanistan will be critical however all donors and troopcontributing states have crucia l role in pressing for urgent action to meet the challenges facing afg hanistan millions of lives depend upon it further information for more details please contac t matt waldman policy and advocacy adviser oxfam international afghanistan 3 4 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 1 aid effectiveness since 2001 afghanistan has received more than 15 billion in assistance and the us house of representatives has approved 64 billion more in economic and development assistance 4 aid will be crucial to afghanistans development f or many years and as this paper argues many areas are und erresourced however too much aid to afghanistan is provided in ways that are ineffective or inefficient for example afghanistans biggest don or the us agency for international development usaid allocates close to half of its funds to five large us contractors in the country 5 as in iraq too much aid is absorbed by profits of companies and sub contractors on nonafghan resources and on high ex patriate salaries and living costs each fulltime expatriate consultant costs in the r egion of 200000 year and in some cases up to half million dollars year 6 according to the former nato special civilian representative the cumulative impact is th at some 40 of aid to afghanistan flows out of the country 7 the afghan government has significant budget execut ion problems due to insufficient or ineffective donor efforts to build the instituti onal and implementing capacities of line ministries some twothirds of us foreign assi stance bypasses the afghan government that officials say they want to strength number of donors including the uks department f or international development dfid provide significant funds through the afgha n reconstruction trust fund artf which provides predictable and accountabl source of funds for recurrent government expenditure however it is regrettable that dfid has very substantially reduced its funding for afghan and international ng who play an important role in grassroots capacity building rural development and support for delivery of essential services there is insufficient direction and support provide d by the and jcmb both of which are substantially underresourced and too li ttle coordination between donors and the government of afghanistan of all technical assistance to afghanistan which accounts for quarter of all aid to the country nly onetenth is coordinated among donors or with the government 8 nor is there sufficient collaboration on project w ork which inevitably leads to duplication or incoherenc of activities by different donors funding for development is fraction of that spent on military operations the us military is spending 65000 minute in afghanista n 35 billion for 2007 9 aid funds are following the fighting usaid concentrates more than half of its budget on the four most insecure provinces dfid allocates onefifth f its budget to helmand canada allocates onethird of its aid budget to kandahar 10 promoting development in the south is essential but as we have seen over the st two years if other provinces are neglected then insecurity could spread 5 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 recommendations reconfigure and coordinate aid donors should ensure aid programmes are consistent with afghanistans national and local development priorities the jcmb and shoul d be significantly strengthened to coordinate donor activities and ensure more ev distribution of resources 11 they should also seek to ensure that the distribution of aid does not disproportionately benefit one or other of afghanistans ethnic groups increase transparency donors should publicly provide comprehensive inform ation on aid flows including on tender procedures use of afghan resources and tractor salaries and profit margins establish indicators of aid effectiveness indicators of aid effectiveness with correlative t argets should be established for each objective under annex ii of the afghanistan compact and those contained in the paris declaration on aid effectiveness 12 establish commission for aid effectiveness an independent commission on aid effectiveness shou ld be established possibly through the and supported by independent manage ment consultants to monitor compliance with the proposed aid indicators and ficiencies in the delivery of aid each donor should report regularly to the proposed commission on the extent to which it meets or falls short of aid effectiveness targets in particular impact efficiency relevance and sustainability of aid an d use of afghan resources increase the volume of aid there is powerful case for more aid to be directe d to areas highlighted in this paper such as education and agriculture in conjunction w ith steps to enhance its effectiveness and build ministerial implementing ca pacity the internationally administered trust funds offer an effective means f minimising waste 13 at the same time sufficient funds should also be allocated to effective afghan and international ngos however any overall increase in the volume f aid to afghanistan should not be at the expense of aid to other developing countr ies 2 national governance weaknesses in governance are increasingly cited by afghans as reason for dissatisfaction with the government they hinder rvice delivery and undermine the legitimacy and credibility of statebuilding as w hole thereby contributing to greater insecurity government systems and processes are opaque bureau cratic and convoluted giving rise to opportunities for graft corruption is wide spread endemic and as the joint coordination and monitoring board puts it continu to flourish 14 despite some improvements the institutional and technical capac ity of line ministries is weak and there are profound deficiencies in human resources female participation in government institutions and in decisionmaking rema ins limited 6 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 there is uncertainty about the roles and responsibi lities of state entities with poor coordination between them they are subjected to on ly limited ad hoc scrutiny and parliament is yet to establish an effective system for scrutinising government policies these problems are compounded by the opium economy where there are links to central government and weaknesses in the justice s ector where rule of law remains precarious governance is fragile and the judicial system is ineffectual and inaccessible 15 despite improvements the afghan national police anp lacks both professionalism and independence the problems cannot all be attributed to the govern ment donor programmes have in many cases failed to build institutional capacities or establish proper systems of governance incoherent wasteful and shortterm pro grammes with weak financial oversight have to some degree accentuated problems of corruption inefficiency and lack of coordination recommendations strengthen public administration reform several mechanisms such as the advisory panel on s enior appointments and the independent administrative reform and civil service commission have been established to ensure fair transparent and merit based appointments but have not yet delivered results these bodies must themselves be transparent and subject to independent scrutiny they should comprise only tho members who are demonstrably independent it is the duty of the int ernational community whose funds are at stake to press for such changes pay and grading reform due to be implemented over fouryear period should be expedited stronger leadership and greater efforts are required by ministers and donors to increase womens participation in governm ent and to build the capacity of line ministries to implement the national action pl an for women continued efforts must be made to strengthen the capacity of civil ad ministration clarify responsibilities and improve coordination between ministries reform of subnational governance is priority which is outlined in following section enhance anticorruption measures rigorous implementation of the national anticorrup tion strategy is essential the anti corruption commission should be overhauled to ensur its transparency and integrity with international support there should be concerte d measures to enhance transparency of government operations especially i n tax procurement and expenditure build stronger mechanisms for monitori ng oversight and audit eliminate bureaucracy and streamline processes and procedure s measures to address corruption in politics counternarcotics instituti ons and the private sector are equally important major reform of the anp is required to nhance professionalism accountability and diversity and to ensure autonom from political interference 16 7 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 reform the legal and institutional framework as part of broader reform of the justice sector th legal and institutional anti corruption framework must be strengthened this wil l require measures to enhance the capabilities independence and integrity of the jud iciary and anticorruption institutions and to implement and enforce the c onvention against corruption 3 rural development and subnational governance while aid has undoubtedly contributed to progress i n afghanistan especially in social and economic infrastructure the development proces s has not sufficiently benefited the majority of the population who live in rural ar eas where essential services such as water or electricity remain scarce or insufficient line ministries are overcentralised and dominate r esource allocation management and planning from kabul provincial line department s have limited autonomy and are subject to interventions by governors offices whic h creates operational problems and deters the deconcentration of resources in villag and districts government is either nonexistent or weak and ineffective having limited capabilities and profoundly inadequate human and financial resources 17 there has been very little donor or government activity to build institutional capacity at district and provincial level and such efforts with national coverage at subnational level there are number of adminis trative appointed and elected entities which have unclear or overlapping respons ibilities with insufficient or uncertain resources for example at provincial lev the governors office line departments provincial council administrative ass embly and development committee there is excessive bureaucracy lack of transparenc and significant disparities in the distribution of government resources throughout the country for example some provinces have more than twenty times the per capit funding for health than for others 18 in number of provincial centres corruption is demic and tribal and ethnic factors rather than competency determine key appo intments 19 municipalities have unclear responsibilities and revenueraising powers weak financial management and limited accountability the national solidarity programme nsp has succeed ed in channelling resources directly to elected community development councils cdcs representing over 25000 villages over 70 of afghanistans communities th rough the programme ngo assistance is provided for communitydirected devel opment projects for example water supply or school construction and there have been several positive assessments of the programme in terms of project implementation governance and stabilisation yet funding for the nsp programme has been irregula r and its future is uncertain the expanded role and legal status of cdcs set out in new bylaw and their relationship to other elements of local government is also uncer tain 20 8 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 recommendations build local government to deliver essential service s intensive efforts are required to build the capacit of the afghan government to deliver or oversee the delivery of essential services at cal level especially education water sanitation and health where most provision is indi rect reform must seek to concentrate the centralised powers and resources of ministries and build institutional systems and capacities at local level donors and k ey ministries including the new independent directorate for local governance shoul d establish group to intensify and coordinate efforts on this issue reform subnational governance legislative reform is required to clarify the roles responsibilities and relationships of subnational state entities at provincial municipa l district and village level including cdcs and to rationalise and clarify coordination nd planning reform should ensure that the primary role of the governors offices is provincial coordination and planning rather than involvement in the operation of line partments greater technical and financial support should be provided to elected bod ies principally provincial councils to support monitoring oversight and representation particularly on development issues 21 measures are also required to enhance local govern ment transparency simplify procedures and strengthen ongoing public dministration reforms in conjunction with wider legislative coordination an d planning reform such measures could substantially improve accountability and redu ce corruption increase support to communities more resources should be channelled directly to com munities by 1 ensuring timely and sufficient flow of funds to cdcs and providing guaranteed funding to secure the future of the programme 2 through cdcs channell ing funds for sectorspecific and multicommunity projects and 3 where cdcs do not exist using other means of providing support to communities such as through l ocal ngos 4 provincial reconstruction teams there are 25 provincial reconstruction teams prts in afghanistan led by 13 different nations their mission statement is to assist the islamic republic of afghanistan to extend its authority in order to facilitate the velopment of stable and secure environment in the identified area of operations nd enable security sector reform and reconstruction efforts 22 the prt handbook also states that each prt is an interim structure which on fulfilment of its ssion should be dismantled prts have gone well beyond this interim security m andate often engaging in extensive development work implemented either by t he military or government agencies afghan communities appreciate any support they can get but whilst prt resources and activities have expanded local gover nment institutions with significantly smaller budgets have been underused and underdeveloped it will not be possible to strengthen institutions of local gov ernment and to improve their accountability if they are deprived of resources 23 in some cases prts have used their 9 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 influence to intervene in provincial political or dministrative affairs which has generated considerable local resentment there are major variations in funding and activitie s between prts and significant number of projects are not in alignment with provin cial or national plans or the interim afghanistan national development strategy being nationled they are often driven more by available funding or the political i nterests of the nation involved rather than development considerations frequent use of cal contractors especially in the south has meant many projects are badly implemente d systemic or political pressure and frequent rotations has tended to result in rge number of smallscale shortterm projects the absence of community participation r association with the military has led to projects which are unsuitable unused or tar geted by militants given the historic suspicion of foreign interventio n such efforts to win hearts and minds are naïve it is unsurprising that the huge expansion of prt activities has not prevented the deterioration of security the develo pment process needs to be owned and led by afghan communities which is essential f or sustainability prts are substitute for longterm development work prts also blur the distinction between the military and aid workers jeopardising the perceived neutrality of the latter putting them in danger and reducing operating space for humanitarian organisations recommendations refocus prts prts should adhere to their mandate to facilitate the development of stable and secure environment and they should only exist wher security conditions make them absolutely necessary 24 in respect of humanitarian activities as the inte rnational community first agreed in the oslo guidelines of 1994 the military should only undertake relief work in exceptional circumstances where there is critical humanitarian need and civilian alternative and their activities should focus on indirect assistance and infrastructure support25 as indicated above the quality and impact of this work could in many cases be substant ially improved exit strategies in accordance with their interim status exit strat egies should be developed for each prt with downscaling and closure plans for those in comparatively secure areas at macro level donor funds should be rerouted from pr ts to national government through the internationallyadministered afghanista n trust funds and as priority to local government and afghan communities 5 agriculture agriculture and connected occupations and trades supports the subsistence or employment of at least 80 of afghans and has tradi tionally accounted for at least half the economy however war displacement persistent droughts flooding the laying of mines and the sustained absence of natural resourc management has led to massive 10 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 environment degradation and the depletion of resour ces in recent years afghanistans overall agricultural produce has fallen by half 26 over the last decade in some regions afghanistans livestock population has fallen by up to 60 27 and over the last two decades the country has lost 70 of its forests 28 there continue to be major food shortages and in 2007 the world food programme sou ght to provide food to 54 million afghans 29 yet given the scale of reliance on agriculture in ternational support in the sector has been modest and government assistance extremely lim ited donors have spent less 300400m directly on agricultural projects over th last six years fraction of overall assistance to afghanistan 30 aside from narcoticsrelated programmes in 2006 u said allocated less than 4 of total funding for afghani stan to agriculture and planned spending for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 is just 4 and 3 respectively 31 in daikundi province for example there are close to half million people who depend on the land yet there is virtually internationa l support for agriculture the provincial department of agriculture irrigation an d livestock which is responsible for providing all official support for farming in the p rovince has threadbare staff of 16 only two of whom have relevant qualifications with funds for projects rural unemployment is extremely high at over 50 nd is exacerbated by large scale deportations of economic migrants from iran and the return of refugees convoluted system of land rights remains an impediment to grea ter investment in and use of agricultural land recommendations develop comprehensive strategy to ensure agricult ural support at local level urgent efforts must be made to provide locallevel support for agriculture and offfarm trades which would improve livelihoods strengthen food security and reduce unemployment the afghan government with the suppo rt of the food and agriculture organisation donors and ngos should d evelop strategy to enhance the institutional capacity of the department of agricul ture at district level and expand the scale and range of agricultural support including assistance provided on cost recovery basis the strategy should cover the recruitment and train ing of staff technical support in designing and implementing projects streamlining b ureaucracy coordination with other relevant line departments and the provision f substantial additional resources contractingout to ngos as used for health care livery could help to overcome shortterm capacity constraints in programme terms the strategy should address th distribution of improved seed varieties fertilizers and pesticides crop diversi fication horticulture and kitchen gardens training in agricultural skills technique s and improved animal husbandry methods livestock development especially improved use of fodder crops fodder storage management of grazing land and herd or fl ock management the provision of veterinary services especially for vaccinations an d disease control in remote areas and the provision of agricultural tools and sustainable mechanisation wider establishment 11 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 of community cooperatives could help farmers gain ccess to finance and share best practices and resources the strategy must ensure t hat rural women benefit from increased support whether in farming or offfarm r ural trades and that their particular skills and resource needs are addressed improve land and water management capabilities the proposed strategy should incorporate capacity b uilding and financial support for effective land management water resources manageme nt especially irrigation systems and watershed programmes and communitybased disa ster risk reduction ongoing land rights reform to clarify and harmonize multip systems of land tenure should be expedited support is also required for processing and marketing methods transport infrastructure and access to markets support rural trades greater resources should be devoted to support for offfarm and nonfarm income generation activities such as carpetmaking or han dicrafts ranging from skills training to access to markets 6 counternarcotics in 2007 the cultivation of poppy and production of opium was up on 2006 by 17 and 34 respectively production has doubled in two yea rs and now accounts for 93 of global illicit supply 32 although cultivation has been reduced in the centr enorth of afghanistan cultivation in the insecure south has vastly increased state officials are known to be complicit in poppy cultivation traffic king or nonintervention the opium industry is valued at three billion dollars year33 accounting for up to third of the economy the opium economy is deeprooted and complex inext ricably connected both to insecurity and to poverty and compounded by inequi table systems of land tenure sharecropping and credit according to the offi ce of drugs and crime over 90 of farmers grow opium for economic reasons and onl fraction would continue to do so if there were viable alternatives 34 recommendations adopt comprehensive longterm approach there are simple solutions or quick fixes to the narcotics problem in particular only limited progress if any can be expected in h elmand province which produces more than half of afghan opium the reality of g lobal heroin market should be taken into account as long as demand persists opium wil l be produced somewhere to meet illicit demand the afghan government and donors should support l ong term multisectoral approach which above all seeks to achieve sustainab rural development as success in tackling opium production in thailand demonstrat counternarcotics requires broadbased economic development and statebuilding particularly at local level 35 12 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 there needs to be substantial additional support fo r licit agriculture as well as offfarm and other rural trades as outlined in the previous section so that farmers are not forced to turn to poppy agricultural programmes m ust be comprehensive and not just focused on those areas that grow poppy altern ative livelihood programmes where they are area or targetlimited can create perverse incentives to support longterm approach counternarcotics should be rem oved from shortterm political milestones for afghanistan which have been establis hed by the international community in addition there needs to be mainstre aming of the drugs issue into overall reconstruction and peacebuilding efforts better understanding of global market dynamics and greater afghan ownership over t he drugs policy debate strengthen implementation of the national drug cont rol strategy there needs to be more rigorous and balanced impl ementation of the national drugs control strategy which rightly includes elements f interdiction manual eradication incentives public information demand reduction an d law enforcement in particular donors and the government should expand outreach to mullahs and community elders who are the central authority both in morality and governance for rur afghans more than one in three farmers who have decided not to grow poppy attribute their decision to religion or the disapproval of elders 36 ensure law enforcement starts at the top prosecuti ons or action to undermine the activities of major drug barons or state offici als who are complicit in trafficking would have powerful disruptive and d eterrent effect so far fewer than dozen midlevel traffickers have been prosecuted institute treatment and harm reduction programmes f or drug users in afghanistan 37 neighbouring countries and international consumpti on markets to reduce demand for afghan opiates and to reduce the risk of blood borne diseases such as hivaids and hepatitis c reject proposals for aggressive eradication evidence indicates that small farmers cannot easily shift to alternative crops thus eradication should only be used where it is targete d and where there are substantial and viable livelihood alternatives without such ternatives eradication can severely exacerbate rural poverty simply displace cultivati on and even create incentives for farmers to increase opium cultivation in response t actual or threatened eradication the government should reject aggressive eradication such as aerial spraying which would hit poor afghan farmers not the traffickers it would drive them to seek protection from antigovernment groups lead to gre ater backing for the taliban and create wider insecurity reject proposals for licensing cultivation for medi cal opiates to fulfil domestic requirements the afghan governm ent could legitimately use confiscated opiates for medicinal production howev er the afghan government and donors should reject proposals for licensing which would be ineffective and unworkable in afghanistan for the following reason s this would not affect the production of illicit opi um because 1 half the country is highly insecure and in many areas either the taliban dominate or the governments authority is too weak to operate such programme and 2 the 13 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 licit price could never match the illicit price wh ich could be as much as ten times greater thus the black market would remain 38 the additional demand and greater perceived legitim acy would result in increased cultivation currently only 4 of afghani stans agricultural land is used for poppy 39 there are insufficient resources or controls to pre vent illicit diversion of the licit crop which is up to 30 of total production in in dia 40 thus the international narcotics control board incb could not sanction s uch use as it requires guaranteed security of the licit crop it would confuse messages on drug control from the government donors and not least from the mullahs who have decreed that i t is against islam 41 it is unnecessary according to the indb there is world oversupply of opiates national shortages or underusage especially in veloping countries is caused by restrictive legal regulations and bureaucracy l ow health care budget resources and low policy priority for palliative ca re production transport bureaucratic and control cos ts would render afghan morphine uncompetitive as against other licit produ cers in the global market such as australia 7 education despite very significant increase in enrolment app roximately half of afghan children predominantly girls are out of school in 2006 ov erall enrolment in primary education was 50 for boys and just 20 for girls for second ary education it was 20 and 5 respectively teachers are paid an average of just 50 per month only 20 are professionally qualified and less than third is female there is an immediate shortage of some 50000 teachers high proportion of girls drop out of sc hool to lack of female teachers especially in rural areas 42 significant number of government schools charge nduser fees despite provision in the afghan constitution which guarantees free ed ucation over 5000 schools have buildings there are major variations between th quality cost and investment in education between provinces and national budgeting and expenditure systems are complex and bureaucratic as an example in daikundi province of roughly 10 00 official and unofficial teachers only two have relevant professional qualifications of 220 schools only 28 have buildings and 85 of schools charge userfees 43 increasing insecurity in the south has had major deleterious impact on education more than half of the 720 schools in the southern p rovinces of helmand kandahar uruzgan and zabul are closed due to violence or thr eats 44 and overall attendance levels for girls remain extremely low 14 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 recommendations international donors should give substantial additi onal funding to support the implementation of the national education strategy as set out in oxfams recent report on education in afghanistan 45 amongst other things the priorities should be to recruit train and support more teachers recruit and train of over 50000 additional primary school teachers at least 50 female increase the teaching wage and the resettlement all owance for those moving to rural areas establish wellresourced teachertraining colleges in all provinces and institute comprehensive inservice training to raise the quality of teaching institute training and other measures to eliminate corporal punishment in schools and to address violence between students build education infrastructure construct at least 7000 school buildings over the next five years expand support for outreach classes or community schools i n remote areas eliminate formal and informal enduser fees provide universal midday meal in all schools whi ch would cost 200m per annum and has been proven to increase enrolment ra tes improve student performance and address child malnutrition 46 produce and distribute nationwide high quality tex tbooks to all schools give more support to communities to improve the sec urity of schools and to achieve greater security of access for girls improve financial systems planning and coordinatio n move towards zerobased budgeting system coordin ate planning at district and national level and establish system of resou rce monitoring enhance coordination between donors ngos and prts to ensure alignment with national and provincial plans especially in r espect of school construction and to ensure more even distribution of education funds throughout the country 8 health significant progress has been made in the provision of health care through the basic package of health care services bphs which is im plemented on contractual basis by ngos and other providers and overseen by the nistry of public health donor government coordination in health care is effective and there has been progress in capacity building of health care institutions and p ersonnel primarily at central level progress has been made from very low base over the last five years there has been 25 fall in infant mortality but still on average one in five children die before the age of five 47 the proportion of young children receiving vital i mmunizations has 15 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 substantially increased but still around third f children do not receive vaccinations against tuberculosis 48 which causes total of around 12000 deaths each year 49 over the last three years the number of rural women receiving antenatal care has increased dramatically likewise those receiving s killed assistance with childbirth has increased threefold yet assistance is currently vailable to fewer than one in five 50 the maternal mortality ratio at 1600 deaths per 10 0000 live births 51 remains one of the highest in the world overall life expectancy i s just 4346 years 52 health care standards and resources vary throughout the country and insecurity particularly in the south and southeast is increa singly constraining the provision of health care in those areas for example 21 health clinics have been forced to close in helmand province 53 recommendations expand the provision of health care in remote areas although bphs coverage is impressive access is lim ited for those who live in isolated rural areas as result of physical climactic cos t insecurity and cultural constrains thus more primary health care centres should be tablished in rural areas with further measures to promote public health awareness provide training to district and community health staff and expand the system of co mmunity health workers better planning by donors and the moph could address provi ncial disparities in the allocation of resources donors should also ensure sufficient funding and coordination for the expanded programme on immunization to maxim ise national coverage strengthen institutional capacity coordination and security at subnational level donors should provide more support for institutiona l capacitybuilding of the moph at provincial and local level particularly in huma n resources the moph should establish an effective integrated procurement syst em and improve provinciallevel collaboration and coordination with ngos and other agencies provincial strategies to ensure the security of clinics and safety of health workers should be developed which includes enhancing engagement with local communitie s expand and improve secondary and tertiary health ca re whilst the bphs seeks to address primary health car needs donors and the afghan government should invest more in hospitals and heal th centres the essential package of hospital services ephs should be implemented i n more hospitals to ensure better management and higher quality of supplies facili ties and care in all core clinical functions medicine surgery paediatrics obstetri cs and gynaecology hospital standards should be developed with effective monito ring and comprehensive system of training for hospital staff 54 increase the number of female health workers key means of improving womens health which has been proven to benefit the health of families as whole is by expanding acce ss to female health staff better opportunities for training and employment packages which include higher salaries accommodation incentives and security provisions sh ould be provided in order to attract and retain female health workers 16 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 increase core government spending on health core government spending on health is less than 1 of gdp equating to around 10 of the overall health budget with the remainder pr ovided by external sources 55 to secure sustainable comprehensive health service the proportion of core government funding for health must be increased 9 protection the security situation in afghanistan has deteriora ted significantly the estimates that the frequency of attacks bombings and other v iolent incidents is up 2030 on 2006 56 in 2007 the conflict claimed over 6000 lives 57 compared to roughly 4000 for 2006 58 at least 1400 civilians have been killed in 2007 500600 of whom were killed in operations conducted by international and afghan fo rces 59 there are more than twice as many airstrikes by international forces in afgh anistan as in iraq to which high number of casualties can be attributed 60 searches conducted by afghan and international forces have on number of occasions involved excessive use of force destruction of property andor mistreatment of susp ects discrete isaf and usled commands creates operational incoherence variable operating standards inconsistent practices in civilmilitary coordination and hinde rs cooperation with afghan national security forces insurgent and criminal attacks have intensified ki lling over 900 afghan police 61 and 220 international soldiers last year more than 140 suicide attacks have killed well over 200 civilians 62 in the south southeast and east of the country i nsurgents are mounting an increasingly vigorous terror campaign of threats abductions and executions aimed against members of the population suspected of bein g connected to the afghan government and its military and civilian internatio nal supporters according to the there are 130000 longterm dis placed people in afghanistan and recent fighting in the south has displaced up to 80 000 63 insecurity has had wider impact on livelihoods forcing the closure of educa tion and health facilities last year there were at least 131 violent incidents directly targeting or impacting on ngos caused by both criminal and insurgent activities 1 5 ngo staff were killed and 88 abducted 64 in 2007 there were more than 30 attacks on wfp foo d convoys 65 humanitarian access has been significantly curtaile d and close to half the country the south and southeast is now categorised as an extr eme or high risk environment for ngos 66 insecurity has spread to areas which were previous ly stable such as parts of north and northwest afghanistan achieving greater security is priority for afghan s the inability of the government and international community to provide greater prot ection for communities undoubtedly challenging task is major reason for afghans turning to the aegis of the taliban or other antigovernment groups 17 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 recommendations ensure proportionate use of force afghan and international forces should take all pos sible steps to minimise civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian property including rigorous verification of intelligence and should ensure that searches are c onducted with proportionate force and respect for human rights and traditional values crucially the approach must incorporate an empathetic appreciation of the persp ective of afghan people unify command of international forces ensure commo n operating standards and enhance coordination with afghan forces there should be unified nato command for all intern ational forces in afghanistan with permanent mechanism to monitor operating sta ndards of all units ensure all detainees are treated in accordance with internatio nal humanitarian law including those transferred to the custody of afghan authorit ies and strengthen coordination with afghan forces wherever possible community eld ers should be engaged or forewarned in respect of military operations establish new mechanisms to monitor investigate an d compensate for civilian casualties new crosssector body should be established comp rising the afghan government isaf and afghan independent human rights commis sion to monitor and investigate civilian casualties destruction of pro perty and alleged abuses comprehensive system should be instituted to ensure timely and sufficient compensation is paid to civilians who have suffered from military operations support increasing numbers of refugees and idps national action plan should be developed to respo nd to the needs of idps and refugees covering protection resettlement suppor t resolution of land disputes and longerterm assistance it should take account of t he potential for significant future movements in light of increasing insecurity strengthen the uns humanitarian response capabilit ies the uns capacity for humanitarian response coordi nation and the protection of civilians must be strengthened significantly with expanded human and material resources at both central and regional levels 10 community peacebuilding almost all of the peacebuilding work in afghanista n has been at political level where there are links to warlordism corruption or criminality or it is targetlimited such as the disarmament programmes initiatives suc h as the action plan on peace reconciliation and justice are significant but lac k clarity and are primarily concerned with peace and reconciliation at national level implementation of the plan has been nonexistent or extremely limited 67 moreover most peacebuilding measures only marginally indirectly or partially concern the people of afghanistan the capacity of afghan communities to resolve their own disputes nd build and sustain peace has largely been neglected 18 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 the recent deterioration in security particularly in the south and southeast of afghanistan is evidence that topdown approaches re by themselves inadequate without parallel nationwide peacework at ground l evel war has fractured and strained the social fabric of the country and has deepened widespread poverty which is itself cause of inse curity an oxfam security survey of 500 people in six provinces shows that disputes at local level often have root causes in poverty and are largely related to resources p articularly land and water family matters or intercommunity and tribal differences local disputes frequently lead to violence and inse curity which not only destroys quality of life and impedes development work but i s also exploited by commanders or warlords to strengthen their positions in the wider conflict security threats are diverse not only the taliban as is sometimes portrayed and in many cases they have local roots or connections in rural areas predominantl local mechanisms are used to resolve disputes especially community or tribal co uncils of elders known as jirgas or shuras and district governors recommendations promote community peacebuilding there is clear need for widespread community peacebuilding this is participatory bottomup approach which strengthens community cap acities to resolve disputes and conflict to develop trust and social cohesion with in and between communities and to promote interethnic and intergroup dialogue it f ocuses on capacity building in mediation negotiation and conflict resolution tech niques and supports civil society and schools involvement in local peace and develop ment existing community peace building programmes implemented by afghan and inte rnational ngos including oxfam have been highly effective an independent nalysis of the work of one peace building ngo in western afghanistan concluded that the programmes had major positive impact on local security and that it was creative initiative at the forefront of enabling and supporting what is truly wanted by afg han partners and communities 68 thus donors should significantly expand support fo r ngos and civil society actors carrying out such work develop national strategy for community peacebui lding given that existing work on community peacebuildin g in afghanistan has such major impact on peace and development yet remains fragmented and benefits only tiny proportion of afghans there is powerful case for the development of national strategy in kenya for example where oxfam has und ertaken community peace building for over decade there is now national steering committee and peace network to ensure high quality coordinated nationa l coverage in afghanistan with dialogue coordination and external assistance c ivilsociety led strategy should be developed with series of local strategies releva nt to provincial circumstances it should include phased capacity building peaceeduc ation awarenessraising mainstreaming research and monitoring it should lso ensure that women are fully included in peacebuilding activities the afghan g overnment and donors should give full support to the development and implementation of such strategy 19 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 11 regional action as landlocked state sharing largely porous border s with pakistan 2400km iran 930km turkmenistan uzbekistan tajikistan and c hina afghanistan is necessarily affected by the policies of its neighbours particu larly in respect of refugees movements migration security narcotics and trade over 2 million afghan refugees are officially livin g in pakistan and 09 million in iran 69 in 2007 some 350000 afghans returned from pakista n and 170000 mainly economic migrants were forcibly deported from iran as acknowledged in the joint afghanistan pakistan peace jirga held in august last year the taliban and other ill egal armed groups operate with the support of groups bas ed in afghanistans neighbouring states there is extensive trafficking of opium and heroin across afghanistans northern and southern borders including several thousand to nnes of precursor chemicals required for refining opium across the southern bo rder every year 70 afghanistans neighbours will be critical to the co untrys economic development significant proportion of afghanistans trade is bo th with and through neighbouring states pakistan for example accounts for 25 of imports and 20 of exports and is an important transhipment route 71 afghanistans trade with iran has increased considerably recommendations refugees and migrants both pakistan and iran should act in accordance wit h principles enshrined in the tripartite agreements made with each country afgha nistan and unhcr in particular that repatriation is voluntary and grad ual given the security situation in afghanistan pakistan should be assisted by the int ernational community to continue to host afghan refugees 80 of whom do not wish to return their legal status and longterm social and economic integration into paki stani society must be fully considered iran should ensure the measured and pro portionate treatment of economic migrants donors should ensure that shortfalls in u nhcrs budgets are met so that it can provide comprehensive reintegration assistance to returnees security pakistan and iran should take measures to ensure th at groups or members of its administrations or armed forces provide weapons pplies or any other support to illegal armed groups in afghanistan both afghanist an and pakistan should be scrutinised for their willingness to implement unde rtakings given in the joint peace jirga held in august military action by foreign power against iran or against groups in the afghan border areas of pakistan could be riously destabilising for afghanistan and lead to an intensification of attac ks on international and afghan forces narcotics neighbour states should assist in counternarcotics by taking measures to prevent the export of opium from afghanistan and the transit t afghanistan of chemicals 20 afghanistan priorities oxfam january 2008 required for refining in both cases afghanistan an d neighbouring states should reinforce efforts to share intelligence strengthen interdiction and improve law enforcement the trilateral agreement on counterna rcotics between afghanistan iran and pakistan signed in june 2007 should be implem ented in full and should be succeeded by more detailed agreements which enhance crossborder cooperation trade it is in the longterm interests of regional partne rs to support afghanistan by accepting preferential trade agreements which incorporate w tariffs for afghan exports and unrestricted transit trade but allow afghanistan t protect its nascent productive sectors as oxfam argues in recent briefing paper afghanistan should not be pressured to achieve rapid accession to the world t rade organisation which would have few benefits and could undermine efforts to re duce poverty 72 members of south asian association for regional cooperation which fghanistan joined in april 2007 should develop coordinated action plan with pract ical measures in development assistance trade and investment to promote afghan istans economy this should be supplemented by expanding and strengthening regiona l initiatives on trade transport and energy supply by members of the economic cooper ation organisation and the central asia regional economic
