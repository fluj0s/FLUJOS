nlra to post detailed notice to its employees regarding the order and to offer reinstatement and backpay to the terminated employees3 during subsequent compliance hearing before an administrative law judge alj to determine the amount of backpay owed to each employee castro admitted to using friends birth certificate to obtain employment with hoffman castro was born in mexico and had never been legally admitted to the united states based on castros testimony the alj concluded that the nlrb was precluded from awarding reinstatement or backpay to castro the alj maintained that such relief would be contrary to the courts holding in suretan v nlrb prior case involving undocumented workers and the immigration reform and control act of 1986 irca4 the irca makes it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire undocumented workers or for employees to use fraudulent documents to establish employment eligibility although the nlrb supported the aljs determination that reinstatement was inappropriate it disagreed with the aljs conclusion about the availability of backpay5 the nlrb maintain ed that the most effective way to accommodate and further immigration policies embodied in the irca is to provide the protections and remedies of the nlra to undocumented workers in the same manner as to other employees6 the nlrb determined that castro was entitled to 66951 of backpay including interest the backpay amount was calculated from the date of castros termination to the date hoffman first learned of castros undocumented status hoffman filed petition for review of the nlrbs order with the us court of appeals for the dc circuit panel of the court denied the petition after rehearing the case banc the dc circuit again denied the petition for review and enforced the boards order certiorari was granted by the supreme court on september 25 20017 nlrb discretion to fashion remedies for violations of the nlra although the court has recognized the nlrbs broad discretion to select and fashion remedies for violations of the nlra it has set aside awards of reinstatement or backpay to employees found guilty of serious illegal conduct in connection with their employment8 for example in southern ss co v nlrb the court set aside an award of reinstatement and backpay to employees whose strike on ship amounted to mutiny in violation ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21186crs3 9 316

court concluded that the nlrb has not been commissioned to effectuate the policies of the labor relations act so singlemindedly that it may wholly ignore other and equally important congressional objectives 10 in hoffman the court noted that since southern ss co we have accordingly never deferred to the boards remedial preferences where such preferences potentia lly trench upon federal statutes and policies unrelated to the nlra11 following southern ss the court maintained that allowing the nlrb to award backpay to undocumented aliens would unduly trench upon explicit statutory prohibitions critical to federal immigration policy as expressed in the irca12 under the irca an undocumented alien cannot obtain employment in the united states without the employer or the employee contravening explicit congressional policies the court observed the board asks that we overlook this fact and allow it to award backpay to an illegal alien for years of work not performed for wages that could not lawfully have been earned and for job obtained in the first instance by criminal fraud we find however that awarding backpay to illegal aliens runs counter to policies underlying the irca policies the board has authority to enforce or administer13 moreover the court noted that an award of backpay to undocumented aliens would condone prior violations of the immigration laws and encourage future violations14 the nlrb argued that an award of backpay to castro is permissible because it reason ably accommodates the irca and is not inconsistent with it15 the nlrb contended that because the backpay period ended on the date hoffman learned of castros illegal status hoffman could have theoretically employed castro during the backpay period without violating the irca16 further the nlrb argued that the irca does not explicitly render violators ineligible for backpay awards flowing from employment secured by the misuse of documents the court rejected the nlrbs arguments the court recognized the irca as reflecting congress interest in making it criminally punishable for an alien to obtain employment with false documents an award of backpay would suggest contrary interest that congress intended for an alien to remain in the united states illegally and to continue to work illegally the court concluded that the nlrbs position subvertedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21186crs4

law 22 see charles lane court denies back pay to fired illegal immigrants wash post mar 28 2002 at a13rather than accommodated the irca by recognizing employer misconduct but discounting the misconduct of illegal alien employees17 dissent the dissenting justices concluded that the nlrbs limited backpay order did not interfere with the implementation of immigration policy18 the dissent maintained that the general purpose of the ircas employment prohibition is to diminish the attractive force of employment which pulls illegal immigrants towards the united states19 by restricting the availability of backpay to an undocumented alien the court was actually increasing the force of employment the dissent reasoned that because the cost of initial labor law violations involving undocumented aliens was low an employers incentive to find and hire such individuals increased the dissent observed in the absence of the backpay weapon employers could conclude that they can violate the labor laws at least once with impunity20 the dissent also suggested that the court improperly substituted its own independent view of the matter for that of the nlrb because the nlrbs position appeared to be reasonable one the dissent maintained that the court was required to respect and uphold it21 legislation legislation that would allow undocumented aliens to receive backpay awards could be forthcoming following the courts decision senator edward m kennedy is reported to have expressed an interest in pursuing legislation to undue the holding22
