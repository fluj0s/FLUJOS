review of study lecture given on 22 september 1964 thank you all right i like you too thank you very much and this is the what of what audience 22nd of september twentysecond of september ad 14 saint hill special briefing course is that correct audience right all right todays lecture is review lecture on the subject of studya very rapid review lectureand it doesnt mean that if you hear this lecture why none of the other lectures need be listened to or something like that because this lecture doesnt necessarily contain all that they contain but i want to give you fast review of this subject called study ive been meaning to write textbook about it and i will do so in the very near future but the textbook for this is not the type of text that you just dash off because if i do good job of writing this textbook on this material we now have here you recognize that it goes into an area where there is textbook or data or technology of any kind which is studyhow to study now you can look in vain up and down the corridors of the libraries at big universities and so forth for book which simply tells the student how to study i know that sounds sounds fantastic but thats all they teach basically and foremost in whole course on education but they havent got any book on it that says how to study not even in theirthan their major courses of education do they have this textbook but here are all these poor blokes sitting around in university being told at every hand that they dont know how to study but there is textbook on the subject now what do you suppose is going to happen with textbook like that if that justtextbook just sits down very calmly and goes about the business of what study and education are all about and how to study and how to approach this subject and what the bear traps are in it and what to avoid and what good textbook is and what bad textbook is and all this sort of thing and if it just took this thing up chapter by chapter and shook it all out very nicely with fancy terms and said incidentally as it went along that this was data derived from the subject called scientology where do you think that book would land probably land in the hands of every student who enters university anyplace courses of education would have to be pulled down and thrown away because they havent got course of education one of the things wrong with education of children in the united states right now is theres nobody has any technology of education its something on the order of trying to fix radios when you have instruction book of any kind and you dont even know what it is and trying to fix radio in that state of mind would be rather exasperating situation since you wouldnt even know what the radio was supposed to do if you did fix it to show you that the technology is out in schools and universities series of tests were given to children over number of grades in school this happened in johannesburg accidentally and itchildren in one grade and in the next grade and the next grade and the next grade in various groups were given graphs and it was very apparent that the longer they went to school the dumber they got now i couldnt figure out why that was except i could figure out there must be something unknown about all this if this could happen and nobody was doing anything about it and sure enough that wasthat was the data that emerged from it in other words the longer they went to school the stupider they got well whats this about education is supposed to make bright people well there was obvious stuff there that it wasnt true here was the grade for the eightyearolds and they got certain iq and certain graph and here was the grade for the nineyearolds and they got certain iq and graph and the grade for the tenyearolds and certain iq and graph and the elevenyearolds they had certain iq and graph and after these things were already graphed out and the factor was added that some of them didnt know as much language as another and that sort of thing it made terribly steep curve their iq was going downhill the highest iq that we have ever registered on any student was on schoolboy in johannesburg who was twelve years old it was not on oppenheimer or einstein see it was twelveyearold kidhighest iq ever registered well thats an optimum age he knows enough language so that he can read the test and he doesnt know so much language that he cant understand it so this showed clearly that there was something amiss in the field of education if the longer you studied something the more stupid you got well of course the longer you study something we know now the more chance and opportunity you have to run into words you dont know and there we go now in the field of the arts it is peculiarwell its just the longer you study the more chance you have of running into words that you arent acquainted with and cant get defined so in the fields of the artssince it is just misunderstood words which bring about this conditionin the field of arts particularlyand this is field with which im very very well acquaintedthe working workaday artist the boy whos out there making his coffee and cakes with the drawn line or the airbrush or the paintbrush or something of the sort you know and whether hes selling it to mr and mrs gotbucks or whether hes selling it to the local studio or hes making sidewalk exhibit someplace or another thats immaterial the point is this boy is in the workaday world with the writer similarly with theoh heavenspoets evenyou could even include various of the fine arts architecture and that sort of thing all of these boys have certain peculiarities which i never quite understood peculiarities were these when you reviewed tremendous number of writers who were pros and who were good and who were landing on the mark every time you found nobody who had graduated from course in writing but nobody i mean this isntthis isnt even the exception that makes the rule he just wasnt present i remember sitting up in riverside drive at one timesitting in big swanky apartmentriverside drive new yorkand the whole place the whole salon of this apartment was jampacked with some of the best stellar names in the field of american fiction there they wereall of them practically and scattered in amongst them were some of their agents you know sort of keeping to the background and trying to look like the radiator or something and this subject came up not just the subject of writing but the subject of education in general and census was taken on the spot and noses were counted on the thing and nobody there had ever finished the university amongst those writersmuch less writing they had never finished the university they had all been kicked outalmost uniformly had been expelledor theyd never gone near the place and that was it and then checkover demonstrated clearly and conclusively that not one of them had ever taken course in writing from anyplace from anybody about anything well this was also quite startling too and its not something that you would write in writers magazine about because it would be very unpopular with the magazine because of its advertisers and their fond ideas they have and their advertisers who sell courses in story writing and that sort of thing so it isnt the kind of thing you have written up and i was about ready to dismiss the whole subject you know and say well thats it because i had been sitting there keeping the notes for two or three other eager beavers who had been taking this over and i was saying well i guess weve just about got that taped or something like this you know and everybody was laughing about it and all of sudden here was very faint voice over in the corner that said well your figures are not quite correct what you know whawhawhat who was that and well ii have pphd in literature and aa couple of other degrees and finishedfinifinished the university and several other universities and ive taken lot of courses in writing andand so forth so its not true of everybody in the room and everybody turned around looking at this guy trying to find out who it was and of course it was literary agent he wasnt writer hed never published line in his life all he did was sit around and tell other people what was wrong with their stories but he had tried to be writer and hed failed so about this point i said theres something very peculiar going on here theres bunch of swindlers selling courses in writing that dont teach people how to write wont name any names because you dont have to its every blig brassy university in the united states whats going on here well could have been lot of things could have been lot of things going on but in the years following i ran the subject down i got that interested in it that i ran it down bit further and i found out that writing course teaches writing they dont teach writing im not sure what they teach but none of the technology which they employ and say is writers technology is the writers technology you get the point see they say there is this piece of technology but it isnt that piece of technology you see writers dont use this technology period if any of you have ever taken writing course im sure you heard about foreshadowing and im sure youve heard about other writing gimmicks of one kind or another and writers dont use them and when they do use them they dont call them that do you see here there is technology then which writers use but it is not taught in universities and its not taught in courses in writing i remember with horrible start one time getting up to make talk to short story group and i was about ready to draw long breath and say well ladies and gentlemen how are you this evening is there anything i can tell you about so i was justand right in front of the desk lying there was one of my stories wideopen which they had been using as text and every paragraph of it had some weird symbol or word written opposite it to show what i was doing at each one of these points why i would have wrapped myself around four telegraph poles if id ever tried to think of all that at the same time this area was foreshadow and this was characterization and this was this and that was that you see and it was tzsatzsatzsa and it was all supposed to have been laid out it just stopped cold see and i found myself looking at piece of technology which i never used and this was the pretense you see and here were these poor blokes trying to study writing you see well now there is subject called writing there is such subject the trouble is writers are professional liars and when they start telling people how they write they just go on and create the most weird dissertation i ever read in my life i think is by edgar allen poe on the subject and its used in every textbook i think in short story writing i have ever collided with and i think its poe writing about how you write why i think its the most marvelous piece of stuff you ever read in your life if you want to read thati did one time just for kicks and you dont find anything in his stories that agree with what he said they either want to be the only ones and cut down the competition or do something but they never really say what they do so technology isexists in this particular area but there are lot of pretended technologies in this area im just talking to you about field which is offbeat which i happen to know well and which is noncodified field which is one of the arts and theres that field completely uncodified only when it starts to descend into technical application like the graphic arts the graphic arts are just cut down from the arts you see theyre the mechanical representation of the arts theyre how do you take painting and how do you handle this painting in order to reproduce it in magazine its not creative art in other words its graphic art now that technologyboy boy you start doing something little bit haywire with that one or you start doing something little bit offbeat in the way you take your separation negativesyou know the red negative the green negative and the yellow negative that youve got to take of this thing in order to get three printing plates to run through the presses you know so that each one superimposed on the other one andooooooh boy youve got to have the patch of gray that can match from each negative its got to be on every negative and its got to be at least quarterofaninch square and its got to match exactly on densitometer boy theres technology there man wow theres technology theres exactly what is the factors involved in this theres the various types of ink theres the various types of pigments theres various color charts theres various systems which are employed theres all types of reproduction equipment on the subject of fine lines and dots andoh my my my my my wow theres terrific terrific technologythe technology of the printer the technology ofwell you take retouching bears about the same resemblance into photography theres somebody who can take picture and he can take various type of ink or sauce or something and he can take this photograph and he can alter the features of the person in it he can do this he can do that terrific technology involved applied art but very applied big technology well how come you have to know this when right next door to it the thing its cousin to which is the original writer doesnt have any codified technology has actually false technology and the second that this thing that is written or the thing that is painted moves over into reproduction moves into the high channels of communication moves over into that field at all drops into one of the most complex and exacting of technologies it gives one to wonder how these things are even cousins heres this whole area of writing there is technology everybody prits worse than that everybody pretends theres technology that if you just studied it real hard why you too could starve to death in garret see soand right next door to it heres this other well it bears some kind of resemblance betweeni mentioned retouching you take any photograph that is portrait of anyone i dont care where or who or how or why the number of times you get perfect negative that you can print and make copy of you know and frame it or enlarge it or do something with it and enlarge it and give it to somebody so theyll say how nice izzybelle looks these days you have to retouch it and all your big studios retouch sometimes they overretouch sometimes they practically take out all the features in their excess of enthusiasm to make somebody look good but any picture youve ever had taken in studio which was ever framed and enlarged and presented to you as presentation piece it had to be retouched well this retoucher is not the photographer they bear the same resemblance as the duke and steward see the photographers definitely the duke you know hes the boy who goes through all the stuff that gets the picture and so forth and nobody much pays much attention to the retoucher the retoucher is rather heavily paid but he sits there quietly drawing his heavy pay you see with his very exacting work well the number of tricks you can do in retouching are absolutely almost unlimited you can do one of the wildest things with retouching you take this negative you know and you take fellow who or girlgirl doesnt like to be plump you knowand you can take this thing and you can thin her down man and this fellow doesnt like to look so old well you cant take too many lines out because his character disappears but you can take few lines out if youre very goodand boy you can take about fifteen years off his age you see thud and he thinks that pictures beautiful because hesof course the people who are buying these pictures are the people who are having them taken and naturally they only buy something that flatters them so the whole world of photography isin portraitureis bent in the direction of making somebody look betternot more dramatic but betterand because people dont like dramatic photographs really they like pretty ones i read dissertation of why they dont let the public judge an art exhibit the other day its because the only paintings or the only photographs or anything else exhibited would have to do with cute little kittens falling out of baskets or wearing babies clothes or little children with jam all over their faces and those would be the only pictures that would ever get winning award and they have another penchant if its not sharpthe public at large has an index by which they judge photographif its not sharp why its good well think if you took an expert picture of mist very misty morning of course its not sharp but its beautiful picture and the public would turn it down so judging has been taken completely out of the public hands for these particular reasons you see but portraiture is never taken out of the public hands see so its got to be retouched within an inch of its life everybodys really got to look prettied up you know tsk its wild some of those pictures dont any more look like the people theyre taking picture of you know than the man in the moon well what about this whats this relationship how come well actually the retoucher steps in when the photographer fails you can do everything the retoucher does with your camera and the lights you can do the whole lot with the camera and the lights but when the photographer falls down the retoucher picks it up well they have various thingsnot to give you whole bunch of nomenclature dont pay much attention to this nomenclature its just its just words theyve got things like barn doorsvery expressive beautiful word they put them on the sides of spotlight andso the spotlight wont shine into the lens or so that you can flap them over and keep the light from hitting somebody in certain portions and then they have things called headscreens which stand up here on biglike square cardboardand that restrains the light from hitting somebodys ear see you can tip the edge of this board in so that this persons ear is not well lighted you see his ears are too big let us say see well you can take that shadow and throw it just exactly across his ear see and his ear looks smaller any part you want to emphasize you put light on the formula is the parts you dont want to emphasize why you just let it drift away and the parts you want to practically take out of the picture well you just hold the light off of them and there they go and because photography of course photo lightgraphy writingits just writing with light and when youve written well with light you get perfectly retouched picture you can turn people in certain ways that make them much thinner you can make their noses longer and you can make their forehead shallower and their chins stop jutting and so forth of course you can just easily make strongjawed person into weakchinned person and so forth you can do all kinds of wild things but when the photographer doesnt do his job why then somebodys got to step in and straighten it all out and theres where the technology builds up and the technology builds up in the area of correction so i think youll find in the fieldthis is broad statement and might be subject to great deal of modificationin any heavy heavy technical subject but if very very very technical i think the technology is built up around an area of correction its dissatisfaction with something and the correction of that dissatisfaction do you follow this now all right the photographer doesnt do his job he doesnt put the head screen over right so this guys ears look like pair of donkeys ears see well all right nobodys going to buy that picture so when the thing is all finished and so forth welli mean its been developed rather not completely finishedand its in its proof sheets and so forth they dont even show him the proofs they wont even show the customer the proofs retoucher takes ahold of that thing and he cuts those ears down and he subdues those ears and he makes that look better and they reproof it then they show it to the customer and the customers very happy with it correction correction now you can say when it isnt done right in the first place its got to be corrected and where it is going to be corrected great deal of technology will arise you follow this audience mmhm yes all right if it was done right now then there would have been further technology but where its done right you would then have something moving along the line very smoothly and very easy to get along with indeed if it was being done right if you had the technology of how to do it in the first place in other words everything would move smoothly from that point there on but let us say theres bunch of technology missing at this point or it is not known or its not practiced now were going to get very heavy complicated technology arising just on the other side of this thing which were going to call lowerscale subject and it will simply be totally corrective of the upperscale subject where youever you have tremendously heavy technology then that is all of corrective basis in other words it was based on correction there had to be something corrected at this point it wasnt running right in the first place now lets get on this subject of bodies lets take it aa finite line all right the photographer didnt do his job well and so therefore we had to pass it over into the hands of the retoucher and the retoucher had to go all over this negative and take out pieces of it and do this and that before he printed it and so forth well lets not stop there lets move over just little bit further and how about building these bodies well somebody didnt build them right if people are that dissatisfied with them theres something going wrong over there and im merely pointing this out to youtheres technology known there theres geneticists theres all kinds of eat wheaties theres various types of false technologies but they franklytheres second dynamic freudianism and so forth but they really have nothing to do with making bodies i dont know what the second dynamic has to do with making bodies its just because they get connected and they are inevitable in sequence but they do not necessarily proceed from one two see now whats all this and were into totally unknown body of knowledge arent we and theres lot of false superstition and other things connected with it so theres some bird down in vienna in 1894 could say the whole trouble with the human race is they have technology of building bodies or theyve got it all in backwards or something like this you know theres something wrong see freud he builds up then psychoanalysis which has proven very popular it isnt effective its popular see it depended upon the communication cycle of the analyst whether it was good or bad not on freuds theory surprise if you had good analyst that knew how to communicate with the patient and so forth why somebody would get better accidental thoughthey never studied the technology of communication they didnt know anything about that and they thought they were dealing with the second dynamic and they werent funny you can read over freuds records and you find out every time the guy got off an overt he recovered and you know freud never noticed it you know thats so remarkable it will be buried somewhere in the notes because its not emphasized and then hesyoure given the wrong reason for the recovery and that makes it very hard to relocate what was going on in this particular thing and were not riding hobbyhorse trying to apply scientology to it its one of the woits one of the places we got the overt and there seemed to be one present in every recovery disclosed overt and recovery they seem to go hand in glove so further study of this particular zone and area brought about resurgence of technology in that particular field and the importance of this thing was able to take place all right but lookahere lookahere here is the only thing im leading up to rather circuitously but to give it to youmore thud to show you theres some background to it with the idea of you understanding it little bit better do you realize that all of education as it is practiced today is complicated corrective technology its corrective technology it isnt education at all see theres effort to relay an idea from point to point b or mind to mind b see theres an effort however to keep the fellow from or to keep him at it in some way or to do this or to do that in other words the educational system is built around the fact that education has already failed so you have this fantastic technology and some poor bloke could go to school for many many years learning how to be teacher and all he would ever learn is how to correct the corrections now it isnt that that data is unis useless let tell you when an engine has gone into the ditch its very good thing to know how to operate wrecking train to get it back on the rails againvery complicated technology but its very good thing to know but this doesnt make all of railroading lifting trains back on rails that have gone into ditch because railroading done right has the train on the rails all the time its only when railroading doesnt go right well so how about education where the students are committing suicide all over the place the way they do in france and so forth i donti dont know what this has to do witheducations somehow or another linked up with something or other and survival or something and they got it all in backwards and crosswise and the poor students over there in france come up for an examination you just start reading the roll call pierre you know oh hes dead and so forth he took cyanide last night he couldnt confront it any longer and they have heavy heavy suicide rate because apparently in france if you dont get through this particular type of examination or something like this they execute you anyway i think youre executed socially or something and france hasnt any colonies anymore to ship anybody off to so you just have to stay home in total disgrace or something corrective well look at the amount of force and duress which must have been on this student terrific force terrific discipline heavy to what well to keep him at it and make him study his examinations well i dont know i never had any trouble getting anybody to study something they were interested in so i think that if this much duress can exist in field to drive students to suicideand very often in england and the united states they go off their rockers and so forthif theres this much duress to get them to learn then i would say it must be some kind of corrective technology that moves over into this field so hard only becauseit moves over into this fieldonly because the students missed it all in the first place now what kind of duress do you think it would take to get johnny to learn what b was when hed already missed what was now youre getting accustomed to this in handling it with definitions and that sort of thing and im talking to rather informed group here supposing supposing somebody came up to take his examination to you and you were checking him off and so forth and you stuck in on the second paragraph you couldnt get past second paragraph he couldnt seem to remember anything in the second paragraph or so forth well your technology now says that you should go back up and look just little bit earlier to find the word he didnt understand and sure enough youll find one just before he went blank in other wordsjust before he went blank there was word he didnt understand when we trace this back we find this word we get this word defined and straightened out all of sudden magically he understands that paragraph well now supposing we didnt straighten out the word and supposing we told him that he was going to be expelled if he didnt learn the paragraph now supposing we compound this with about tensomewhere between ten and fifty thousand instances and texts and we did this every time i would say wed have an adequate explanation of why the child at nine was dumber than the child at eight the child at ten was more stupid than the child of nine the child of eleven was more stupid see in other words this amount of duress became necessary because nobody would ever have understood anything they wouldnt have been educated at all and perhaps better than nothingperhaps i dont think so myself but you could add it up this way and if every time this fellow hit rough spot on the road you simply applied the lead boot or the pincers or the brass basket full of rats or some other interesting medieval torture and said now if you dont get that next paragraph youre going to have had it bud now what dowhat do you think he would finally wind up well hed be inhed be in an interesting state wouldnt he hed be far removed from any idea of what he was doing hed be far removed from the subject and he would be treating the subject as something entirely different than the subject certainly heyou know well hed say well theres this thing called physics and im just trying to fix these weights here and of course that physics it doesnt have anything to do with these couple of weights im trying to fix on the counter here itd wind up in nonapplication thered be ahed have to shortcircuit hed have to get all that duress out of his perimeter hed have to get all this stuff out of his circle of understanding hed have to move it all over here someplace and just squash it and suppress it and say well the devil with it ill have to make up my own mind about this or ill have to try to walk my own way through all this dont you see you would leave him on total onlyone basis with regard to his subject matter and his information and instead of helping him you would have taken away all the information that could have helped him so i would say modern education was making it impossible for person to utilize his training well this then should indicate to you that decline of iq could be expected to follow misunderstood word that sounds absolutely wild but the longer you went past that and the more you had to know that the stupider you could be expected to get do you see of course we have all the corrections for this and so forth weve got clay table and clearing and definitions and all that sort of thing now so were talking from point of view of considerable savvy but im just trying to show you what the world must look like here you got engineers out here putting up skyscrapers man imafter ive learned this about education and so forth i hope they were put up by the foreman who was never near the college because otherwise id expect them to fall down on head i would i dont think id trust one very good ive noticed peculiarity in this particular field to get unreal or kind of revengeful toward the subject or to do weird things or to slough off when they got near their trained area now here is another datum how does the state suffer in various terms from miseducation how does the state suffer from miseducation well theres country you might not have heard of it called russia and it went by the boards number of years ago and it imported german philosophy called communism and it had ball and it nevertheless is trying to go forward and make something out of itself and so forth it probably would have gone forward as fast as the western world if it hadnt adopted squirrel offbeat philosophy the western world has advanced exactly the same distance and further during the same period of time see they were not mechanized either back in 1917 they were pretty bum if you dont believe it one of these museums go into one of these motor museums and so forth look at 1917 modelstuff well thats modern russian car i dont mean to be catty they did copy jeep they got lot of jeeps in there during the war and they copied them but theyre pretty corny and what theyre trying to do over there in russia is spread civilization out into very very very backward asian world russia is basically asian its not western and i will say that with all their handicapspolitical and otherwisethey are making some progress of one kind or another and theyve got an awful lot of virgin territory to spread all of this into theyve got the whole of siberia to spread stuff into it see and theyre really in state of sort of pioneer country and people have said well theyre really entering their victorian age and i imagine that they are theyre way behind theyre almost century back of anybody else oh just because great britain sells them some machinery and they change the labels on it and export it to japan as russian field tools or something is reason why theyre good in this department theyre not these boys are up against tremendous frontier and they have the frontier of ignorance and the frontier of this and that theyve got vast wilderness they have millions and millions of uneducated backward people to try to do something with you see their problems are fantastic theyre trying to solve them with education and heres the outcome of their solutions with education of course you can imagine russian commissar operating over russian student this would be pretty grim and the figures are these that onthejob training of great number of students who were trained at the full expense of the government and the industry which was training them to take future key posts in there left it one hundred percent at the end of their onthejob training period which was two or three year period one hundred percent took further activity in that plant or that line of work in another plant and an areathis is one specific plantanother plant two out of several thousand did stay with the plant and these are not just selected figures these are the broad coverage estimates for the whole of russia these are young people who have been educated under communist duress and have been moved out into plant to be given onthejob training to take over future posts in that plant and at the end of that time because things are milder over there now they had some power of choice as to what they did now and they all left that was the exercise of power of choice now if you know educationand you know our technology of education nowyou will see at once exactly what must have happened way back here in kindergarten or someplace the communist love of the reevaluation of words caught him the favorite trick of the communist is not to change anybodys vocabulary but to make it mean something else they change the meaning of words so therefore everything sounds familiar the next thing you know person finds that the word means something else entirely different ill give you in lump example of this orwells 1984 wonderful changes of semantics the change of meanings of words which went through 1984 freedom is slavery you know well even roosevelt was at it we had freedom for long time everybody knew what freedom meant roosevelt he made it freedom from you had to be freedom from something that was whatthe freedom we were now fighting for we were fighting for freedoms from well thats an interesting way of looking at it freedom from well that means you must be fighting it so you couldnt possibly be free of it freedom means freedom it doesnt mean standing up against something and pushing it away from you or worrying about will it catch up to you again or something like this or working day and night so that it wont happen to you thats not freedom so heres change of semantics now the russian of course had this entire asian population this huge mass of people 200 millionone of the bigger populations of earth in one country all divided up into different lingual groups and different customs and so forthand he moved in on them and then he had to change everything in order to get it all lined up and get them to work together at all and he had to reevaluate all their words so that in 1964 we find hes lost his revolution how did he lose his revolution well he trains several thousand young people to take over the pujas river project and theyre going to be the executives and the big shots on the project and theyre gothey too are going to be able to drive around in model t fords and at the end of the onthejob training they all leave the pujas river project that means hes going to run out of people to run things material which weve got right now in scientology oddly enough was of great interest to the old man stalin himself because he smelled that it might exist in the studies which i was doing and wasi was in contact with amtorg in 1938 and the whole line ofis how do you evaluate the relative ability of person to work how can you find out which person will produce more than which person and i was engaged in study of that at that time and had some rather revelatory information regarding it i was extremely pleased with this information and it got noised about the explorers club the next thing you know i was backing up at mile minute trying to keep my foot off that boat of going to russia and talk to stalin about it he had problems he had worries in 1938plenty of worries he was looking for help from anyplace but where was his missing technology the missing technology was how do you get people to understand something and how do you get people to do things those were his areas of comprehension how do you get people to understand things how do you get people to do things well he thought he had solved how do you get people to do things you set up enough machine guns in front of enough walls and give them enough examples they will work only you cant keep itkeep at it forever that way thatll play out sooner or later now when you start working that along an educational line you run out of educated people fast they just get stupider and stupider and stupider and stupider so that i think that the way the leisure class and the upper class was wiped out in england and suborned was not through any political revolution i just think they educated them to death i think actually they got too stupid to hold their position something to think about huh i mean as class they were just educated to death everybody had to go to college of course what did this leave this left bunch of commoners around who didnt have to go to college so it didnt matter about birth or anything else it left these boys who were on the outside smarter than the guys who were on the inside so the guys who were on the inside lost i mean it doesnt take much to understand that that must have been what happened so we can make further point we can make further point here we could say then that the continuation of culture is entirely dependent upon possessing technology of study russia is going to lose hers we have an example of the upper class of england having gone through oxford into oblivion we have examples ofall around usof changing face of earth and so forth and that hinges basically on people the future of the human race hinges oddly enough on people and if you dont make people who are good people youre going to have trouble and in the field of study if you dont have any technology of study then the poor little bloke who goes into kindergarten and who starts running into incomprehensibles and who then is threatened with being flunked or shot or whatever they do to children in kindergarten if they dont get their blocks piled up in the right pile moves on into the first grade and here he is shown word which is cat and he says its tac and everybody looks sad the teacher paces up and down writes notes to the parents the father goes into decline holds his head in his hands for half an hour you see this is the standard accepted procedure you see what is going to come of you you know that is the question which is left burning in the middle of the air you see you will never succeed in life and all that sort of thing why do they have to put this much duress on well its because they dont know how to teach the kid to read cat instead of tac so you get this terrific cultural pressure you get bunch of cultural technology on how do you keep kid in line then you hire whole police force all over the nation to try to sit on him when he becomes teenager and then you have real ball now you get the mods and rockers and so forth and your this and that well of course these people by now have been taught thoroughly that theyre part of anything and thats the way they act they act as though theyre part of anything they dont own anything and thats it its quite interesting to watch some young boy and so forth whos been catapulted out into the responsibility of the care of family or something like that at ten or eleven twelve years of age its very interesting to find today you canin spite of child labor lawsoccasionally find such specimen and he bears more resemblance to the modern teenager and he wont because hes already had to wrap his hands around this thing called life you see and carry on somehow and he hasnt had timeall the time necessary to sit in school and be made stupid and hes liable to become quite success in life or something weird like this is liable to happen to him unlooked for theyre trying to bring in law and order while operating in the schools to create illegal activities and disorder theyre operating in schools to create it and the last person in the world that would stand up and take any responsibility for it is miss princenez there at thepublic local number 18 well we just try our best you can see her now you know we just try our best christ why dont they hang sign across the door and say juvenile delinquent factory well all right so once more we have this experience in dianetics and scientology in this line of work once more we have this experience of colliding with zone or area of the society in which theres pretended technology where actually there is none its not only thatits absence itstheres pretended technology sitting in its place now i dont think however youre going to have too much collision with it i dont think theres going to be too much upset but i could foresee theres going to be some upset about it anything we write on this subject is sooner or later going to be challenged in some quarter or another but this isnt codified field that is returning great deal of money teaching is not really vested interest because it doesnt make enough money and thats about the only reason why medicine however is vested interest and drugs are vested interest because somebody is making money out of it the multibilliondollar drug empire and healing empire and so forth will be defended to the last stethoscope see those guys will be standing around thereyoull stilli mean twenty thirty years from now therell still be some bloke down here trying to cause trouble you know he says rowrrowrrowr and you say well you dont understand some word in healing yeah i understand all the words in healing well you dont understand some word in dianetics and scien oh yeah i understand all the words in dianetics what the hells the matter with you im broke well now the teacher doesnt make any money and the school contractor doesnt care whats built in those buildings that hes contracted to build and the state doesnt really like to shell out this much money because kids dont vote its not an area where you can buy many votes you can buy thembuy the votes of their parents somewhat but people really never connect the school to the administration theyre always somewhat disconnected so you have active vested interest there to go up against and i believe the whole area can just be gobbled up because nobody has ever seen it as profitable area were not looking at it as profitable area but they wont defend it because they dont see it in profitable area if medicine were lot less profitable today we would have trouble taking over the field of healing its just the selfinterest in the thing which keeps the opposition raving i dont say that bitterly i mean thats just completely considered statement there isnt such an area in the field of education so therefore i think proper textbook which just goes down the line ratatattat and doesnt find any fault with anybody and doesnt shoot anybody down in flames you know but just goes right down the line and takes up the whole subject from the word scat and carries it on throughwhy its pretty hard to get over the chapter of how you can reduce iq in person because somebody would take that as accusative but i imagine that that can benot glossed over because its piece of the technology thatll have to be presented but itd be presented gently enough so that it wont have people fighting that point and the next thing you know why youll be in another business but its not in another business that youve ever been absent from your part of the business is making people brighter you see processing people clearing people that sort of thing well that fits hand in glove with this particular type of activity then you have scientologists to teach so you need the technology and that was the only reason the technology was developed in the first placejust to make it easier to teach more scientologiststhat was why it was developed but its going to go further than that you watch it now if we dont take some responsibility for how far itll go were liable to be in more trouble than if we just released it and forgot about it therefore im not releasing any small book on the subject i have to release definite text and i think you will find out that gradually as this starts to roll that it will be necessary for you in your area to make it possible for teachers on saturday and sunday or something of that sort to drop around and have some lectures on this subject and i think that youll find that it sort of will tend to stand separate and distinct from anything else which youre doing and you will say rather faintly well you know we can raise peoples iq oh yes yes now what did you say about and some educational question will come up you see and you say well you see you can process somebody in order to theyll say well yes but now in teaching child do you and youll say what the hell which way is this cat jumping well i think youll eventually see which way the cat jumps and the way the cat jumps is the fact that they want to know all about education and you better let them walk all the way through education before you start showing them that they actually have entered the field of philosophy and i dont think theyll route any other way because in education what youre actually studying is the difference between level 0 and level 1 and what sits there is this band called education and thats whats been established here isthats of importance to us intimately and immediately all these other ramifications all these other complexities of education are not terribly important to us so the society of russia will not be able to perpetuate itself im afraid that would cause to yawn almost wide enough to dislocate jaw so it wont be able to perpetuate itself in history too bad oh thats terrible the various other political regimes and so forth wont be with it im afraid i justthat the state of mind im in with regard to these blokes im afraid that i wouldnt even pick up shadow for them if they dropped it theyre just not important but people are important and their systems are not important now when their systems are built on lies those systems must therefore be destructive and the whole educational system as i see it of total duress of total squash on the individual in view of the fact that its system thats full of lies i think its about the most destructive thing you could have around at all i think it would be very rough to have to live with this kind of thing its definitely incorrectwrong but youre going to find yourself in this business and the only real point im trying to make to you here is dont then considerbecause you cant talk to them about processing when theyre busy studying studydont then consider that you have moved them over into some other field recognize that youre moving them up through the top of zero into the bottom of one recognize that this is necessary step these people are not bright enough at this particular time to even sit down and wonder how come theyve got this technology you know theyve put it on some other basis entirely so you come in and talk to group of them and you say well study is soandso and soandso and soandsoand the iq of your child could be increased by study not decreased and you could have brighter child or something like this or your school could run with less upset or to group of police juvenile delinquency is caused by miseducation proper education would reduce juvenile delinquency this will all sound to them like good roads and good weather and theyll be very happy to cooperate upon this particular line and so forth and you dont have to say anything else and they wont really ever wonder now how the devil does this person know all this yeah where is this information from whats this all about unless of course theyre totally arc broke and then thats out the other end but it never really occurs to them to ask intelligently ah what part of the information and so forth it says throughout this textbook that this is part of body of information called scientology but then it just says scientology and everybody knows what scientology is its study of science of course naturally truth and that sort of thing and its so on and so on and so on and see they wouldnt even think about it and why wouldnt they think about it i want you to get so you can see this one little point they cant think about anything see youre wondering why fellow with blinders on cant see see what you havent recognized about this individual is the most fundamental thing about this individual and that is he cant see at all so you ask yourself why cant joe and pete see this and this and this you see youre asking yourself too complex question see youre asking yourself why cant joe and bill see that soandso soandso soandso and why do they always argue and so forth and so forth well you yourself are just being too complex with your question your question is based on the fact that you havent recognized that they cant see do you follow this youre trying to stretch it out into why cant they see something see well your basic thing is is just why cant they see at all well they cant see at all because theyve never beentheyve been trained into stupidity and youre talking to blind men thats all well how do you talk to blind man well you talk to him damn carefully you get smart about it you know this guys blind so younaturally hes sitting there he cant see at all and youre trying to talk to him about the rose garden which you can see right outside the window well you sayyou wouldnt say to him well you silly ass why dont you look outside the window and look at the rose garden well you wouldnt say that to fellow who couldnt see at all see you wouldnt youd say well over there to your youd have to think it over you see youd have to say well over there to your right there are certain number of windows you possibly can feel cold draft coming in on you occasionally well thats windows over there and theres light which makes things visible and show up so that you can see things back of things like you hold your two hands together you see like this well the light would fall on the first hand but wouldnt fall on the second hand so youd see the second hand you seeyoud see the first hand but you wouldnt see the second hand because theres light on the second hand now you can hold those up and you can feel it that way and you gradually infiltrate it into his experience dont you see and youd have to sit there and figure for while on how am i going to give this guy some dope so that he can get some idea of theres flower garden outside the window see and you gradually build it up and youd say well outside the window theres lot of space you know the last time you went out of the room why you walked for quite ways before you got into another door well that was all space and thats the outdoors and youve noticed sometimes that youve gotten rained on and so forth while you were in under some spaces but not into other spaces see you know and you take it up like this now theres big wide space outside the windows and then youd probably recognize good god the next thing im going to have to explain to blind man is the aesthetics of color ooh well lets see how can i do this see well all right be brave lets do this lets attempt it you get the idea and you eventually find yourselfand the guy would be sitting there saying yeah you know yeah yeah yeah well i now know what flower garden is see something like that you really would have communicated something because you recognized in the first place you were talking to blind man but when you fail to communicate you do so for one big awful reason you dont recognize that youre talking to blind man and when you start talking to people about scientology you are actually talking to them above the strata where you should be talking to them to somebody says well on this new pe course how do we get in arc well you dont arc is too high thats very advanced data youve got to undercut this youve got to give them the idea of datum and youve got to give them the idea of the comprehension of datum and youve got to give them the idea that there are data in existence youve got to give them the idea that they can learn something sounds incredible but this is your leg up this is your edge in then you can give them the idea that there is knowledge because 99 percent of the people youre talking to have had the experience of the technology taught did not operate most of them do not expect anything to happen even if they know the technology so theyre not able to give that extra little push that makes it work when you run into these failures its because of this see its that little extra thing they dont expectwhat im trying to tell you is they dont expect anything to work because nothing ever has so they reallydont really know what knowledge is knowledge is some sort of fakery that people think is see if you gave them the task of describing what is knowledge youre liable to run into something like that well these people dont know theres anything to know look at the arrogance of the medical profession they dont think theres anything to know about the subject of the mind or the spirit or healing they brush all this off theywow you know the arrogance of these fellows theyre not producing any results yet they think theyve got it all wrapped up well where do you suppose that comes from but latin imagine starting somebody to handle the human mind by getting them to go over into the next county for some word of dead language that has resemblance whatsoever to anything he has any experience with and say thats where you begin on the human body and then you wonder why in the final analysis this guy is so eager to carve up human bodies and choke people off well he wouldnt ever do anything else dont you see youve said this is the tibia and youve looked for where the tibia is its this word in the book tibia actually education is getting worse and worse in desperation recently great britain has taken fantastic turn in the field of education about which youre not reading any articles and with which youreprobably arent getting much data youve probably heard something of this but ive just been getting it hot and heavy over the lines because i was working out to find out where quentin could go to school and what he had to do to figure out some various things so of course typically i just got in touch with everybody on this subject and got the gen down lot of interesting data is pouring in on the lines the british college does not expect within four years to teach any degree course which goes consecutively to school they want nothing to do with it they consider this is total failure and they want nothing more to do with it and they tell you consistently you want to know what the expectancy of enrollment is in 1968 i wish we knew but one thing one or several have said that we can tell you for sure is the courses which are now available to enroll in will longer be enrolled in sandwich training is what theyre using today in all technical fields they say the artswho cares any of these old deadlanguage subjects and so forth and dead degrees and so forth who cares about those but we have found out that our engineers cant build bridges and were jolly well doing something about it and were upset in the field of education and were just tearing it to pieces so all the big companies and the governments and the local councils and everybody else who can put his shoulder to the wheel is knocking out anything that has resembled engineering education in the past here in great britain they are just knocking it in the head left and right they found the school room was place to make any engineer and the future of this culture depends completely upon the quality of their engineers they have recognized that entirely so theyre just reforming the whole thing and by 1968 it wont even look the same theyll go six months to school and theyll work for six months thats whats going to happen to the student and hes going to go six months to school and hes going to work for six months and he jolly well damned better be working in the subject hes studying or he cant enroll in it whole new face has been given to the field of education well that is corrective measure which is recognition of the fact that educational methods have failed but its corrective measure in the right direction and we may even have had something to do with it because remember weve been teaching anwe used to teach an awful lot of teachers up in london and it was our idea of the familiarity of things and so forth we may have more to do with the evolution of the culture than we believe perhaps we could overestimate it but i think we commonly underestimate it i see lot of things happening i noticed the other day something or other happening it was straight out of our textbooks oh yes theres somebody drew up the profiles of home and heath and whatever its name ismr george somethinganyway drew him up and printed our personality analysis in the guardian and plotted these boys on our personality analysis somewhat alterised but they never took one of these things down and gave it to somebodytypically the psychologist at worknever gave it to poor home or heath or wilson or any of the boys see but went around and asked some students what they thought of these fellows and put that down as the results and then advertised this as the actual graph of these people i think its very interesting its only something that they would do in the field of psychology you understand what i mean they just asked some people their opinions of whether these fellows were you know this or that or up and down you see and then they put down whatever anybody said and then released to the public that this was the personality of these blokes i thought it was fascinating but nevertheless that was our graph sitting there staring us in the face weve already infiltrated this field to the degree that theyre already out the backdoor and playing in the yard and dont even realize that were sitting in the parlor twiddling our thumbs thats about the way the situation is as far as command and knowledge and technology is concerned but we are at verywere very unreal group to these people and were unreal because any further knowledge is unreal to them dont you see they recognize instinctively that there is knowledge somewhere and when we talk to them they recognize that we are talking that way but its all on sort of an unconscious basis and then they dont really connect this up and theyre sort of hunted about the whole thing and we make them nervous but frankly our command value over such person is rather fantastic its almost an hypnotic command value which is sort of interesting they recognize that youre talking the truth but they are not quite able to add you up to it so the words which youre saying as you speak to them are engramic almost as you speak them its all very interesting scientology could be in this state and simply put the whole society into some kind of an obedience basis without even trying but that isnt what were trying to do the way that you would follow this throughyoud have to get somebody into state where he could learn this is the way youd bring somebody into scientology see youd get him into state where he could learn and youd show him there was something to be studied and then you would show him that there was body of information about study and then you would show him that there was body of information to study and its about in thosein that sequence that you would make big win and you have never really tried to approach it from this particular angle your normal approach to the individual is we can help you we can make you smarter we can do this for you we can do that for you we can make you well we have tried to talk to him and so forth and were talking to somebody who cant learn all right if this individual cant learn why then of course he cant learn even the words were saying to him so hes in nonreceipt it isnt that were even talking dully or uncleverly hes simply not receiving see if he cant learn in general why he couldnt receive youreven your sentence so your approach isnt failing it just isnt reaching big difference between those two points so all you have to do is move the person up to where it reaches see you take your first step first you pull him up to where itd reach him well so hed be very happy to learn that there was ways of studying hed be very happy to learn this hed be very happy to learn there was ways of broadening his information about the world about things but right away of course you recognize youre dealing with present time problem he has lot of things that he is having problems with that if he could learn more about he would be able to handle his problems so you must be at that point colliding with present time problem on the part of the person youre talking to do you see that his basic present time problems have to do with not knowing see if he could just learn more about women he wouldnt have so much trouble with his wife i mean lets get it down to that simple an index see but of course it never occurs to him that theres any way to go about learning that he isnt going about so if he were just to know that there is some way you could learn more about women or learn more about anything or if there was some way of approaching this field of gathering data or becoming more learned on certain subjects and so forth why boy hed be on your side right now because he would be applying them to his present time problems not on direct processing basis but on just direct indoctrination basis you say well theres something you can do about your life there is some hope for it why well you can find out more about it is that so see not that you become clever or anything else but you can just find out more about whats going on around you oh i can isnt that interesting hey how do you do that well theres techniques various techniques of learning more about things that are quite surprising quite surprising and so forth and one of them is to observe is that so well you get how fundamental this gets you observe you think you have to be clever to teach somebody something like this just be obvious observe now youyou say you want to know more about your wife all right now theres good example all right now has it ever occurred to you to observe your wife all right now ill tell you what you do your first lesson in learning something about study is to just learn how to observe just learn how to look at something justthats it all right how do you look at something well leave him wallow in it man how do you look at something hell you look at it thats the answer and thats the answer hed finally come up with but how does he look at something well he looks at it see and that would be his problem for the day you see hed think there were trick ways of looking at things do you look at them through various colored glasses you know do you look at them crosseyed do you use eyeballs all kinds of things see let him solve that one how do youhow do you observe something well let him draw up systems of observation if he wants to know more and have less trouble with his wife well hed better learn how to observe his wife now that would be primary method then of handling his personal affairs and his personal life that would be right there or right down the middle of main street hed learn all kinds of things that just never occurred to him before hes taken it for granted that observation is going on dont you see youve taken it for granted you say two people are living together they both look at each other the only time wife ever looks at him is when he comes home with smear of lipstick she can see lipstick she puts it on her mouth all the time in fact she put that lipstick on him that morning when he left for work but shes forgotten that so now she has grounds for divorce he came home with lipstick on his face all day long nobody happened to tell him he had some lipstick on his face see but she can observelipstick on his face end product you talk about observation in any very big cityin any big city you can pull some of the wildest tricks to demonstrate nonobservation you ever cared to have anything to do with the wildest things go unobserved in large cities you wouldnt believe it i myself used to make gag out of this i used to make very amusing gag out of this it paid off in many ways why i used to tell some girlif i were ever walking down broadway in the vicinity of 42nd street you could always count on to tell the girl i was walking with you see do you know that new yorkers never see anything oh oh yes you can do almost anything i mean fellow could drop dead out here somebody could pull gun out of his pocket and shoot somebody dead and the passerbys wouldnt even pause in their stride youd have to actually actively block the pavement if there was fight in progress they would only stop if the pavement got blocked so they couldnt go by and then theyd stop and eventually watch the fight you can excite curiosity by blocking the pavement and looking up but you have to block the pavement before you look up and then they will also look up but its very very funny but they never see anything they dont pay any attention to you and if you dont actively block the pavement why they never notice oh i dont believe you you see you get some girl from the corn belt or something like this do you know that i could stand right here on the corner of 42nd and broadway and kiss you and there isnt one single person would even glance in your direction i dont believe it all right ill show you yeah never failed never failed wonderful technique yeah therell be fee if any of you young fellows try that anyway the score is that you take suchtake such very unexciting words as observation or inspection or familiarity you see the very unexciting words you can actually build them up into mountains they become very very startling indeed and when youre teaching somebody about this what you want to do is take the obvious and expand it dont go going overboard to give them allwell were sitting in the drivers seat now weve got the technology of education do you see its contained in these lectures and so forth there hasnt been very much to add to it either it appears to be quite complete now youre going to say well am i supposed to teach somebody education huh oh brother youre not supposed to teach anybody your technology of education lets teach them the introductory aspect of education which is what how do you learn about things well you could sit down and ask yourself that well how do you learn about things well you learn about things by looking at them by feeling them by hearing about them by reading books about them by seeing what they relate to you could lay all this down very easily but of course you get out of it such things as feel and observe and so forth now if thats the breakdown that you make on your very very introductory and elementary approach to learning you see if thats the breakdown which you make realize that all of these things can be applied to all of the problems which any person at level 0 or level i has you could give all kinds of gratuitous information about all kinds of gratuitous things which are being brought up with regard to this lets look at that so it isnt for you then to say well lets see im going to teach this fellow about scientology well theres such thing as arc thats affinity reality and communication and they form triangle and so forth and so on where am i at whatwhats going on see well he doesnt know theres any knowledge in existence anyplace that he doesnt know thats one of the first things he doesnt know he thinks everything in the world has already been found out he doesnt know that the society is in anyway deficient look at the way somebody out in the street will complain about past life or complain about something or other you can take some bird whos howling like mad about the fact that theres such things as implants and start to say well say this word give him an item in helatrobus line plot and the meter goes bluu and he goes bluu and give him the next item say that word bluu bluu well if theres such thing as an implant wheres all that coming from meters dont run for the fun of it see but to teach him something like this so what you in scientology are up against is actually not the meanness of the society or the cussedness of the society nor the unwillingness of the society to be helped or any of those things what youreyoure not even up against the ignorance of the society youre actually up against the incorrect study technology of the society which prohibits them from learning what youre talking about and prohibits them from learning that there is more to know technology that stultifies the intellect that freezes the individual into noncomprehension of anything which puts him into woodenheadedness the like of which nobody ought to be put into in other words youre talking to stultified even ossified individual who has been carefully and systematicallybut accidentally and unintentionallydestroyed since the first day he set his foot on his mothers knee and said mama whats cat and then she said dont bother now lets see cats are dont bother nows hes the product of an educational system which has threatened to shoot him against the social brick wall with all the social machine guns if he doesnt get in every subject and graduate out of the top of his class where he didnt even understand what the word school meant everything has militatedeverything has operated against this individual ever becoming brighter or more educated and now you expect to come forth with great body of knowledge that this individual would welcome with open arms well in the first place hes been shot down in flames on the subject of study to begin with and this would just mean more study to him furthermore you couldnt possibly exist because all study materials are bad because you get shot if you dont know them or something weird like this will be going on in his head in other words the communication line is jammed whats the communication line jammed on the communication line is jammed on study so this is study in dissemination and do you see that the study itself is an excellent dissemination tool and would work like shot and im sure that you will find yourself if you start to use this being pulled in faster than you know and i will only give you one little caution with regard to it is dont get too studious about study in your address to the subject just pick the very obvious points of study and make them very studious points because it doesnt matter how studious you get about the obvious person can still see it do you see so that you sayyousome person he wants to get things built up into some tremendous tower of complexity on this subject well you just let him build it up on the subject of observation until it likes to reach the sky he isnt going to get anyplace but observation is he hes going to get in the final analysis the fact that you observe by observing this is what final conclusion he will have to reach matter how many systems he develops in order to do the observation he will eventually reach that point he cant help but learn things and learn things about learning if he observes things so youve got any broad fabulously simple point of this character which if you put across and got it across you would all of sudden get tremendous agreement with and youd get that little hey what do you know you know whatsyeah yeah if i observed my wifeah yes what is she doing how does she look when im talking to her why i have to check up on that and by the very familiarity of reach and withdraw by observation of his wife hed have less trouble with her hed become more familiar with her hed understand her better youre talking to people who have withdrawn totally from life study of course is one of the best methods in the world of bringing them out of it thank you
