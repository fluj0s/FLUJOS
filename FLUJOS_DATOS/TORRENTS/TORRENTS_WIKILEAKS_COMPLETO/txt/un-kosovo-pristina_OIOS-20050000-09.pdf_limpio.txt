procedures relating to the following contract have been examined 3 v investigation details 10 this case concerns allegations of corruption by staff at pristina airport arising from handling and landing fees levied on passenger aircraft using the airport in the period january december 2001 the case also d eals with allegations of corruption arising from deicing costs levied on pa ssenger aircraft using the airport during the same period and alleged requests for corrupt payments for the allocation of landing slots to airlines at the most convenient times 11 samples were taken from total of 21 airlines using the airport at pristina in 2001 the year 2001 was selected due to the fact th at fees appear to have been collected and receipts issued manually therefore it was assessed that greater risk of fraudulent activity existed 12 where possible similar dates and the type of ircraft were selected to allow for comparative analysis of landing charges and passeng er charges 13 an average price was then calculated for each t ype of aircraft by selecting sample of landings for each airline and multiplied by the number of flights to give an estimate of the total income from landing fees 14 the itf obtained price list dated 1 january 2002 which provides an indication as to the respective costs for basic airport servic based on the weight of the aircraft handling fees and deicing costs 15 the total income from landing fees in 2001 was estimated at dm 14357949 equivalent to 7341163 this compares with fig ure of 7376182 in the profit and loss accounts produced by the chartered account ants 16 this result suggests that in the absence of fur ther information the aircraft charges agreed with the figures produced in the off icial accounts of the airport however the integrity of the information on which the accounts are based cannot be verified the possibility therefore remains that airlines were routinely overcharged 17 it was noted that there are small variations in the prices charged to different airlines for the same type of aircraft however ce rtain airlines appeared to have measurably lower costs these were airline 1 average dm 2190 airline 2 average dm 2888 18 the receipts books do not indicate whether airl ine 1 carried passengers and if so how many 19 it was notable that where aircraft requested icing facilities this appears to have added considerably to the landing fees costs 20 schedule was created detailing costs associat ed with deicing with the possible exception of one airline 3 flight this do not appear to indicate any 4 obvious anomalies although it again did not take i nto account the possibility that airlines were uniformly being overcharged for deic ing landing fees 21 passenger taxes appear to be charged at 25 dm p er passenger spreadsheet was created detailing the total number of persons t ravelling in the period 1 february 2001 until 31 december 2001 together with the number of persons not paying passenger tax the file did not contain any data for the month of january 2001 22 the spreadsheet produced by the itf indicated total of 375472 passengers during the relevant period of whom 18996 did not pay the required passenger tax if this number is multiplied by 25 dm and conv erted to euro per paying passenger this gives total of 4799395 as agai nst stated income figure in the accounts of 4919190 for the whole year this gap is diminished if number of passengers were to be added for the month of jan uary 2001 23 however there remains possibility that the p assengers were not being charged airport tax when they should have been or that the sums detailed in the accounts do not equate with sums actually paid 24 in an effort to verify whether or not airlines were being routinely overcharged for handling and landing fees or deicing costs the it f sent request to iata to provide information from airline 3 airline 4 airl ine 5 and airline 6 concerning any instances of overcharging or extortion of money by staff at pristina airport the request also sought information concerning any inst ances of corruption arising from the allocation of landing slots at pristina ai rport 25 regrettably to date substantive response h as been received from the airlines or iata vi conclusions 26 whilst the figures for handling and landing fee s broadly agree with the figures produced in the accounts of the airport it is not possible to ascertain whether the source of information forming the basis of the acco unts is reliable 27 in the absence of cooperation from the airlines and iata despite repeated requests by the itf it is not possible to progress the case further vii recommendations 28 it is therefore recommended that based on the r esults of this investigation unmik should prepare an official request to the abo vementioned airlines in an effort to obtain their support and any information relevant to this matter iv0428301
