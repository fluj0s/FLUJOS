greater confidence in th threat information being conveyed to the nation universally understandable c onsistent and relia ble national threat notification system is deemed necessary in todays world of increasing and time sensitive threats to the nation many believe that the notif ication of threat to the united states should be conveyed by single entity and the message should be consistent with other communications fede ral government officials may offer in times of crisis or national emergency the federal governments unity of message and coordinated delivery of the threat notification are widely seen as crucial to the effectiveness of the system designed to convey the message the systems color coded warnings have become the primary means by which the federal government communicates directly to the public its bottomline judgment on the risk of terrorist attack at any given time1 however the circumstances and explanations surrounding the warnings and changes in the homeland security advisory systems hsas color code to date have called into question the utility and credibility of the system in particular at times it appears the colorcode has been raised based on speculation that terrorist attack may occur rather than receipt of new threat information at other times warnings of heightened threats have been issuedwithout changing the hsas and on numerous occasions agencies have provided different andsometimes contradictory informa tion about threats to the homelandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32897crs2 2 the decision whether to publicly announce threat

uniontribune september 4 2002 though the homeland security act of 2002 is fairly clear regarding the transition of responsibility of administering national threat notification system from the attorney general to the secretary of homeland security there reportedly have been few occasions in the past couple of years that s ecretary ridge was frustrated when attorney general ashcroft announced terrorist threat information despite the fact that the homeland security act of 2002 transferred the responsibility of management of the hsas from doj to dhs also at times dhs has disagreed with the alarming tone of as hcrofts announcements4 this paper will discuss examples of uncoordinated na tional threat announcements between dhs doj and other federal government entities it is possible that recent ch anges of departmental and agency leadership may assist in resolving future occurrences of uncoordinated and premature threat announcements however the issue remains that previous threat announcements and arguably lack of di scernible processes in determining from whom threat information is to be conveyed has seriously eroded the hsass credibility generating congressional review and

announced on september 11 2002 that the us intelligence community has received in formation based on th debriefing of senior qaeda operative of possible terrorist attacks timed to coincide with the anniversary of the september 11 attacks on the united states however oneweek prior to the official notice put forth by the attorney general office of homeland security chief tom ridge reportedly st ated that us officials do not have intelligence indicating terrorists are plotting another attack on the september 11th anniversary we do not anticipate raising the threat level for that day5 though it is common in the world of intelligence to receive informati on that contradicts previous analysis possibly explaining movi ng from an elevated yellow to high threat orange environment in oneweeks time the concern is that prior to the first use of the hsas two senior members of the administration spoke publicly to the status of the threat environment in this case the director of the office of

the national alert status would remain unchanged although the previous two examples did not represent official public announcements the effect was the same in that both of these events were widely

against us interests to defend muslims and the iraqi people on the eve of the war in iraq secretary ridge informed the public that the terrorist threat level was being raised not because of any new thr eatening intelligence but because the war seemed likely to provoke rrorist response in the us11 prior to the war in iraq numerous administration officials including some at the cia and fbi and

threat advisory level defense secretary rumsfeld later noted that the nation must remain vigilant and alert to the possibility qaeda or those sympathetic to their cause as well as former iraqi regime state agents may attempt to c onduct attacks against the united states13 this change of alert level status was accompanied by continuing pattern of independent official announ cements regarding

the fifth time since its creati on the secretary of defense stated that theres question that there are any number of terrorist acts that were stopped prior to their actually occurring20 also six days after this hsas threat level was lowered the fbi director stated that he did not foresee time when the country could drop its guard and that we probably will at some point in time have another attack21 there were two public discussions in 2004 of threat information of significant nature that produced some anxiety among us citizens and frustration on the part of the congress neither of the following in stances resulted in change of the hsas on march 24 2004 the fbi issued threat advisory indicating that the texas oil industry may have been targeted by terrorists while dhs is statutorily responsible for public adviso ries relating to the announcement of homeland security threats specifically as they pertain to alerting infrastructure owners and operators of threat related information the advisory came solely from the fbi as house committee for homeland security chairman christopher cox stated twoweeks after this occurrence clearly this is very troubling development was it simply

and the election why the threat level had not been raise d attorney general ashcroft responded that the homeland security c ouncil led by secretary ridge would make such decision and for to try to speak for th em at this time woul d be inappropriate24 after mr ashcrofts announcement mr ridge seemed surprised by the attorney generals warning asked why the national colorcode alert had not been raised mr ridge replied there is nothing speci fic enough to raise the alert level this seemingly uncoordinated effort was followed by response from representative christopher cox chairm an of the house select committee on homeland security dissemination by our government of sensitive terrorism warnings must be closely coordinated across our intelligence and law enforcement communities cox said in the homeland security act dhs was assigned the central coordinating role in this process the absence of secretary ridge from yesterdays news conference held by the ttorney general and the fbi director and the conflicting public messages their separate public appearances delivered to the nation suggests that the broad and close interagency consultation we expect and which the law requires did not take place in this case 25 these last two examples are cited by many observers as suggesting general lack of coordination and unity in message of warnings to the nation of threats and also reflecting lack of overall colla boration between dhs and other federal intelligence community and law enforcement organizations homeland security employees have complained that their cia and fbi colleagues show them little respect intelligence agents reportedly count er saying that dhs has been known to go public with terror alerts based on info rmation that other agencies found to be sketchy26 this latter contention does not seem to be supported by the pattern of administration officials other than the dhs secretary openly discussing threats to the nation

showing that qaeda had been surveilling financial targets in 2000 and 2001 however she also added that the most recent intelligence included mention of threats to the us capital and members of congress this prompted washington dc capitol police chief to re mark that the briefings he had received on the recent intelligence did not speak to sp ecific credible dir ect threats against congress as an institution or its members 27 secretary ridge did not mention the capital or congress in his statement nnouncing the increase in the threat level however one month later secretary ridge

uncoordinated warning efforts lack of uniformity in the type of information conveyed and an increasingly wary populace as to the credibility of the message cong ress could choose to eliminate the system the natural question that follows is what would the replacement system be and would it be an improvement on the current system one could argue that given the uniqueness of each threat situation

geogra phic location target location timing of perceived attack defensive measures nd the like should be addressed individually and not formulated to fit into neat category of threatlevels this might
