years from the date of its submission to the states by the congress this article shall take effect on the 180th day after the date of its ratification6 analysis purpose proponents of the amendment have articulated five r easons for passage of the amendment constitutional amendment will balance the scales of justice constitutional amendment will fix the patchwork of victims rights laws constitutional amendment will restore rights that existed when the constitution was written constitutional amendment is necessary because state law is insufficient and constitutional amendment is nece ssary because federal statutory law is insufficient 149 congrec s824 daily ed jan 7 2003 the need for greater balance the scales of justice are imbalanced the us constitution mainly through amendments grants those accused of crime many constitutional rights such as speedy trial jury trial counsel the right against selfincrimination the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures the right to subpoena witnesses the right to confront witnesses and the right to due process under law the constitution however guarantees rights to crime victims for example victims have right to be presen t right to be informed of hearingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31750crs4 7 see also 149 congrec s83 remarks of sen feinsteindaily ed jan 7 2003 currently while criminal defendants have most two dozen separate constitutional rights fifteen of them provided by amendments to the us constitution there is not single word in the constitution about crime victims these rights trump the statutory and state constitutional rights of crime victims because the us constitution is the supreme law of the land to level the playing field crime victim s need rights in the us constitution in the event of conflict between victims and defendants rights the court will be able to balance those rights and determine which party has the most compelling argument 8 snyder v massachusetts 291 us 97 122 1934 9 house hearing v at 12 statement of rep chabotcurrently the us constitution is completely silent on victims rights while it sp eaks volumes as to the rights of the accused thus the us constitution essentially serves as trump card for those accused of committing crimes in order to keep victims fro m participating in their prosecution or even just sitting in the courtroom during trial 149 congrec s82 daily ed jan 7 2003remarks of sen kylstatutory and state constitutional provisions are always subservient to the federal constitution so in cases of conflict the defendants rights which are already in the us constitution will always prevail our amendment will correct this imbalance see also the victims bill of rights are victims all dressed up with place to go 8 s t johns journal of legal commentary 251 276 1992 young constitutional amendment for victims of crime victims perspective 34 wayne law review 51 6465 1987no right to be heard at sentencing or at parole hearing right to insist on reasonable conditions of release to prot ect the victim right to restitution right to challenge unending delays in th disposition of their case and right to be told if they might be in danger from release or escape of their attacker this lack of rights for crime victims has caused many victims and their families to suffer twice once at the hands of the criminal and again at the hands of the justice system that fails to protect them the crime victims rights amendment would bring balance to the judicial system by giving victims of violent crime the rights to be informed present and h eard at critical stages throughout their ordeal 149 congrec s82 remarks of sen kyldaily ed jan 7 20037 the balance argument is hardly new close to three quarters of century ago the supreme court observed that the law as we have seen is sedulous in maintaining for defendant charged with crime whatever forms of procedure are of the essence of an opportunity to defend but justice though due to the accused is due to the accuser also the concept of fairness must not be strained till it is narrowed to filament we ar to keep the balance true8 the due process clauses and other fendants rights components of the constitution supplied the foundation for the defendantfocused jurisprudence of the 1950s and 1960s it has also served as one of the early catalysts for the victims rights movement call for greater constitutional protection of victims rights seems predictable feature of the belief that th criminal justice syst em must involve greater balance between the rights of victim and those of the defendant9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31750crs5 10 senate hearing iv at 65 statement of ms arwen bi rdas survivors of crime who are also united states citizens we benefit from th

of balance often makes little sense in the context of criminal proceeding it assumes that we can identify the victim at the outset of every ca but this may not be possible in some casesas where the defendant claims that she acted in selfdefenseidentifying the victim is what the trial is all about see also srept 106254 at 63 minority views of sens leahy kennedy kohl and feingold 12 logic might suggest that the victim also suffers when the guilty escape unpunished because an innocent individual has been accused instead but this view is rarely heard 13 senate hearing iv at 13435statement of mr ro ger pilonpronents of this amendment often speak of constitutional imbal ance between the rights of defendants and the rights of victims the constitution lists numerous rights of defendants they say but is silent regarding victims there is fundament reason for that imbalance it has to do with the very purpose and structure of the constitution the federal government had only those powers that the people through the constitution had delegated to it as enumerated in the document and the exercise of that power was further restrained by t he rights of the individual enumerated and unenum erated alike such benefits as the constitution does confer in the criminal law context arise entirely because the government is the moving party in an adversarial matter the benefits or rights of due process or trial by jury for example arise only because the government has placed the accused in an adversarial relationship at which time such ri ghts kick in to limit the means government may employ the situation is entirely different with crime victims they stand in adversarial relationship with the government such that the means available to the government must be restrained for their protection see also srept 108191 at 70 minority views the balance argument stakes the fundamental reason for elevating rights to the constitutional level the rights enshrined in the united states constitution are designed to protect politically weak and insular minorities against governmental overreaching or abuse not to protect individuals from each other when the government unleashes its prosecutorial power against an ac cused the accused faces the specter of losing continuedsome might suggest that victims already enjoy equal constitutional rights with the accused10 the victim who repels an unlawful assault with excessive force may find himself criminally charged in that case he is entitled to exactly the same constitutional rights as his attacker11 moreover many of the constitutional ri ghts afforded the accused benefit the victim as well they are designed to ensure that the guilty are convicted and that the innocent are not the accused benef its when the innocent are not c onvicted the victim benefits when the guilty are12 the more common response to the bala nce argument however has been that the balance argument represents fundame ntal misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of individual constitutional rights13 in the same vein one of the motiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31750crs6 13 continued his liberty property or even his life the few and limited rights of the accused in the constitution are there precisely because it will often be unpopular to enforce them so that even when we are afraid of rising tide of crime we will be protected against our own impulse to take shortcuts that could sacrifice fair trial of the accused and increase the risk of wrongful conviction in contrast there is need to grant constitutional protections to class of citizens that commands virtually universal sympathy and substantial political power in the words of bruce fein cri victims have difficulty in making their voices heard in the corridors of power they do not need protection from the majoritarian political process in contrast to criminal defendants whose popularity characteristically ranks with of general william tecumseh sherman in

critics respond that victims rights am endment would esse ntially federalize the state criminal justice process denying the people of particular state and their elected officials the right to decide the range of victim righ ts and services that should be part of their state criminal justice systems16 uniformity obviously requires compliance to single standard imposed by an amendment to the united states constitu tion some victims advocates however see the amendment as providing c onstitutional minimum beyond which congress and the states would remain free to establish more exacting victims rights hence the reference to uniform national floor17 skeptics may find that this does not eliminate the patchwork it simply changes it18 restoration of victims historic rights it is little known fact that at the time the constitution was drafted it was standard practice for victimsnot public prosecutorsto prosecute criminal cases because victims were parties to most criminal cases they enjoyed the basic rights to notice to be present nd be heard hence it is not surprising that the constitution does not mention victims now of course it is extremely rare for victim to undertake criminal prosecution thus victims have none of the basic procedural rights they used to enjoy victims should receive some of the modest notice and participation rights they enjoyed at the time that

speak of outlawry of the bloodfeud of the tariffs of wer and bot and wite of punishment in life and limb the evidence which comes to us from england and elsewhere invites us to think of time when law was weak and its weakness was displayed by ready recourse to outlawry it could not measur its blows he who defied it was outside its sphere he was outlaw he who breaks the law has gone to war with the community the community goes to war with him it is th right and duty of every man to pursue him to ravage his land to burn his house to hunt him down like wild beast and slay him for wild beast he is not merely is he friendless man he is wolf without actively going to war with the ffender the law may leave him unprotected against those who have suffered by his misdeed it may concede to them the right to revenge themselves the slaughter of member of one by member of another kin has been the sign for bloodfeud the injured kin would avenge its wrong not merely on the person of the slayer but on his belongings it would have life or lives for life for all lives were not of equal value six ceorls must perish to balance the death of one thegn outlawry and bloodfeud alike have been retiring

the crime victim in the prosecutorial process 9 h arvard journal of law and public policy 357 371 1986whatever its derivation the american system of public prosecution was fairly well established by the time of the american revolution this meant that loca l district attorneys were given virtual monopoly over the power to prosecute crim victims were longer allowed to manage and control the prosecution of their crimes rather the victim was to serve as piece of evidence to be used by the state to obtain conviction 22 the most commonly cited examples of pr ivate prosecutions involve dicta in appellate decisions and few stat utory provisions which allowed indi viduals to hire private attorneys to assist public officials in public prosecution under some circumstances eg mcdonald towards

his views yet there has been suggestion that the practice gave the victim an enforceable right to be present or to be heard other than through his or her attorney inadequacy of state law alternatives these state victims rights measures have helped protect crime victims but they are inadequate for two reasons first each amendment is different and not all states have provided protection to victims

rights to victims rights or s ubordinate victims to fendants rights it may subordinate either both or neither to prosecutorial discretion it may require any conflicting law or constitutional precept state or fede ral to yield even in the absence of conflict it may preempt the field sweeping away all laws ordinances precedents and decisions compatible and incompatible alike on any matter touching upon the same subject whether it does so or to what extent it does so is matter of interpretation that is what is its intent what does it say what is its purpose what does its history tell us the questions are most perplexing when an apparent conflict exists between state and federal law or among the rights and prerogatives of victims defendants and prosecutors the interpretative principles of preemption triggered by an apparent conflict between state and federal law are fairly well developed preemption of state law may occur either by expre ss provision by implication or by conflict between federal and state law and yet despite the variety of these opportunities for federal preeminence the court has never assumed lightly that congress has derogated state regulation but instead has addressed claims of preemption with the starting presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law indeed in cases where federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation the court has worked on the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest

phrase that one phrase is the continuedclause where the subject matter is one which the constitution relegates to the federal domain the vitality of state law is depende nt upon the largess of

allows congress to permit few advocates have explicitly called for kingofthehill victims rights amendmen t but the thought seems imbedded in the complaint that existing law lacks uniformity how else can universal symmetry be accomplished but by implementation of sing standard that fills in where pre existing law comes up short and shaves off where its generosity exceeds the standard yet the recent history of the amendment and proposals indicate that advocates intended to establish minimum rather than uniform standard32 questions of the amendments impact on the rights afforded the accused

earlier this would seem disqualify neither of the participants in mutual assault nor inmates victimized during their incarceration the courts may also consider the wo rd victim li mited by the insistence in section 3 that only the victim or the victims lawful representative may claim the amendments benefits the concept of representative is rather clearly stated in singular terms as one who speaks in the interest of the victim rather than in his own interest65 parents and other relatives of deceased or child victim might not themselves be considered victims simply by virtue of the relationship and and as discussed below perhaps only one of them could be selected as the victims representative66 the amendment uses the word crime rather than the less inclusive word favored in many of the earlier proposals nd often in existing fe deral law felony thus it seems the amendment protects the rights of victims of violent crimes other than felonies eg misdemeanors67 of course crimes which are indisputably nonviolent clearly cannot provide the f oundati on for claim of right under the amendment result which some may find unsatisfactory in some cases68 looking elsewhere in federal law for guid ance the courts might observe that the term victim has been assi gned definitions which vary according to the context in which they are used although the existing federal victims rights

violence phrase the issue of how the courts will construe the terms victim and violent crime becomes less problematic if they can be defined legislatively witness at the house hearings in the 107th congress and again in the 108th congress suggested that the amendment comes with an implicit unders tanding that both congress and state legislatures have complete latitude to define both victim and violent crime as long as they do not violate the amendment it should be noted that states and the federal government within their respective jurisdictions retain authority to define in the first instance conduct that is criminal the power to define victim is simply corollary of the power to define the elements of criminal offenses and for state crimes the power would remain with the state legislatures it is intended that both the word victim and the phrase victims lawful representative will be the subject of stat utory definition by the state legislatures and the congress within their respectiv jurisdictions single rule will govern these definitions as single rule governs what conduct must be criminal in the absence of statutory definition the courts would be free to look to the elements of an offense to determine who the victim is and to use its power to appoint appropriate lawful representatives senate hearing iv at 181 200 house hearing iv at 19 29 statement of steven t

provisi on the federal government and the states will retain their power to implement th amendment for example the states will subject to supreme court review flesh out the contours of the amendment by providing definitions of victims of crime and crimes of violence srept 106254 at 41 does this mean that either congress or the states are free to negate the amendment by definition may they define victims of violent crimes to include only those victims entitled to victims rights under state law and only to the extent that state law permits may they define victims of violent crimes so narrowly as to extinguish victims rights under the amendmen t asserts th senate judiciary committee report on the 108th congress amendment c ongress and the states are free to expand the amendments coverage to embrace victims of nonviolent crimes but the committee intends the term vic tim of violent crime to be understood broadly and to be so in terpreted by the courts the amendment extends broadly to all victims of violent crime the phrase violent crime should be considered in th context of an amendment extending rights to crime victims not in other possible narro wer contexts the most analogous federal definition is federal rule of criminal procedure 32f which extends right of allocution to victims of crime of violence and defines the phrase as one that involved the use or attempted use of physical force against the person or property of another emphasis added the co mmittee anticipates that the phrase violent crime will be defined in these terms of involving violence not narrower elements of the offense approach employed in other settings see eg 18 usc 16 only this broad construction will serve to protect fully the interests of all those affected by criminal violence of course not all crimes will be violent crimes covered by the amendment for example the amendment does not confer rights on victims of larceny fraud and other similar offenses at the same time many states have already extended rights to victims of such offenses and the amendment in way restricts such rights in other words the amendment sets national floor for the protecting of victims rights not any sort of ceiling srept 108191 at 31 32 the committees reference to crimes of physical force against the property of another as qualifying viole nt crimes seems to support the argument that victim covered by the amendment includes an yone whose property interest might unlawfully be made the subject of the use of physical force ie victims may include not only individuals but any legal entity capable of holding an interest in property this reference and other remarks indi cate the committee understands the term crime of violence to describe crime violent or pot entially violent in either its nature or its circumstances72 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31750crs26 72 continued be considered crimes of violence for purpose of the amendment if identifiable victims exist similarly some crimes are so inherently thr eatening of physical violence that they could be violent crime for purposes of the amendmen t burglary for example is frequently understood to be crime of crime of violence because of the potential for armed or other dangerous confrontation similarly sexual offens against child such as child molestation can be violent crimes because of the fear of the potential for force which is inherent in the disparate status of the perpetrator and vic tim and also because evidence of severe and persistent emotional trauma in its victims gi ves testament to the molestation being unwanted and coercive some crimes such as drug or espionage offenses do not ordinarily have such an identifiable victim and therefore woul d not ordinarily be covered by the amendment however in some unusual cases court might conclude that these offense in fact involved violence against an identifiable victim fo r example treason or espionage against the united states resulting death or injury to an american government official would produce an identifiable victim protected by the amendment srept 108191 at 312 internal citations omitted 73 srept 108191 at 78 minority viewsargui ng that based on the amendments history its requirements would presumably apply to military courts martial and to military commissions conducted under federal authority in the united states rights in what system the amendment makes little mention of the systems it reaches it clearly applies to both federal and state criminal justice systems the rights of victims of violent crime are hereby established and shall not be denied by any state or the united states the elimination of the provision found in earlier proposals that address its coverage elsewh ere might be construed as an indication that the amendment on its face is inapplicable to juvenile proceedings to proceedings before military tri bunals or to criminal proceedings in rritorial or tribal courts on the other hand the omission may be seen as the elimination of redundancy since each of the systems functions ultimately under the authority of either state or the united states73 notice notice in the world of victims rights takes three forms

would create an affirmative duty on the government to provide notice of what ri ghts the constitution provides turning this formulation on its head i fear that this provision might generate body of law which will make fourth amendment jurisprudence simple by comparison finally congress will be empowered by section 3 of the proposed amendment to enforce its provisions presumably including the

notice of the release or escape of the accused fifth there is longer any declaration that victim is entitled to notification of hi s or her rights under the amendment the amendments grant of rights is

has always been some question whether courts and legislative bodies might by closing otherwise public proceedings curtail victims notification nd other rights that would otherwise be beyond judicial or legislative reach the hi story of past proposals indicates that this may be the case victims rights under this provision ar also limited to public proceedings some proceedings such as grand jury investigations are not open to the public and accordingly would not be open to the victim other proceedings while generally open may be closed in some circumstances for example while plea proceedings are generally open to the public court might decide to close proceeding in which an organized crime underling would plead guilty and agree to testify against his bosses see 28 c fr 509 another example

filed criminal charges although other proceedings might also be related to the crime senate report at 3031 court interpreting the current bill might conclude that the change from rela ting to to involving was intended to make it easier to apply the amendment to proceeding s outside the criminal context see also senate hearing iv at 122 house hearing iv at 50involving the crime the breadth of the phrase involving the crime used to described the public proceedings covered by the notification ri ght may raise questions too the phrase clearly contemplates more than trial pretrial and posttrial hearings involving motions to dismiss to suppress evidence to change venue to grant new trial and any of the host of similar proceedings that flow to or from criminal trial seem to come within the meaning of the term the senate reports discussion of proceedings related to the crime in earlier versions for instance specifically mention appellate proceedings srept 106254 at 31 srept105409 at 26 the same reports indicate th at at least at one time covered release proceedings were understood to include those involving release from custody of defendant found not guilty of crime by reason of insa nity and then hospitalized in custody for further treatment id at 36 and 30 crime relatedne ss understood in such terms would presumably carry victim notice rights to fairly wide range of civil and quasi civil proceedings eg habeas and civil forfeiture proceedings deportation and extradition hearings and administrative disciplinary reviews if conducted publicly before tribunal to name but few it may be for this reason that the phr ase was changed to involving the crime phrase that arguably imposes greater limits on the class of proceedings than might be considered related although not clearly sufficient to excuse notice of the habeas forfeiture deportation or the extradition proceedings84 historical proposals were thought to perhaps embody notice rights for the victims of defe ndants past crimes and victims of charges that have been dropped or dismissed as well as victims ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31750crs31 85 frequently criminal defendants are susp ected to have committed crimes for which they are never charged or for which charges are later dropped even though significant evidence may exist that the defendant did indeed commit the crime do the victims of these crimes have rights under the proposed amendment if so are they the same as the rights of the victims of charged counts or of the defendant such victims of course would have the same

which triggers notification requirement must be one relating to the crime this includes not only release after criminal conviction but also for example release of defendant found not guilty of crime by reason of insanity and then hospitalized in custody for further treatment or release pursuant to habitual sex offender statute as discussed below this statement seems totally at odds with the use

might be thought to have embraced earlier descriptions of pro ceedings related to the crime even though the committees examples in the 108th congress are much more modest in some places id the right applies not only to initial hearings on case but also rehearings hearing at an appellate level and any cas on subsequent remand86 reasonable and timely notice the addition of timely unquestionably seems significant because it would appear to greatly reduce the prospect of reasonable but ineffective notice yet the committee report issued after the change makes note of it and continues to describe the obligation in the same terms used prior to the change87 under past proposals it was unclear whether reasonablen ess was to be judged by the level of official effort or by the effectiveness of the effort the senate reports noted and continue to note that heroic efforts were not expected but due diligence was srept 108191 at 34 srept 106254 at 30 srept 105409 at 25 yet the

custodial authorities93 would publication notice be considered reasonable in such cases would the existence of an online or other automated system available to the general public and containing release and escape dates retrievable by prisone r name without more cons titute reasonable notice application may be particularly challenging in the area of bail the amendment grants both right to consideration of the victims safety and right to reasonable notice and attendance under normal circ umstances it might not be unusual for an accused to be released on recognizance or bail before authoritie s could reasonably be expected to provide victims with timely notice it may be that the amendment contemplates postponement of the accuseds initial judicial appearance until after victims can be notified and can be given reasonable period of time to prepare and present their views at one time amendm ent proposals seem to explicitly anticipate that failure of timely notice in bail cont ext could be rectified by recourse to the provision in the amendment that permitted the bail decision to be revisited at the behest of victim94 the amendment longer cont ains that explicit provision

victims deserve the eight basic rights of the amendment they should be informed about those rights not only does this serve to ensure th at victims can exercise their rights but it can even improve the functioning fo the criminal justice process victims who have been informed about their role in the process ar in better position to cooperate with police prosecutors and courts to bring about proper resolution of the case victims deserve appropriate notice of their rights in the process srept 106254 at 26 96 i have significant concerns about the necessity and wisdom of providing that continuednothing in the amendment precludes revis itation other than abandonment of the earlier explicit provision perhaps release or escape of the accused for the first time the amendment refers to notice of the release or escape of the accused the implication is that there is right to notice of release or escape following conviction since at that point the defendant is convicted rather than accused if this is the amendments meaning the consequences of the change are considerable the administrative burdens associated with notifying victims every time an inmate is released from custody are not insignificant particularly in those jurisdictions without any comparable require ment of their own this is especially true if the amendment is construed to apply to the future release or escape of prisoners convicted of cr imes committed prior to the effective date of the amendment nevertheless the committee report in the 108th congress suggests that the senate judiciary committee considers the terms accused and convicted interchangeable and intended change from earlier more generously worded proposals the release which triggers notificati on requirement must be one relating to the crime

state constitutions and statutes it was perhaps seen as victims counterpart to the miranda warnings enjoyed by an accused and as prerequisite if the amendment were to function effectively95 there were

would be unlike defendants right to attend yet like defendants right to attend the use of the phrase has been thought to permit exclusion of the victim for disruptive behavior excessive displays of emotion and other forms of impropriety for which defendant might be excluded id under existing law the usual rationale for exclusion is to prevent victim witnesses from having their testimony co lored by the testimony of other earlier witnesses109 victim exclusion is one of the features of existing law that the amendment seeks to overcome how its command may be implemented is less apparent in single victim cases both constitutional policies victims rights and defendants due process rights could be honored simply by having the victim testify first the two policies might also be reconciled by refusing to allow attending victims to testify since the right not to be excluded does not include the right to testify and the right to be heard does not extend to trial testimony the issue might be resolved alternativel on victimdefendant equality grounds the defendant is constitutionally entitled to attend the entire trial even if he is ultimately to be witness the amendment may be seen as an equalizer if so it may not preclude defense counsel from commenting upon vic tims opportunity to color his or her testimony110 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31750crs39 110 continued testimony is

necessary infringement upon the rights of the accused145 it is said that permitting victim impact statements serves several beneficial purposes 1 to protect the victims interest in having the court order the defendant to make restitution146 2 to increase the possibility that the senten ce imposed will reflect the damage done and therefore the seriousness of the crime147 3 to balance the pleas for the defendant that have traditionally been heard at that point148 and 4 to restore some level of dignity and respect for the victim149 critics counter that the use of victim imp act statements

is insufficient reprieves may also be from legal necessity as where woman is capitally convicted and pleads her pregnancy though this is not cause to stay the judgment yet it is to respite the execution till she be deliv ered another cause of regular reprieve is if the offender become non compos betwee n the judgment and the award of execution for though man be compos when he commits capital crime yet if he becomes non compos after he shall not be indicted if after indictment he shall not be convicted if after conviction he shall not receive judgment if after judgment he shall not

which attached to the pardon rights has been added to the others references to parole proceedin gs and convictequiva lent rights have disappeared and reference to reprieves s surfaced in their place the right to be heard and make statement on conditional release plea and sentence has been replaced with the simple right to be heard on release plea and sentence the right to make statement

nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31750crs49 166 in earlier versions the right to be heard and to submit statement in each of several kinds of proceedings could have been construe d as the right to communicate right to submit statement and the right to have the communi cation carry determinative weight the right to be heard 167 senate hearing v house hearing v at 79 statement of james orensteini would expect courts to interpret the deletion of subm it statement to signal legislative intent to allow victims actually to be heard by making an oral statement nor do i think the use of the term reasonably to be heard would alte r that interpretation instead i believe courts would likely reconcile the two changes by inte rpreting reasonably to mean that victims oral statement could be subjected to reasonabl time and subject matter restrictions see also senate hearing iv at 122 house hearing iv at 50 168 id if correct then prison officials might face an extremely burdensome choice of either transporting incarcerated victims to c ourt for the purpose of being heard or providing for live transmissions to the courtroom related problem would extend beyond prison walls because the difference between the previous and current versions of the amendment suggest that victim must be allowed specifically to be heard rather than simply to submit statement victim might persuade court that the reasonable opportunity to be heard guaranteed by the current version of the amendment carries with it an im plicit guarantee that the government will take affirmative steps if necessary to accord such reasonable opportunity this undermines the intent of the amendments careful use of negative phrasing with respect to the right not be excluded from public proceedings formulation designed to avoid government obligation to provide funding to schedule the timing of particular proceeding according to victims wishes or otherwise assert affi rmative efforts to make it possible for victim continueddispositive the same message may be fo und in the distillation of the right to be heard and submit statement down to the right to be heard166 this reasonableness element may also give the courts and administrators greater discretion over the circumstances under which the right is accommodated than would be possible in the form of restriction permitted by the last sentence in section 2 of the amendment these rights shall not be restricted except when and to the degree dictated by substantial interest in public safety or the administration of criminal justice or by compelling necessity the reasonableness element may play role in another matter the right to be notified is limited to public proceedings invol ving the crime the right not to be excluded is likewise limited to such public proceedings involving the crime the right to be heard suffers such limitati on at least not facially once victim offender nexus exists court might conclude that it was reasonable for victim to be heard with regard to the release plea bargain sentence or pardon issues involving the offender or even potential witness on charges otherwise totally unrelated to the victim one hearing witness however foresaw the prospect of an opposite more narrow interpretation as result of the changes in his view elimination of the reference to the right to make statement in favor of simple right to be heard runs the risk that the courts will understand this as right to make an oral statement before the tribunal167 even under standard of reasonableness this might lead to substantial administrative inconvenience168 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31750crs50 168 continued to attend proceedings further undermining that intent is the fact that unlike its predecessor the current version of the ame ndment does not include the phrase if present in the specification of the right to be heard 169 cf senate hearing v house hearing v at 35 statement of steven t twistthe right would also extend to postconviction pub lic release proceedings for example parole or conditional release hearings jurisdictions th at have abolished parole in favor of truth in sentencing regimes may still have conditional release only if the jurisdiction also has public proceeding prior to such cond itional release would the right attach see also senate hearing iv at 18687 house hearing iv at 22 statement of steven t twistat its most literal construction the ame ndment is likely to convey greater rights than victims enjoy in many if not most jurisdictions public release proceedings proposals once conveyed right to be hear d at public proceedings relating to conditional release from custody and to the exte nt the inmate enjoyed right to be heard at closed parole hear ings the amendment simply conveys right to be heard at public release proceedings the clear implication is that under the amendment victims have right to be heard at closed parole hearings regardless of whether the inmate has right to be heard169 on the other hand the new formulation may open wider range of proceedings to victim allocution there was always some ambiguity over whether conditional release proceedings meant proceedings wh ere release might be granted if certain conditions were met before release or proceedings where release bound the accused or convicted offender to honor certain conditions after release or both in any event in bygone proposals the senate judiciar committee read conditional in the phrase conditional release from custody as word of limitation the amendment extends the right to be heard to proceedings determining conditional release from custody this phrase encompasses for example hearings to determine any pretrial or posttrial release including comparable releases during or after an appeal on ba il personal recognizance to the custody of third person or under any other c onditions including pr etrial diversion programs other examples of conditiona l release include work release and home detention its also includes parole hear ings or their functional equivalent both because parole hearings have some discretion in releasing offenders and because releases from prison are typically subject to various conditions such as continued good behavior it would also include release from secure mental facility for criminal defendant or one acquitted on the grounds of insanity victim would not have right to speak by virtue of this amendment at hearing to determine unconditional release for example victim could not claim right to be heard at hearing to determine the juri sdiction of the court or compliance with the governing statute of limitations ev though finding in favor of the defendant on these points might indirectly and ultimately lead to the release of the defendant similarly there is righ t to be heard when prisoner is released after serving the statutory maximum penalty or the full term of his sentence there would be proceeding to determinea release in such situations and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31750crs51 170 the senate committee reports on the question of when public hearings might be closed thus removing the trigger for the rights unde r

testify against his bosses srept 108191 at 34 sre pt 106254 at 30 s rept 105409 at 25 171 srept 108191 at 36 victims have righ t to veto any release decision by court rather simply to provide relevant informati on that the court can consider in making its determination about release see also senate hearing iv house hearing iv at 223 statement of steven j twist quoting sre pt 106254 at 33the victim is given right of veto over any plea doubt some victims may wish to see nothing less than the maximum possible penalty or minimum possible penalty for defendant under the amendment the court will receive this informa tion along with that provided by prosecutors and defendants and give it the weight it believes is appropriate deciding whether to accept continuedrelease would also be without condition if the courts authority over the prisoner had expired srept106254 at 32 srept 105409 at 27 thus by removing the words conditiona l and from custody the amendment perhaps should be understood to allow victims the right to be heard on most pretrial motions as well as most posttrial appeals and petitions or at least any that might result in release of the accused or th convicted offender from jeopardy for example it might support an argument that the amendment gives victims the right be heard at trial by the trier of fact j udge or jury on whether the defendant should or should not be convicted on an of the charges at issue ie at least limited trial participation the amendment affords the right only to reasonable extent victim shall have the right to reasonably to be heard at public release plea sentencing reprieve and pardon proceedin gs in other contexts the amendments reasonableness demands are sta ndards of circumstance what is reasonable is likely to depend upon the circumstances of individual cases li mitation of unknown implications the amendment even if conservatively read represents an expansion of victims rights in most jurisdictions its promise of the right to be heard in release proceedings in particular is more gener ous than most although victims rights to have their interests consider ed to be notified to atte nd and in some instances to make presentations at bail proceedings appear more frequently in state statutes and court rules than was once the case plea bargains the amendment assures crime victims of the right to reasonably be heard at proceedings where plea bargain is accepted the right only attaches to the acceptance of plea bargains in open court ie at public proceedings170 the right clearly does not vest victim with the right to participate in plea negotiations between the defendant and the prosecutor which are neither public nor proceedings by the same token the right to be heard is not the right to decide victims must be heard but their views are not necessarily controlling171 it remains to be seen whetherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31750crs52 171 continued plea 172 congress and the states remain free to set certain

s it speak to permissible restrictions on length content or other limitati ons that may come within the rule of reason neither does it expressly identify any limitation activat ed by conflict with rights of the defendant drafters may envision legislative definition of these limitations but the amendment may confine such efforts to those marked by substantial interest in public safety or the administr ation of criminal justice or by compelling necessity the right to reasonably be heard may come to be understood to mean the right to be heard under conditions and circ umstances where the right is weighed against judicial and administrative convenience or conflicting defenda nt interests the senate judiciary committee however has continuous described this and similar language as

not necessarily controlling in the case of victim safety the decisi on whether to release an accused on bail and the conditions to be imposed upon rel ease represent perhap s the obvious example of decisions where victims safety must be considered the right does not attach if the decision to release the offender is simply matter of administrative discretion exercised without the necessity of an adve rsarial proceeding thus the right only attaches with respect to release of an offender following full service of his or her sentence or on furlough or work release or assignment to halfway house

prompt or timely disposition of the case in one form or another188 the federal statutory victims bill of rights 42 usc 10606 does not include speedy trial provision but congress has encouraged the states to include right to reasonably expeditious trial among the rights they afford victims189 past proposals in the beginning proposals so metimes spoke of victims speedy trial right190 and in other

tolerated only if they are outweighed by other interests on the other hand the term ad judicative decisions appears clearly more inclusiv than trials and although it carries judicial coloring perhaps it is not much different than p roceedings except that there is literal requirement that the adjudications be public however since only victims may assert their rights section 3 and since victims are entitled to heard only at public proceedings section 2 the amendments authors may have intended the adjudications at which victims interests must be considered to be limited to public proceedings at

release proceedings as noted earlier it may be considered significant that neither the government nor the defendant may be allowed to bring the victims interest to the attention of the tribunal since in the words of the amendm ent elsewhere only the victim or the victims lawful representative may assert the right established by this article does victim always have recognizable interest in avoiding all unreasonable delay or only in those unreasonable delays that do more than simply offend the victim does victim only have an interest entitled to due consideration when the victim suffers some disadvantage because of the unreasonable delay the answers may lie in what the courts consider unreas onable delay in earlier versions it has been suggested that the test for reasonableness rests in the supreme courts speedy trial jurisprudence which weighs the length of delay reasons for the delay defendants assertion of his right and prejudice to the defendant194 the senate judiciary committee

matter of right the scope of the right was unstated although th proposals applied to juvenile proceedings the use of the rm convicted offender might have been construed to limit their restitution command to criminal convictions and therefore not reach findings of delinquency200 restitution orders in nominal amount or subject to priorities for criminal fines or forfeiture or other claims against th defendants assets might have seemed inconsistent with the decision to elevate mandatory victim restitution to constitutional right yet th senate reports concluded that the proposal did not

restitution order has become the right to consideration of just and timely victims claims appropriate to the circumstances weighed against the interest s of others and perhaps only applicable during

to restitution without reference to any other factors yet insertion of the word just for the first time in the restitution component of the amendment presumably calls for consideration of such factors

language is gone and in its place is reference to timely claims to restitu tion the implications are obvious but the statement quoted above seems to suggest that timeliness may be judged by the date of the injury the date of sentencing or the date on which the offender has the resources to begin paying restitution today the offende r earns 750 an hour making furniture inside the prison walls and none of it goes to her for her damages and injuries because it was not part of th criminal sentence if this provision had been the law jane would today be r eceiving restitution payments each month legislative authority section 4 vests congress with the power to enforce the amendment through appropriate legisl ation in addition the legislative history points out that subject to congress preemptive legislative prerogatives the state legislatures share with congress the authority within their own domains to restrict victims rights in the name of substantial interest in public safe ty or the administration of criminal justice or in response to compelling necessity they also continue to enjoy fundamental authority to outlaw new form s of misconduct it is so mewhat unclear whether they may legalize conduct which they had ou tlawed when the amendment went into effect for example does the amendment permit state that outlaws solicitation of various violent crimes to reduce the extent of its basic victims rights coverage by repealing its proscription on solicitation ot her than for purposes of public safety the administration of criminal justice or compelling necessity neither the language of the amendment nor its legislative hist ory seem to provide any clear answer contemporary practices the grant of legislative implementing authority may shield against the appearance of the unexpected and undesi rable consequences discovered after ratification of constitutional amendment the difficulty of amending the constitution argues for legislative safety valve of course this argument loses considerable force when one of the principal reasons for enacting constitutional amendment rather than merely enacting statute is to ensure that the rights it grants are not easily denied or diluted one of the perils implicit in opting for extensive legislative powers is the prospect of unfulfilled promises it is cer tainly possible to draft generally worded constitutional amendment in anticipation of future legislative refinements and these may be forthcoming but it may also happen that the refinements must be laboriously crafted through the courts

then to constrict the explicit legislative authority of the states205 the senate report in the 105th congre ss explained however that the loss of state legislative authority was less sweeping than it might have appeared it asserts that the power to define the class of vi ctims to whom the proposal would apply was by implication to be shared by congress and the states206 subject to preemptive

unlike previous versions of the proposed amendment which permitted states to enforce the amendment in their jurisdictions sjres 44 gives congress exclusive power to enforce this article by appropriate legisl ation i believe that granting congress sole power to enforce the provisions of the victims rights amendment and thus inter alia to define terms such as victim and violent crime and to enforce the guarantees of reasonable notice of public proceedings and of the rights established by the amendment will be significant and troubling step towards federalization of crime and the nationalization of our criminal justice system it is possible that the victims rights constitutional amendment will lack the flexib ility that is the hallmark of our federal system and perhaps in the process invalidate ma ny state victims rights provisions such prospect should give us pause srept 105409 at 445 additional views of sen hatch 209 the majority appears to believe that it can control some of the inevitable damage through explications in the committee report about how the amendment will operate we doubt that the courts will care much for such efforts they will look first at the plain meaning of the text of the amendment they will seek guidance in supreme court precedents interpreting provisions using simila r language they will not resort to the majority report to interpret wo rding that is clearly understood in current legal and political circles any interpretative value of the ma jority report is further undermined by the inconsistency of the document which in so situations narrows the impact of the amendment and in other circumstances expands the impact of the amendment eg by devising role for states in implementing the amendment such inconsistency renders the majority report legally meaningless weaknesses in the text of the amendment cannot with any confidence be cured by the ma joritys views especially not when the majoritys analysis is so directly at odds with the amendments plain language and with settled constitutional doctrine the majority report attempts to deflect the federalism concerns raised by sjres 44 by suggesting that the states will retain p lenary authority to implement the amendment within their own criminal systems we find this suggestion surprising given the plain language of the amendments implementation clause in section 3 the congress shall have the power to enforce this article by ppropriate legislation identical language in earlier constitutional amendments has been read to vest enforcement authority exclusively in the congress in the case of sjres 44 moreover the text is illuminated by the legislative history earlier drafts of the amendment expressly extended enforcement authority to the states these drafts drew fire from constitutional scholars who expressed doubt that constitutionallyauthorized state laws could be supreme over state constitutions or even over federal laws and concern that for the first time rights secured by the federal constitution would mean different things in di fferent parts of the country the committee then amended the text to its current formulati on faced with this history

substantial interest as used in the amendment is in tended to incorporate the third and fourth prongs of the central hudson test ie that the government must not only demonstrate substantial inte rest

supreme court is catchall phrase that encompasses any aspect of criminal procedure the term administration includes two components 1 the procedural functioning of the proceeding and 2 the substantive interest of parties in the proceeding the term administration in the amendment is narrower than the broad usage of it in supreme court caselaw and refers to the first description the procedural f

although i w ould likely disagree with an interpretation of the phrase that excluded prison administration such an interp retation is certainly possible given that habeas corpus proceedings

ambiguous are restrictions permitted when dictated by the administration of criminal justice or by substantial interest in public safety or must th administration of criminal justice interest be substantial as well the more logical cons truction would seem to apply the substantial interest measure to both public safety and th administration of criminal justice but contrary construction w ould

to restrictions in the name of the administration of criminal justice these rights shall not be restricted except when and to the degree dictated by subs tantial interest in public safety or the administration of criminal justice or by compelling necessity232 when interpreting the amendment courts might favor the compelling interest option because it alludes to governmental burden while particularized need is burden ordinarily shoul dered by private party on the other hand the frequent use of compelling interest in earlier propos ed amendments may indicate that the drafters switched to compellin g necessity with different standard in mind house witnesses felt compelling necessity ca lled for demanding strict scrutiny standard233 the senate judiciary committee report in the 108th congress briefly explains its understanding of the restrictions clause it expects recourse to the clause will occur only rarely and supplies three examples of when the clause might be called upon in the case of crimes with catastr ophic consequences mass victim cases in domestic violence cases and in cases of intergang violence srept 108191 at 41 many of the amendments rights are subject to rule of reasonableness that seems to afford flexibility in mass victim cases there is however such explicit limitation upon the right not to be exclude d and it is here that the committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31750crs71 234 for crime perpetrated against hundreds of victims it may be impractical or even impossible to give all victims the right to be physically present in the courtroom in such circumstances an exception to the right to be present may be made while at the same time providing reasonable accommodation for the interest of victims congress for example has specified closecircuit broadcasting arrangem ent that may be applicable to some such cases srept 108191 at 41believes the restriction clause might come into play234 the committee is comparably precise in its observation that the clause might be invoked where notifying the member of rival gang of an offenders impeding release may spawn retaliatory violence id the gang example may serve the added purpose of clarifying the scope of the amendments right to reasonable and timely notice of the release or escape of an accused when the committee identifies ga ng retaliation as an example of where the restriction clause may prove beneficial it suggests that otherwise concern for offender safety may not be considered in formulating and implementing reasonable victim notification procedures this has obvious implications in domes tic violence situation and may be what the committee had in mind when it offered the domestic violence example yet the report is cryptic as to when the use of the restrictions clause might be appropriate or necessary in domestic violence case it simply declares that in some cases of domestic violence the dynamics of victimoffender relationships may require some modification of otherwise typical victims rights provisions id the report does confirm the committees understanding of the cl auses use of the terms substantial interest and compelling nece ssity refers to the st andards developed by the supreme court with the added observation that defendants constitutional rights may well meet this standard in many cases srept 108191 at 412 the restriction clause mentions neither congress nor the states earlier versions spoke of state authority in the area the omission might be considered telling or it may be that such construction is too wildly impractical to have been intended it may be that the restrictions clause may only be activated by congress acting pursuant to the enforcement authority the amendment confers in section 4 perhaps in the absence of statute re striction may be found on the other hand the committee report begins its discussion of the restri ctions clause by noting that the first amendment not absolute and that courts interpreting the crime victims rights amendment will doubt give simila r common sense construction to its provisions srept 108191 at 41 the imp lication is that the courts in most instances at least initially the state courts will be the ones to determine whether the circumstances in particular case warrant the application of the restrictions clause enforcement section 4 of the amendment

in the criminal justice system in order to correct denial of victims rights or have other provisions designed to prevent offenders from claiming the benefits of victims rights237 in contrast federal

current language would appear to permit victim to reopen the restitution portion of ntence for any reason at all at any time even after sentence has been served in full the problems for law enforcement that could be caused by this provision include for example the possibility that because of the limited economic means of many defendants restitution awarded to some victims at sentencing might have to be decreased to accommodate subsequent claims by victims who come forward after sentencing the potential that defendants will litigate the reopening of restitution order without the reopening of othe r parts of the sentence and the difficulty in reaching and defending plea agreements in lig ht of possible reopenings of and changes in terms of restitution 241 srept 105409 at 44
