related programs updated november 13 2003 michael m simpson specialist in life sciences resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress climate change federal research and technology and related programs summary for over 20 years there have been federal programs directly or indirectly related to climate change direct programs have focused largely on scientific research to improve the capability to understand climate systems andor predict climatic change and variability energy use has been major focus of efforts related to possible climate change because carbon dioxide the major greenhouse gas is added to the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned those efforts which sought to reduce oil imports manage electricity needs and address environmental concerns including climate change involve many parts of the government similarly climate science efforts in various agencies have sought to expand scientific understanding of the dynamics of climate and its societal consequences as basis for policy decisions that rely on improved predictions of future climate conditions and climate impact assessments coordinating these efforts has been challenging this report identifies and discusses only the direct climate scientific and research programs of the federal government and does not focus on the wide array of programs on energy that though relevant indirectly to climate change do not include climate as specific goal the us global change research program in the first bush administration and subsequently in the clinton administration funded studies to improve scientific understanding of the processes that influence earths climate including trends on global and regional scales the climate change technology initiative ccti was the clinton administrations package of research and development rd to develop renewable energy sources and more efficient technologies targeted tax credits to encourage purchase and deployment of more efficient technologies and voluntary information programs so businesses and schools might be better informed when making purchasing and operating decisions involving energy use and emissions the ccti was followed by the current bush administrations climate change research initiative ccri and national climate change technology initiative nccti both parts of cabinetlevel committee on climate change science and technology integration the ccri and the extant us global change research program were combined into the climate change science program ccsp in the fy2004 budget various major activities of the ccti appear to continue at different funding levels through the bush administration while using different name the final report of the strategic plan for the climate change science program was released in july 2003 the fy2004 budget requests 17 billion to sponsor scientific research directly managed by the ccsp and 12 billion for technology rd in the nccti an interagency review process is underway to identify specific research areas with various details about the bush administrations climate change efforts still in development some critics highlight the need for clearer goals for climate change rd while some proponents note that further rd is needed if certain climate change management strategies are to be put in place this report will be updated as events

climate change research and technology activities and related programs many research and technology programs related to climate change are of long standing coordinating these myriad interagency activities has always been challenge the federal structure interrelating these activities recently reorganized by the bush administration has grown more complex over time in june 2001 president george bush announced the national climate change technology initiative nccti and the climate change research initiative ccri two major federal initiatives on climate change the administration described in april 2002 its climate change science and technology research management structure responsible for managing the federal governments research and technology efforts related to global climate change in january 2003 the administration issued statements that further described its climate change activities and structure including the ccri the us global change research program and the nccti in general while organizational and nomenclature details differ from previous years research and technology efforts largely appear to continue many of those of past initiatives at somewhat different funding levels the current structure outlined most recently in the july 2003 strategic plan for the climate change science program has two main components which encompass most previous programs overseen by complex set of interagency bodies see table 1 1 directly sponsored climate change research is specified in the request for thirteen federal entities the departments of agriculture commerce defense energy health human services interior state and transportation along with the environmental protection agency the national aeronautics and space administration the national science foundation the agency for international development and the smithsonian institution descriptions of the activities of these entities are provided in this report testimony on january 8 2003 given by assistant

of the gcrp ccsp strategic plan p 13 announced on july 24 2003 the ccsp strategic plans major research goals are to improve climate change knowledge and understanding reduce uncertainty and explore ways to manage risks and opportunities historical background carbon dioxide the major greenhouse gas of concern in possible climate change is produced in large part as result of energy production and use the federal government has had programs dealing with energy efficiency and with climate research and services for more than 20 years the congress has held hearings about them since the mid1970s when major goal of such programs was to reduce us dependence on oil imports during the energy crisis and to expand scientific understanding of the dynamics of the climate system and its societal consequences as basis for policy decisions that depend on improved predictions of future climate conditions and on better climate impact assessments us government policies explicitly addressing possible climate change linked to greenhouse gas emissions date back to the mid1980s4 these policies have focused heavily on scientific research the energy policy act of 1992 in conjunction with the us ratification of the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc influenced the direction of us efforts which continued in the first bush and clinton administrations toward energy 4 for details please see crs issue brief ib89005 global climate change crs5 efficiency renewable energy and rd5 to try to move toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions the climate change action plan designed with the goal of reducing us greenhouse gas emissions and announced in 1993 by the clinton administration included more than 40 ongoing federal programs to influence assist or work with business state and local governments scientific and other entities rd and other programs since then were largely maintained or modified with some new activities and names with evolution from prior efforts coupled with some augmentation packages of programs in the clinton administration such as the 1997 climate change technology initiative ccti were built upon the earlier efforts including efforts originally aimed at reducing dependence on oil imports during the preparations for the final negotiations of the december 1997 kyoto protocol to the unfccc6 president clinton announced the threestage ccti on october 22 19977 it was described as the cornerstone of the clinton administrations efforts to stimulate the development and use of renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency products that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions8 through combination of rd and information and tax incentive programs stage 1 included funding for rd tax incentives for early action set of federal government energy initiatives including various tax credits to encourage purchase and use of more efficient technologies and industry consultations to explore ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions stage 2 which was planned to begin around 2004 would have reviewed and evaluated stage 1 stage 3 as envisioned prior to the kyoto protocol included actions aimed at reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 20082012 meeting the binding targets anticipated in the kyoto protocol through measures that would include domestic and international emissions trading the kyoto protocol which the united states signed on november 11 1998 but which has not been submitted to the us senate for advice and consent on ratification outlines an obligation for the united states to reduce its total greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 7 below 1990 levels on average between 2008 and 20129 the clinton administration supported united states participation in this protocol the bush administration on the other hand has rejected the protocol 5 for further details see crs report rl30024 global climate change policy cost competitiveness and comprehensiveness 6 please see crs report

deidre lee acting deputy director for management office of management and budget omb to the house committee on government reform and oversight subcommittee on national economic growth 9 please see crs report 982 global climate change the kyoto protocol for further details crs6 the congress has in the past passed budget resolutions and appropriations bills with provisions prohibiting the use of funds to implement the kyoto protocol which has not been ratified by the united states or entered into force internationally some controversy was engendered by the possible linkage of funding proposals associated with the ccti to the kyoto protocol goals after some early consideration of these concerns for the most part the r d elements were funded by the congress moreover many of the programs related to the ccti and other climate research preceded the kyoto protocol and were mainly influenced by the voluntary commitments the united states made in the framework convention on climate change to try to meet voluntary goal of returning greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 and to current efforts to reduce intensity of emissions see crs report rl30024 global climate change policy cost competitiveness and comprehensiveness federal structure and funding for managing global climate change research and technology the governments activities relating to climate change have been accomplished through several programs initiatives and agencies coordinating these activities continues to be challenge various organizational structures have been attempted over the past two decades in the effort to improve coordination and efficiency an early effort dating back to the late 1970s was embodied in the national climate program act of 1978 hr 6669 public law 95367 involving twelve federal agencies vested with responsibilities in climate research and services10 designed to centralize planning and to improve interagency and intergovernmental coordination the national climate program emphasized development and delivery of useful climatic information and services to wide range of users based on current knowledge of climate and better use of existing climatic data simultaneously the program sought an expanded federal effort in scientific research to foster better understanding of the climate system and the societal consequences of climate change as basis for national decision making that depended on improved predictions of future climate conditions and better climate impact assessments some ten years after its enactment however the national climate program was faced with criticisms that involved charges of paucity of funding and concerns expressed among agency principals that any program combining individual agency capabilities and resources into coordinated effort could compromise or impede existing agency responsibilities 10 us library of congress congressional research service the national climate program act of 1978 background and legislative history by john justus appears in implementation of the climate act hearing before the subcommittee on natural resources and environment of the committee on science and technology us house of representatives 96th congress washington us govt print off 1979 p 190228 crs7 united states global change research program by the early 1990s the national climate program faded from the scene11 as the newly created us global change research program gained adherents achieved prominence as presidential initiative with discretely identifiable budget items12 and eventually acquired legislative underpinning in the form of the global change research act of 1990 s 169 public law 10160613 it continues as part of current federal climate activities as described below and as shown in table 1 the gcrp was created with the recognition that global change issues are complex and far reaching extending beyond the mission resources and expertise of any single agency requiring instead the integrated efforts of several governmental entities the program involves scientific research on global change generally including but not limited to climate change gcrp agencies support scientific research through coordination and joint activities members of the gcrp are the departments of agriculture commerce notably its national oceanic and atmospheric administration defense energy health and human services notably the national institutes of health interior united states geological survey and state plus the environmental protection agency national aeronautics and space administration national science foundation and smithsonian institution the gcrp coordinates and funds research on among other things natural fluctuations of earth processes possible impacts of human activities on the environment and ways to increase the predictive power of climate change models the gcrp14 is mandated by statute to undertake scientific assessments of the potential consequences for the united states of global change15 the global change 11 pl 95367 was never formally repealed however 12 annual budget presentations appeared in separate document our changing planet first produced by the national science and technology council nstc in 1995 further information about the nstc comes later in this report 13 the act defined global change as including alterations in climate land productivity oceans or other water resources atmospheric chemistry and ecological systems that may alter the earths capacity to sustain life 14 the gcrp which focuses on improving the understanding of global change reported to the committee on environment and natural resources cenr this was established in 1993 as an element of the nstc until the cenrs sunset date of december 31 2002 the nstc created by executive order on november 23 1993 continues and is chaired by the president the nstc is the primary means for the president to coordinate science space and technology across the federal government members of the nstc include the vice president the assistant to the president for science and technology cabinet secretaries and heads of agencies with significant science and technology responsibilities and other white house officials the cenr advised and assisted the nstc to increase the effectiveness and productivity of federal rd involving the environment and natural resources climate change research was coordinated through the nstc in accordance with the global change research act of 1990 as shown in table 1 and described later in this report the gcrp is now part of the climate change science program 15 global change encompasses the multidirectional interactions of the physical chemical and continued crs8 research act of 1990 pl 101606 section 106 stated that the federal government shall prepare and submit to the president and the congress national assessment which integrates evaluates and interprets the findings of the program and discusses the scientific uncertainties associated with such findings analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment agriculture energy production and use land and water resources transportation human health and welfare human social systems and biological diversity and analyzes current trends in global change both humaninduced and natural and projects major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years research conducted by the gcrp was the scientific foundation on which the assessment was built the national assessment synthesis team nast committee of experts drawn from government academe industry and nongovernmental organizations provided the leadership in writing the assessment approvals for the work were given by the nstc the cabinetlevel body of agencies responsible for scientific research the assessment is composed of the overview report and the foundation report the foundation report is more detailed than the overview16 the two reports are nationallevel peerreviewed documents which synthesized results from studies conducted by regional and sector teams and from the broader scientific literature17 climate change research initiative on june 11 2001 the bush administration issued the white house initial review on climate change cabinetlevel review of us climate change policy members of the cabinet the vice president and senior white house staff examined the science technologies us activities and options for addressing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases the white house initial review included the concurrent announcement of the us climate change research initiative ccri and the national climate change technology initiative nccti the ccris general mission was to improve the integration of scientific knowledge into effective decision support systems with performance metrics and deliverable products useful 15 continued biological processes that affect the whole earth system changes in climate are subset 16 the full titles of the two reports are similar climate change impacts on the united states the potential consequences of climate variability and change foundation and climate change impacts on the united states the potential consequences of climate variability and change overview 17 from wwwusgcrpgovusgcrpnacc the national assessment was formally challenged under the data quality act dqa section 515a of pl 106554 by the competitive enterprise institute cei the dqa empowers affected parties to challenge the objectivity utility and reproducibility of data used andor disseminated by the federal government the cei later filed lawsuit seeking to prevent further dissemination of the report an official response to the suit is pending crs9 to policymakers in 25 year time frame18 specific priorities begun in fy2003 include new efforts to better understand the north american carbon cycle to develop reliable representations of the global and regional climate interactions of atmospheric aerosols to invest in more refined computer modeling and to ensure long term climate data records that are of higher quality additional organizational elements to deal with climate change were announced in 2002 an organization chart was released by the bush administration at meeting on april 1 2002 of the subcommittee on global change research gcr part of the nowextinct cenr19 the chart provided some details about new governmental structures and activities that are part of the administrations efforts to advance climate change science and technology the organizational background information for the chart released at the cenrs gcr subcommittee meeting on april 1 2002 is summarized in table 1 as described further in this report and shown in table 2 the ccri was combined in january 2003 with the gcrp to form the climate change science program national climate change technology initiative the nccti was announced by president george w bush on june 11 2001 the secretaries of the departments of commerce and energy working with other agencies were directed to evaluate the state of climate change technology rd in the united states and make recommendations for improvement provide guidance on strengthening basic research in academe and in the national laboratories develop opportunities to enhance publicprivate partnerships in applied rd make recommendations for funding demonstration projects of cuttingedge technologies and evaluate improved technologies for measuring and monitoring gross and net terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions the fy2004 budget requests 12 billion for climate change technology within the presidents nccti the fy2004 budget request for climate change science is described later in this report climate change policy panel the climate change policy panel ccpp see table

the ccsti is the director of the white house office of science and technology policy the ccstis functions include recommending to the president climate change science and technology activities and movement of funds and programs across agency boundaries and coordinating with the omb the chair of the ccsti is responsible for the final review of recommendations to the climate change policy panel working group on climate change science and technology reporting to the ccpp and the ccsti as seen in the organizational chart in table 1 is the interagency working group on climate change science and technology the groups secretary was expected to be the assistant director for climate science and technology from the office of science and technology policy ostp position the administration said it intended to create20 while the position had not been created as of the date of this report the function is performed by ostps associate director for science21 the functions of the interagency working group on climate science and technology include reviewing all programs relating to climate change science providing recommendations to the ccsti regarding climate science funding and program allocations and accepting and acting on recommendations by the joint climate change science program office and the climate change technology program office climate change science program on january 30 2003 the administration announced that the ccri and the gcrp would be combined into the climate change science program ccsp which is separate from climate change technology work which is part of the presidents national climate change technology initiative the fy2004 budget seeks 175 billion to directly sponsor scientific research managed by the ccsp included in the 175 billion ccsp funds are 182 million for the ccri although the total ccsp request for spending in fy2004 was up only 01 over the fy2003 request that portion of the funding request allocated to the embedded ccri was up 355 from 40 million in fy2003 to 182 million in fy2004 an issue for congress is the extent to which that large ccri increase represents new money versus how much is attributable to the reclassification of ongoing research programs the ccsp reports to the interagency working group on climate science and technology and will have joint membership of all agencies with climate research funding according to materials presented on april 1 2002 in meeting of the subcommittee on global change research the ccsp is to be staffed by interagency detailees the director is detailee from the department of commerce james mahoney assistant secretary of commerce and deputy administrator of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the function of the ccsp will 20 disclosed on april 1 2002 in meeting of

announced april 1 2002 located in doe is new entity and reports to the interagency working group on climate change science and technology through the secretary of energy the cctps director is doe senior political appointee according to materials presented on april 1 2002 in meeting of the subcommittee on global change research23 the functions of this office are to develop review and implement climate technology programs within the federal government consistent with the national climate change technology initiative nccti the cctp works with the current participants of the nccti the cctp began in fy2003 and continues in fy2004 to create an inventory of climate change technology efforts with the goal of recommending priority programs to help meet the administrations goal of an 18 percent reduction in energy intensity ratio of energy use to economic productivity by 2012 this ongoing creation of variety of climate change technology efforts makes comparisons of technology programs and funding before and after fy2003 very difficult as such the comparative details as presented in table 5 are unavailable for fy200424 in hearing of the house science committee held on november 6 2003 the administration stated its intention to release during the first quarter of 2004 for public comment draft plan for the cctps activities doe also said that the cctp will release two reports on near and longterm goals and the state of research and current technology activities in statement some of the priorities to be highlighted in the fy2005 budget include the hydrogen fuel initiative to accelerate the transition to hydrogen economy futuregen for zeroemissions electricity generation using coal and fusion energy the same form of energy that powers the sun25 comments made in the hearing noted that the administration appeared to be focused mostly on longterm technologies that energy efficiency and other proven technologies exist for shortterm gains and that there remain questions about the specifics for the timeframe and the level at which atmospheric carbon concentrations will be stabilized26 22 from materials distributed in an april 2002 meeting of the subcommittee

previouslymentioned climate change research initiative to accelerate climate change research over the next five years in order to assist in the development of climate change policy strategic plan would guide the climate change research the national academy of sciences nas was asked by the administration in september 2002 to review the draft strategic plan the draft strategic plan was made available in november 2002 for scientific and public comments planning workshop for scientists and stakeholders was held in december 2002 to formally gather comments about the draft strategic plan the nas review and assembled outside comments were reported by nas in february 2003 recommendations from the nas report addressed the federal structure for managing climate change research and technology among other things they included these comments the revised strategic plan should articulate clear specific and ambitious vision statement in the context of national needs with tangible goals an explicit process to establish priorities and an effective management plan the plan should present clear goals for the ccri and ensure activities are consistent with these goals maintain ccris emphasis on nearterm decisions and include an explicit mechanism to link gcrp and ccri activities the plan should describe the management processes to be used to foster agency cooperation towards common ccsp goals clear mechanisms for coordinating and linking ccsp activities with the technology development activities of the cctp should be described the plan should more fully describe how models and knowledge supporting regional decision making and placebased science will be developed the plan should strengthen treatment of human economic and ecological dimensions of climate and associated global changes the plan should better describe strategic program for an integrated observing system for climate variability and change on scales from regional to global the plan should improve the description of how decision support capabilities will be developed the plan should identify what sources and magnitudes of uncertainty reductions are especially needed crs13 the plan should address the major requirements in building capacity in human and computing resources the plan should use the clear goals and program priorities and advice from an independent advisory body to guide future funding decisions27 climate change science program strategic plan subsequent to the nas recommendations reported in february 2003 the administration released its new ccsp strategic plan on climate change on july 24 2003 the plan describes five major research goals improve knowledge of past and present climate including natural variability and improve understanding of causes of variability and change improve understanding of forces causing climate change reduce uncertainty in projections of future climate change understand the sensitivity and adaptability of natural and managed ecosystems to climate change explore the uses and limits of knowledge to manage risks and opportunities related to climate variability and change specific research targets accompany each goal there also are schedules for research papers and synthesis reports including report within two years on how to resolve temperature data differences between satellite and groundbased readings and report within four years on abrupt climate change the plan provides budget details some critics say the plan overemphasizes the uncertainties in climate science covers little new ground and allows delay in taking actions to curb greenhouse gas emissions some proponents say the plan will more sharply focus research with clearer goals and schedules28 the 360page plan can be viewed at

identified as ccti or ccri but rather part of noaas generic mission among other things research at noaa sought to determine the impacts of climate variability and change on ecosystems understand how radiative chemical and dynamical processes interact in the upper tropospherelower stratosphere to affect climate and study the effects of climate variability and change on health30 there also were programs at the national institute of standards and technology nist which looked at climate change issues31 the 2 million requested and provided in the fy2000 budget specifically for the ccti

activities including climate change observations and research to reduce scientific uncertainty in fy2003 amounted to 118 million and the fy2004 request is 136 million department of energy carbon dioxide which as noted above is the major greenhouse gas arises mostly from combustion of fossil fuels the department of energy which has long had rd programs relating to fossil fuel energy use was by far the largest recipient of both ccti and similar later funding doe has received and continues to receive about 90 of interagency climate change funding while the administration has stated that the total interagency fy2004 request for climate change technology is 1210 million agencyspecific amounts are being reviewed through an interagency process in comparison as shown in table 3 the fy2004

varied through the years eg basic science was presented in fy00 and fy02 as specific category but had been funded in fragmented fashion throughout other categories in other years crs20 national institutes of health within the department of health and human services the national institutes of health conducted research identified as related to climate change including study of the health effects of ultraviolet radiation and of chemical replacements for chlorinated fluorocarbons this work amounted to 59 million in fy2003 the fy2004 request is for 61 million department of the interior the united states geological survey usgs within the department of the interior has conducted global change research including historical research on climate variability and change and global carbon cycling through lakes streams wetlands soils sediments and vegetation the usgs also manages and disseminates satellite landsurface and ecosystem data which may be used in climate change activities in fy2003 the department received 26 million for its climate change research the fy2004 request is also 26 million environmental protection agency the environmental protection agency uses two main budget categories science and technology st which includes rd and technology development and diffusion efforts and environmental programs and management epm which are the costs to run programs therefore it is difficult to consistently separate rd from technology assistance and diffusion efforts for example in epas climate change buildings sector the owner of building can have epas benchmarking tool voluntarily applied to that building as target for energy reduction various activities can be tried eg plugging leaks and replacing less efficient lights with more efficient lights to see if the benchmark will be met if not other activities can be tried in an iterative fashion trying and recording and incorporating the findings in the benchmark this program includes activities that can be described as both researchrelated and technology diffusion and assistance epas figures for climate change st are used here while there has been some discussion about the proper roles for government industry and academe in climate change and other rd35 the climate change rd activities have not been highly controversial in general epa funds targeted for rd especially areas of more basic rd that predate the ccti and the kyoto protocol were less controversial and funds for new programs intended to assist technology deployment and diffusion and to help consumers learn about and choose more efficient commodities and processes have sometimes been more controversial the elements and levels of epas climate change research and technology funds are summarized in table 7 activities related to these program areas are briefly described below some of these funding areas focused heavily on rd while others involved information dissemination and other activities 35 please see crs report 98365

especially energyintensive industries such as cement chemicals steel petroleum airlines and food processing commonly through technical assistance to audit and identify greenhouse gas emission sources and to help in formulating appropriate reduction goals and strategies including removal of regulatory and other barriers this includes working with ongoing privatelyfunded energy efficiency programs at private companies carbon removal efforts at epa were planned in coordination with the departments of agriculture and energy the epausdadoe funds for this activity are for studying ways to increase environmental storage of carbon as well as the kinds and sizes of incentives that could be given to land owners and crop growers to increase the quantity of carbon stored on agricultural and forest lands and at the same time improve soil quality reduce soil erosion and enhance other environmental and conservation goals epa works with state and local governments to help find ways to reduce energy use and pollution sometimes by supporting existing state and local programs the cities for climate protection program for example involves more than 54 local governments in implementing building transportation waste and renewable energy projects to eliminate about 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide statelevel example is new jerseys state carbon bank program established to help achieve new jerseys greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal of 35 below 1990 levels by 2005 international capacity building partnerships and cooperation involves epa and other agencies working to study ways to provide technical and other assistance to developing countries to aid in reducing their emissions developing countries currently emit more than half the global total of greenhouse gases and such emissions are growing rapidly smithsonian institution global change research at the smithsonian institution attempts to understand more fully atmospheric processes ecosystem dynamics natural and humaninduced environmental change on daily to decadal time scales and longerterm climate metrics the smithsonian also serves as repository of climate change findings these activities amounted to 6 million in fy2003 the same amount requested in fy2004 crs23 united states agency for international development the us agency for international development has worked with foreign governments with the goal of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions and lowering vulnerability to the threats posed by climate change impacts by studying ways to increase use of environmentally sound energy forestry and biodiversity conservation methods foreign governments have included brazil the phillippines and russia these efforts amounted to 6 million in fy2003 the same amount requested for fy2004 department of transportation the department of transportation will conduct research and analysis relating to greenhouse gas models for the surface transportation sector greenhouse gas control strategies and transportation and global climate change while there were funds for this activity at dot in fy2003 the fy2004 request is for 4 million department of state joined by various european union environmental policy makers the department of state issued joint statement on february 7 2003 identifying six areas for possible cooperative research carbon cycle research aerosolclimate interactions

involving the departments of state and energy and representatives from several countries was announced on february 27 2003 to design build and operate what was labeled the worlds first pollutionfree coalfired power plant the facility will cost an estimated 1000 million over the next 10 years36 while climate change research funds for state were identified in fy2003 the fy2004 request is for 1 million department of housing and urban development climate change research and technology programs new to the department of housing and urban development hud in fy1999 were for the government housing developers builders partnership for advancing technology in housing path identified as part of the ccti through fy2001 path research had number of goals in addition to climate change path efforts sought to develop and disseminate technologies that will result in housing that is substantially more affordable durable disaster resistant safer and energyresource efficient37 known money for hud has been requested since fy2001 but hud continues to administer the overall operations of the path conclusion possible climate change linked to greenhouse gas emissions has been addressed by various us government policies since the mid1980s with an emphasis on energy rd and on climate research and services us efforts in the 36 httpusinfostategovtopicalglobalclimate03022802htm 37 department of housing and urban development policy development and research from httpwwwhudgovbdfy2000summarypdandrrandtcfm crs24 former bush and clinton administrations toward rd in energy efficiency and renewable energy and research into climate and global change were given direction by the energy policy act of 1992 which implemented united states responsibilities under the unfccc and by the global change research act of 1990 the 1993 climate change action plan linked or made partnerships among various federal agencies business state and local governments and other entities with the goal of reducing us greenhouse gas emissions the clinton administrations ccti built upon these earlier efforts the current bush administration has introduced its us climate change research initiative the national climate change technology initiative and the climate change science program strategic plan the plan as released on july 24 2003 describes five major research goals improve knowledge of past and present climates improve understanding of climate change forces reduce uncertainty in climate change projections understand sensitivity and adaptability of ecosystems to climate change and explore uses and limits of knowledge to manage risks and opportunities as funding and other details become available similarities to and differences from earlier climatechange programs may become apparent the evolving organizational structure however makes it difficult to determine precisely some of the interrelationships among science and technology programs some critics of current climate change policy call for sharper goals better defined priorities and more detailed clearly stated objectives for climate change rd and its associated funding profile some observers point out for example that the total ccsp request for spending in fy2004 was up only 01 over the fy2003 request from 1747 billion to 1749 billion while that portion of the funding request allocated to the embedded ccri was up 355 from 40 million in fy2003 to 182 million in fy2004 an issue for congress in this regard is the extent to which such demonstrably large ccri increase actually represents new money and how much is attributable to the reclassification of ongoing research programs especially given the fact that the overall request is up only 01 on the other hand some proponents note that further rd is needed to justify certain climate change management strategies to focus those strategies on key policy questions and to reduce scientific uncertainties surrounding prospective climate change so that policymakers can make better more informed decisions for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32147
