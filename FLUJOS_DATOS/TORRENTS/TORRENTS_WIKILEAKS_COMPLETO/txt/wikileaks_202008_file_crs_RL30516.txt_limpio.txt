services firms trends and prospects updated august 29 2006 walter w eubanks specialist in economic policy government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress mergers and consolidation between banking and financial services firms trends and prospects summary competitive legislative and regulatory developments in financial services in the united states have all contributed to significant industry changes the landmark financial services legislation the grammleachbliley act pl 106102 glba has been speeding ongoing changes in the us financial services industry overall it allows providers flexibility in responding to economic trends global and especially technological advances continue to affect the financial services industry in ways yet unforeseen such factors are part of the larger picture reflected in recent mergers among large banking organizations in europe and japan as well and expanding or contracting product lines of domestic financial institutions mergers of very large banking organizations in europe and japan move the size of single organizations to new heights american providers of financial services are similarly growing through combinations as exemplified by the fusion of jp morgan into the chase manhattan companies and the joining of wachovia and first union not to mention the increasing span of citigroup bankamerica acquired fleetboston to form the largest banking company in america and the second largest in the world increasing diversification of financial services within single entities in the united states is occurring through acquisitions and internal development of new businesses glba allowed new affiliations among banks insurance and securities firms and increased diversification within individual financial organizations in response to this increased flexibility many institutions have taken advantage of expanded organizational arrangements some have done so to marked advantage while others have retreated from their diversifications the most prominent backer of glba citigroup has shed the insurance businesses it went to great lengths to acquire and validate through that law and was cautioned in 2005 by the federal reserve on future expansions specific changes for policy consideration depend on the predominant ways in which the financial system unfolds glba clearly ended the isolation of the investment banking business from the commercial banking businesses through its repeal of the glasssteagall act of 1933 the financing of enron worldcom parmalat and other questionable corporations through both securities and loans from prominent financial holding companies has called the commercial and investment banking combination of businesses into some question in the 109th congress the financial services regulatory relief act of 2006 s 2856 which is in conference with the house version of this bill may have an impact on the concentration of financial services providers it includes provisions that address the risks that large complex bankingsecurities firms must confront in the new glba environment the dynamics of consolidation combined with the commingling of financial services have made risk management more difficult for the services providers and their regulators this report will be updated as developments warrant contents consolidation worldwide 1 mergers of large

services firms have been prominent first there have been amalgamations of financial companies including banks into everlarger entities generally within the same industries second there has been increasing diversification of financial services offered within single entities whether through acquisitions or internal development of new businesses crossing industry lines ultimately these size and product changes will shape the performance of the domestic and international financial systems as nations gain experience with these changes legislative and regulatory bodies in the united states and elsewhere will be maintaining oversight to evaluate possible effects volatility in the insurance and securities sectors adds impetus to changes in financial acquisitions as well problems of corporate governance in nonfinancial sectors have come to have large role in the evolution of financial companies consolidation worldwide consolidation is occurring not only in the united states but worldwide varied factors are contributing in japan dominant factor is the belief that the nation requires larger institutions to ease recovery from serious financial difficulties in europe the business philosophy is that crossboundary transactions are increasing within the european union now with largely common monetary system and set of business practices and with former communist countries the belief driving change in the united states is that organizations containing diversified financial services should have place alongside compartmentalized financial services firms much of the change not only domestically but worldwide is taking place through holding companies which hold controlling stock positions in banks and other financial companies through two forms of absorption merger and acquisition technically the term merger denotes one corporation purchasing another and absorbing it entirely into its own structure while acquisition means one holding company buying another to control it in this country most financial fusions of large size take the form of an acquisition canada too has moved toward holding companybased framework of financial firms acquisitions in the increasingly international financial economies of computerized world new institutions spring up while existing institutions feeling threatened assemble in defensive reaction prominent observers believe that large bricksandmortar providers of services and small niche providers are the most likely to survive the onslaught of their new and more nimble competitors those in the middle in size or crs2 technology might seem less likely to succeed in volatile world of rising energy costs and interest rates changes under way in european union financial regulation including financial conglomerate and investment services directives are likely to increase pressures to consolidate across border geography and industry lines within the union resistance to external acquisitions of financial firms in france germany and italy is dwindling suggest that deals within the european union will continue the biggest mergers worldwide the governmentsponsored fusion of daiichi kangyo bank fuji bank and the industrial bank of japan made the resulting trilliondollar group nominally the largest banking organization in the world by assets it and another japanese firm created by merger as an alternative to collapse mitsubishi tokyo have kept that nations institutions at the top of asset sizing japanese supergiants and the european ones to lesser extent have emerged as the result not of strength but of weakness japanese banks in particular keep vast quantities of severely overvalued bad loans and investments on their books calling into question their actual asset sizes and making them fall behind in operating results and market value american institutions resulting from acquisitions are among the worlds largest as they were years ago the us companies fannie mae and freddie mac have grown to dominate their mortgage market without major acquisitions however by relying on governmental support general electric and berkshire hathaway often treated as nonfinancial entities appear among the largest businesses doing financial services as the result of acquisitions it is hard to compare the sizes of financial business that result from corporate deals and internal growth when they are so varied banks historically sized by assets have become more interested in revenuegenerating nonlending activities insurers share many of the assetsonhand features of banks except in their health lines yet are subject to payouts on policies and thus might be sized by assets or revenues transactionbased firms such as securities brokerdealers and mortgage bankers try to minimize their own assets at risk and thus are generally stratified by revenues or profits financial analysts often analyze businesses of any kind including financial entities by the value of their enterprise in the marketplaces for stocks and bonds what investors believe the firms activities are worth multinational operations of every large financial company worldwide can move it up or down in comparative ranking when exchange rates shift thus variety of standards are used to construct table 1 which is an approximation of the sizes of the worlds largest financial firms not all mergers succeed one prominent example called off before it happened was of deutsche bank and dresdner bank in germany that proposed merger would have created banking organization that would then have become the largest anywhere dresdner instead sold itself to the allianz insurance firm in mid2001 in transaction that weakened the new buyer other mergers here including that of citigroup noted below and abroad which observers had anticipated would become successful have not worked out such marketplace downside phenomena do not raise crs3 public policy questions if bankers accomplish the mergers within acceptable guidelines and do not cause national or international economic problems table 1 the worlds largest financial services firms 2004 name headquartered in principal businesses citigroup usa bankingsecurities general

systemic risks to their economies however they are toobigtofail governmental intervention will almost certainly occur to assure their survival in case of difficulty this is the financial situation of japan its government has propped up enormous bad loans and investments in the financial system consequentially encouraging mergers of banks and other financial companies through deposit insurance tax and regulatory mechanisms mergers of large financial institutions in the united states as for bankingbased entities fusions of us institutions beginning in the mid 1990s significantly changed the countrys financial institutions both in size and diversification of services the buoyant economic environment with its richly valued stock prices encouraged corporate deals of all kinds including in finance us banking law changed to encourage large amalgamations by market extension across america coasttocoast or regionally major financial legislation the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 pl 103 328 envisioned these mergers that act provided the statutory authority and set the framework for bank holding companies to acquire banks outside their home states and for banks to secure branches on an interstate basis as result the share of industry assets of the ten largest us banking organizations essentially doubled in the decade ending in 1999 before major statutory incentive noted below meanwhile financial industries remain much less concentrated than many others in notable deals the most prominent was the formation of citigroup which uniquely mixed domestic and international financial services of many kinds it anticipated pl 106102 discussed in more detail below in its combination of banking securities and insurance businesses into one holding company its formation predated enactment of that law that would ratify all of its deals because it had received special regulatory exemption from the federal reserve citigroup also expanded by acquisition along traditional lines including recent deals for european american bank golden state bancorp in california and banamex in mexico and into the securities and insurance businesses the complex formation of jp morgan chase included the former chemical taking over chase manhattan several securities businesses and then jp morgan before changing its name name change also occurred after wachovia absorbed first union the latter having been on valuedestroying path of multiple acquisitions insurance companies too are engaging in megamergers most notably the acquisition of american general by american international group and of lincoln re by swiss reinsurance co bank of america startled the world of finance by announcing fusion with fleetboston financial to create banking company holding 10 of us banking deposits the expanded institution is truly nationwide bank along lines envisioned in the riegleneal act of 1994 and yet touching upon that laws national deposit share limit of its 10 its announcement sparked wave of mergers among smaller crs5 bankbased companies as well as of jp morgan chase buying bank one deal flows of this as most industry sectors have accelerated into early 2005 such mergers are important steps in the evolving deregulation of the traditionally tightly limited commercial banking and insurance industries even while finance began shifting away from bank loans and deposits to securities throughout america investment banking and other securities firms have become perhaps even more important than traditional commercial banking to acquirers antitrust concerns over geographic concentration of traditional banking products remain however the justice department has required divestiture of branches as condition of some recent banking fusions antitrust concerns embody societal views that banks should provide customer services in an atmosphere of some competition customers ought not to be charged much more for or be discouraged from financial services because of declines in numbers of providers many believe that financial fusions have disadvantaged individuals and small businesses upon creation of large complex financial organizations lacking community orientation securities and insurance companies might siphon funds away from localities even further in that view expanding lines of business for us financial companies industry observers expected wave of growth and diversification among united states institutions following ongoing application of legislation enacted in 1999 the grammleachbliley act pl 106102 glba that law eases affiliations among banking insurance and securities firms in the us including those owned by foreign parties and increases diversification within individual financial organizations most prominently glba followed the fusion of travelers insurance with the bank holding company citicorp which would eventually would have to dissolve unless legislation would allow the combination of banking with insurance under one roof responding to the increased flexibility in glba institutions have been rapidly making new organizational arrangements glba has several provisions easing diversification by financial services companies structurally companies subject to bank regulation may expand their array of financial products through several options glba provides for financial holding company option and financial subsidiary option new mechanism is also in place for the federal reserve and the department of the treasury to decide what is an appropriate financial activity besides activities authorized by name in glba companies wishing to expand services through holding company framework have more latitude to do so postglba in that measure congress repealed provisions of the 1933 glasssteagall act that had long precluded the affiliations of banks and securities firms and parts of the 1956 bank holding company act that formerly precluded affiliations of banks and insurance underwriters bank holding companies wishing to become financial holding companies fhcs file notice of their election to choose new status with the fed as do foreign banks under modified procedure fhcs have since grown to prominence more than 600 domestic and foreign financial firms of all sizes have become fhcs securities crs6 based investment bank holding companies such as merrill lynch have similar potentials under securities and exchange commission regulation another way for commercial banks wishing to expand product lines directly is through the creation of financial subsidiaries fs this arrangement allows banks to own companies doing financial activities that the banks may do directly or more significantly activities that banks may not otherwise engage in directly banks wishing to do so follow the certification and notification procedures prescribed by their primary federal regulator most prominently the office of the comptroller of the currency which charters and regulates national banks the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation govern fs of state banks an institutions chartering authority whether the occ or state must also permit contemplated activities many fs are insurance agency subsidiaries an unforeseen aspect is that despite glbas encouragement fusions of insurance and banking companies have not been going on rapidly volatile often low returns on many lines of insurance underwriting policywriting and investments deter bankers the propertycasualty sector in particular remains unattractive for most fhcs not only following the events of september 2001 but also because it lacks nationally uniform system of regulation such as depository institutions enjoy the prototype fhc citigroup reversed its course to exit the propertycasualty underwriting business by divesting travelers insurance in contrast profits in the insurance field are generally greater and more predictable in the sales or agency capacity that banks often undertake through subsidiaries because policy losses do not negatively affect sales commissions insurance companies themselves have been moving very slowly into the banking field following the example of metlife becoming fhc in 2001 securities firms are conversely taking on fullservice banking especially merrill lynch which has come to have major deposits in the banks it controls under glba momentum may be gathering for both nonbanking industries increasingly to fold banks into their operations especially if economic uncertainties keep the attractiveness of federally insured deposits as safe assets high in comparison with securities competition measured as numbers of providers nationwide seems likely to continue its decline overcapacity in financial businesses became reduced over time before glba through consolidation in sectors except securities the top ten firms have increased their share of assets since the mid1990s while the number of participants shrank the number of commercial banks fell from about 25000 before world war i to less than 8000 recently securities brokers and dealers numbered more than 9500 in 1987 and have likewise declined in number investment firms however if defined to encompass investment advisors asset managers mutual funds hedge funds etc have grown over time life insurance underwriters fell from about 2200 in 1985 to less than 1600 in 2000 todays approximately 3000 property casualty insurers are generally expected to fall by perhaps onethird most us savings and loan associations vanished years ago through waves of supervisory mergers like the japanese mode that increasing size can paper over bad loans as well as by collapse fewer than 1500 such thrift institutions remain crs7 customers generally believe that enough providers to serve them at least for transacting business across political boundaries such as many insurance and securities companies have historically done even for mortgages the historical major and locationally limited products of savings and loan associations national market developed through brokers and other parties for this financial product even though the number of associations shrank sharply because of losses and failures of firms simultaneously nonfinancial providers offer new customer choices relating to financial services consumers may use financial services through software products offered by nonfinancial providers while internetonly banking has not been great success to date offerings of online access to bricksandmortar financial institutions have proven viable various kinds of businesses are also linking their products to other services directly for advertising revenues or for slice of transactions as agents such new products are increasing competition for business in this sense in other expansions into nontraditional businesses banking companies have taken on trading in the kinds of derivatives that enron marketed ubs warburg unit of diversified banking company ubs of switzerland beat out citgroup to take on enrons failed trading operations the office of the comptroller of the currency has allowed large national bank to initiate trading in energy derivatives the federal reserve has allowed fhcs to enter further into agricultural and energy related commodities derivative businesses using provision of glba known as merchant banking which allows fhcs to invest in nonfinancial businesses bank one acquired the camera and imaging businesses of the failed polaroid corporation restructuring and growth for its own sake in

organization in regulation w may restrain both risks and returns from diversification within fhcs insurance interests have contested glbas bank insurance sales provisions in court filings recently while other insurance provisions and interactions between depository institutions and commercial firms remain open in the 109th congress financial holding companies activities were critical focus of the financial services regulatory relief act of 2005 hr 3505 and the financial services regulatory relief act of 2006 s 2856 both bills were passed by their respective houses and conference is in the process of ironing out their differences the provisions of these bills address the interactions between depository institutions and commercial firms and reaffirm the regulatory authority of state insurance supervisors another bill hr 111s 98 seeks to keep bankers from moving into the field of real estate two megamergers in the commercial banking sector increased concentration of industry assets in america as whole they are bank of america purchasing fleetboston financial and jp morgan chase purchasing bank one both were presented to stockholders regulators and customers as improvements in providing bankrelated financial transactions across america spreading the businesses into many new states and increasing the sizes of the firms for efficiencies some questioned their effects on localities and smaller clients however table 3 presents pre and post acquisition amounts of corporate assets and shares of total industry assets of these three largest us banking entities

the deals had occurred at the time when bankers consolidate they typically close branches and lay off employees in reaction to such costsaving contraction many customers seek other financial providers

companies of the 87 trillion of such bank holding company assets on september 30 2003 the largest three firms held 315 adjusted by summing assets disregarding customer loss these firms would have collectively held 371 national asset share that figure represents significant increase in the asset concentration of banking services nationally industry rankings remain the same when adjusted observers believe that these megamergers will encourage wave of consolidation and thus increase resource concentration in banking for example regions financial announced its deal for union planters few months later seeking to create peer fhc this sector remains more competitive than most others in the economy however if viewed through the lenses of other antitrust criteria because of its many providers and the many financial services available from nonbank providers and over the internet risk management the dynamics of consolidations combined with the commingling of financial services have made risk management more difficult for the services providers and their regulators in the glba framework where services such as banking insurance and securities trading are provided by single institution the responsibilities of regulating financial institutions are more complicated because the regulators longer have the separation of the lines of businesses that they had in the past driven by technological advances and competition among providers new products have helped to erase the traditional lines of demarcation in financial services that the regulatory structure and markets were built upon bank regulators for example continue to lower barriers to bank entry into commodity futures and options businesses and insurance has become popular bank product rules and regulatory requirements concerning these products often fall under the supervision of multiple crs10 regulators as bankers have gotten more involved in the securities business the business has changed causing risk management issues to fall under the jurisdiction of bank regulators and the commodity futures trading commission cftc but most regulatory changes have occurred after the risks have risen sufficiently to show the deficiencies consequently regulators are now placing great emphasis on improving creditrisk management developing and improving their methods of measuring risk on transactionbytransaction basis these methods are attempts to better quantify risk and establish more formal and disciplined processes to recognize price and manage risk banking to ensure compliance to federal regulators risk management requirements bank regulators have been moving from the traditional regime of periodic examinations to inhouse examiners the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal reserve system for example have placed resident examiners in the 24 largest national banks these examiners and specialists in areas such as commercial and retail credit capital markets bank technology and asset management provide the regulators with realtime risk management information in addition the federal regulatory agencies are in the rulemaking stage of implementing the basel ii capital accord as well as modifying the existing capital accord basel i to make them more sensitive to the changing risk in banks portfolios under the basel riskbased system each assets probability of default is estimated in each line of business such as mortgages consumer loans credit card and automobile loans given the probability of default the agencies require the banks to keep the appropriate level of capital on hand similar methodology is set up for commercial paper as well as derivatives equities and bonds insurance banks and insurance and securities firms sell deferred annuities term life insurance and propertycasualty to individuals and commercial entities consequently most of these financial services providers have become proficient at managing the risk inherent in these products consolidation is taking place within each sector as banks general merge with banks and insurers with insurers however risk management in the insurance business has evolved along similar form in both the banking and insurance sectors for example risk sharing is common risk mitigating technique used by bankers and insurers the institution finances its risks either directly or through an insurer or reinsurer by selling bonds to institutional investors the payment of interest or principal depends on the occurrence or severity of the insured event finite risk insurance is an established risk management tool these are multiyear multiperil andor multitrigger coverages that combine self financed reinsurance protection and an agreement that the reinsurer will not cover losses above specified amount this risk management tool reduces earnings volatility for the insured and limits the reinsurers exposure in addition insurers and bankers are active in the credit risk transfer market where insurers are net protection sellers and banks are net protection buyers while these instruments may enhance the efficiency and stability of credit risk they tend to be complex and lack transparency consequently supervisory authorities have been introducing more complex requirements to make these transactions more transparent crs11 securities like the insurance industry with the exception of exchanges significant consolidation has not taken place in the securities industry however the development of financial instruments that incorporate characteristics of banking and insurance products has also complicated risk management in the securities industry furthermore overthecounter instruments such as swaps caps collars and floors are increasingly popular alternatives to exchangetraded instruments exchange traded instruments are standardized contracts for fixed amount delivered at specified date at particular location overthecounter instruments are custom designed to reflect specific needs of the participants these instruments are oneon one arrangements with feeearning broker who could be attached to securities firm an insurance company or bank many of these instruments are not transparent have default risk exposure and have limited risk protection and they are legally enforceable contracts risk management defined as the limitation of the risks faced by an organization due to its exposure to changes in financial market variables has been significant force behind recent changes in the business pursuits of number of the firms for example number of firms have significantly increased their involvement in proprietary trading or trading for their own accounts wide ranging trading that can range from domestic equities to derivatives to foreign securities some firms have also significantly boosted their presence in the private equity market by taking direct investment stakes in worldwide enterprises in the last few years number of firms have become brokerage intermediaries for hedge funds and in an attempt to lure back the institutional investor trades number of securities firms have become increasingly willing to commit their own capital to help facilitate the institutions large block trades recently the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq exchange each merged with electronicbased securities trading rival and due in part to concerns that the consolidations could provide the two exchanges with an opportunity to boost their trade transaction fees number of wall street firms have acquired stakes in smaller rival regional stock exchanges to reduce the risk of higher transaction cost from the larger exchanges for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30516
