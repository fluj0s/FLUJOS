science and industry division summary the saltonstallkennedy act established fund that among other things has supported fishery research nd development projects with funding awarded annually on competitive basis recent congressional earmarks have preempted the competitive process for awarding funding for industry pr ojects this report will be updated as this issue evolves the saltonstallkennedy sk act as am ended 15 usc 713c3 established fund known as the sk fund that the secr etary of commerce uses to finance projects and cooperative agreements for fishery research and developm ent under this authority projects or cooperative agreemen ts are selected annually on competitive basis to assist noaa fisheries previously known as the na tional marine fish eries service in addressing concerns re lated to us commercial and recreational fisheries the sk fund is capitalized through annual transfers under permanent ppropriation to the secretary of commerce of 30 of the gross receipts coll ected by the secretary of agriculture under the customs laws on imports of fish and fish products1 the objective of the sk program is to ddress the needs of fishing communities in providing economic benefits fo r rebuilding and maintaining sustainable fisheries and in dealing with the impacts of conser vation and management measures2 the sk program has become very important in addressing issues of immediate concern to the commercial fishing industry by producing many new gear innovations mark ets and management options issues addressed have included fish harvestin g seafood quality improvements domestic and foreign market development fficiency and productivity improvements and the costsprofitability of potentia l fishing industry

substantially during the life of this program with almost 80 million currently being transferre d annually to the secretary of commerce table 1 summarizes program funding in 1980 congress enacted formal program authority to fund fishing industry developm ent projects and expanded this authority in 1983 establishing minimum percentage of sk funds to be used to provide financial assistance to projects the balance of sk funds were to be used by the secretary of commerce for national program of fisherie s research and development to address aspects of us fisheries not adequately ddressed by

minimum amount 50 after fy1980 and 60 after fy1983 specified by law for industry projects for example in fy2002 slightly more than 791 million in customs duty receipts were transferred to the department of commerce from the department of agriculture of this amount pl 10777 transferred 68 million to noaas orf account for necessary expenses of activities authorized by law for the national

congressional earmarks designated funds for specific activities outside the regular competitive award process and the competitive program was cancelled for fy20045 similar situation occurred in fy2003 regardless of the merits of the activities funded through the congre ssional earmarks some elements of the commercial fishing industry ve expressed frustration when the competitive process is circumvented and projects are funded out side competitive selection process6 since the sk program requires periodi c reauthorization recent congressional oversight hearings have been held to review the departments rationale for allocating sk funds between industry projects and agency base funding how specific project areas to be funded are selected how this program is administered and at what cost how the results of funded projects are reviewe d disseminated and used and to what extent the program continues to meet its statutory objectives additional questions include whether the

industry projects conti nues to be useful how the utility of the sk program authority may have changed over time and whether critical research might be done by industry if it were not funded by the sk program criticism of sk program management generally comes from elements of the commercial fishing industry some critics of sk fund management question whether the administration of both regulation and research within the same agency raises questions about objectivity they suggest that researcher s might be hesitant to criticize the agency for its regulatory actions because they might lose access to future or continued project funding others suggest that the selection ie restriction of what types of projects will be funded also may administr atively earmark funds such as occurred in fy2003 when about half of all industry project funding 5 million of an anticipated 103 million was identified for direction to atlantic salmon aquaculture development others suggest that the narrow agency identification of project s that would be funded in fy2003 actually prompted the subsequent cong ressional earmarks to specify pr ojects that are to be funded the following chronology presents
