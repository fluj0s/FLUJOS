public finance government and finance division summary perspectives on international competitiveness differ so its not surprising that tax proposals for improving competitiveness vary also but economics is famous for being the dismal science and its reputation is welldeserved in this case regardless of how competitivene ss is defined economic analysis suggests that most tax measures can do little to enhance it indeed many of the tax provisions designed to improve us performance in the world economy could actually reduce us economic welfare this report will not be updated the firmlevel perspective the effects of foreign competition are probably most visible and are doubtless felt most directly at the individualfirm level for example imagine the case of us manufacturing corporation whose market share is rapidly shrinking because of competition from lowpriced imports the companys owners managers and employees probably define competitiveness as their ability to withstand the threat of foreign competition and if asked they would probably recommend some sort of tax benefit targeted at their industry measures such as favorable depreciation rules for the types of machines the industry uses or tax credits for consumers who buy the industrys product indeed economic analysis predicts that such measures might well improve the position of the us companies in the targeted industry their costs would fall because their taxes have introducing the possibility of reduced prices larger market shares and more jobs but here is one place that economic theory earns its sobriquet it predicts that the effects of targeted tax benefit will ripple through the economy and ultimately confound the policys competitiveness goals the reason is this because the nations resources are limited narrowly available tax benefit will to large extent simply reshuffle the way in which the nations limited resources are employed resources that taxes draw into the favored sector of the economy must be pulled out of some other use and while exports in the favored industry may rise or competing imports fall exports in other sectors of the economy will fall while jobs may be saved or even grow in the targeted sector they probably will ultimately be lost elsewherehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20495crs2 economic theory goes even further not only are targeted tax benefits of limited use when the whole economy is considered they also reduce the nations economic welfare in number of ways first economics predicts that with few exceptions the interference of taxes in how the economys resources are deployed diminish the nations economic vitality market forces not tax rules are usually the best way to guarantee that resources are used efficiently for example tax benefit for the company in the preceding example might boost that companys output but that increased output would be produced by resources diverted from sectors of the economy where they were more productive second if some or all of the tax benefit is passed on to foreign consumers in the form of lower prices for us goods the united states registers worsening of its terms of trade it obtains fewer foreign goods for the american products it sells the national level moving beyond the individualfirm level policymakers and others may have different perspective and view competitiveness as the internation performance of the economy as whole from this vantage point more widelyavailable tax benefit may seem more promising than narrowlytargeted tax incentive for example it is sometimes argued that us firms in general have higher cost of capital than do competing companies from japan and other developed countries us businesses it is argued must pay more for the use of investment funds than foreign firms perhaps because of the relatively low us savings rate tax incentives for saving and investment measures such as tax cut for capital gains expanded individual retirement accounts iras and investment tax credits have thus been proposed partly as way to reduce the us cost of capital and improve the competitive position of us firms in general economists are generally skeptical of the results the principal reason is that both theory and evidence suggest that tax policy is relatively powerless to affect saving and since the cost of capital is heavily dependent on the availability of savings tax incentives apparently can do little to reduce the cost of capital for the economy in general taxes and saving are the key to number of controversies in tax economics so it is worth taking brief closer look at the relationship between the two economic theory provides clear answer about whether individuals reduce or increase their saving in response to various tax benefits they may increase their saving because the tax benefit increases the aftertax rate of return on saving or they may reduce it because they have more money and need to save less given the ambiguity of theory the empirical evidence is of paramount importance and most analyses of the data show little or response by private savers to tax benefits thus tax benefits probably do little to promote capital formation and probably do not reduce the cost of capital further if tax incentives for saving and investment are financed by reduction in the federal budget surplus or an increase in the deficit the impact on total national saving government saving plus private saving is unambiguous national saving is reduced but what if one looks beyond exports and imports and adopts broader definition of competitivenes s defining it as how us economic growth compares to that of other developed countries can tax incentives for saving and investment lead to permanent increase in economic growth for example one study compared growth rates across different countries and found that the nations with higher growth rates tend to have higher levels of investment in equipment however large part of the correlation may well behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20495crs3 1 the study is summarized in delong bradford and lawrence summers equipment investment and economic growth quarterly journal of economics v 106 may 1991 p 445502caused by only few countries and the theoretical reasons such relationship might exist are not well understood thus the results of the study must be viewed with caution1 standard economic growth theory holds that an increase in saving cannot lead to permanent increase in the economys growth rate although it can increase the level of output briefly the reasoning is this increased saving expands the capital stock which initially leads to higher growth rate however as the capital stock grows more and more of the resulting increases in output must be devoted to simply ensuring that the larger capital stock grows at its old rate at the same time fundamental principal of economics is that the product of additional capital declines as more capital is combined with given amount of labor ultimately these two trends collide at the point where any increase in saving must be entirely devoted to ensuring that the new larger capital stock grows at its old rate the rate at which it grew before the increase in saving as result in the long run the economys growth rate returns to the steady state that existed before saving increased in sum economic analysis suggests that the nations economic welfare is maximized if tax policy distorts market choices as little as possible not attempting to direct resources into the export sector or into importcompeting sectors and it predicts that generally available savings and investment incentives probably do little to improve competitiveness but economic theory is not completely negative on the ability of tax policy to improve economic competitiveness in the us context first it suggests that in certain exceptional cases tax incentives that interfere with resource allocation may improve rather than reduce economic efficiency part of the enhanced efficiency may be registered in the international trade sectors of the economy for example theory suggests that the market mechanism may not work smoothly in the case of research and development rd if left to their own devices firms would probably underinvest in research and development compared to the amount of investment that is warranted by its benefit to society thus tax incentive for rd investment may enhance us economic welfare part of the improvement may consist of higher productivity in the export or importcompeting sectors second way tax policy might enhance competitiveness is by its impact on the budget surplus or deficit first there is firm link between the size of the budget surplus or of the budget deficit in years when spending is greater than revenues on the one hand and the size of the trade deficit on the other it works like this reduction in the budget surplus puts upwards pressure on us real interest rates compared to rates elsewhere in the world the resulting inflow of foreign capital drives up the exchange rate which reduces exports increases imports and expands the trade deficit second while private saving is generally unresponsive to changes in taxes an increase in the budget surplus increases national saving and the amount of capital available for private investment while it is true that an increase in saving cannot permanently increase longterm growth it can increase growth in the nearterm as well as the level of output thus the one unambiguous contribution tax policy could make toward improving us competitivenesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20495crs4 is probably by increasing the budget surplus or reducing the budget deficit during years of budget deficits
