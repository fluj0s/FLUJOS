orders that effectively overrule permit issued by state under its epa approved air program the court said yes though only by 54 margin in engine manufacturers assn v south coast air qua lity management district the court held that the caa preempts state from compelling local vehicle fleet operators to buy new vehicles from the states list of lowemission models and dept of transportation v public citizen spoke to whether dot safety regulations whose promulgation allowed mexican trucks great er range in the united states must be preceded by environmental analyses unde r the caa and national environmental policy act because dot lacks discretion to prevent the truck movement said the court the added emissions from that move ment did not have to be considered the other decided cases are first south florida water management district v miccosukee tribe of indians holding that point source of discharges into us navigable waters must obtain clean water act permit despite the fact that the point source itself did not add the pollutants in the discharged water second norton v southern utah wilderness alliance clarified the availability of judicial review of federal agency

conservation v epa the broad concern of alaska dec is epas authority to oversee state administration of the clean air act caa and in particular to enforce the act contrary to state determinations the precise issue is whether epa may issue caa noncompliance orders to company where such orders effectively overrule state permit issued to the company under the st ates epaapproved caa implementation plan the caa provisions at issue are section 113a53 epas general enforcement authority and section 1674 its specific enforcement authority for prevention of significant deterioration psd areas5 alaska

electric generators it wished to install satisfied the caas requirement that best available contro l technology bact be installed epa disagreed however the state agency issued the psd permit anyway prompting orders from epa that prevented the mining company from installing the new generators until it demonstrated to epa compliance with bact the state and the company then challenged the epa orders in the ninth circuit that court ruled for epa holding that the orders were within its caa authority6 the supreme court affirmed 547 epa had rationally c onstrued the acts text the majority said the enforcement author ity granted epa in sections 113a5 and 167 is capacious and though epas many guidance pr onouncements asserting oversight authority over states are not entitled to deference since they are not legally binding they still warrant respect the court majority rejected alaska decs argument that epa could only insist that the state make some bact determination not review its reasonableness once made still the majority admonished epa must accord the states bact determination considerable deference only when the states determination is not based on reasoned analysis may epa step in to ensure that caa requirements are met the agen cy concluded the court adhered to that limited role here the court majority also rejected alaska decs argument that even though epa may review state determinations for reasoned analysis it may only enforce before state agencies and state courts federal courts have jurisdic tion also said the majority as is typical for federal enforcement of federal statutes clean air act preemption of state efforts to lower vehicle emissions engine manufacturers assn v south coast air quality mgmt district the issue before the court here was whether the caa preempts rules of state agency requiring that when local operators of vehicle fleets buy fleet vehicles they buy only those vehicles the district has designated ba sed on their low emissions the south coast air quality management district in california encompasses an area including angeles with ma jor air pollution problems the district adopted six rules each mandating the bovenoted vehicle purchase limitation for particular type of fleet opera tor some public some private four of the rules require the purchase or lease of alternativefuel ve hicles the other two the purchase or lease of either alternative fuel vehicles or vehicles that meet emission standards set by state agency before the district court trade associations argued that the fleet rules violated caa section 209a8 which prohibits states from adopting standards relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehi cles the fleet purchasing ruleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32569crs3 9 158 f supp 2d 1107 cd cal 2001 10

holding that section 209a only bars the states from applying emission standards to manuf acturers not purchasers9 moreover the court said the caa explicitly protects the authority of states to regulate air pollution10 the ninth circuit affirmed without discussion11 in the supreme court the united states f iled an amicus brief on the side of the engine manufacturers association arguing for preemption this position prevailed 8112 based on the ordinary meaning of caa section 209a the court held that the provision precluded stat emission standards for both the manufacture and purchase of vehicles although the court di d not declare that all the fleet rules were preempted it said that it appears likely at least certain aspects of the fleet rules are preempted13 the court vacated the judgment below and remanded the case due to remaining questions as to the appli cation and scope of the fleet rules legal cause under the national environmental policy act and clean air act department of transportation v public citizen this case concerns three motor carrier safety regulations issued in 2002 by the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa within dot together the regulations will permit mexicodomiciled motor carriers to operate within the united states beyond the current limited border z ones the regulations carry out us obligations under the north ameri can free trade agreement nafta the case turns on fmcsas determination that there was need for environmental analysis of two of the th ree safety regulati ons under the national environmental policy act n epa beyond preliminary environmental assessment and need for any environmental analysis at all of the third regulation petitioners environmental groups and truc kers unions claimed that fm csas failure to prepare full environmental impact statement eis addressing the environmental effects of increased crossborder operations of mexican motor carriers violated nepa they argued that issuance of the regulations was the legal cause of the increased cross border operations since appr opriation act provisions barre d registration of mexican motor carriers for travel in the interior us until such issuance petitioners also asserted that fmcsas failure to make conformity dete rmination to ensure that the regulations are consistent with caa state implementation plans violated that act14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32569crs4 15 316 f3d 1002 9th cir 2003 16 nepa 1022c 42 usc 1022c 17 124 s ct 2204 2004 18 40 cfr 93153bthe ninth circuit said that fmcsa had been arbitrary and capricious in refusing to do the nepa and caa analyses15 as to nepa the regulations constituted major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment the nepa phrase triggering federal agencys duty to prepare an eis16 for example fmcsa had failed the cour t said even to consider whether any negative health effects could be associated with the increased diesel exhaust emissions resulting from the regulations as to the caa the court held that the regulations did not fall within regulatory exemptions from the conformity determination requireme nt the court instructed fmcsa to prepare full eis and caa conformity determination for all three regulations the supreme court unanimously reversed17 it found that the presidents decision pursuant to nafta to lift the longstanding moratorium on mexican motor carrier certification not the fmcsas sa fety regulations wa s responsible for potential emission changes once the moratorium was lifted and the safety regulations promulgated the fmcsa had choice under the governing statute but to issue registrations to qualifying moto r carriers an agencys actions do not constitute legally relevant cause of an effect if the agency is unable to prevent that effect due to its limited statutory authority since there was not reasonably close causal relationship between the regulations and the environmental effects fmcsa was not required to consider thos effects in its nepa documents as regards the caa the court held that full conformity determination also was not required epa regulations say that conformity determination is required where the total of direct and indirect emissions in nonattain ment or maintenance area caused by federal action would equal or exceed specified level18 the increased mexican truck emissions are not direct result of fmcsas regulations said the court because they will not occur at the same time or place as the promulgation of the regulations epas finition of direct emissions nor are the emissions an indirect result because fmcsa cannot practicably control nor maintain control over them epas defin ition of indirect emissions therefore it was unnecessary for fmcsa to consider the increased emissions from mexican trucks in deciding whether to c onduct full conformity determination discharge permits under the clean water act south florida water mgmt district v miccosukee tribe of indians this case addresses the backbone of the clean water act cwa regulatory program its requirement that the discharge of pollutant from point source into navigable

requirement when the point source itself did not add the pollutants in the discharged water the south florida water management di strict operates pumping station that receives water from canal draining large mixeduse area then pumps the water into an undeveloped wetland both areas are hi storically part of the everglades the tribe and an environmental group asserted that the dist rict was violating the cwa by operating the pump an admitted point source wit hout npdes permit the district responded that because the discharge of pollutant that requires permit is defined in the cwa as any addition of pollutant to navigable waters20 the pumping station was not covered since it did not itself add the pollutants to the pumped water the indian tribe won in the district court21 discharge of pollutants for cwa purposes existed the court said because water containing pollutants was being pumped to separate water body to which it would not ve flowed naturally that the pumping station did not itself add the po llutants to the pumped water is irrelevant to whether discharge occurred the eleventh circuit affirmed on the same rationale22 the supreme court unanimously rej ected the districts argument23 affirming the decision below24 npdes coverage it held is tr iggered notwithstanding that the point source did not itself generate the po llutant having answered the question on which the court granted certiorari however the court proceeded to address two others the first was the unitary waters argument pressed chiefly by the united states as amicus on the districts side in determining whether there has been an addition of pollutant the united states contended all naviga ble waters in the nation should be regarded as one so vi ewed moving water from one water body to another is not an addition hence re quires permit the court was highly skeptical of this argument but left the issue open for resolution on remand to the appellate c ourt below the second argument addressed by the court and not in the petition was the districts contention agreed to by the united states that the canal drainage area and the wetland are not distinct bodies of water at all but are hydrologically connected parts of single water body npde s permit is required to move water from one area of water body to another this time the court appeared amenable to the argument but finding that factual issues remained unresolved remanded for further factual development by the district court httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32569crs6 25 5 usc 7061 26 flpma 603c 43 usc 1782c 27 301 f3d 1217 10th

management norton v southern utah wilderness alliance this case raises an important question as to the availability of judicial review under the administrative procedure act pa the issue for the court

flpma landuse plans regarding orvs and 3 take hard look at whether under nepa the agency should do supplemental environmental an alysis for areas where orv use had increased the district cour t rejected use of section 706 1 for these purposes but divided tenth circuit reversed27 regarding the first claim for example the tenth circuit found that despite bl ms discretion in deciding how its nonimpairment duty would be carried out the duty itself is i ndisputably nondiscretionary this satisfies the unlawfully withheld phrase of 7061 and confers subject matter jurisdiction on the reviewing court the supreme court reversed again28 unanimously finding against apa jurisdiction section 7061 review is ava ilable it held in only tightly defined circumstance when there is discrete agency action that federal agency is required to take29 this requirement is fatal said the court to plaintiffs claims as to the first claim the court cannot order blm to manage orvs in accordance with flpmas nonimpairment mandate since that mandate leaves the agency much discretion moreover plain tiffs allege only general program deficiency charge that lacks the specificity required for 7061 review plaintiffs second claim that blm failed to carry out its land use plans does not satisfy the required to take prong of the section 7061 availability rule land use plans under flpma act only to guide and c onstrain actions but do not at least in the usual case prescribe them30 projections of agency action in land use plans such as the one before the court are not legally binding commitment

whether breach of nepa duty is actionable under section 7061 it concluded because he re there was nepa duty in the first place the eis supplementation demanded by plaintiffs is necessary only if there remains major federal action to occur althoug h the approval of the blm land use plan in this case is major federal action that ac tion is now complete there is ongoing federal action that could require supplemental eis analysis ii cases accepted during the 20032004 term for decision during the 20042005 term contribution actions under the superfund act cooper industries inc v aviall services inc this case deals with the availability of contribution actions under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund act by wa of background contribution actions are those brought by liable parties often in the tort context asserting that some or all of the partys liability should be reimbursed by other liable pa rties the specific issue presented by cooper is whether cercla section 113f131 the authority for contribution actions under that statute is available when civil action has been brought by the federal government that is the united states has not ordered the party seeking contribution to clean up under cercla section 10632 or reimburse the united states cleanup costs under cercla section 107a33 aviall bought contaminated property fro m cooper after the state ordered aviall to clean up it began to do so impor tant here the federa l epa never contacted aviall or designated the property as conta minated to recover some of its cleanup costs aviall sued cooper seeking c ontribution under cercla and damages under state law theories under cercla both aviall and cooper ar liable parties both the district court and fifth ci rcuit panel 21 held that under cercla 113f1 the liable party seeking contribu tion must have pending or adjudged federal cleanup or costrecovery order against it the banc fifth circuit reversed over threejudge dissent asserting that the great majority of circuits disagreed with the panel majority34 acknowledging that reasonabl minds could disagree it found that the most reasonable interpretation of section 113f1 was that it allowed liable party to sue for contribution under fe deral law at any time not only during or following the words of 113f1 cleanup or cost recovery action

states filed an amicus brief disputing the banc d ecision and urging reversal the case has been set for oral argument on october 6 2004 pesticide act preemption of state tort law claims bates v dow agrosciences llc the issue before the supreme court in this case is whether and if so to what extent the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra or pesticide act preempts state tort law cl aims here for crop damage the pivotal fifra provision is section 136vb36 which seeks through preemption to ensure uniform nationwide approach to pesticide labeling it declares succinctly that state shall not impose any requirements for beling or packaging in addition to or different from those re quired under this act dow agrosciences llc produces strongarm herbicide for controlling certain weeds around peanut crops strongarm is properly registered with the us epa under fifra in 2000 dow began to receive letters from peanut growers contending that the herbicide was highly toxic stunted plant growth and failed to control weeds in peanut crops the letters threatened to sue but dow struck first by filing suit for declaratory judgment against 29 of the growers dow sought among other things judicial declaration that fifra preempted the farmers state law claims the district court endorse d all of dows arguments37 neither the growers breach of implied and express warranty claims nor their texas deceptive trade practices act and fraud claims nor their negligence claims escape section 136vbs preemptive reach though the growers assert that their claims are based on remarks made by dow representatives rather than strongarms label such remarks mostly restated label information thus the grower s claims essentially challenge the label seeking to impose precisely what 136vb preempts requirements for labeling in addition to or different from those required under fifra in addition the breach of warranty claims are foreclosed by strongarms label provisions which disclaim any implied warranty and provide only limited express warranty the fifth circuit affirmed38 first contrary to the growers argument state labeling requirements related to product effectiveness are within the scope of section 136vb that epa has elected not to impose labeling regulation as to product effectiveness does not avoid preemption of claim that has the effect of imposing labeling requirements second the grower s claims for breach of warranty fraud deceptive trade practices act violation defective design and negligence arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32569crs9 39 124 s ct 2903 2004sufficiently related to the content of the strongarm label that judgment against dow here would induce it to alter the label again that is what section 136vb forbids on petition for certiorari the united states was invited by the supreme court to offer its views its amicus brief argued that the fifth circuit ruled correctly in finding fifra preemption of the growers st ate law tort claims and that review by the court was unwarranted notwithstanding the court granted certiorari on june 28 200439 oral argument has not yet been scheduled iii comments the cases decided by the court in th 20032004 term and those to be argued next term present diverse picture unifying substantive theme is apparent further why some of the cases were of interest to the court is perplexing many of them involve issues of narrow focus with accompanying split in the circuit court decisions there are commonalities however first all seven cases raise statutory rather than constitutional issues or mostly so in the two preemption cases engine manufacturers assn and bates this is principal reason why there is unifying theme among the cases statutor issues tend to be specifi c to the statute under which they arise in this regard norton may be the most important of the cases since the statute construed there the administrative procedure act is the basic charter for accessing judicial review of federal agency action and the issue in the case when agency inaction is reviewable is ubiquitous one in administrative law second in six of the seven cases all except bates the decision of the court below adopted the more envi ronmental side of the argument given that the supreme court typically does not take cases in order to affirm this initially caused some concern in the environmentalist camp that the courts conservative bloc was set to reign in environmental programs th results in the five cases decided so far have indeed largely tilted against the environmental positions advanced but not exclusively so nor were the conservative justices alone in their votes in three of the five decisions the nonenvironmen tal position was endor sed by the court unanimously dept of transportation and norton or by 81 engine manufacturers assn and in the nepa rulings dept of transportation and norton the decisions merely continue an unbroken st ring of defeats for the environmental position over three decades of supreme court nepa litigation third in all four cases in which the united states is not party engine manufacturers assn miccosukee tribe cooper industries and bates and thus is under litigation constraint to adopt particular position it has filed amicus briefs urging the none nvironmental position finally three of the seven cases inquire into the nature of the federalstate relationship alaska dec engine manufacturers assn and bates presumablyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32569crs10 40 for the constitutional side of the courts interest in environmental federalism see robert

that are preemption cases engine manufacturers assn and bates again instances where the united states is not party the department of justice also took the position that the federal law prevailed thus in the cases reviewed here there has been consistent endorsement of the federal side of the federalism argument by both court and administration at least in the case of the administration this profederal pa ttern may reflect the tension in the two preemption cases between two administra tion priorities shifting power to the states and reducing regulatory burdens and the administrations decision to go with the latter here
