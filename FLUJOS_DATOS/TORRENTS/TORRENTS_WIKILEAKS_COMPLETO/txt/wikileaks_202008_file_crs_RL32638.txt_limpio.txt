objective became in the words of us trade representative robert b zoellick to fight terrorism by spreading the message of prosperity and democracy throughout the world1 one way the bush administration chose to spread that message was through proposed middle east free trade agreement mefta the mefta initiative was proposed by president bush on may 9 2003 and was slated for completion within decade ie by around 2013 more detail on the bush administrations plan was revealed on june 23 2003 at the world economic forum in jordan when us trade representative zoellick spoke on the conceptual details ustr zoellick outlined sixsteps for middle east entities wishing to enter into free trade agreement with the united states the purpose of this report is to describe mefta in terms of 1 its impetus 2 its major elements 3 background trade data 4 details and 5 arguments for each at the back of this report are five tables table 1 outlines the basic elements of mefta table 2 tracks the steps each entity has taken toward free trade agreement with the united states wto membership eligibility for the generalized system of preferences and achievement of three types of agreements trade investment framework agreements bilateral investment treaties and free trade agreements tables 3 and 4 list for each entity us import and export totals and shares of key commodities traded table 5 shows the current value and share of world and us foreign direct investment respectively in various entities impetus for the initiative mefta captured an idea that was already being debated in washington using trade as tool to fight terrorism for example in february 2003 report by policy analyst edward gresser argued that the muslim world had been the blank spot on the us trade agenda fact that risked undermining rather than supporting the war on terrorism gresser pointed to an economic crisis affecting almost all of the western muslim states which have seen their share of world trade and 1 man of many missions business week march 31 2003 p 9495 crs2 investment collapse since 1980 resulting in stagnant growth and falling income with social consequences of unemployment political tension and rising appeal for religious extremists2 gresser argued that strategic initiative for the muslim3 world could end or at least ease the tilt gresser called for an initiative analogous to the programs now available for central america the andean nations and africa in order to possibly spark growth and creation and so reduce the attraction of radicalism and religious fundamentalism another article written by policy analyst brink lindsey of the cato institute argued for two concepts the first was an additional shorterterm program to include temporary dutyfree quotafree access to the us market for exports of selected muslim countries the shorter term program he declared would give tangible dramatic proof of us commitment to the region thereby providing an impetus for the longer arduous process of negotiating free trade agreements the second concept lindsey called for was the expansion of the definition of middle east beyond the traditional geographic area to include other countries with geopolitical significance4 more recently the 911 commission report affirmed these ideas it included recommendation which reads comprehensive us strategy to counter terrorism should include economic policies that encourage development more open societies and opportunities for people to improve the lives of their families and to enhance prospects for their childrens future5 major elements the bush administrations mefta plan in aiming to support economic development job creation and political and humanitarian changes reflects elements of the two articles referred to above primary focus the primary focus of the bush administrations plan would be on the longterm establishment of middle east free trade area by around 2013 shortrun trade preference program the bush administrations shortrun trade preference component would be to continue the generalized system of preferences gsp currently 2 gresser edward blank spot on the map how trade policy is working against the war on

framework agreements tifas 3 bilateral investment treaties bits and 4 free trade agreements ftas with the united states once country has entered into an fta with the united states other neighboring countries could achieve some fta tariff benefits by cooperatively producing with two or more countries contributing to the same product with that country definition of middle east the bush

components trade preferences b steps or activities leading toward free trade agreements c requirements for country eligibility and d time lines for each initiative an overview chart outlining these components is included as table 1 trade preference components in the short run the bush administration would continue the generalized system of preferences which includes dutyfree entry to the us market for at least 3500 products from 140 developing countries the following middle east countries are currently eligible for gsp benefits egypt iraq jordan lebanon oman yemen algeria and tunisia remaining countries covered by this report are not eligible for gsp benefits of those not eligible some are longer considered developing11 others do not meet the bush administrations eligibility requirements gsp limits country participation on the basis of percapita income and b participation in the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec it also limits product preferences on the basis of import sensitivity12 steps or activities leading toward free trade agreements13 the bush administrations proposed program consists of six steps which each country may take culminating in free trade agreement with the united states 10 usitc dataweb 11 for example bahrain graduated from the gsp program on january 1 2006 12 only eight out of the 20 entities covered by the two middle east trade initiatives are currently eligible for gsp as indicated in table 2 gsp provisions us trade act of 1974 as amended 19usc 2461 specifically exclude from tariff preferences certain textiles and apparel the second most important export category from these middle east entities watches footwear handbags luggage flat goods eg wallets and briefcases work gloves and other leather wearing apparel steel glass and electronics as result for the 20 middle east entities covered by this report imports under gsp represent only fraction 02 for 2005 of all imports from these entities 13 these steps are taken from office of the us trade representative ustr trade facts june 23 2003 additional explanatory material is taken from office of the ustr transcript of background press conference call to

briefing be identified only as senior administration official crs8 table 1 lists each country included in the ustr definition of middle eastnorth africa and for each country indicates which steps it has already fulfilled the six steps are first world trade organization wto membership to promote integration into the world trading system nine middle east entities are not yet members of the wto the gaza strip and the west bank iran iraq lebanon saudi arabia syria yemen algeria and libya second the continuation of gsp discussed in the section above third trade and investment framework agreements tifas to establish framework for expanding trade and for resolving outstanding disputes six middle east entities do not have tifas with the united states cyprus the gaza strip and the west bank iran lebanon syria and libya fourth bilateral investment treaties bits oblige governments to treat foreign investors fairly and to offer them legal protections equal to those afforded domestic investors bits make the business climate more attractive to us companies the following 14 middle east entities do not have bits with the united states cyprus the gaza strip and the west bank iran iraq kuwait lebanon oman qatar saudi arabia syria the united arab emirates yemen algeria and libya fifth free trade agreements ftas typically to remove tariff and nontariff barriers to trade across all sectors currently four countries in the middle east israel jordan morocco and bahrain have congressionallyapproved free trade agreements with the united states in addition the united states has completed an fta with oman and is negotiating an fta with the uae it has suspended preliminary negotiations which were underway with egypt over human rights issues the bush administration is considering including cumulation clauses which would afford subregional groups within the middle east some eligibility to export goods to the united states tarifffree or at reduced tariffs stipulations would likely require that 1 those goods be produced in concert with neighboring country which already has free trade agreement and that 2 the exported products meet rules of origin requirements14 under the bush administrations initiative now that the ftas have been implemented with morocco and bahrain for example other north african countries might be able to dock with and coproduce with morocco and other gulf countries could dock with and coproduce with bahrain so for example to qualify for tariff benefits under usbahrain fta products could be jointly produced by bahrain and qatar or oman or the united arab emirates or combination of the named countries15 the program whereby jordan egypt the 14 us department of state middle east trade initiative office of the ustr february 27 2003 15 office

authorized gain tariff relief by coproducing with israel under the usisrael free trade agreement is an example of this concept16 sixth the final step in the bush administrations plan is tradecapacity building to help countries realize more fully the benefits of open markets eg build the legal entrepreneurial infrastructure the middle east partnership initiative mepi aims to help allocate structural adjustment funding to partner countries to help ease the burden of free trades impact on local industries the initiative is also aimed at increasing educational opportunities strengthening civil society and rule of law and supporting small business the mepi aims to help target more than 1 billion of annual funding from various government agencies and spur partnerships with private organizations and businesses that support trade and development it has received an estimated 294 million in funding between fy2002 and fy2005 for 2006 the bush administration has requested an 125 million17 meanwhile for 2005 total funding for us trade capacity building reached 13 billion of which 236 million or 18 went to middle east countries18 requirements for eligibility the bush administrations plan is open to those peaceful countries that seek an increased trade relationship with the united states and b all those countries that are prepared to participate in economic reform and liberalization eligible countries must among other things 1 be prepared to participate in economic reform and liberalization and 2 not participate in primary secondary or tertiary boycott of israel19 15 continued representative jordanian minister of trade salah bashir movenpick hotel dead sea june 23 2003 16 under this legislation goods wholly produced by the gaza strip or the west bank

time line the bush administration aims for middle east free trade area by about 2013 cathi novelli ustr chief negotiator on ftas with countries in the middle east until the fall of 2005 has indicated that the overall objective of the mefta exercise is not to meet the deadline which she calls ambitious but to push the reform process in the region along20 progress so far according to the bush administration each of the steps listed above would aim to address political economic and humanitarian objectives in order to help middle east countries to become sustainable trading partners21 the hope is that each of the successive steps involved in negotiating tifas bits and ftas might help induce internal changes in the laws and regulations of the various countries since the mefta program was announced in 2003 saudi arabia has joined the wto and the united states has negotiated new tifas with seven countries kuwait oman saudi arabia the united arab emirates yemen qatar and iraq see table 2 thus almost threequarters of the mefta entities 14 now have tifas with the united states other countries with which it already has tifas are bahrain egypt jordan israel algeria morocco and tunisia in addition since the mefta program was announced bit between the united states and jordan has been fully approved as result the united states currently has bits with more than onequarter 6 out of 20 of the mefta entities other countries with which the united states already had bits were bahrain egypt jordan morocco and tunisia finally since the mefta program was announced the united states has completed bilateral trade agreements with three countries morocco bahrain and oman the president signed implementing legislation for the morocco fta in august 2004 pl 108302 and for the bahrain fta on january 11 2006 pl 109169 an fta with oman was signed by the two countries on january 19 2006 and awaits congressional action ftas were already in effect for israel and jordan in addition an fta with the united arab emirates is under negotiation thus currently onequarter five mefta entities have signed trade agreements with the united states one of those awaits final

president bush may 9 2003 crs11 completion by the negotiators seventh fta under negotiation with egypt has been suspended over human rights issues in egypt22 current congressional issues in may of 2006 the national labor committee nlc nonprofit organization that works for worker rights around the world released 161page report allegedly documenting sweatshop conditions in 28 manufacturing operations in jordan where clothing is produced primarily for export to the united states the nlc report says that tens of thousands of foreign guest workers who entered employment willingly were subsequently stripped of their passports and trapped in involuntary servitude sewing clothing for walmart gloria vanderbilt target kohls thalia sodi for kmart victorias secret llbean and others23 the report has raised congressional concerns first about the treatment of workers producing us imports from jordan whose fta with the united states has been in effect since 2001 second it has raised concerns about the treatment of workers who are or will be producing us imports from other mefta countries for which ftas have been or are in the process of being negotiated andor implemented congressional concern over mefta labor conditions is focusing in part on the labor provisions of the ftas in most meftaftas the only labor provision which is enforceable through dispute resolution procedures is that each country agrees to effectively enforce its own labor laws in manner affecting trade some mefta country labor laws do not cover foreign guest workers who typically make up large portions of workers employed in multinational manufacturing operations producing for export in mefta countries guest workers are technically not covered by jordans labor laws for example according to country reports on human rights practices 2005 however under the usjordan fta which differs from more recent meftaftas all labor provisions are technically enforceable including the provision that the parties reaffirm their obligations as members of the ilo as members of the ilo all countries are committed to uphold the eight core labor standards jordan has ratified both core labor standards pertaining to the elimination of forced or compulsory labor the jordanian government has reportedly begun to take steps to address the violations alleged in the nlc report and has invited the nlc and the ilo to jordan and formed nine special inspection teams to visit factories cited in the nlc report24 22 the realities of exporting democracy the washington post january 25 2006 p a1 23 national

countries and specifically oman was addressed at senate finance committee mock markup of the usoman fta implementation bill on may 18 2006 with the unanimous adoption of an amendment the amendment offered by senator kent conrad would prohibit any products made in oman with slave labor including under sweatshop conditions so egregious as to be tantamount to slave labor or with the benefit of human trafficking from benefitting from the agreement representatives of the administration which is not obligated to accept amendments to draft implementing legislation responded that while they would consider the amendment they had some concerns with the concept oman has promised to issue royal decrees and ministerial decisions to strengthen the countrys labor laws in response to earlier congressional concerns by later than october 31 200625 while some republicans argue that oman needs time to craft new laws with technical support from the ilo some democrats argue for changes in omani laws before the usoman fta implementing legislation is considered by congress26 for more details on this issue see the current issues section of proposed usoman free trade agreement crs report rl33328 meanwhile several days after the senate finance committees mock markup of the usoman implementing legislation jordans trade minister sharif zubi indicated that the report incorrectly identified three sweatshops that are not even in jordan and that three others had been closed before the report had been released in may in addition he noted that the jordanian government had formed nine inspections teams to investigate the entire garment trade in the country and is working with the international labor organization us labor committees the ustr the state department and us and jordanian apparel companies to address the challenges and improve their monitoring system conclusion the mefta would aim to help stimulate greater economic development in the middle east shorter term goals from these
