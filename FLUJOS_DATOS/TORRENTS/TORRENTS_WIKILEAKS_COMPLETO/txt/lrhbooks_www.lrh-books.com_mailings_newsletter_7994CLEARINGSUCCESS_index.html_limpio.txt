bridge enewsletter lrhs congress lectures date clear is condition of responsibility and ability youll never come along and take the magic syringe hike up the fellows sleeve and go pfssst and have clear you cant say to the individual be three feet back of your ruddy ead and have clear because clear is not condition of being out of your head or in your head or in this universe or out of it its not condition of location it is condition of responsibility and its condition of ability thats what its condition of but the earliest stages of processing are simply devoted to letting it be found that he has had something to do with his life and when he is able to recognize that hes had lot to do with his life he is then able to move up to point where he can have some responsibility for his life and at that time he starts to drop pieces of the gpm he starts to drop this that things start to key out he does little bit better and he does little bit better and he begins to handle his associates and so forth excerpted from the clearing success congress lectures discovery of the suppress button an article by l ron hubbard from the clearing success congress lectures the individualthe individual has simple singular obsessed method of not hurting and he knows nothing about the mind or anything like that his method of not hurting is to suppress it you watch somebody you watch somebody i wouldnt say i wouldnt say you should make general test on this but you take cigarette butt and grind it out in somebodys palm you start to you see and they will immediately grab their hand to stop the pain i wouldnt make that test if i were you the next time you see somebody pick up hot teakettle he will go through two actions he will go this way and then he will some way or another try to hold it still he will put it in motion and hell try to hold it still maybe hell do both you see nothing is happening except youve just got more engram see the point im making here is the actual first impulse action when the message known as pain starts creeping its insidious way toward the thetan is for him to say now when an individual is in pain agony and so forth he is trying to stop it from hurting go around hospitals and you can always tell which guy hurts see hes the one who looks all scrunched up you could actually walk down whole series of beds in hospital and say that one is in pain and that one isnt in pain and that ones been drugged and that ones dead and now the individual in handling pain or mental problems puts it away now actually we had it all the time weve had it in the axioms its the notis axiom but this is how you express it in english as well as scientologese notis he notises it he says it doesnt exist this button is in common to all well ill just forget it the best way to handle that ill just forget him there is reason for to sit here sadly and mope i will just forget him boohoohoo you see bingand then nothing nothing nothing see shes got itgot it made its the perfect way of becoming miserable if you want to have your whole past kick your head off forget it thats the best possible way now this is by the way residual in hypnotism the hypnotist uses this and of course we dont use any hypnotism in dianetics or scientology but knowledge is knowledge and the hypnotist knows this very well he knows how to put compulsion in on somebody he tells it to him and then makes him forget it and then after that it goes off like an automatic button so if you want to put person on total automatic so that he can be restimulated at any time by anything and so forth all you have to do is make him suppress all right so this individual is in an automobile accident now if he didnt suppress things little while after the accident this memory of pain would run out and itd just flow away hed heal up i mean weve proven this many times hed just heal up in short order well this is because the suppression is off of it that is the main thing that has happened therethe suppression is gone thats all in other words this individual would get well if he didnt suppress he has an accident during the accident he suppresses everything thats happening suppresses all the pain thats happening in the accident and doing so he of course arrests time on the time trackhe stops time he suppresses time as well as anything else and that may i call to your attention is part of the physical universe matter energy space and time well if hes going to suppress matter and energy and other things hes also going to suppress time so he quote stops himself on the time track and he stops himself right in the accident l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture the healing effect of preparatory auditing suppress button this lecture is available in the clearing success congress lectures success from listening to the congress lectures this lecture series is like opening up the core of the reactive bank itself and taking real close look ive been such an ardent studier of lrh lectures over the years and i was thrilled to get the new clearing success congress as it had lecture basic purpose which i had always wanted to listen to the sound and material are great of course and having all those definitions colloquialisms phrases etc so thoroughly and meticulously done right there in the back of the highly portable transcript book for quick and easy access is definitely key this factor alone considerably sped up the time it took to get through the materials these congresses were obviously designed for maximum quantity and quality of consumption as to the first three lectures including and culminating in basic purpose this was just astounding here is what i learned the reactive mind at the most basic level how lrh unraveled and set forth the tech to clear it away for all time and all people how to actually stabilize the state of clear and thus open the door to ot the major role that responsibility plays in anyones clearing how any persons first point of departure from the mad world is realizing he has hand in his existence and that clear is condition of responsibility and ability also how the road to clear is achieved by an ever increasing gradient of persons ability to confront and handle his existence and the incredible role basic purpose has assumed in persons life whole track and case actually this lecture series is like opening up the core of the reactive bank itself and taking real close look its very upfront look at the greatest rattrap ever devised and we all have or had one for sure after this series youll definitely have considerably less of one i felt very fresh fning and exterior after each lecture thank you to cob for this awesome project and of course lrh kc clear is condition of responsibility and ability
