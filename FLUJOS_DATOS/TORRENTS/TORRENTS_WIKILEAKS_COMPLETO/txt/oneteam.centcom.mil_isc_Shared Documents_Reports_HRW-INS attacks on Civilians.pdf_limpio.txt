this country mohammad yusef aresh describing bo mb attack in kabul july 5 20061 since early 2006 taliban hezbe islami and other armed groups in afghanistan have carried out an increasing number of armed attacks that either target civilians or are launched without regard for the impact on civilian life while going about ordinary activitieswalking down the street or riding in busmany afghan civilians have faced sudden and terrifying violence shootings ambushes bombings or other violent attacks these insurgent attacks have caused terrible and profound harm to the afghan civilian population attacks have killed and maimed mothers fathers husbands wives parents and children leaving behi nd widows widowers and orphans many civilians have been specifically targeted by the insurgents including aid workers doctors day laborers mechanics student s clerics and civilian government employees such as teachers and engineers attacks have also left lasting physical and psychological scars on victims and eyewitnesses and caused tremendous pain and suffering to surviving family members 1 human rights watch interview with mohammad yusef aresh kabul september 6 2006 human rights watch april 2007 3this report is about insurgent attacks and their consequences it is based on accounts provided by witnesses victims and victims relatives and thorough review of records and reports of incidents in 2006 and through the first two months of 2007 the report also includes an assessm ent of statements by insurgent groups themselves who often claim responsibility for attacks that kill and injure large numbers of civilians antigovernment forces are not the only f orces responsible for civilian deaths and injuries in afghanistan at least 230 civilians were killed during coalition or nato operations in 2006 some of which appear to have violated the laws of war while there is evidence suggesting that coali tion or nato forces have intentionally directed attacks against civilians in number of cases international forces have conducted indiscriminate attacks or otherwise failed to take adequate precautions to prevent harm to civilians human rig hts watch has reported on several of these cases and will continue to monitor the conduct of such forces but in this report we focus on the civilian victims of insurgent attacks and on the effects of these attacks on civilian life in afghanistan civilian deaths from insurgent attacks skyrocketed in 2006 though exact casualty numbers from previous years are not available increases in overall numbers of insurgent attacks in 2006 indicate that 2006 was the deadliest year for civilians in afghanistan since 2001 roadside bombs and other bomb attacks more than doubled since the previous year human rights watch counted 189 bomb attacks in 2006 killing nearly 500 civilians another 177 civilians were killed in shootings assassinations or ambushes overall at least 669 afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 separate armed attacks by antigovernment forces in 2006 almost half of these attacks appear to have been intentionally launched at civilians or civilian objects hundreds of civilians also suffered serious injuries including burns severe lacerations broken bones and severed limbs the total numbe r of civilian casualtiesafghans killed or wounded in insurgent attackswas well over 1000 for the year the human cost 4suicide bombings once very rare in afghanistan now occur on regular basis at least 136 suicide attacks occurred in afghanistan during 2006a sixfold increase over the previous year this count is subs et of the 189 bomb attacks noted above at least 803 afghan civilians were kill ed or injured in these suicide attacks 272 killed and 531 injured at least 80 of these attacksa clear majoritywere on military targets yet these 80 attacks caused significant civilian casualties killing five times as many civilians as combatants 181 civilians versus 37 combatants civilian deaths and injuries from insurgent attacks have continued in 2007 in the first two months of 2007 insurgent forc have carried out at least 25 armed attacks resulting in civilian casualties including suicide attacks and other bombings shootings kidnappings and executions these attacks have killed at least 52 afghan civilians and injured 83 more insurgent attacks have also done significant damage to civilian property in addition to bombings and other attacks that r esulted in damaged shops buildings and infrastructure insurgents specifically targeted local schools which are often the only symbol of government in remote areas in 2006 bombing and arson attacks on afghan schools doubled from 91 reported attacks in 2005 to 190 attacks in 2006 attacks have continued into 2007 violations of the laws of war civilian casualties during armed conflict are not necessarily the result of violations of international humanitarian law the laws of war the nature of modern armed conflict is such that civilians are frequent ly killed and injured during fighting that is nonetheless in accordance with the rules of warfare however human rights watch investigations found that many civilian casualties from insurgent attacks in afghanistan in 2006 were intentional or avoidable insurgent forces regularly targeted civilians or attacked military targets and civilians without distinction or with the knowledge that attacks would cause disproportionate harm to civilians human rights watch april 2007 5such attacks violate international humanitarian law serious violations of international humanitarian law are considered war crimes and are subject to the jurisdiction of the r0me statute of the international criminal court which afghanistan ratified in 2003 there is little question that responsibility for most attacks lies with the taliban and other insurgent groups taliban spokesmen have claimed responsibility for over twothirds of recorded bombing attacksprimarily those in the southern and southeastern provincesalthough in some cases their claims may be unfounded boasts as for attacks in eastern and northern areas of afghanistan there is significant evidence of involvement by the hezbe islami network under the command of gulbuddin hekmatyar which has been increasingly active in insurgent activities other groups associated with tali ban and hezbe islami forces including jaish muslemin and forces under jalaluddin haqqani are likely responsible for other attacks in eastern areas and districts around khost and jalalabad justifications by insurgents insurgent forces in afghanistan often claim that their military operations are generally lawful or that the targeting of civilians is legally permissible media statements by various taliban comma nders and spokesmen and documents attributed to the taliban shura council indicate that taliban leaders consider it permissible to attack afghan government workers and teachers employees of nongovernmental organizations or anyone who supports the government of president hamid karzai taliban spokesmen have claimed responsibility for various kidnappings and killings of foreign humanitarian aid workers claiming that they are killed because they are spying for the am ericans or for nato or coalition forces 2 such statements are blatantly contrary to international law which prohibits all intentional attacks on civilians not direct ly involved in hostilities and they implicate 2 statement of taliban spokesperson qari mohammad yousuf to reuters correspondent see afghans launch hunt for kidnapped albanians reut ers march 12 2006 this statement concerned four kidnapped macedonian citizens initially and erroneously reported to be albanian who were executed by the taliban few days later after the four were killed yousef told the bbc we will kill anyone who is helping the americans afghans killed on hostage mission bbc march 17 2006 the human cost 6taliban leaders in war crimes such statements also facilitate and encourage lower level commanders to continue violating the laws of war while insurgent spokespersons and comma nders have at times expressed concern for the security of civilians these statem ents are unconvincing given the record of insurgents detailed in this report many afghans referring to the high number of civilians who have been killed in insurgent attacks told human rights watch that they considered insurgents claims of conce rn preposterous moreover when taliban and other insurgent leaders make these statements the focus typically is placed on civilians who do not work for the government or ngos thus statements of concern primarily serve to highlight insurgents disregard for the security of other civilians such as civilian government workers whom they do not consider to be innocent expressing concerns for some civilians does not justify unlawful acts against others types of illegal attack insurgent groups in afghanistan have carried out the following types of illegal attacks in recent years intentional attacks on civilians such as assassinations of civilian officials or schoolteachers or bombings aimed at crowded bazaars or other civilian objects such as schools or medical clinics indiscriminate attacks in which the attacker uses means type of weapon or method how the weapon is used that does not distinguish between civilians and combatants for instance an antivehicular landmine on commonlyused road or suicide bo mber who is sent to detonate in populated area without regard to civilian loss disproportionate attacks in which an attack is expected to cause civilian harm that is excessive in relation to anticipated military goals for instance when bomb directed at minor military target can be reasonably expected to cause high loss of civilian life some insurgent attacks also appear to be primarily intended to spread terror among the civilian population tactic that violates international humanitarian law insurgents have targeted civilian governm ent personnel and humanitarian workers human rights watch april 2007 7apparently with the intent of instilling fe ar among the broader population and as warning not to work in similar capacities and have delivered numerous messages and announcements threatening afghans to not work for government offices or non governmental humanitarian organizations insurgent groups have also carried out several bombings in civilian areas which appear to be specifically intended to terrorize local populations in addition antigovernment forces have regularly threatened civilian populations by posting wr itten documents socalled nightletters warning civilians not to cooperate with the government or with international forces during many attacks particularly suic ide bombings insurgents have disguised themselves as civilians in violation of the international legal prohibition against perfidy perfidious attacks are ones in which combatant feigns protected status such as being civilian in order to carry out an attack such attacks have contributed to general blurring of the distinction between civilians and combatants in afghanistan which in turn has raised the risk for civilians of being mistakenly targeted during military operations carried out by government and coalition forces notably nato forces in the last months of 2006 appear to have repeatedly mistakenly opened fire on civilian vehicles approaching convoys erroneously believing based in part on past perfidious attacks that they were suicide attackers international humanitarian law requires combatants in all military operations to take all feasible precautions to avoid or at least minimize loss of civilian life and property yet insurgents have conducted many intentional attacks on civilians which are clear war crimes they have als attacked military objectives causing indiscriminate or disproportionate harm to civi lians in violation of the laws of war many recorded insurgent attacks took place in the midst of crowded civilian areas or in close proximity to residential and commercial areas in addition bombers in many cases used very powerful explosives the blast effects of which would be known to cause considerable loss of civilian life and damage to civilian buildings beyond the destruction or neutralization of the military target often such attacks have involved suicide bo mbers on foot or in vehicles while suicide bomber is theoretically very prec ise weapon human rights watch found the human cost 8that in practice suicide bombers frequent ly detonated their explosives prematurely or inaccurately and without regard to minim izing civilian loss also these attacks almost invariably involved the attacker f eigning civilian status which greatly increases risks to civilians the willingness of taliban and other insurgent commanders to continue to deploy in highly populated areas weaponsuicide bombersthat in practice is highly indiscriminate amounts to serious violation of international humanitarian law war crime human rights watch is also concerned about the actions of government and international forces in protecting civilian popu lations from the effects of hostilities international humanitarian law requires all parties to conflict to take all feasible precautions to protect civilians under their control against the effects of attacks that includes avoiding locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas these obligations apply to both insurgents and afghan government and international forces thus while afghan government and international forces are responsible for providing security for the civilian population they should also act to avoid placing civilians at risk in the event of insurgent attacks such as unnecessarily placing military installations in populated areas or patrolling in crowded places beyond the deaths and the injuries afghans have been deeply scarred emotionally by insurgent attacks sharzad 9year old girl was severely injured in kabul bombing in march 2006 aimed at senior member of the afghan parliament her stomach was torn open spilling her intestines sharzad told huma n rights watch that the bombing occurred just after she left shrine where she had just offered prayers she was walking with her brother the explosion happened on our way home it cut my stomach open and i thought i was going

because i thought i was going to die ghulam from kabul told human rights watch about how his morning commute in july 2006 was turned into nightmare by bombing on the bus he was riding the explosion was very bright and made nasty sound inside the bus was like hell the bus was engulfed in flames the first thing i realized was that i was very badly burnt the man sitting next to died on the spot i couldnt move him i was bleeding very badly but i managed to get out of the bus i shouted at the police and people to come and help but everyone was scared and were screaming and running away from attacks have caused immense grief among surviving relatives mohammad hashim whose wife bibi sadaat was shot and killed in may 2006 ambush in northern afghanistan likely by insurgent forces lamented

get depressed because my wife is dea d i have not only had enough of this governmenti have had enough of this world insurgent attacks on civilians have also severely harmed the fabric of daily life in afghanistan besides the obvious and primary effects of attacksdeath and injury to hundreds of civiliansattacks have caused broader harms ordinary afghansfarmers taxi drivers buildersare alread struggling with broken local economies lack of employment and inadequate health care education and social services since many attacks have been launched at humanitarian and development workers and government officials many vital government and development programs have been suspended in unstable areas the resu lt is that already low levels of the human cost 10development and humanitarian assistance have dropped even lower making life for afghan civilians even more difficult many afghan families have been dis placed by the widespread and seemingly random violence and refugees abroad appe ar hesitant to return to increasingly unsafe areas over 100000 afghans have been displaced because of security problems and hostilities in southern districts in the last year hundreds of thousands of refugees in iran and pakistan remain unwi lling to return to their homes in these areas in part because of security problems most returns in recent years have been to urban centers like the capital kabul and many others have avoided return over 3 million refugees remain outside of afghanistan armed conflict and displacement has been especially serious in and around southern and southeastern provinces in cluding helmand kandahar uruzgon zabul paktia paktika and kunar these are areas in which taliban and other insurgent forces have tribal or family roots or other base of support and which are close to the pakistan border over 70 percent of recorded lethal bomb attacks in 2006 occurred in these provinces many afghans and hu manitarian workers consider the rural districts in these areas to be conflict zones governmental developmental and humanitarian assistance in these areas is almost nonexistent it is not surprising that these areas are particularly unstable there is strong evidence that insurgent groups operate freely in areas across the border in pakistans tribal areas with minimal inter ference from pakistani authorities many insurgent groups regularly cross the pakistan b order and take refuge in border areas or even in pakistani cities like chitral peshawar and quetta there are increasing and detailed reports about pakistani government officials at various levels providing assistance or support to insurgent groups active in afghanistan even as bomb attacks and other violence have begun to spread into pakistani territory some local pakistani officials have even openly admitted to providing support in this context pakistans continuing insistence that it is vigorously cracking down on insurgent groups has become impossible to take seriously however it would be erroneous to suggest that all of afghanist ans instability is connected to insurgents human rights watch april 2007 11having easy sanctuary in pakistan insu rgentrelated

appeared to have targeted civilians could not understand why insurgents would carry out such an attack whats my mistake he told human rights watch why does the taliban want to kill i am worker i dont

hezbe islami and allied antigovernment groupshave launched thousands of armed attacks on afghan government us coalition and nato forces and on the civilian population international and afghan military forces have carried out extensive military operations against these insurgent forces in many cases causing large numbers of civilian casualties the fighting has grown more intense over time although stabilit has been achieved at various timesfor instance presidential and parliamentary elections were held in 2004 and 2005 without major disruptionafghanistans general security situation has deteriorated from late 2001 to the present especially in the last two years the most intense fighting to date occurred in 2006 including major hostilities in southern provinces around kandahar and in and around kunar province on the eastern border with pakistan government and international officials and insurgent commanders have suggested that hostilities in 2007 will be even more intense international and afghan government forces as of early 2007 there are about 45000 international troops in afghanistan roughly 32000 are under the unmandated and nat oled international security assistance force isaf and are stationed in kabul and in different provinces around the country with the largest concentrations in the south isafs primary stated goal is to provide security for the government of president hamid karzai and to defend government territory against insurgent operations the united states and some of its allies have an additional 10000 to 13000 troops in the country not under nato command primarily at bagram air base north of kabul and in eastern areas along the pakistani border their primary mission is directed against qaeda and other forces suspected of involvement in international terrorism in addition there are approximately 34 000 afghan troops in the afghan military some of which operate alongside international forces during isaf and nonisaf operations there are an unknown number of other unofficial combatants linked to human rights watch april 2007 13various local commanders some of whom sometimes cooperate with international forces during military operations human rights watch has repeatedly reported on human rights concerns with both international and government forces including concerns about civilian causalities during military operations and human ri ghts abuses by local military and police 3 insurgent forces the insurgency in afghanistan is comprised of number of armed groups the diversity of the groups is reflected in the use of an acronym by afghan government and allied coalition forces to describe the groups who are fighting against the government and allied forces age for antigovernment elements this acronym as used by the government and its allies is meant to cover variety of groups including tribal militias contesting cent ral government authority criminal networks particularly those involved in the booming narcot ics trade and most of all groups ideologically opposed to the afghan governm ent such as the taliban and the warlord gulbuddin hekmatyar and his hez be islami the islamic party 4 the taliban movement taliban forces have claimed responsibility for most but not all of the attacks documented in this report in many cases taliban spokesmen usually mohammed hanif or qari yousuf ahmadi claimed responsi bility for the attacks by contacting the media although it is impossible to determine to what extent such spokesmen are genuinely representative of the taliban and have access to information mohammed hanif was captured by the afghan government in january 2007 in other cases the attacks are associated with nightlette rs issued by groups identifying themselves

40 militant groups some organized as political factions others based on pashtun tribal or regional affiliations given the disparate nature of this grouping it is difficult to estimate how many troops the taliban can effectively mobilize but estimates vary from 5000 by the us military to 15000 by pakistani fficials including pashtun tribal militias one indication of the increasing strength nd boldness of the taliban is that in 2006 their forces engaged nato in battalionsized assaults with sustained logistical and engineering support 6 another indication came from the increasing public presence of taliban supporters many of whom had switched allegiances or at least avoided openly espousing the taliban cause after the governments 2001 defeat by the us led coalition 7 the talibans unexpected military and political resilience in southern afghanistan in 2006 prompted nato to try to reach localized accommodation or truce with taliban forces following the model of the pak istan governments peace agreement with pakistani taliban groups more details of the pakistani peace agreement with the taliban appear below in mid2006 british forces agreed to leave the town of musa 5

responsible and were targeting government officials who were att ending the wrestling match but that they then denied responsibility for the attack because of the high number of civilian casualties 52

september 6 2006 the human cost 70 v rising civilian casualties trends and statistics in addition to the accounts above h uman rights watch reviewed additional information about insurgent attacks in which civilians have been killed or injured from published and unpublished accounts and reports the following section presents some of our findings civilians in the crosshairs insurgent forces launched large number of attacks in 2006 in which civilians were killed or injured based on our own data information collected from other reliable sources including both domestic and inter national monitors and review of various accounts human rights watch found that in 2006 there were at least 350 cases in which insurgent attacks caused civilian deaths or injury these attacksincluding bombings shootings kidnapping and execut ions and other violencekilled at least 669 afghan civilians 115 these figures do not include the numerou s civilians killed and injured during military engagements between insurgents and afghan government nato and coalition forces the totals cited here are conservative numerous afghan officials and civilians have suggested that many deaths and injuries go unreported and that violence in remote rural areas often remains unknown the real number of civilian victims during insurgent attacks is likely higher most civilians who died in insurgent att acks were killed in bomb attacks although large numbers of civilians were also target ed in shootings or were killed after having been abducted 115 in early january 2007 us military intelligence officer told the new york times that the use of roadside bombs more than doubled to 1677 last year from 783 in 2005 the number of what the military calls direct attacks meaning attacks by insurgents using

in the legal analysis section be low suicide attacks are not an unlawful method of combat however most suicide attacks in afghanistan have violated the laws of war suicide bombers have typi cally attacked using perfidious meansthat is attackers have feigned protected civilian status to get close to targets suicide attacks have also frequently directed their attacks at civilians or civilian objects or made effort to minimize civilian casualties taliban forces which are believed responsib for the overwhelming majority of suicide attacks have expressed little concern for the high civilian

the intended target was unclear in the 18 suicide bombings that appear to have been directed at civilians or civilian objects over 200 civilians were killed or injured 91 killed 119 injured in theory suicide bombers as weapons are very discriminate suicide bomber can detonate at target with an accuracy that could match or exceed that of the most sophisticated guided weapon it is thus not an inherently indiscriminate weapon such as land mines however it appears that in some circumstances suicide bombers become nervous or confused and detonate their explosives accidentally or prematurely in afghanistan many attackers in 2006 appear to have erroneously detonated their explosives away from intended targets killing and injuring civilians thus while the majority of suicide attacks appear to be meant for military targets the actual victims have been predominately ci vilian of the 112 bombings in which 119 see website of the site institute for review of video

forces and insurgent groupsare bound by international humanitarian law the laws of war international humanitarian law ihl imposes upon warring parties legal obligations to reduce unnecessary suffering and to prot ect civilians and other noncombatants it is applicable to all situations of armed conflict without regard to the legal basis for the conflict that is it applies whether the conflict itself is legal or illegal under international or domestic law and whethe r those fighting are regular armies or non state armed groups all armed groups involved in conflict must abide by ihl and any individuals who violate ihl rules can be tried and convicted in domestic or international courts for their violations the fact that insurgent forces are not the official government or military of afghanist an is legally irrelevant to the applicability of international standards insurgency itself is not violation of inter national humanitarian law the laws of war do not prohibit the existence of insurgent groups or their attacks on legitimate military targets rather they restrict th means and method of insurgent attacks and impose upon them duty to protect civilians and other noncombatants and minimize harm to civilians during milit ary operations international humanitarian law does not regulate whether states and armed groups can engage in hostilities but rather how states and armed groups engage in hostilities132 human rights watch consistent with our position of neutrality in armed conflicts takes position on the legality under inter national law of military operations by us 132 however with respect to nongovernment actors the domest ic law of afghanistan is applicable with respect to many insurgent activities described in this report afghan law like the laws of most nations proscribes basic domestic crimes including murder assault arson rebellion and crimes relating to attacks on government forces or installations see 1976 penal code of afghanistan art 394 murder art 407 assault arts 491493 destruction of property art 173 impairing the territorial integrity of afghanistan or separating territory from the governments administration art 175 taking up arms

specific international humanitarian law provisions applicable in afghanistan have changed as the nature of conflict in afgha nistan has evolved over the past five years the initial usled military operation against the taliban government that began in october 2001 was considered to be an international armed conflicta conflict between opposing states the law applicable to international conflicts includes the four geneva conventions of 1949 to whic h afghanistan and the united states are party and the hague regulations of 1907 which are considered reflective of customary international law 133 after the fall of the taliban government in november 2001 and with the creation of government under president hamid karzai the international armed conflict ended since then hostilities have comprised noninternational armed conflict in which afghan government forces and us nato and other coalition partners are fighting against antigovernment forces the conflict is not an international armed conflict under the conventions since it is not conflict between two or more states parties to noninternational armed conflic t are obligated to observe applicable standards of the four 1949 geneva convent ions specifically article 3 common to the conventions common article 3 which provides standards for noninternational armed conflict all parties must also abide by the rules and obligations of

april 2007 83many as 177 separate attacks in 2006 that appear to have been intentionally directed at civilians or civilian objects several of which were detailed in chapter 3 of this report intentional attacks on civilians are flat ly prohibited under international humanitarian law which makes the intentional targeting of civilians war crime one of the most basic rules of armed conflict is that part ies to conflict must distinguish between combatants and civilians and should not intentionally target civilians or other persons not taking direct part in hostilities the principle exists in both international treaty law and customary international law 144 the icc statute also makes the intentional targeting of civilians war crime145 civilians cannot be attacked unless and for only such time as they take direct part in hostilities according to the icrc commentary to protocol i direct participation in hostilities means acts of war which by th eir nature and purpose are likely to cause actual harm to the personnel and equipment of enemy armed forces146 direct participation in hostilities implies dir ect causal relationship between the activity engaged in and the harm done to the enemy at the time and the place where the activity takes place147 typically civilians who fire weapons directly assist combatants on the battlefield such as by loading weapons or acting as artillery spotters are considered to be directly participating in the hostilities hostilities not only covers the time when the civilian actually makes use of weapon but also the time that he is carrying it as well as situations in which he 144 see common article 3 of the four geneva conventions applica ble in noninternational armed conflict and prohibiting acts against persons taking active

hostilities in case of doubt whether person is civilian all forces should assume such person is civilian 149 afghan police civili ans or combatants police normally have the status of civilians150 however police units that take part in military operations or otherwise engage in military functions may be targeted as combatants individual police may only be targeted during such time that they take direct part in the hostilities151 although insurgent groups have carried out numerous attacks on police officers or police convoys in 2006 human rights watch has not counted police deaths in the approximately 650 civilians killed in insurgent attacks noted above human rights watch s taken this admittedly conservative approach because of difficulties in conducting research about attacks on police to determine whether the attacks were lawful under international standards it is likely however that many attacks on police in 2006 were not legal as many police officers working in afghanistan are not directly taking part in hostilities but instead engage in basic police activities investigating ordinary crimes directing traffic and guarding civilian government offices 148 icrc commentary

humanitarian law pp 2324 there are number of gray areas in the phrase direct participation in the hostilities these relate not only to the civilians activity and whether it is direct participation or n ot but also to its geographic or temporal beginning and end that is there is little clarity as to when civilian with weapon actu ally begins participating in the hostilities and at what point the participation ends 150 see bothe new rules for victims of armed conflicts p 240 report of working group b committee i 18 march 1975 cddhi238rev1 x 93 in howard s levie ed the law of non international

paramilitary or armed law enforcement agencies into armed forces is usually carried out through formal act for example an act of parliament in the absence of formal inco rporation the status of such groups will be judged on the fact s and in the light of the criteria for defining armed forces when these units take part in hostilities and fulfill the criteria of armed forces they are considered combatants ibid p 17 human rights watch april 2007 85politicians and civilian government employees civilian officials and staff of foreign governments humanitarian aid workers journalists and contractors without military function are all protected civilia ns under the laws of war and cannot be targeted for attack any attacks directed at such persons are prohibited indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks international humanitarian law prohibits as war crimes attacks that use means or methods of attack that do not distinguish between civilians and combatants and attacks in which the expected civilian loss is disproportionate to the anticipated military gain many of the attacks described in chapter 3 above appear to have violated these requirements as well as prohibitions against attacks that do not seek to minimize civilian casualties or are perfidious the icrc articulates the rule against indiscriminate attacks as follows indiscriminate attacks are those which are not directed against specific military objective which employ method or means of combat which cannot be directed at specific military objective which employ method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by international humanitarian law and consequently in each such case are of nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction152 indiscriminate attacks include attacks in the vi cinity of civilians or civilian areas that use bombs or other explosive materials so powerful that explosions cannot be limited to military targets for instance if an attacker uses bomb to target military convoy passing though populated area that can be expected to cause destruction 152 icrc customary international humanitarian law rule 12 citing protocol i art 51 which states among others the following types of attacks are to be sidered as indiscriminate an attack by bombardment by any methods or means which treats as single military objective number of clearly separa ted and distinct military objectives located in city town village or other area containing similar concentration of civilians or civilian objects the human cost 86to combatants and civilians alike without any distinction the attack may be indiscriminate the icrc explains the rule against disproportionate attacks as follows launching an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life injury to civilians damage to civilian objects or combination thereof which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited153 under international humanitarian law milit ary objective is an object or target selected by its nature location purpose or use that contributes effectively to the enemys military capability and whose destruction or neutralization offers definite military advantage in the circumstances 154 the anticipated military advantage must be concrete and direct and not merely potential or theoretical legitimate military objectives include the enemys forces weapons convoys installations and supplies in addition objects generally used for civilian purposes such as houses buses taxicabs or civili an airfield can become military objectives if their location or usesuch as being u sed by enemy troopsmeets the criteria for military objective 155 however the laws of war characterize all objects as civilian unless they satisfy the test mentioned ab ove objects normally dedicated to civilian use such as houses mosques church and schools are presumed not to be military objectives there is specific formula for what constitutes disproportionate attack excessive damage is relative concept the presence of single soldier cannot serve as justification to destroy an entire village if the destruction of bridge is of paramount importance for the occupation of strateg ic zone it is understood that some 153 icrc customary international humanitarian law rule 14 citing protocol i art 515 see also icrc rule 8 citing protocol i art 522 military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature location purpose or use make an effect ive contribution to military action and whose partial or total destruction capture or neutralization in the circumstances ruling at the time offers definite military advantage 154 icrc customary international humanitarian law rule 8 citing protocol i art 522 155 bothe new rules for victims of armed conflicts pp 30607 human rights watch april 2007 87houses may be hit but not that whole urban area be leveled156 by contrast if an attack is directed at highvalue military target it is conceivable that higher number of civilian casualties might be legally justifiable under the laws of war however the fact that an attack is directed at military objective does not absolve the attacking party of responsibility for civi lian deaths indiscriminate methods of attack are still impermissible and there is never justification for excessive civilian casualties matter how valuable the intended military target157 taking precautions to minimize harm to civilians international humanitarian law makes the above rules into positive obligations as the icrc articulates these obligations in the conduct of military operations constant care must be taken to spare the civilian population civilians and civili an objects all feasible precautions must be taken to avoid and in any event to minimize incidental loss of civilian life injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects 158 each party to the conflict must do everything feasible to verify that targets are military objectives159 each party to the conflict must take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of warfare with view to avoiding and in any event to minimizing incidental loss of civilian life injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects160 each party to the conflict must do eve rything feasible to assess whether the attack may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life injury to civilians 156 icrc commentary on the additional protocols p 684 157 ibid p 626

the attack may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life injury to civilians damage to civilian objects or combination thereof which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated 162 these rules place obligations on parties to conflict to take affirmative steps to minimize civilian casualties in the incidents documented in this re port human rights watch found little evidence to suggest that insurgent forc were in any way seeking to minimize civilian losses many insurgent attacks in 2006 have unfolded in typical way an afghan government vehicle or isaf or coalition convoy is traveling through city or village as it passes by set of shops or houses civilian car pulls into traffic alongside the convoy and then explodes possibly small number of troops or government personnel are injured and their ve hicle is damaged at the same time significant number of surrounding civilian buildings are destroyed and numerous civilians are killed or injured 163 indeed in many attacks insurgents appeared to have purposefully conducted attacks in the midst of crowds to conceal their attack itself violation of international law in order to avoid violating international law insurgent forces must take better measures to protect civilians minimizing civilian losses could mean attacking 161 icrc customary international humanitarian law rule 18 citing protocol i art 572a 162 ibid rule 19 citing protocol i art 572b 163 attacks of this type are detailed in chapter 3 of this report for instance the august 3 2006 suicide car bomb attack in crowded market in panjwai markaz near kandahar which killed at least 22 civilians including children and wounded dozens more the intended target canadian patrol 200 meters from the blast was unharmed to take more recent example on december 14 2006 suicide bomber attacked an afghan police ve hicle in qalat in the southern province of zabul only two police officers were wounded but four ci vilians were killed and approximately 20 more injured including four children see abdul waheed wafa 4 are killed and 22 hurt in bomb attack in afghanistan new york times december 15 2006 as noted in appendix many other attacks of this kind occurred through 2006 human rights watch april 2007 89military targets outside of crowded populated areas or conducting attacks during time of day when there would be fewer civi lians out on the streets attacks that cannot be lawfully carried out must be cancelled or suspended acts intended to spread terror this report has described several attacks in which the apparent aim of the insurgents was not merely to harm specific individuals but to generate broader fear among the civilian population this aim violates international legal norms parties to conflict cannot engage in acts or threats of violence primarily intended to cause terror or extreme fear among civilians 164 for instance this would include the abduction or shooting of humanitarian aid workers in which the insurgents claim that such persons can be targeted because they are working with the government as part of an apparent effort to driv out the larger humanitarian aid community insurgent groups have also regularly left nightletters warning civilians not to cooperate with government or international military forces or ngos or else face violence and insurgents have bombed or set fire to schools in dozens of districts across afghanistan with the apparent broader goal of disrupting the educational system depending on the attackers inten t bombings directed at crowded civilian areas might also violate this rule in addition to being an unlawful attack on civilians perfidy and its effects on the civilian population in many of the attacks detailed in this report antigovernment forces have feigned civilian statuspretended to be civi liansin order to carry out attacks under international law this tactic violates the laws of war prohibitions against perfidy perfidious attacks are acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to or is obliged to accord protection under the rules of international law applicable in arm ed conflict with intent to betray that confidence 165 examples of perfidy include the f eigning of civilian noncombatant 164 icrc customary international humanitarian law rule 2 citing protocol i art 512 and protocol ii art 132 while applying this rule in 2003 the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia stated that terror could be understoo d also as extreme fear see prosecutor v galic case it9829t trial chamber december 5 2003 137 165 see icrc customary international humanitarian law rule 65 citing protocol i art 37 the human cost 90status166 the icc statute makes perfidy war crime during noninternational armed conflict listing it as killing or wounding treacherously combatant adversary 167 this has especially been the case during suicide bomb attacks discussed below where suicide bombers almost always feign protected status as civilians to safely approach military targets such as convoys nd checkpoints on foot or in vehicle before detonating their weapon 168 the rule against perfidy is meant not only to promote honorable warfighting on the battlefield but also to protect civilians and other persons and objects protected by international law 169 it is linked to other rules that are meant to protect civilians such as the rule against using civilians as shields specifically prohibiting combatants from feigning civilian status is meant in part to ensure the principle of distinction between combatants and civilians 170 the prohibition is intended to minimize ca ses in which combatants mistakenly target civilians believing them to be combatants perfidious attacks have damaging psychological impact on afghan civilians nd on afghan government coalition and nato forces whose personnel fear that at any moment they may be killed by another civilian nearby as result it increases th likelihood that actual civilians will be mistaken for suicide attackers by government coalition and nato forces and mistakenly attacked 166 see ibid 167 rome statute art 82eix the phrase killing or woundi ng treacherously from the 1907 hague regulations art 23b is equivalent to perfidy 168 in addition to cases cited in this report other examples include december 2006 anso report 15th december 1500hrs barmal district paktia male suicide bomber in burka veil detonated his ied at the entrance of shkin ana base in the

91such effects can be readily seen in incident s in which afghan or international forces fire on civilian motorists who they m istakenly believe are suicide bombersa regular occurrence in southern provinces and even around kabul in november and december 2006 alone human rights watch collected reports of at least 17 afghan civilian motorists shot by nato or coalition troops in circumstances suggesting that nato forces erroneously spected the motorists of being suicide attackers 171 nine of the seventeen died these numb ers are just from the last few months of 2006 when nato began keeping more accurate records nato press statements about these attacks which could not be verified provide some information about how these shootings can unfold for example 23 november early yesterday morning an incident involving an isaf convoy traveling on the bagram road resulted in the death of one afghan and the injury of 4 others civilian van was observed driving suspiciously in the vicinity of the convoy isaf troops signaled for the vehicle to stop and fired number of shots the driver subsequently lost control of the van and unfortun ately crashed regrettably one of the civilians was killed and 4 were injured the casualties were taken to kabul ana hospital for medical treatment 172 another report reads 27 december this morning an isaf security patrol was involved in tragic

afghan government and international forces still have an obligation to ensure that attacks are direc ted at military targets and not civilians and to call off an attack when the civili an nature of target becomes known 174 yet there have been several instances where international forces have responded to suicide attacks by firing indiscriminately on civilians in kandahar city in late november 2006 is af personnel fleeing from the scene of vehicle suicide attack in which three soldier s in their convoy were injured fired on several civilian motorists three civilians were reported killed by the gunfire and approximately seven others were wounded 175 an isaf spokesperson confirmed that isaf personnel discharged their weapons in the wake of the attack and said they were responding to what they perceived were potential suicide car bombs this is not to say that they were fired in caval ier fashion but the convoy had just been attacked by suicide bomb they had the right to self defence 176 similar incident occurred with us military forces in nangahar in march 2007 during which at least 10 civilians were shot and killed177 the assistance mission in afghanistan unama in december 2006

engagement for situations in which they have come under attack by suicide bombers using pe rfidious disguise the report specifically raised the following key issues increased risk to civilians due to frequent insurgent attacks with disregard for the civilian population increasing number of incidents in which natoisaf has fired at civilians who have strayed too close to traveling convoys 178 suicide bombing attacks many of the insurgent attacks discussed in this report were carried out by suicide bombers wearing explosiveladen vests or dr iving vehicles filled with explosives suicide attacks are not an unlawful means of attack under international humanitarian law and the suicidal methodology is irrelevant to its legality for example japanese kamikaze attacks against us military forces during world war ii were lawful attacks on military targets and as noted above over 80 percent of suicide attacks in afghanistan in 2006 112 attacks appear to have been directed at military convoys or installations yet most insurgent suicide attacks in 2006 appear to have violated the laws of war first suicide bombers have at times targeted civilians or civilian objects during their attacks not military targets many of these attacks on civilians have been devastating as noted above over 200 civi lians have been killed or injured in the 18 suicide bombings in 2006 that appear to ve been directed at civilians or civilian objects 91 killed 119 injured second in virtually all of the cases from 2006 investigated by human rights watch in which suicide bombers attacked military ob jectives the attacker feigned civilian 178 unama taliban suicide attack and uk isaf firing upon afghan civilians 03 december 2006 kandahar december 2006 on file with human rights watch the report also states sco res of innocent afghan men women and children have been displaced terrorized injured and killed as the taliban target the afghan government and natoisaf with scant regard for civilian lives military operations by the afghan government and natoisaf have also taken lives and contributed to an atmosphere of fear the human cost 94status violating the prohibition against perfidy attackers did not carry their weapons openly or wear insignia or uniforms ident ifying themselves as combatants rather they dressed as civilians and wi th their explosives hidden and then used their civilian status to get close to t argets not only was this unlawful but as detailed above it makes it more likely that belligerent forces may erroneously target civilians during military operations mistakenly believing they are combatants third insurgent commanders have continued to carry out suicide bomb attacks after it became apparent that in practice the method of attack was indiscriminate killing combatants and civilians without distinction and perhaps disproportionate to any expected military gain in theory suicide bomb attacks are very precise with the attacker able to determine specifically wher and when to detonate the explosives however human rights watch found that in practice bombers frequently panic or make misjudgments setting off explosiv at the wrong time or placeand without regard to civilians nearby this has occurr ed time and again through 2006 and into 2007 with great loss of civilian li fe commanders who knowingly deploy such an indiscriminate weapon are committing war crimes justifications by insurgent forces insurgent forces in afghanistan often claim that their military operations are generally lawful or that the targeting of civilians is legally permissible media statements by various taliban comma nders and spokesmen and documents attributed to the taliban shura council indicate that taliban leaders consider it permissible to attack afghan government workers and teachers employees of nongovernmental organizations or anyone who supports the government of president hamid karzai taliban spokesmen have at v arious times claimed responsibility for various kidnappings and killings of foreign humanitarian aid workers claiming that they are killed because they are spying f or the americans or for nato or coalition forces 179 such statements not only implicate taliban leaders in war crimes but they facilitate and encourage lower level commanders in violations of the laws of war 179 statement of taliban spokesperson qari mohammad yousuf to reuters correspondent afghans launch hunt for kidnapped albanians reut ers march 12 2006 this statement concerned four kidnapped macedonian citizens initially and human rights watch april 2007 95a rulebook issued by the taliban leadersh ip in december 2006 explains why the taliban believes civilians and civilian infrastructure can be targeted for attack working for the current puppet regime is not permitted either in madrassa religious school or as schoolteacher because that provides strength to the infidel system in order to strengthen the new islamic regime muslims should hire religious teacher and study in mosque or another suitable place nd the textbooks used should be from the mujahid antisoviet war time or the taliban time those who are working in the current puppet regime as madrassa teacher or school teacher should be warned if he doesnt stop he should be beaten but if teacher is teaching against true islam he should be killed by the district commander or group leader the ngos that came into the country under the infidels government are just like the government they came here under the slogan of helping the people but in fact they are part of this regime thats why their every activity will be banned wh ether it is building road bridge clinic school or madrassa or anything else if school matches these conditions it should be burned if it is told to close but doesnt it should be burned but before burning it all religious books should be taken out 180 in mid 2006 taliban commander in hel mand province under the command of mullah mohammad kaseem farouqi told the london times the americans the british canadians and others have dest royed afghanistan we are hunting every individual who supports this imposed democracy we will also hunt the puppet afghans who

who instead of targeting the enemy blow up mosques kill mullahs and burn schools these are not acts that the mujahidin are involved in rather they are acts of the americans or agents acting on the cias instructions the statement then provides an example of mosque bombing suggesting the attack was carried out by foreign forces explosions of that type that the victims have been innocent have been carried out by the americans and the british along with local agents the real mujahidin understand that burning and destroying schools does not hurt the enemy and they understand that terrorizing lowly and mercenary propagandists who are bought for meager wage has significance to the enemy rath er these acts offer them propaganda material and pretext to terrorize honorable islamic scholars 182 hekmatyars denial however contains ambiguities suggesting that civilians and civilian objects can be targeted if they are aiding in the occupation of afghanistan the mujahidin understand that their aim is not to destroy schools but to eliminate all those people who use schools as front line against islam and our people our real enemies are those who use schools hospitals and mosques as tools meant for the longterm occupation of our country insurgent spokespersons and commanders ve at times expressed concern for the security of civilians at least those who do not work for the government or nongovernmental organizations for instance in october 2006 taliban spokesman mohammad hanif provided statement to the associated press said to be from mullah omar the former leader of the taliban

trying our best to avoid civilian casualty sic this is war 184 the taliban have spoken of innocent civilians on other occasions for instance after january 2006 attack in the border to wn of spin boldak near kandahar that reportedly killed 26 civilians attending wrestling match ahmadi initially claimed responsibility for the attack but later told agence francepresse we strongly condemn this attack on innocent people the taliban leadership convey their condolences to the relatives of the victims 185 rather than demonstrating their concern f or certain civilians such statements are unconvincing given the record of insurgent s detailed in this report and ultimately highlight the talibans disregard for the sec urity of those personsprotected under international humanitarian lawwhom they do not consider to be innocent expressing concerns for some in way ju stifies unlawful acts against the others precautions against the effects of attacks international humanitarian law

populated areas nonetheless certain steps like keeping bases out of such areas and avoiding crowded roads should be adopted where feasible to minimize the potential harm to civilians in the event of an insurgent attack international forces security concern s and laws of war violations many afghans who spoke to human rights watch raised various concerns about the armed conflict some relating to the specific conduct of the fighting by both sides others relating to broader issues of the gitimacy of the insurgency and the role of international forces in supporting the gover nment while the former issue is within the purview of international humanitarian law the latter is not and yet for many afghans the two types of concerns were invariably related how each side engages in war was seen as affecting its legitimacy unmet expectations for security factored in heavily on individual opinions many afghans blamed afghanistans worsening security situation on failures by the government coalition and nato forces since the fall of the taliban some suggested that insurgent forces have had renew ed successes in 20062007 especially in the south because of support from local popu lations

military operations in 2006 against antigovernment forces using ground operations aerial bombardment and missile strikes some of which have killed signif icant numbers of civilians afghans are understandably outraged by cases in which int ernational forces have killed civilians at least 230 civilians were killed during coalition or nato operations in 2006 some of which appear to have violated international humanitarian law while there is evidence suggesting that coalition or nato forces have intentionally directed attacks against civilians in number of cases international forces have conducted indiscriminate attacks or otherwise failed to take adequate precautions to prevent harm to civilians for instance human rights watch criticized several military operations by nato forces in southern prov inces in october 2006 which killed over 50 civilians 191 and more recently criticized operations in march 2007 that resulted in other civilian deaths192 international forces at

human rights watch april 2007 101 vii recommendations international humanitarian law places restri ctions on the military operations of all parties to an armed conflict state armed forces and opposition armed groups are prohibited from intentionally targeting civilians or civilian objects conducting attacks that do not discriminate between civilians and combatants or are anticipated to cause civilian loss that is disproportionate to the military gain conducting attacks or threats primarily intended to spread terror amidst the civilian population and attacking military targets using perfidious methods in all attacks they must take all feasible steps to minimize harm to civi lians when conducting offensive operations insurgent forces should choose areas to launch attacks that are not in proximity of civilian areas and try to avoid operations in crowded civilian areas afghan government and international forces should to the extent feasible avoid locating their bases and operations with in or near densely populated areas human rights watch makes the follow ing specific recommendations to the taliban hezbe islami jaish muslemin jalaludd in haqqanis forces and other opposition armed groups cease all intentional attacks on civilians and civilian objects commanders and other leaders of the taliban and othe r insurgent groups should ensure that civilians are never targeted for attack under international humanitarian law armed forces can only target military objectives enemy combatants or civilians directly participating in hostilities persons immune from attack include afghan civilian government officials and employees humanitarian aid and development workers school teachers journalists doctors and other noncombatant civil servants civilian ob jects such as schools hospitals and homes must not be attacked unless cu rrently being used for military purposes cease all attacks that cause indiscriminate or disproportionate harm to civilians or civilian objects insurgent forces attacking military targets must take all feasible steps to minimize harm to civilians attack should be carried out the human cost 102that uses means and methods of war that do not discriminate between civilians and combatants or are expected to cause excessive civilian harm the taliban and other armed groups should avoid any attacks in crowded civilian areas such as busy roads village or city st reets bazaars or other public gathering places given the likely unlawfulness of such operations cease attacks or threats that are primarily meant to spread terror among civilians the taliban and other armed groups should not make threats or launch attacks intended to spread terror among the civilian population which is illegal under the laws of war they shou ld not make threats of violence to civilians such as the delivery of night letters or take other actions intended to terrorize civilians stop feigning civilian status during attacks members of the taliban and other insurgent groups should not pretend to be civilians to gain military advantage while carrying out attacks feigning civilian status puts civilians at heightened risk of attack during hostilities an tigovernment forces who seek to carry out attacks on military targets can use ru ses of war including camouflage decoys mock operations and misinformation but they must not present themselves as civilians affirm commitments to follow international humanitarian law antigovernment forces should publicly affirm their commitment to follow established rules of the laws of war including prohibitions against targeting civilians using indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks attacking with the primary intent to cause terror among civilians and feigning civilian status to gain military advantage these are rules which afghan forces invoked to criticize soviet forces during the 1980s and us and coalition forces during the 2001 war to the afghan government and allied internat ional forces including us nato and coalition military forces review policies and protocols for basing patrolling and convoys to minimize harm to the civilian population government and international forces are at human rights watch april 2007 103heightened risk of attack by antigovernment forces and should therefore seek to distance their forces from civilians and civilian objects to the extent feasible ensuring the protection of the civilian population does require that military forces at times place themselves in th vicinity of populated civilian areas however these forces where possible sh ould take precautions to minimize harm to civilian life for instance by locating bases checkpoints or temporary posts at heightened distances from civilian areas review rules of engagement and operating procedures for how forces respond to real or perceived suicide attackers government and allied forces need to improve their policies for identifying and w arning civilians to avoid mistaken shootings of civilians who are erroneously believed to be suicide attackers some suggested actions take further steps to better mark checkpoints and convoy vehicles with lights and large signs in dari and pashto have interpreters available at all checkpoints at all times provide soldiers at checkpoints with ba sic knowledge of dari and pashto commands and hand signals to ensure be tter communication with civilians strengthen public service campaigns to inform afghan civilians about proper behavior at checkpoints and arou nd convoys civilians should be informed of the basic guidelines to avoid danger to the government of pakistan properly investigate and prosecute insurgents located in pakistan who have been implicated in serious violations of international humanitarian law end support including providing safe haven to insurgent forces operating out of pakistan who are responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law pakistani authorities should
