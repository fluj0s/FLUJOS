6107c03 shspec26x routine 1a problems routine 1a is problems processing alternated with sec checks it is to handle cases that are too tied up with out ruds to run cchs what is it that makes problem so deadly in processing problem is postulatecounterpostulate an indecisional proposition because the two sides are in balance one can hardly confront the two data at once the pc doesnt see the amount of confusion on it and the confusion mounts up around each side of it thus you get two separate zones of confusion each side with its stable datum because each side has yes and about it so you dont asis the problem and it persists thats its most basic characteristic people get impatient with problems so they solve them but problem solved has been notised not asised the solution of problem is of course an overt against problem everything in the universe is cure for something else solution this is one reason the universe persists cures deteriorate and solutions become new problems alcohol century ago was curing things even diseases once cured something cf sickle cell disease the bacteria that caused disease once cured something take an organization that is hammer and tongs on the subject of creativeness the catholic church they have the hatchet out on the 2d they dont think creation should be done that can be prevented they oppose vd campaigns because they think vd is good thing as cure for sex if you get vd sex stops so if sex stops you get vd sex vd because vd sex prostitution is also nosex proposition so it gives nosex disease sex is cure for bodies and bodies is cure for sex you dont get pc whose idea is horses sleep in bed who wasnt curing something with that idea every aberration hes got was cure for something his motionlessness is cure for having killed so many people if you pick up withholds on killing he will be able to move again killing too was cure for something maybe for hating people hate in its turn was cure for associating with people whom you might damage and damaging people was cure for people being people etc an aberration is cure that doesnt cure that you dont understand this all goes back to confusions and stable data if you have two confusions and two stable data opposed to each other which you dont confront you get an endurance because you never asis the thing you solve it pcs who go through vias continually on an auditing command have some problem theyve never looked at as problem when you run problems of comparable magnitude youve taken the via of curing the problem off automatic and sneakily gotten the pc to take look at the problem certain conditions that are designed to cure other conditions actually create them eg snakes venom makes snake antipathetic and snakes have venom because people and other animals dont like them the willingness to solve problems but not to asis them is the basis for q and people dont like getting the question fully duplicated as the answer this is because they are trying to solve some very fundamental confusion they have an effective method of teaching is to try to find the source of the question if you try to cure confusion it continues duress and punishment are the results of despairing of solving someones problems jails and mental hospitals are the cure for confusions about people this seems awfully drastic but it is born out of despair the effect of jails is to merely educate criminals more into hating people there is way to make correct and frontal attack on these confusions they often stem from withholds so joburg will help you may note that pc may look bit confused as he tries to find the problem he was solving problem remember is multiple confusion there are two solutions or ideas involved each with its own confusion an encysted confusion so one tries to back off from it which only pulls the problem along this is why thinking of solution makes the problem mass move in you cant really escape your own ideas thought mass is basically composed of problems it endures because its not confronted given enough of this the pc will be overwhelmed and will dramatize being problem one which is insoluble so you keep worrying about the pc because the pc is problem pc who says he has had gain is saying im problem solve your chances of doing it are poor hes got two confusions and cant confront either pcs whose needles keep rising are notconfronting problem you ask how are you doing the pc says fine the needle rises you ask what happened the pc says nothing its discouraging they cant tell you what it is because they cant confront it cchs will saw through this but slowly slowgain case is heavy on comm lag or not quite on the subject when hes talking the comm lag stems from noconfront so does the alteris which is dissociation from the confusion you ask the pc if hes got problem he gets upset because he cant confront it and knows he cant and he wants to avoid it altogether phenomena observed in the field stem from problems on noconfront or inverted basis in fields of stress or duress religious cults make their finest harvest they offer an escape from problems the reason alcoholics anonymous doesnt cooperate with scientology is that they have for their very existence contrary datum alcoholism cant be cured you cant do anything about it so you might as well join aa matter where you go you can never get away from yourself if you try to pretend you are not where you are you get dispersal of location youll be buttered all aver the universe the guy who permeates everything without being anywhere is trying to escape his problems which all carry noconfront you put motion and action into thought process and they become inextricably tangled up inextricably that is short of scientology processing all this is prelude to very simple killer process for the pc for whom all life is problem the difficulty for the pc is series of ridged problems the ridges people have trouble with surrender on this one command which is horrendous to run because it moves very slowly at first and turns on fierce somatics recall problem you must be very careful to get the question answered on recall problem you should ask what problem was that and make sure he is not giving you generality instead of specific problem the pc will come up with some interesting solutions which will suddenly turn awful hell discover hes been both sides of various conflicts each side to solve losing on the other if the pc does locational on some object hes used to solve problem of boredom hell come uptone to interest this is another reason touch assists work
