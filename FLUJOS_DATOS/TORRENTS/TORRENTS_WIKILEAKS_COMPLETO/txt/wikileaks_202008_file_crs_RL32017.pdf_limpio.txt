provides guidance for federal agencies on how to conduct publicprivate competitions the outcome of competition determines who government agency or private businesswill pe rform commercial activities commercial activity is service that could be performed by the private sector omb circular a76 was issued initially in 1966 the circular a76 revised supplemental handbook was first issued in 1979 the handbook provided guidance for implementing circular a76 policy and included procedures for conducting a76 cost comparisons in 1999 the federal activities inventory reform fair act of 1998 pl 105270 was incorporated into the circular and the handbook the most recent a76 revision which was issued in 2003 is arguably the most significant change to the circular and its supplement in the documents history the revision is one of several steps the bush administration has taken to further its competitive sourcing initiative which is one of the components of the presidents management agenda pma other activities include the requirement that agencies submit lists of their inherently governmental activities to omb an inherently governmental activity is function that is so intimately related to the public interest that it must be performed by federal government employees according to ombs circular 76 revised may 29 2003 p a2 combining the circular and the circular a76 revised supplemental handbook into one document omb modified the definition of inherently governmental established the concept of an agency tender which is the governments response to solicitation and eliminated the direct c onversion option under this option and as long as certain conditions were met agencies were allowed to convert function from inhouse performance to privatesector performance without conducting cost comparison several of the changes to circular a76 have generated significant amount of interest requirements for the preparation of commercial activities and inherently governmental inventories have changed and the latter inventories now are subject to challenge and appeal processes the deadline for what are now called standard competitions has been shortened with the expectation that agencies will complete host of planning activities prior to beginning competition these and other changes have raised questions about the ability of agencies to comply with the revised circular and other competitive sourcing requirements possible implications for the civil service system and federal employees is another area that has garnered attention this report will be updated if there ar further changes to the circular or information about implementation of the circular becomes available

numericallybased directions were inadequate omb also determined that customized competitive sourcing plans which are based on agencies research and analyses would be more appropriate19 in congressional testimony provided the same day that the omb report was issued the ofpp administrator emphasized that omb has moved away from mandated numerical goals and uniform baselines that were introduced at the beginning of the competitive sourcing initiative to ensure level of commitment that would institutionalize use of th tool within each agency instead we have negotiated tailored baselines based on mission needs and conditions unique to the agency 20 second report issued by omb in fall 2003 competitive sourcing reasoned and responsible publicprivate competition agency

most significant change to the circular and its supplement in the documents history previously the circular stated that it was the policy of the federal government to rely on the private sector for the provision of commercial activities25 with the publication of the 2003 circular this policy has been replaced by one that focuses on subjecting commercial activities performed by the government to competition26 under the 2003 revision agencies designate an assistant secretary or equivalent level official as the competitive sourcing official cso the governments response to solicitation is identified as an agency tender which is the equivalent of bid or proposal submitted by contractor two types of competition standard and streamlined are still allowed but some features have changed standard competition may be used for work center of any size but most efficient organization meo is required and conversion differential is used 27 streamlined competition may be used only for functions that have 65 or fewer ftes an meo is optional and conversion differential is not used contracting officers use the same source selection criteria or procedure to evaluate both the agency

is made agencies establish performance standards for agency officials who have been designated to implement and comply with circular a76 apparently the standards would concern performance on circular

in april 2001 omb established requirement for agencies to prepare and submit inventories of their inherently governmental activities along with lists of their commercial functions it is and has been federal policy under circular a76 that inherently governmental activities are to be performed by federal government employees 34 commercial functions may be performed by government employees or contractor employees since the inception of the requirement to submit lists of inherently governmental activities omb has changed its approach to these inventories initially inherently governmental inventories were not made available to the public and agency justifications written or otherwise were not required for activities bearing this designation two years after the initial directive was issued language in circular a76 states that inherently governmental inventories are to be made available to the public interested parties are allowed to challenge activities that are included on or omitted from an inherently governmental inventory and written justifications must be provided upon request by agencies the following chronology demonstrates how omb has changed its treatment of

the circulars definition of interested party indicates that the purpose of the definition is to identify who may challenge the contents of commercial activities inventories however paragraph d2 of

revision to circular a76 omb has modified its guidance on the use of reason code under the circular agencies are required to prepare written justifications for commercial activities that are assigned reason code and these justifications are to be available to omb and the public upon request49 ombs 2004 guidance for agencies on the preparation of their commercial and inherently governmental activities inventories essentially repeated the instructions found in the circular50 beginning in 2005 agencies are required to submit to omb their reason code justifications with their inventories51 ombs 2006 inventory guidance noted that omb personnel may also request that agencies refine previously submitted justifications for other reason code functions if there are questions52 g11g150g153g149g142g150g142g151g157g138g157g146g152g151g561 agency implementation of this portion of the circular attachment inventory process might create additional work for agencies in addition to preparing written justifications for activities designated as inherently governmental or design ated as commercial and assigned reason code agency personnel might be called upon to respond to challenges and appeals concerning reason codes or the contents of inherently governmental activities inventories in light of ombs emphasis on competitive sourcing one possible outcome of changing and expanding the applicability of the inventory procedures could be the establishment of an environment conducive to erroneous classification of activities activities that are arguably inherently governmental or that are commercial but should be exempt from competition reason code might be misclassified as commercial and eligible for competition reason code b less work is required for placing activities on the fair inventory and assigning reason code b written justifications are not required for these activities but they are required for inherently governmental activities and commercial activities assigned reason code this potential problem may be mitigated by the visibility of agency inventories and the accountability mechanisms established by fair and enhanced by circular a76 requiring commercial activities inventories and inherently governmental inventories to be made available to the public allows for scrutiny of both types of activities union and private sector reviews of inventories could be particularly useful in guarding against potential misclassification of activities as commercial when they are not or vice versa additionally the release of inherently governmental inventories could aid in examining the belief held by some commenters that some commercial activities are placed on inherently governmental inventories in order to shield them from competition one issue that might arise is how to balance an agencys determinations based 49 us office of management and budget circular a76 revised may 29 2003 p a3 50 clay johnson iii deputy director

exercise of discretionary authority in applying reason code against the assessments of outside organizations concerning the proper classification of agency activities in the absence of disclosure process akin to the one used for inventories of commercial and inherently governmental activities it is difficult to gauge whether and how outside organizations use the opportunities available to them under the revised challenge and appeal process useful information can be gleaned from inheren tly governmental and commercial inventories such as the variety of functions performed by an agency and the number of ftes associated with each activity however the utility of this information is somewhat limited the inventories are based on dichotomy between commercial and inherently governmental which makes them useful for competitive sourcing but they appear not to capture the complexities and interdependence of government work and government organizations changes to the definition of inherently governmental might not end with the revised definition that appears in the 2003 circular various factors such as the production and publication of lists of inherently governmental and commercial activities the increasing number of competitions or the revised definition itself could act as catalyst for an open informed and thoughtful discussion on the concept of inherently governmental and its validity some policy issues and questions that might arise as agencies attempt to comply with the circular and omb inventory guidance include the following the circular states that agency personnel shall use the circulars definition of inherently governmental in preparing their justifications for inherently governmental activities other guidance is provided to indicate what type and scope of information constitutes sufficient justification what happens if omb disagrees with an agencys justifications for inherently governmental activities whothe agency omb third partyhas final authority

governmental activity inventory andor justifications if not how frequently does omb require agencies to prepare justification statements for their inherently governmental activities how has omb encouraged compliance what happens if an agency does not comply with ombs directives there is statutory requirement for agencies to submit lists of inherently governmental activities do all agencies that submit fair inventories also submit inventories of inherently governmental activities have ombagency consultations resulted in shifting activities from an inherently governmental list to

1999 circular agencies were allowed 18 months to complete standard cost comparison for single function and 36 months for multifunction study the cost comparison start date was the date study team had been identified and the public or the union had been notified of the study53 the 2003 revision imposes shorter timeframe for study completion and does not make distinction between single function and multifunction studies the 2003 circular requires an agency to complete competition that is reach performance decision within 12 months of the public announcement of the competition54 the federal register notice that announced the release of the 2003 circular stated ombs rationale for the 12month deadline timeframe standards have been incorporated into the revised circular to motivate agencies to complete competitions and to instill greater confidence that agencies will follow through on their plans current processes have been criticized for allowing agencies to extend publicprivate competitions indefinitely in addition to instilling confidence in the process time limits ensure that the benefits of competition are realized 55 time limit waiver of up to six months may be granted by the agency competitive sourcing official cso waiver applies only to compe tition that is particularly complex and must be signed by the cso before the public announcement of the competition the cso is to provide copy of the waiver to the deputy director for management omb if an agency exceeds the time limit whether 12 or 18 months for study the cso is to notify omb in writing 56 the 2003 circular does not indicate whether there will be any consequences for an agency that fails to meet the deadline in practice agencies have more than 12 or 18 months to complete competitions in establishing timeframe what omb did was identify set of activities an agency must accomplish between studys start date and the end date all other necessary tasks can occur before or after the 12 or

determine what resources and skills are needed to conduct rigorous planning for competitions neither the circular nor the federal register notice addressed the matter of training personnel to plan and conduct competitions training for agency personnel was addressed in ombs may 2004 report on competitive sourcing which identified the federal acquisition council senior managers governmentwide the defense acquisition university and the federal acquisition institute as key participants in the effort to plan for develop and offer training tailored to meet the needs of agency personnel conducting publicprivate competitions successful application of competitive sourcing requires that our workforce be the best it can be in identifying activities that are suitable for competition applying streamlined and standard competition techniques in strategic manner running fair and transparent selection process and properly managing the resulting contract or letter of obligation established with winning government provider the federal acquisition council has been inventorying agency resources skill sets and training needs omb w ill work closely with the council and ask senior agency management to give priority attention to developing plans that address identified skills gaps the defense acquisition university and federal acquisition institute will be asked to play lead role in providing training materials geared to skills such as market analysis cost analysis and contract administration 62 whereas omb has imposed requirements on agencies regarding for example the inclusion of inherently governmental activities in their invent ories it remains to be seen whether omb issues any directives or requirements regarding training shorter timeframe was incorporated into the 2003 circular in an effort to alleviate problems caused or aggravated by timeconsuming studies studies that take long time to complete some argue create problems for federal agencies government employees and businesses michael wynne deputy undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics summarized this perspective the entire process is frustrating for all concerned government employees who are in limbo about their jobs contractors who have tied up considerable bid and proposal investments and the government activity that is managing the process while simultaneously performing their daytoday mission63 additionally it is possible that the emphasi s on rigorous planning prior to the public announcement will decrease the likelihood that an agency announces then cancels competition implementation of the new deadline might not alter the amount of time agencies take to plan and conduct competitions however a76 studies for which figures are available have taken considerably longer than 12 or 18 months information from for example the department of defense dod shows that the average time for co mpleting studies has varied for the period october 1 1978 through december 31 1986 the average time was 24 months between 1987 and 1990 the average was 51 months in fy1990 the average was 56 months for 53 studies64 in 62 executive office of the president us office

reported that over the past five years the average time to complete cost studies in dod was 25 months65 presumably these figures include the time necessary for planning the studies if so and if omb does not impose deadline for the planning phase then it is unclear how the 12month deadline will result in shorter studies furthermore the requirement to establish workload data collection system which an agency apparently must do during the planning phase if system is not already in place66 might impede an agencys efforts to complete study quickly the circular does not address the issue of the amount of time for data collection apparently agencies will determine how many weeks or months of data they will need to collect prior to starting competition documentation that shows why studies take as long as they do or that indicates what amount of time is reasonable for producing quality competitions is lacking67 in the federal register notice for the 2002 proposed revision to the circular omb suggested that agencies have great deal of control over the duration of competitions and that managers often unnecessarily draw out competitions without consequence68 if reluctance on the part of agencies is primary reason why a76 studies take as long to complete as they do then the tightened deadlines may be realistic however other factors might play role too gao has found that in addition to the failure of agencies to place sufficiently high priority on cost studies the absence of skills needed to prepare the statement of work and work load data needed to define work requirements in the function being studied contributed to delays in completing cost studies 69 in its initial report on competitive sourcing results dated may 2004 omb stated the timeframes in the new circular are motivating agencies to carry out their commitments in timely manner for example the department of health and human services hhs reports that it completed streamlined competitions within threemonth timeframes and standard competitions within year equally important these timeframes are not causing agencies to sacrifice quality decision making competitive sourcing efforts by hhs have

competitions and the pace at which they are to be completed presumably will increase the number of contracts agencies must monitor the issuance of letters of obligation where the government wins the competition will likely add to an agencys contract monitoring workload83 whether agencies have sufficient resources to fulfill competitive sourcing and circular a76 requirements in timely manner is unknown two senior government officials have expressed their concerns on this issue at the department of justice paul corts assistant attorney general for administration reportedly said we do not have the resources to prepare the justifications and particularly for the number of criticisms this process would invite from contractors 84 according to the washington post the director of the national park service nps stated in memorandum dated april 4 2003 we do not have fund source to cover the cost of completing these a76 studies the costs are too significant to be covered by the affected parts as some in the interior department have suggested nps anticipated that the cost of consultants needed to conduct studies would reach 25 to 3 million and that as result there would be serious consequences for visitor services and seasonal operations 85 the list of needed resources could include agency employees who have circular a76 experience or experience preparing bids and proposals funding to hire contractors to conduct a76 studies and sufficient numbers of agency personnel qualified to monitor contracts also unknown is whether additional resources will be provided to agencies to help them meet these requirements lack of sufficient resources could affect the quality of a76 studies and the effectiveness of contract monitoring efforts possible implication of insufficient resources could be preference on the part of agencies for streamlined competitions under which meos are not required over standard competitions if an agency elected to handle the increased competitive sourcing workload by diverting greater numbers of employees to a76 studies the normal work these employees perform might have to be deferred robert kugelman head of the commerce departments office of executive budgeting and management in comment in federal times acknowledged this problem the bottom line is really about finding ways to do things more effectively but doing that while still performing your job can be daunting 86 finally there is indication of how omb might respond to agencies that are unable because of inadequate resources to meet all of the competitive sourcing

designing an meo is one of the steps in the publicprivate competition process87 designing an meo that is competitive88 might help to ensure that competition between government agency and private sector sources is carried out on level playing field in its recommendation for developing an integrated competition process process that would combine elements of circular a76 and the federal acquisition regulation the commercial activities panel noted as with most efficient organizations under a76 federal employees should be able to propose process improvements and efficiencies and be supported in that effort federal employees involved in submission of an inhouse offer also should receive assistance in planning for competition preparing proposal conducting discussions attending debriefing and filing protest inhouse teams should receive reasonable consideration and support from management in their efforts to participate in competitions wh ere there is an inhouse workforce currently performing it would be expected that management generally will authorize inhouse submission of proposal which includes commitment of resources for proposal with reasonable prospect of award which may include increasing staff or making capital investments 89 in addition to the knowledge necessary to perform their jobs employees may need the assistance of management experts to redesign the workspace reengineer processes and identify capital improvements the 2003 circular acknowledges the types of studies and analyses which can be used to develop an meo the meo is an agencys staffing plan as iden tified in the agency tender the meo is not usually representation of the incumbent organization but is the product of management analyses that include but are not limited to activity based costing business case analysis consolidation functionality assessment industrial engineering market research productivity assessment reengineering reinvention utilization studies and value engineering 90 the federal register notice acknowledged the need for technical assistance to be provided to the agency tender official but it does not require the agency to provide the necessary support through either agency personnel or outside sources the revised circular like the proposed circular recognizes the talents of the federal workforce the conditions under which it operates and the importance of providing the workforce with adequate training and technical support during the competition process to ensure it is able to compete effectively in this regard the revised circular requires that the ato agency tender official have access to available resources eg skilled manpower funding necessary to develop competitive agency tender 91 87 under standard competition an meo is

personnel responsible for developing an agency tender including an meo immediately following the list of ato responsibilities the circular states an agency shall ensure that the to has access to available resources eg skilled manpower funding necessary to develop competitive agency tender93 the circular does not identify who within the agency whether particular office or official should be responsible for ensuring that the ato receives needed resources in appendix b of the revision under the heading competition officials one is identified as having this responsibility94 what kind of or how much authority an ato might have in order to obtain the resources necessary to develop competitive agency tender is unknown the lack of specificity and the absence of requirement for agencies to provide sufficient resources as determined by the ato could affect implementation some questions that might arise include given that an agencys competitive sourcing official is responsible for implementing the circular why was this official not identified as the responsible party for providing resources to the ato what might happen if an to believes the agency is not providing sufficient resources what recourse if any might the ato have who in the agency would be held responsible could claim that the circular levels the playing field be sustained if preparation for and development of agency tenders were underfunded how might dispute over the type quality or quantity of agency resources provided to the agency tender effort affect the legitimacy of competition what costs might an agency incur for preparing inventories conducting competitions and establishing meos where the government has won the competition in its may 2004 report on competitive sourcing results omb stated that the success of most efficient organizations in winning publicprivate competitions in fy2003 suggests that agencies are taking steps envisioned by the revised circular to ensure government providers have fair opportunity to demonstrate their capability to serve the taxpayer 95 requiring agencies to ensure that their inhouse providers have access to available resources eg skilled manpower funding necessary to develop competitive agency tenders is one of the steps credited to the 2003 circular other steps or factors cited by omb and included in the 2003 circular were eliminating direct

success of inhouse efforts to in part the provision of resources by agencies might not accurately reflect the extent of inhouse support for meos other possibly more accurate measur of agency support might include the amount of funds expended on training the number of agency personnel who have been trained documentation of services for example reorganization workload analysis or reengineering provided to the meo or the type and extent of support requested by the ato compared to what was provided by the agency generally unless costtechnical tradeoff tradeoff between cost and noncost factors source selection method has been used the prospective provider that is government agency or contractor whose offer promises to yield greater savings will be awarded contract private business or letter of obligation meo omb has noted that savings were largely attributable to reductions in federal labor costs but they also may be derived in other ways one interpretation of this statement is that savings resulted mostly from reduction in the number of an agencys ftes as result of an a76 competition 97 if this is an accurate statement then it might be helpful to ask how an agency determined that smaller number of ftes could perform the work related issue is the question of whether fewer ftes are required by the meo because the scope of work as documented in the performance work statement pws has been decreased in short it is not clear that ombs suggestion that agency provided resources are factor in successful competitions accurately portrays what has occurred or is occurring other factors may need to be taken into account and it appears there are other possibly more accurate ways to measure the amount of agency support provided to meos lessons learned document prepared by two employees of the justice department who participated in an a76 competition addressed among other things an meos need for resources they wrote establish budget that covers meo expenses throughout the competition and seek independent authority for the ato to expend those funds in the early planning stage establishing an accurate budget may be difficult for an meo team because of so many unknown factors with this in mind create budget that provides flexibility and allows for maximum amount of outside support in the event it is needed include funding for separate space to house the meo team also include funds for general office and other supplies that might be particularly useful in developing proposals eg flipcharts overhead projectors 98 the coauthors also advise that the meo team may face challenges in obtaining needed resources keep the lines of communication with management open and remind them the meo team is not their opponent the competition may create tug of war for resources needed to support both meo team activities and ongoing operations this struggle for resources combined with the physical separation of the meo team may impede communications with management and result in an us versus them mentality standing up for meo team rights 96 ibid pp 910 97 when contractor wins competition the ftes associat ed with government function or activity are eliminated when government agency wins competition the number of ftes associated with particular function or activity might be decreased decrease would occur if the meos staffing plan includes fewer ftes than the number employed prior to the implementation of the meo 98 bob miller and nancy chamberlin most efficient organiza tion teams lessons learned and best practices nd available at httpwwwgovexeccom

competition process and even after performance decision has been made there are various milestones where circumstances or decisions could affect federal employees andor their positions for instance when an agency cannot complete streamlined or standard competition within the allotted time maximum of 135 days and 18 months respectively if the cso has granted time limit waiver the circular provides guidance on what the agency should do in the former case the agency has the option of converting the streamlined competition to standard competition or requesting an additional extension from omb using the circulars deviation procedure 100 if an agency exceeds the time limit for standard competition the cso is to notify ombs deputy director for management in writing101 the circular mentions possible consequences for the failure to meet the 12 or 18month time limit however the ofpp administrator reportedly suggested that agencies that fall behind in their competitions will undergo sharp scrutiny by omb and if inhouse employees fail to submit proposal on time their jobs could be directly outsourced to the private sector 102 if this sequence of events were to occur it is unclear what would happen to the employees who otherwise would have staffed the meo included in the agency tender one of the changes effected by the 2003 revision is the establishment of an evaluation process that applies the same criteria to contractor offers and agency tenders and generally treats sources from both sectors the same coupled with this change is move to use in addition to sealed bidding source selection processes that allow offerors under certain conditions to correct deficiencies in and resubmit their offers 103 because of this package of changes an agency tender could be dropped from further consideration before performance decision is made previously under the 1999 circular an agencys inhouse cost estimate was included in the performance decision calculation as for private sector contractors there has been change in how their offers are treated their offers have been and continue to be susceptible to elimination for failure to correct deficiencies the applicable

agency tender from the standard competition if the co determines that private sector offeror or public reimbursable tender official has not corrected material deficiency the ssa may exclude the private sector offer or public reimbursable tender from the standard competition 104 in cases where performance decision results in the awarding of contract to private sector offeror federal employees have right of first refusal for positions with the successful offeror the following clause must be inserted in solicitations that might result in the conversion of work from the government to contractor and must be inserted in contracts that result from solicitations whether or not cost comparison was conducted according to 48 cfr 522073 the contractor shall give government employees who have been or will be adversely affected or separated as result of award of this contract the right of first refusal for employment openings under the contract in positions for which they are qualified if that employment is consistent with postgovernment employment conflict of interest standards b within 10 days after contract award the contracting officer will provide to the contractor list of all government employees who have been or will be adversely affected or separated as result of award of this contract c the contractor shall report to the contracting officer the names of individuals identified on the list who are hired within 90 days after contract performance begins this report shall be forwarded within 120 days after contract performance begins as with the 1999 circular the contractor determines who is qualified105 it is possible then that an individual who is qualified as far as the agency is concerned might not meet contractors qualifications and thus would not be offered job under the 2002 proposed revision the government would have been allowed to tell contractor whom to hire the agencys human resource adviser would have determined which government employees were qualified and the contractor would have been required to offer these individuals employment before hiring new employees or transferring existing employees 106 in effect the right of first refusal clause is limited safeguard in that it does not guarantee that all federal employees will be offered jobs with the contractor on the other hand it is unclear under what authority aside from the 2002 proposed revision to the circular the government would be able to dictate to contractors whom they should hire consider for example competition that the government wins the meo is established and begins performing the work as described in the pws the prospect of recompetition at the end of the letter of obligations performance period could affect employees decisions to leave or remain with their agencies the question is whether attrition would occur less frequently more 104 us office of management and budget circular a76 revised may 29 2003 pp b15b16 105 us office of management and

recruiting and retaining topnotch people for government service 107 under another scenario where the agency tender is selected and the meo is established it is possible the meo could be terminated for failure to perform108 the circular states upon terminating an meo letter of obligation an agency shall change the inventory coding to reflect that the activity is longer performed by an meo and shall perform either streamlined competition or standard competition109 under the temporary remedies for failure to perform the circular states if the co terminates contract feeforservice agreement or meo

sourcing initiative in early 2001 the administration has remained focused on publicprivate competition and the anticipated benefits of competition this commitment is accompanied by recognition that in the words of the administrator of the office of federal procurement policy federal employee s are some of the nations most highly trained and dedicated employees114 the administrator also acknowledged that competitive sourcing asks agencies to make some difficult choices these choices affect real jobs held by dedicated and loyal career civil servants in many respects this initiative comes down to one simple reality very few people whether they are working in the private sector or the public sector like to work under the pressure of knowing that their work is on the line if they do not figure out how to perform it more efficiently and effectively but the fact that this initiative requires hard choices and lot of hard work makes it an initiative that can 112 ibid pp 1 b2b3 b6b7 113

the federal government is managed115 some commentators have different perspective on competitive sourcing and the civil service noting that it might have significant implications for the civil service as an institution donald kettl professor of public affairs and political science at the university of wisconsinmadison said the bedrock of the civil service has long been neutral competence and strong expertise grounded in career service staging regular competitions would undermine the commitment to career service especially if the scope of services and the standards for competition shift over time and in the process put more federal workers at risk 116 as more competitions are carried out which presumably could result in more government work going to contractors it is unclear how the neutral competence and strong expertise of the civil service might be affected yet another scholar dan guttman who is fellow with the national academy of public administration raises different issue both the clintongore reinventing government initiative and the bush management agenda aim to render civil servants more contractor like but do so with little or reflection on the fact that our longstanding laws do not now provide for the blurring of the boundaries between official and contractor status 117 g6g146g159g142g155g156g146g157g162g561 another unanswered question about the administrations competitive sourcing program is how the implementation of the 2003 circular coupled with agencies efforts to meet their targets might affect the diversity of the federal workforce some agency managers reportedly have voiced concerns about this issue the assistant secretary of planning and evaluation for the department of veterans affairs v reportedly stated that within the v there are numerous occupations such as maintenance laundry and food service that could be competitively bid however these occupations have the highest proportions of women and minorities and any significant effort to outsource these jobs will have huge diversity implications118 news article reported that the national park service director in an april 4 2003 memorandum said that job competitions in washington and san francisco may affect the diversity of our workforce119 it is difficult to know how competitive sourcing policy has or might affect the diversity of the federal workforce since it appears that
