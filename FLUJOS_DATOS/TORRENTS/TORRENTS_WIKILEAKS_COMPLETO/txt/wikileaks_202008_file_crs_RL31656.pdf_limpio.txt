contractproject officer prepared by the lyndon b johnson school of public affairs the university of texas at austinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31656survey of recent state policies to manage growth and protect open space summary many states have been actively addressi ng the closelyrelated issues of sprawl and loss of open space in recent years by working to manage growth and protect remaining open spaces the mix of issues and levels of activity vary widely from state to state many members of congress are interested in these state efforts because federal polices and programs have impacts on these issues both direct and indirect and both positive and negative federal policies and programs with an impact include transportation housing th environment and agriculture among others and others have importa nt but less direct effects such as the federal tax code some federal programs provide positive assistance to states that are trying to address these issues while others may support incompatible activitie s congressional deliberations generally have given limited consideration to how decisions on federal policies might affect spra wl and loss of open space although both have become prominent topics in more states and comm unities in recent years some members of congress also may be interested in states as incubators of innovative approaches to public policy that might serve as models for future national policies crs contracted with the lyndon b j ohnson sc hool of public policy at the university of texas at austin lbj sc hool to survey every state and compile catalogue of state efforts that have b een initiated or amended since 1990 the lbj school returned this compilation to cont act in each state for final review for completeness and accuracy before it was submitted to crs this report identifies and compares the recent state efforts and pres ents some of the reasons for resurgent interest in addressing this suite of topics in many states it also discusses the effectiveness of these efforts where evaluati ons or analyses could be found it draws not only from the lbj school survey but also reviews of literature and other sources appendix iii is narrative summary of each state introducing major programs and activities drawn from the same sources the lbj school also prepared table summary for each of the 354 programs that it identified through the survey and related inform ationgathering activities the lbj school students determined that the overall level of interest and activity on managing growth and protecting open space is high that issues vary widely and that approaches and resources committed to address these issues vary greatly the state efforts are responses to problems they are concentr ated in states where sprawl and loss of open space have been most pronounced ho w states have res ponded also reflects how responsibilities are spread among state agencies how they are divided between state and lower units of government and resource management and land use planning traditions places where there has been ss economic or population growth in recent years have found little reason to act according to this survey congressional interest reflects the same geographic pattern as most of the interested members represent the east coast great lakes and west coast states this interest is bipartisan and generally reflects what is occurring in the district or state than broader ideologies this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31656contents introduction 1 causes of unmanaged growth and open

research experience and to culminate in final research product for client this prp involved 18 students from the master of public affairs program two professors served as project directors 2 sprawl is typically characterized by low density development distant from citys urban core and often consists of noncontiguous deve lopment or isolated singlefamily homes typically uncoordinated this type of developmen t leads to singleusage of land rather than more concentrated mix of residential commercial and other uses many academics planning professionals and inte rest groups have presented similar definitions of sprawl 3 open space includes three subsets productive land environmentally significant areas and green space productive land includes farm and agricultural lands and resource lands such as forests environmentally significant areas include wildlife habitats wetlands and coastal lands green spaces include public open space inside urban areas such as parks and large tracts of undeveloped lands outside urban areas survey of recent state policies to manage growth and protect open space1 introduction this report describes the policy approaches each us state has adopted since 1990 to address the closelyrelated issues of managing growth in order to minimize sprawl2 and protecting remaining open space fro m being converted to other uses 3 both issues are addressed by trying to manage the use and allocation of land and resources in sociallybeneficial ways under the us federal system land use management is principally an issue addresse d by state and local governments given that state governments define powers and au thority of local governments this study concentrates on state government legisla tion including policies that empower local governments enhance the power of existing state agencies strengthen or create new regulations encourage regi onal cooperation and initiate land mana gement studies sprawl and open space loss are of concern to growing number of both governmental and nongovernmental orga nizations while land use planning resonates with most states this power and responsibility has traditionally been delegated to localities through state laws such as zoning enabling laws and home rule authority local governments proximity to the issues of land use growth management and open space protection make them the most affected level of government they are responsible for cal infrastructure and service delivery as well as preserving open space and dealing w ith blighted inner cities while some communities have begun to tackle these important land use issues there is broad lack of knowledge concerning the issues and costs of unmanaged growth and manyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31656crs2 4 the survey contacted only people who

adoption andor amendment description of the program and its approach the source of f unding and evaluations or assessments of the policy communities have avoided making the politically and technically challenging commitments required to alter growth patterns historically the federal governments role in land use was focused primarily on federally owned lands largel acquired when the wester n regions were annexed to the united states in the nineteenth century however with increasing urbanization and the new societal needs of the twentieth century the federal government initiated numerous programs that today affect land use patterns in multitude of ways policies in transportation housing agricultu re and the environment among others play significant role in how land is deve loped and used some within the federal government have been taking an active in terest in how federa l policy and programs affect land use and how they can better enable localities and states to manage growth and preserve open space generally under the moniker smart growth this interest was raised to the presidential level during the clinton administration the next two subsections introduce some of the causes of unmanaged growth and open space loss and some of the costs th at result generalizing about these two topics is challenge because two places ar identical in addition these topics are viewed differently by people based on their perspective and interest following these subsections are sections th at provide an overview of four topics where federal policies and programs can affect patterns of change and that compare state perspectives on managing growth and prot ecting open space using materials collected through the survey including comparisons of responses from governmental and nongovernmental representatives4 appendix i describes the research method and process appendix ii descri bes key terms used in th survey and appendix iii summarizes the laws and activities in each

and economic factors in the united states are preference for owning detached singlefamily homes with yards almost universal car ownershi p and rising standard of living homeownership is an objective desired by most americans when financially feasible most people will purchase home while homeownership itself does not cause sprawl or the loss of open space th location and concentration of new and existing residential developments largely determine the land use patterns in an area developers try to measure the market and build homes that will sell and provide the desired rate of return when

management pr inciples and practices chicago american planni ng association 1995 p 96virtually universal car ownership has fundamentally changed the patterns of land development in american communities car ownership has facilitated residential expansion into once isolated undeveloped areas with land prices in these outlying areas lower than in areas closer to the urban core consumers will consider purchasing land and buildin g homes in these lessdense areas the overall rising standard of living pa rticularly since the end of world war ii has enabled more americans to attain homeownership the purchase of home involves the consideration of factors that typically includes some mix of price convenience and safety w ith land prices in outlying areas comparatively inexpensive and factoring in ease of travel and perceive d safety cities have experienced dispersal of their populati on to less developed areas although the provision of infrastructure is more expens ive in outlying and undeveloped areas than in alreadydeveloped areas these costs are likely to be averaged among all residents who are served by the same provider when costs are averaged those further from the center city do not incur the true cost of services and infrastructure thus lowering the cost of living further from the urban core federal state and local public policies in areas such as transportation housing and land use also can encourage or cause urban sprawl and open space loss as discussed below unintended impacts of fe deral policy affect patterns of urban development federal transportation policy is often cited as leading to the expansion of roads and the highway system opening rural lands and other lowerdensity areas to development by improving access to cen ter cities with lessexpensive land in lowerdensity areas homebuyers are able to buy larger plots of land than they would be able to in higherdensity areas federal housing policy can influence land use patterns in multiple ways such as encouraging and rewarding singlefamily homeownership over denser multifamily hous ing these singlefamily homes are often built away from the citys central core further proliferating sprawl and the destruction of open space zoning and land use policy have also c ontributed to sprawl zoning rules initially emerged in the early part of the twentieth century as tool to separate incompatible land uses protecting ur ban centers from heavy industry and manufacturing plants ultimately these ru reinforced lowe r densities throughout communities today some of these rules seem inadequate to address prevalent development issues in many localities the original concept of zoning may still apply although the sharp separation of co mmercial industrial and residential uses may longer be desired or needed these rules may prevent practices such as mixeduse development and urban inf ill and suppress ur ban revitalization comprehensive planning tool that c ould be used to manage growth and protect open space remains nonexistent in ma ny areas and is inc onsistently applied in some places where it is used typi cally land use policie s have supported or allowed growth

prevent expansion of sprawl they have also led to the loss of open space including agricultural land and important habitat these policies while not the only ones that affect the expansion of sprawl have been large contributors costs of unmanaged growth and open space loss while the benefits of economic growth are obvious the costs imposed by sprawl are often less so loss of open space agricultural lands culturalhistorical sites and loss of natural resources including coastal lands are all part of the price of sprawl additional costs might include providing expensive infrastruct ure trying to improve blighted center cities and responding to decrease in some aspects of the quality of life these costs could be considered when land use and ot her policies are being formulated while communities can benefit from growth many experts believe that it is important that they effectively manage the way they grow if they desire to minimize the costs of sprawl and open space loss green spaces are lost as cities become less compact and expand to undeveloped lands if this growth takes place in an unconstrained and uncoordinated way development may be scattere d agricultural lands may be lost as developers build homes in rural farming areas subdividing agricultural land while the impact may not be felt immediately on the entire farming community as more farmland is purchased farming may become less viable in the area farming practices especially ones that result in noise and odors are often perceived as nuisances to the new homeowners creating conflicts and if fa rming is not protected the resolution of these conflicts can accelerate the rate of at which farmland is converted to other uses7 culturalhistorical sites also may be lost as residents leave center cities in the same way that general open space is lost these sites can become slowly consumed by lowdensity development areas deemed important by the community and by society as whole are ofte n unprotected from the destruction caused by lowdensity developments another cost of sprawl is the loss of natural resources as larger open spaces are either subdivided or c onverted to other uses wildlife habitats may be damaged wetlands can be degraded or stroyed forests and other resource lands may be lost and beach bay and estuary systems along coasts may become damaged without necessary protection one review summarizing numerous other studies estimated that re sponding by applying growth ma nagement systems can increase environmentally sensitive land savings by 20 or more in some communities8

storefronts vacan t office space and inactive streets healthy downtown areas are considered by many to be essential to the long term success of an overall re gion but many city governments have been unable to successfully protect their vitality in the face of urban flight degradation of quality of life in rural areas can result from unmanaged growth and open space loss with many residents living in outlying areas and commuting into town for work roads and highways have become congested the inability of the transportation system to meet the needed carrying capacity especially during morning and evening hours of peak dema nd frustrates and delays commuters and costs individuals and society valuable time the increase in car usage and distance traveled also increases autooriented emi ssions and may lead to decreased air and water quality in community11 loss of sense of community is anothe r potential cost of sprawl in lower density areas many residents live on larger plots of land that are substantial distances from the nearest neighbor combined with reliance on cars for transportation this greater distance often leads to less interacti on with neighbors many also live in new communities that lack tradition and events that bring residents together some experts view this combination of sprawl externalities as contributing to loss of social capital12 roles and relationships am ong levels of government traditionally land use planni ng and land use policy have been the responsibility of state and local governments before wo rld war ii the federal role in land use planning and management included little beyond managing federallyowned lands disposing of federal lands and dealing with land issues on piecemeal basis in policy areas such as housing and highways th magnitude and intensity of effects of federal actions on private lands were more limited in an era of smaller and less far reaching government programs and policies following world war ii however federal laws have increasingly affected policy decisions made by state and local governments for this reason this study and survey examined the intergovernmental context of land use planning and manageme nt while it is impossible to identify roles unique to each government level it is important to understand why different levels of government are involved in land use issues and what types of policy decisions they each make httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31656crs6 13 in dillons rule states the state give s municipalities only those powers and duties expressly detailed in their enabling legislation limited

federal spending on infrastructure highways for example and tax incentives for home ownership among others state programs and policies can also play many roles in land use by implementing statewide comprehensive plans intended to manage growth andor protect open space preserving historic sites protecting land from future development and promoting certain forms of development states authorize the creation of subs tate political jurisdictions cities counties and special districts and assign them powers and re sponsibilities local government powers and duties such as land use planning and regu lation are usually assigned by the state relationships between state and local leve ls are based on either dillons rule or home rule approach and the approach determines how much independence local governments have to act without state approval13 local governments generally deal with land development efforts that require land use regulation and the infrastructure issues that accompany new growth the federal governments role in these matters traditionally has been limited for many reasons the us constitution does not mention land use its only reference to what may be expressly deemed planning subject occurs in the bill of rights through the fifth amendments injunction against taki ng land for public purposes without just compensation14 other constraints include the sheer size of the united states and the variation in topography cu lture and economies further limiting the role of the national government is the political valu placed on both states rights and local government control most land use aut hority resides at the local level through zoning subdivision and building code powers which were assigned by most states to local government in the 1920s15 one level generally not extant is regi onal government in theory regional approach would seem like good scale for addressing many land use topics local governments could use this structure to co llaborate on concerns of mutual interest however regional framework is difficult to accomplish with the multitude of localities that comprise the typical metropo litan area in the united states who would each have to cede authority to regional entity moreover efforts to coordinate among localities in region can be complicat ed because the powers assigned to local governments can vary considerably as between counties cities and special use districts water authorities for example and because many metropolitan areas lie in more than single state even though land use is controlled largel by local governme nt several federal

interstate highway act federal gas tax revenue f unds very large portion of the total investment in new highwa construction by st local governments are expected to assume much higher percentage of investments in mass transit which allows cities to grow in more condensed area17 another example of the indirect effects of federal programs on growth are the fhainsured mortgages which date from the 1930s these mortgages have encouraged new housing on the suburban fringe as some lenders refused to insure mortgages on older houses in most urban neighborhoods thereby reinforcing resi dential

numerous other laws focusing on the environmental sensitivity of lands and resources were enacted especially in the late 1960s and early 1970s however these laws were not principally concerned with national growth ma nagement policy and most focused on single environmental issue such as water quality or endangered species22 these laws do not mandate land use planning at the state or local level nor do they balance land preservation with any goals of growth management such as economic development social equity infrastructure capacity or quality of life still these laws establish national concern for the effect s of land use and have been paralleled by enactments at the local and state levels the clinton administration supported major initiatives to promote smart growth at the federal level the liva bility agenda initiated in january 1999 aimed to provide local governments with more t ools and financial res ources to pursue open space and regional smart growth strategies the lands legacy initiative first proposed in fy 2000 sought to expand funding to programs associated with land acquisition and natural resource protec tion but would not have amended the programs themselves23 the bush administration has not aggressively pursued either initiative but has begun growth management campaign centrated in brownfield redevelopment24 in january 2002 president bush signed in to law the small bu siness liability relief and brownfields revita lization act pl 107118 which provides liability protection for prospective purchasers contiguous property ow ners and innocent landowners for the cleanup of brownfields this protection is intended to attract private developers who can develop these s ites often as infill projects within urban areas the bill also authoriz increased funding for st ate and local programs that assess and clean up brownfields25 numerous bills were introduced in the 107th congress to promote growth management and open space protection th most

the lbj school survey contacted the state director of the amer ican planning association to initially identify the appropriate experts to the degree that these respondents belong to groups that advocate planning they may not represent the full range of views some additional individuals who were suggested during initial contacts with state government and nonstate government representatives were contacted as wellpolicy in assisting states with growth management efforts see appendix i for review of the survey methods and particip ation numbers by state these answers which are opinions of the respondents provide insights into the satisfaction of states with federal policies affecting growth management respondents were asked if they agreed that federal policies of the past decade have been effective in preventing or minimizing urban sprawl an overwhelming majority of total re spondents either disagreed 59 or strongly disagreed 27 responses from two major subgroups into wh ich survey participants can be divided state government and nonstate government representatives were almost identical although 30 of the non state government pa rticipants strongly disagreed compared to 26 of state government respondents27 by contrast only 14 of all respondents agreed that the federal government has been effective in its growth management efforts but most of these 12 of the total strongly agreed state government respondents were slightly more positive th an nonstate government respondents in their view of the effectiveness of federal policies with 14 strongly agreeing that federal policy has proven ffective compared to 9 of nonstate government respondents this pattern of responses shows that many more state officials and others believe these policies have been ineffective however the survey did not seek further explanations for why they reached their conclusi on about the effectiveness of federal policies further examination of the effectiveness topic might begin with dialogue between those fe w states where respondents be lieve that fe deral policies have been effective and the federal government this di alogue could provide insight into how different implementation methods might affect the performance of federally initiated policies that influence growth management the next question asked respondents to br oadly evaluate how changes in federal growth management policy w ould affect urban growth in their state respondents were asked if there were changes in federal policy would sprawl in their state get better worse or stay the same about two thirds of the re spondents or 65 felt that urban sprawl would get worse however 76 of nonstate government respondents felt sprawl would get worse w ith changes while only 60 of state government respondents answered this wa these respondents may have felt that the federal government has be neficial role to play in the implementation of federal policies and without innova tion conditions in their states would deteriorate possible explanations for higher percentage of negative responses from nonstate government respondents are that 1 many of them are more likely to monitor the activities of the federal government and national policy debates that affect their concerns and 2 because they are outside state government some of them are likely to forcefully promote and seek publicity for their views httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31656crs10 28 percivel miller schroeder and leape environmental regulation law science and policy new york aspen law and business 2000 p 761roughly onethird of total respondents felt that sprawl would stay the same without changes in federal policy althoug h this includes only 24 of the nonstate government respondents this respons could indicate perceived lack of involvement and influence that the current federal policy has on sprawl and growth management some state gove rnment respondents might view sprawl as state issue and therefore federal policies are either unwanted or of limited importance while more nonstate government respondents ma identify strong associations between federal policies nd state actions only 3 of respondents felt that chan ge in federal polic would make growth management more effective in their state from this response one might conclude that these few individuals ar not pleased with the federal governments role and would rather have growth management policies left to the state or localities this response may reflect view that federal policy has detr imental effects on states urban growth and attempts to curb that gr owth interestingly not single nonstate government respondent chose this answer however there was insufficient time to seek out an explanation federal programs and land use patterns the majority of federal policies that were believed to impact state growth management efforts in the lbj school surv ey were in the areas of transportation housing environment and agriculture each is briefly introduced below the impact of federal policies in each of these four areas on land use is substantial survey respondents both complimented nd criticized federal efforts of the past and present in land use management they expressed mixed feelings toward the federal role in the future of growth management transportation federal transportation policies assert powerful force on state and local planning efforts transportation systems are also sometimes viewed as contributing to unmanaged growth patterns for example the sprawling development patterns found in many metropolitan areas would have been virtually impossible without the automobile nd modern highway systems thus transportation infrastructure is considered decisive factor in growth management and open space preservation issues state and local policymakers recognize this key role and increasingly look to transportati on policy as part of the solution recent increases in funding for mass transit sy stems demonstrate congressional recognition of the evolving relationship between fede ral transportation policies and local and metropolitan development patterns congress authorized the interstate high way system in 1956 in recognition of the value of the german autobahn system to the enemy during world war ii and the need for mobility to the postwar economy and if another war erupted this authorization led to the construction of 41000 miles of highways28 recent iterations of national transportation policy starting with the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act istea in 1991 pl 102240 initiated

policy the following funding provisions illustrate this point states spent 1 billion of an nnual 20 billion grant of federal highway funds on air pollution control projects spending on mass transit almost doubled from just over 3 billion in 1990 to close to 6 billion in 1999 and spending on bicycle and pedestrian projects grew from just over 7 million in 1990 to more than 222 million by 199929 another change gave much greater authority to metropolitan planning organizations mpos in determining how and when federal transportation dollars would be expended prior to istea mpos were said to generate socalled wish lists and state departments of transportation dots made the final decisions in the allocation of federal funding istea requi red that the federal government certify transportation planning in metropolitan areas with populations of greater than 200000 the certification process provided an assessment of how effectively each mpo worked with other transportation organizations local governments citizens and state dots to reach certain planning requirements30 the most recent iteration of these policie s enacted in 1998 in the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 sought even greater authority and flexibility for regional planning bodies in transportation planni ng tea21 includes new 120 million program known as the transportation and community and system preservation pilot program designed to explore innovative ways to integrate transportation and land use decisions to fight urban sprawl this program is one specific instance where the federal government offers assistance to manage growth furthermore the mpo certification pr ocess was amended to require public involvement it also requires the federa l government to renew the certification of mpos every two years in order to maintain full eligibility for federal funding thereby increasing the number of opport unities for public involvement number of the survey respondents indicated that istea and tea21 increased support for efficient land use planni ng yet despite these changes and the resulting optimism among many of those offi cials majority of respondents stated that federal government transportation policies are incompatible with growth management efforts majo rity also identified any highway funding that displaces spending for mass transit systems as major cause of urban sprawl majority of the survey respondents identified federal f unding for the development of new roads which often improves access to more land for development as major impediment to

transportation policie s continue to evolve housing housing policies are important to development patterns because residents take multip trips daily between their homes and jobs shopping schools and other destinations if their residence is long distance from their destinations they are more likely to be adding to pr oblems associated with growth if the residence is in new development it may also be contributing to loss of open space homeownership is very important go for most americans in 1992 survey americans surveyed favored owning home by margin of three to one choosing homeownership over retiring from their job 10 years earlier or taking better job in place where they would only be able to rent31 federal policies to support homeownership emerged in the 1930s today the policy to deduct interest payments on home mortgage loans is one of the countrys largest tax subsidies in this setting it should be surprise that the homeownership rate in the us is 662 according to the 2000 us census32 many positive aspects of federal housing policies contribute to making new homes easier to purchase while this helps first time home buyers and veterans the preference for new housing over the restora tion of existing housing has the potential to encourage development further away from downtowns where the land is less expensive and infrastructure must be installed to meet the needs of the incoming residents while existing homes are allowed to deteriorate when adequate public transit is not available which is more likely with new development longer and more frequent trips by auto can cause traffic congestion air pollution and other problems survey respondents consistently indicat ed that federal housing policy greatly influences land use patterns nd growth management most

act would create 20 federal income tax credit to homeowners who rehabilitate or buy qualified historic house up to maximum credit of 40000 more generally survey respondents identified legislation that w ould connect home ownership programs with growth management issues as one so lution to some of these problems environment federal environmental policie s and programs have affected growth management activities in states pecially since the late 1960s when the federal government became more actively involved in protecting the environment an example of the thinking at that time is comment by russell train the chairman of the council on environmental quality in the nixon administration commenting on that administrations proposal for federal land use policie s he stated that land use is the single most important element affecting the quality of our environment which remains substantially unaddressed as matter of national policy 33 subsequently while congress enacted laws to regulate aspects of environmental quality it has generally left land use or land quality regulation to the states examples of environmental legislation enacted or amended in the late 1960s and 1970s included the clean air and clean wa ter acts the coasta l zone management act czma the endangered species act the national environmental policy act nepa and the federal land policy management act the czma is the closest to national land use legislati on affecting private land as envisioned by many national leaders in the early 1970s it provides modest grants to coastal states including the great lakes states to encourage them to develop and implement coastal management plans and programs that improve the prot ection of sensitive shoreline resources to identify coastal areas appropr iate for development to designate areas hazardous to development and to improve public access to the coastline34 another incentive for state participation is requirement that all federal actions in or affecting coastal zones managed under federally approved plan must be cons istent with that plan in contrast with all the other environmental laws that protect specific places or resources including those listed above the national environm ental policy act of 1970 establishes process to consider th environmental ramif ications of proposed federal actions by requiring all federal agencies to prepare environmental impact analyses before they initiate actions that will have significant environmental effects in the 1990s the federal government b ecame interested in addressing growth management issues in part as they relate to resource protection and other environmentally sensitive issues congress amended the clean air act to strengthen the link between transportation policy and air quality requiring the integration of clean air act standards into transportation planning the clinton administration first proposed the lands legacy initiative with the fy2000 budget submission to substantially increase

federal initiatives states have also employed brownfield redevelopment policies to manage growth and preserve open space the active federal role in regulating certain activities to protect the

levels this study inqui red about the effectiveness and impacts of federal environmental legisla tion at the state level only 14 of the respondents claimed that federal environmental policies or lack thereof were impeding state efforts to manage sprawl among the identified impediments were federal regulation of wetlands coastal ar eas and waterways agriculture farmland in or near suburbs is affected by urban growth and by federal policies farmland lost to urban sprawl has been measured at one million acres year36 in economic terms the highest price for farmland will be paid to convert it to nonagricultural uses in or near urban areas this economic value can be at odds with the amenity and food pr oduction values attributed to farmland by protection advocates especia lly in some suburban areas urban sprawl encroaches upon farmland by inflating property values thereby making it extremely attractive for farmers to sell their land when developers make large offers urban sprawl also encro aches on farmland when developments expand near farms homeowners near farms may object to normal farming practices including the use of noisy machinery outsi normal workin g hours and spreading manure these incompatibilities can lead to nuisance lawsuits many states protect farmers from these actions with righttofarm laws federal policies affect ag ricultural land use and conve

usda to refocus many agriculture conservation programs to addre ssing water pollution37 due to the difficult nature of tracking non point pollution back to its source the fede ral government has struggled for years to find workable solution using provisions of the clean water act to regulate places where the most severe problems are found38 state policies and priorities overview and comparison state governments have become more central in addressing open space topics many of them have expanded planning fforts since the late 1960s in response to issues related to growth management and open space preservation some perceptions of state officials regarding these policies were discussed above while the effects of federal policies can be farreaching the primary policy tools for land use planning are found at the state and local level state governmentled efforts in this field were quite limited until the 1960s when some states started to find unacceptable the consequences of uncoordinated local land use policies some states began to implement policies to encourage localities to consider the effects of thei r land use decisions on the surrounding region and the state as whole common perception of this early state level planning was that only densely populated st ates were active in creatin g land management polices for example california began adopting new land use policy in the late sixties and early seventies39 long before the issue was even considered in many of the less populated states the survey re sponses indicate that most states have become active if not aggressive in the 1990s in pursuing growth ma nagement policies state involvement in growth management has been described as occurring in waves40 the first wave is characterized by concern for

implementation the incentives and disincen tives may include judicial review and regulatory sanctions as well as technical and financial assistance42 the most recent policy trend in many states comprehensive planning at the state level has emerged more strongly since th late 1980s integrated statewide planning encourages localities to consider issues beyond their boundaries and to coordinate their plans with other government units states can be distinguished by specific features of their comprehensive planning policies such as whether the plans are mandated or voluntary whether incentives and disincentives are included and the degree of regulatory authority granted to local planning entities43 many statelevel policies originate in the governors office in review of state governors

dimens ions results in table 1 show that 47 of the respondents believe that their state places equal weight on both issues however many responded that their states focus principally on open space 36

conservation programs were excluded because they were created before the 1990s and have not been significantly changed infrastructure management is an example of an issue that exemplifies the

approaches most commonly used are information provisiontechnical support market incentivesdisincentives nd grantsfunds the more frequent use of these three appoaches in contrast w ith the less frequent use of mandated local planning may suggest that states prefer to use inducements rather than mandating action or compliance it is possible that more aggressive approaches to many of these issues would have political consequences especially from adversely affected constituencies the popularity of these prima rily hands off approaches may also be explained by the relative autonomy they bestow on local governments in the realm of land use planning furthermore thes kinds of approaches may become even more attractive as fiscal c onstraints faced by many state governments start to limit

multipronged strategies for addressing these topics in establishing comprehe nsive plan government s would be required to integrate issues and probably to address them at multijurisdictional scale the reform of the tax system and adoption of market incentives may be seen as expanding opportunities to involve the private sector and in this process creating new or strengthened partnerships between government and nongovernment sectors one difference between the governme ntal and nongovernmental respondents occurred in the strength of preference for the two most frequent recommendations preferred by higher porti on of nongovernme ntal respondents second difference was that 3 government respondents reco mmended establishing or strengthening transfer of development rights laws while nonstate government respondents made this recommendation respondents were asked what recommenda tions they would make to state governments on means to better preserve open space recommendations were offered by

dgable respondents who either work within state government or work on these issues in those states these views were aggregated to identify the approaches used and the most critical considerations the mix of key issues nd approaches that emerge as priorities as states engage in managing growth and protecting open space varies widely with varied amounts of experience in growth management and ope n space preservation and differing degrees of urgency in addressing these issues states are positioning themselves along spectrum of state planning from emerging leaders to not active for some states where these issues began to be addressed 30 years ago and more recent policies are grafted onto many years of interest and we lldeveloped programs and approaches whereas others started taki ng their first ambitious steps in the 1990s useful lessons can be gleaned from comparing state activities examples of these lessons include the effectiveness of different approaches the ability to coordinate efforts that recognize the in terconnected nature of growth management issues and the capacity to calculate fis cal impacts of unplanned growth the amount of expertise states will be able to draw on can be expected to grow as new approaches are tested and implemented in more places experience from each state offers somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31656crs27 indication of the policy development challenges and the feasibility of particular approaches but the context including different political geographic social and economic characteristics may make direct transfers to other states difficult in these experiences the federal government often plays important roles however the federal role is seldom an isolated factor the research findings show that success requires that multiple governments linked both vertically and horizontally work together to resolve pressing problem s that transcend political boundaries statelevel analysis has yielded insights not only into the statewide policies and their outcomes but also to the limitations of trying to evaluate planning policies without also examining local and regional approaches to planning in addition the setting each state finds itself in is important the project research shows that the level of involvement in gr owth management and open space preservation issues is largely determined by these variables geography states with high propor tion of natural resource land or rich agricultural land threatened with conversion to other uses are more likely to preserve remaining land and place high value on resource land dramatic population growth states that experienced significant population growth and development in their urban centers sought to work cooperatively managing growth to minimize the impact on the peripheral regions and hinterlands political leadership states with gubernatorial support for comprehensive planning approach or other growth management policies were the most likely to see these policies implemented local politics also influenced the extent to which the state would attempt to impose and regulate its planning activities economic development goals many states have recognized the value of both strategic economic growth and minimizing the negative externalities of development encouraging local governments to engage actively in the full spectrum of issues related to the development of their community to consider the effects of this development on surrounding re gions and to coordinate with other units of government has become goal for many state programs that can have l ongterm economic benefits environmental concerns states with valuable natural resources are responsible for preserving these ssets in coordina tion with federal and local governments many states are also aware of the tourism benefits to their economy in pr eserving natural resource land managing fiscal impact states implementing growth management and open space preservation programs recognize that trying to accommodate unplanned growth has fiscal costs that may grow funding new infrastructure nd increasing tax burdens to accommodate development often stre sses the tax base and existing resources statelevel planning occurs primarily because localities and agencies find coordinating efforts or fac ilitating that process difficult without framework in place or regulated process state policies frequently encourage localities and agencies tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31656crs28 examine the statewide or regionwide impacts of their policies the state level is positioned to determine the overall planning and pres ervation goals within its boundaries and to recommend methods for implementing coordi nated solutions to growth issues it also has the authority to develop and implement approaches that are too large for political subdivisions to addre ss states use multiple approaches to address planning issues some approa ches are more effective than others ineffective policies reflect several limitations including policies and regulations that are put into place and not followed or diluted to the point of ineffectiveness policies and regulations that are not clearly understood or policies wit hout penalties policy focus varies across states within each state public fficials agencies ngos and various coalitions may disagree on priorities noneth eless smart growth initiatives task forces and commissions on state planning issues frequently stimulate productive dialogue and encourage units of government at every level to examine the impacts of existing planning policy frameworks one agency or layer of government acts in vacuum to addr ess growth management and open space preservation because they are interrelate d with many other public policy issues

do so in way that is sustainable and consistenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31656crs29 appendix i research methods and process the purpose of this study was to create an in ventory of state activities directly related to growth management and open space pr eservation that were enacted adopted or undertaken in some other way since 1990 and to be able to make observations about the effectiveness of these policies state activities were defined to include laws passed by state legislatures including significant amendments to existing laws voter initiatives programs initiated without explicit enabling legislation and executive orders the research team settled on broad definitions of growth mana gement and types of state responses when compiling this inventory the issues and appr oaches that were id entified illustrate the breadth of growth management and open space preservation techniques being used by states the research team decided to use survey to identify the relevant activities in every state staff at appropriate state agencies and experts affiliated with nonprofit organizations academics and professional organizations were identified as the target population to be invited to participate in the survey responses to this survey provid ed current information and some original material since survey r ecipients were asked to offer their personal assessment of state policies respondents co mpleting the survey could choose to remain anonymous this option was offered to encourage the highest level of candor in the responses and their candor helped separate issues of substantive policies from political ones most respondents chose anonymity and this report respects all such requests respondents were asked to rate the seriousness of urban sprawl and the loss of environmentally sensitive land issues in their stat particular attention was paid to federal policies that help or hinder states efforts detailed information on specific policies adopted or amended by states since 1990 was requeste d to facilitate this process list of previously identified policies was included in the survey an initial mailing was made in early november 2001 to 325 individuals empl oyed by states and nonprofits second mailing was sent out in early january 2002 to individuals who had not responded as well as to an additional 75 individuals total of 128 surveys were returned the table on the next page summarizes the mailings and response rates by state following the written survey telephone interview was conducted to solicit additional information during this interview questions were asked regarding implementation approaches outside assessments and individua ls own opinions on the effectiveness of the policies the interviews often identified dditional individuals who were sent the written survey and often interviewed by phone alternative sources of information complemented the survey and telephone interviews many state websites provided uptodate in formation on state policies and allowed for review of key agency reports and legislation internet searches provided additional information including inventories of state initiatives and studies of similar subjects nonprofit organization websites provided altern ative perspectives and legislative reviews library materials often were helpful in iden tifying laws that were not found elsewhere searches of other published materials including law review articles and newspaper archives were also used the study team encountered number of di fficulties while administering the survey the return rate for many states was lower than anticipated often the return rate was higher from program directors whether governmental or nongovernmental in smaller states in larger states program directors typically reque sted subordinates to complete the survey and this often resulted in the survey becoming misp laced in large departments forwarding the survey to an identified individual became

left the more substantive sections on specific policies blank also many recipients stated that the survey would take too long to complete the telephone survey also presented challenges because many potential participants were unavailable or difficult to contact frequently the telephon interviews required multiple calls yet information derived from the phone interviews wa s especially valuable as topics regarding triggering events policy effectiveness and assessments of statelevel commitments were discussed during the informationgathering process the research team consulted with henry richmond

governments pursue growth manageme nt and open space protection policies in multitude of ways the priority given to these issues and the policy instruments chosen vary substantially across states in order to prov ide consistent structure to these issues for this project number of categories and definiti ons had to be agreed to through the use of categories the relative importance of various issues and policy instruments can be established given that state governments r ecognize common categories or definitions the definitions used here reflect those used in academic and policy literature policy issues in managing and protecting open space one set of categories was created to disaggregate the general policy issues of managing growth and protecting open space each state law or program was cla ssified with respect to the specific type of land management concern addressed agricultural land concerns the preservation and viability of farmland and related farm operations understood as the practices that contribute to the production and preparation of crops livestock and livestock products coastal conservation concerns the preservation and development of any coastal area natural resource such as wetlands beaches and wildlife habitat culturalhistorical preservation concerns the continued existence and use of areas or entities of cultural or historical value ranging from single buildings and parks to farms and entire downtown areas hazardous places concerns land where use is limited by actual or potential natural hazards and environmental contamination or the perception of such contamination ex amples include floodplains seismic hazard zones abandoned mines factories and solid waste sites infrastructure management concerns the maintenance feasibility andor rehabilitation of existing infrastructure or the need for provisionplanning of new infrastructure land use management concerns the determination of how land is used as addressed through planning zoning and the like natural resource protection concerns the use of resource land environmentally sensitive areas and other critical open space that is not encompassed within other designations such as coastal or agricultural lands this designation includes but is not limited to the issues of general open space preservation wildlife habitat and wetlands and forest preservation urban redevelopment concerns the development needs of existing urban environments especially deteriorating areas and may relate to increasing urban densities downtown revitalization andor neighborhood preservation land

multiple approaches the presen tation of information on individual laws and programs allows for identification of multiple approaches the approaches are coordinated state agency planning collaborating

on information they accumulated during surveys interviews and related informationgathering activities the summaries vary widely reflecting both diversity in the levels of interest and types of activities among states each summary should be viewed as very brief introduction to an often complex set of laws programs policies and activities the many footnotes identify additional resources the summaries emphasize actions and initiatives that have occurred si nce 1990 in most states they focus on some combination of legislation and gubernatorial initiatives and on perspectives during the winter and spring of 2002 when the survey was conducted since the survey many states are adjusting their approaches because of diminishing state tax revenues and less economic growth and activity especially in locations domin ated by tech industries the effect of the economic downturn reportedly has placed signif icant constraints on some states especially in 200246 specific information about each identified program will be published in crs congressional distribution memo officials in each state received draft of information about their state and were asked to review it for accuracy and completeness alabama alabamas planning system is largely based on local control and consequently very few state laws address gr owth management the state has not pursued this avenue as vigorously as

forever wild program alabama commission on environmental initiatives and alabama geographical information council the forever wild program enacted in 1992 is the only program with an explicit concern for growth management or open space preservation this program sets aside land for permanent state ownership using portion of the interest earned on profits from the sale of offshore natural gas land

extension of the governors office and administers federal grants in th areas of job creation infrastructure public safety and energy efficiency and conservation alaska the role the state of alaska has ta ken since 1990 to protect its vast amounts of open space has principally been to enfo rce existing state environmental protection regulations to coordinate state efforts with fe deral programs and to enable local planning the federal government has strong role in determining the use of land in alaska since it owns over 66 of the state about onethird of this area is designated conservation units by federal laws such as the alaska nativ claims settlement act 1971 and the alaska national interest lands conservation act 1980 alaska now contains 60 of the land in the national parks system administered by the national park service and 86 of the landin the national wildlife refuge system admin istered by the fish and wildlife service the alaska department of environmental re sources

are likely to have im portant implications for managing growth and preserving open space arizona arizona is one of the fastestgrowing states in the nation despite demographic trends arizona took rather conservative approach to growth management and open space preservation policies until the late 1990s with the leadership of thegovernor arizonas legislature passed ma jor growth management acts

smarter plus act of 2000 arizona preservation initiative and arizona heritage fund local governments in arizona have historically been responsible for land use planning the arizona department of commerce throug h its community planning office monitors local activities although current statutes pr ovide little authority to enforce legislative mandates approximately 13 of arizonas land base is in state trust lands which were granted by the federal government when arizona became territory in 186355 the federal government retained extensive holdings and currently administers approximately 331million acres arizona experiences difficulty in trying to consolidate parcels under three distinct types of land ownership state trusts federal lands and privately owned lands for either managed growth or conservation purpos in the northern half of the state fragmented ownership divided among private pa rties federal and state lands and indian reservations has resulted in checkerboard devel opment patterns state officials believe that exchanging or purchasing federal lands would allow it to plan more effectively and manage growth but the federal government is often re luctant to trade or

communities could choose how they would like to pursue growing smarter initiatives it did not include enforcement orevaluation procedures to ensure that local governments complied with state policy in response to citizen initiatives and public demand growing smarter plus was passed in aspecial legislative session the governor desc ribed the plus act as making arizona national leader in land use and growth mana gement and praised the strong tools for managing growth it gave to localities 56 its primary tools are infill incentive districts purchase of development rights and required updating of zoning laws in order to be incompliance with the legislation it also uses urban service limits impact fees for development and active citizen participation in the approval of land use development plans yet critics of growing smarter plus claim that it provides incentive to participate consistency between neighboring cities or counties and means of evaluation the political controversy surrounding growing smarter plus has been fierce environmental groups have attempted to strengthen it by placing initiatives on the ballotin november 2001 for example citizens rejected proposition 202 which would havecreated local growth management plans including mandated growth boundaries after expressing significant support when it was first made public this defeat is an illuminatingexample of the political tugofwar currently ta king place as antisprawl sentiments vie with concerns about loss of local control on february 22 2001 the governor announced the creation of the growth management oversight council to monitor the effectiveness of arizonas growth management statutes and offer suggestions for their improvement 57 arizona appears to be entering new stage in its growth manageme nt and open space preservation agenda as it increases emphasis on improved enforcement nd monitoring of policies by increasing the authority of state and local officials the future of growth management

few of them indirectly address these issues for example the department of environmental quality addresses preservationthrough watershed management plans and the department of economic development

example minimum lot size requirements attempted to discourage individuals from purchas ing parcels of land too large for single family home and too small for farm by the 1980s the economy lagged and the momentumdiminished and few new pla nning statutes were created or old statutes amended in the 1990s the state experienced economic and population growth particularly in the southeastern region where milwaukee is located and in other urban centers which elevated interest in growth management and open space preservation features of previous land use policies were proving inadequate for

smart grow th law was combination of factors dealing with population and economic growth ddressing change at regional level and improving coordination among state agencies comprehensive planning has the potential to address all these pressures although results are largely still in the future the architects of the planning legislation strove to design strategy that would motivate local governments to consider both impacts outside their own bor ders and relationships between localities and agencies financial incentives are used to encourage thinking at regional or even statelevel the driving
