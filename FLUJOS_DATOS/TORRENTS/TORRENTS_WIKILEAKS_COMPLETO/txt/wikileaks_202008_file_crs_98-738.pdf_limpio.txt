three policy perspectives updated november 26 2008 larry parker and john blodgett specialists in energy and environmental policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738global climate change three policy perspectives summary the 1992 framework convention on climate change requires that signatories including the united states establish policies for constraining future emission levels of greenhouse gase s including carbon dioxide co2 the george h w bush clinton and george w bush administrations each drafted action plans in response to requirements of the convention these plan s have raised significant controversy and debate this debate intensified following the 1997 kyoto agreement which had it been ratified by the united states would have committed the united states to reduce greenhouse gases by 7 over fiveyear period 20082012 from specified baseline years controversy is inherent in part because of uncertaintie s about the likelihood and magnitude of possible future climate change the consequences for human well being and the costs and benefits of minimizing or adapting to possible climate change controversy also is driven by differences in how competing policy communities view the assumptions underlying approaches to this complex issue this paper examines three starting points from which us response to the convention is being framed these startin g points or policy lenses lead to divergent perceptions of the issue with re spect to uncertainty urgency costs and government roles they also imply diffe ring but overlapping processes and actions for possible implementation thus shap ing recommendations of policy advocates concerning the federal governments role in reducing greenhouse gases technological lens views environmental problems as the result of inappropriate or misused technologies the solutions to the problems lie in improving or correcting technology th implied governmental role would be to provide leadership and incentives for technological development an economic lens views environmental problems as the result of inappropriate or misleading market signals prices the solutions to the problems lie in ensuring that the prices of goods and services reflect their total co sts including environmental damages the implied governmental role w ould be to improve the functions of the market to include environmental costs so the private sector can respond efficiently an ecological lens views environmental problems as the result of indifference to or disregard for the planets ecosyst em on which all life depends the solutions to the problems lie in developing an understanding of and respect for that ecosystem and providing people with mech anisms to express that understanding in their daily choices the implied government role would be to support ecologically based education and values as well as to promote gr een products and processes for example through procurement policies efficiency standards and regulations some initiatives are underway all the pe rspectives are relevant in evaluating them and possible further policies the pur pose here is not to suggest that one lens is better than another but rather to articulate the implications of the differing perspectives in order to clarify terms of debate among diverse policy

policy perspectives introduction climate change policy actions are underway at state federal regional and international levels1 as party to the united nations framework convention on climate change the united states committed to the objective of achieving stabilization of greenhouse ga s concentrations in the tmosphere at level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic inte rference with the climate system and to preparing national action plans to address emissions of greenhouse gases2 the domestic debate intensified with the negotiations relating to the kyoto protocol agreed to in december 19973 specifically under the terms of the kyoto protocol the united states would have committed to reducing its average annual net carbonequivalent emi ssions of six gases carbon dioxide co2 nitrous oxide methane perfluorocarbons hydrofluorocar bons and sulfur hexafluoride by 7 below 1990 levels 1995 for the fluorinated gases over the fiveyear period 2008 2012 if it had been ratified by the senate the kyoto agreement would have moved the debate beyond the mix of study regrets4 and voluntary actions policies of the george h w bush clinton and george w bush administrations the clinton administration however ne ver submitted the kyoto protocol to the senate5 and subsequently president george w bush rejected it outright in lieuhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs2 5 continued requirements the clinton administration sign ed the agreement saying that costs would not be excessive particularly because it included emissions trading and joint implementation provisions and said it w ould be

proposed twopronged approach one to focus on fu rther research and velopment to better characterize global climate change and its causes the other to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per it of economic activity through voluntary actions6 in addition on july 27 2005 the bush admin istration announced formation of six nation asiapacific partnership on clean development and climate app7 with the goal of meeting national pollution reduc tion energy security and climate change concerns consistent with the principl of the framework convention on climate change unfccc through voluntary nonlegally binding framework for international cooperation8 additionally in may 2007 the president announced that the united states would convene meeting of the worlds major economies that are responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions held in september 2007 the final statements of the major economies meeting on energy security and climate change emphasized the need to integrate such meetings into the overall unfccc negotiations the us summary of the meeting focused on the aspirational nature of reduction goals reflecting the administrations rejection of mandatory reduction

community va lues perceptions of human progress and adaptability experience education and tr aining and outlook in how to cope with risks and uncertainty10 these differing perspectives of pe rsons affect their observations and interpretations of the issue influencing their decisions on whether policy interventions are necessary and if so what kinds of intervention at the same time personal perspectives can change new know ledge education andor moral suasion may impact on policymaking and individual and corporate beha vior and may also be necessary to create conditions for successfully implementing initiatives relating to climate change three lenses for viewing solutions the many personal proclivities and professional constructs that help shape an individuals perspectives on environmental issues in general and global climate change in particular can be grouped into three perspectives that affect proposed policies these perspectives whic h can intertwine and overlap are that environmental problems are the result of inappropriate or misused technologies and that the solutions to the problems lie in improving or correcting technology that environmental problems are the result of market failures and that the solutions to the problems lie in ensuring that market decisions take into account all costs including environmental damages and that environmental problems result from combination of ignorance of indifference to and even disr egard for the ecosystem on which human life ultimately depends as well as for the other living creatures that share the planet and that the solutions to environmental problems lie in developing an understanding of and respect for that ecosystem and in providing mechanisms for people to express the priority they place on the environment in their daily choiceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs4 11 further action on global climate change or setting policy of federal government role are options as well 12 hence the economic lens s hould not be confused with the academic discipline of economics nor the ecological lens with ecological science the frameworks are broader than any single discipline in corporating range of policyrelevant perspectives depending on the personal experiences and knowledge of the policymaker 13 see marco janssen and bert vries the battle of perspectives multiagent model with adaptive responses to climate change ecological economics 26 1998 4365 14 see for example thomas l friedman hot flat and crowded new york farrar straus and giroux 2008each of these perspectives can be cons idered lens through which individuals and policy communities view the issue lens that provides particular focus on the nature of the problem and for the kinds of actions to solve it11 for shorthand they might be termed the technological lens the economic lens and the ecological lens respectively each perspective and its associated po licy approaches generally are sufficiently distinct that dominating tendency in po licy options can be discerned as policy frameworks these lenses incorporate terminology and methods associated with diverse academic disciplines and professions including not only engineering economics and ecological sciences but also various social scie nces jurisprudence theology and others as policy frameworks they should not be confused with any one academic discipline or profession12 rather they are perspectives on policymaking on how to focus on policy issue while the lenses can be analyzed as distinct perspectives most of the time for most people they represent predilections rather than conscious alternatives13 the lenses differ primarily in what aspects of the issue come into focus resulting in some being magnified others obscured or even distorted the ppropriateness of this focusing is dependent on the characteristics of the specific issue and the orientation of the policymaker thus policymaker viewing global climate change through one lens say the technological lens is not necessarily disregarding economic or ecological factors although these factor s tend to lie outsi and may be less discernible than the more clear focus on technological options ultimately given the diversity of policymakers and the potential overlapping of viewpoints any global climate policy considered will likely involve mix of initiatives representing all of the perspectives14 such mix may reflect mutual accommodation as much as conscious agreem ent that combination of approaches better ensures progress toward mitigation goals the purpose here is not to suggest that one lens is superior to another but rather to artic ulate the differing perspectives in order to facilitate communication among different parties and interests technological lens background viewed through the technolog ical lens an environmental problem is an opportunity for ingenuity fo r technical fix this technologicallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs5 15 for more information see crs report rl34099 california waiver request to control greenhouse gases under the clean air act by james mccarthy and robert meltzdriven philosophy focuses on researc h development nd demonstration of technologies that ameliorate or eliminate the problem many uncertainties can be ignored if technology is available to rende r them irrelevant presumption underlying the pollution prevention concept for ex ample from this perspective policy entails the development nd commercialization of new technologies governments role can include basic research techni cal support financia l subsidies economic mechanisms or the imposition of requirements or standards that stimulate technological development and that cr eate markets for such technologies the relationship between environm ental protection and technological development was recognized early in th environmental deba tes and policymaking of the 1960s and 1970s particularly in th area of mobile source pollution control standards anticipated technological devel opment to achieve emissions reductions commonly called technologyforcing alt hough some in industry argued that this was not an efficient means of encourag ing technology particularly when the deadlines for compliance were shor t the process undoubtedly stimulated development regulatory mandates can directly stimulate the commercialization of technology by creating market opportunities thes mandates can be performancebased meet an emissions level or t echnologybased specify the performance of the technology used for example california and 14 ot her states have enacted legislation or regulations mandating that greenhouse gas emissions from new passenger vehicles be reduced by 22 in model year m 2012 and 30 in my2016 the degree to which these sorts of mandates have fo rced technologies has depended on the perceived seriousness of problems re sulting in accelerated time frames for development and in very high leve ls of required performance the ease of developing the needed technology nd the impact of anticipated costs on consumers15 along with the use of regulatory appr oach to forcing technology the federal government has also taken an active role in assisting pr ivate industry in developing pollution control technology some envi ronmentally important industries did not have strong research and development sectors in the late 1960s and 1970s or did not have ones that could easily be redirected toward pollution control this led to governmentally directed res earch and developmental effo rts toward pollution control technology for example the epa spent approximately 2 billion supporting development of feasible flue gas desulfurization fgd device for electric utility use to control sulfur oxides at that time late 1960s the utility industry had central research effort the electric power research institute epri was not started until 1972 and individual utilitie s devoted their engineering efforts to improving mechanical effici ency of generation not the che mical engineering necessary for desulfurization many utilities also were opposed to adding chemical process on their plants preferring othe r control techniques such as tall stacks and low sulfur coal the success of the governments efforts is indicated by the fact that the fgd device is now the performance and reliability standard by which new

ag designing solar economy washington dc worldwatch institute december 1990 p 5 control devices are measured16 the federal government has also promoted the development of hybrid electri c and fuel cell vehicles in the united states through joint governmentindustry research and development aimed at the introduction of high efficiency cars and trucks as well as tax incentives for the purchase of new advanced technology vehicles17 the technological lens reflects traditional american cando faith in technology and in the countrys ability to find technologyfix to meet the needs of most problems such an approach attempts to increase the effectiveness of technology so that social problems can be solved at little or additional cost consumers desires and needs are taken as given the technological response is an effort to achieve an acceptable level of environmental protection without unduly restricting the choices available to those consumers for example consumers want to drive viewed through the technolog ical lens policymakers see their role as making that activity less environmentally harmful at minimal cost to consumers not as restricting that desire or even necessarily as offering alternatives to driving such as mass transit efforts to diminish consumer use of the automobile would be seen as last resort the technological lens provides view of the economy in which technology permits consum ers to continue their preferred behaviors while concomitantly achieving environmental goals it is not necessary for consumers to change their behavior sign ificantly to adjust to th new reality of an environmental problem application to global climate change viewed through the technological lens global climate change is seen as problem requiring reorientation of the energy sector from carbonbased fossil fuel s to more environmentally friendly energy system based on renewables and conservation as stated by worldwatch institute the end of the fossil fuel age is now in sight as the world lurches from one energy crisis to another fossil fuel dependence threatens at every turn to derail the global economy or disrupt its environmental support systems if we are to ensure healthy and prosperous world for future generations only few decades remain to redirect the energy economy18 this view was reflected in speech of president clinton on april 21 1993 the challenge of global climate change must be clarion call not for more bureaucracy or regulation or unnecessary costs but inst ead for american ingenuity and creativity to produce the best and most energyeffici ent technology the focus on technology was evident in the clinton administra tions 1993 climate change action plan httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs7 19 william j clinton and albert gore jr

mandating cuts daily environment report june 5 2002 p a13these longterm policies must addre ss technologies of energy supply and use and condition markets for the longterm transition away from activities fuels and technologies that generate large emissions of greenhouse gases the policies contained in the action plan are directed primarily at creating effective markets for investments in exis ting or nearly commercially available technology that reduce gree nhouse gas emissions the core of long term strategy must ensure that constant stre am of improved technology is available and that market conditions are favorabl to their adoption the action plan is likely to stimulate modest accelerati on in technological development such gains will lay the foundation for the development of technologies that could contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in both the united states and abroad research and development into the technologies that could contribute to greenhouse gas emission reductions w ill be cr itical part of the long term effort19 these views were reiterated in president clintons 1998 6 b illion c limate change technology initiative as stated by then national economic council chair gene sperling we think that this climate change initiative package is very good example of what we spoke about when we said that there were winwin opportunities for positive incentives that would clearly show how we can address the issue of climate change and strengthen our economy at the same time20 this winwin perspective on climate change policy also represented the core of the george w bush administrations pproach the president stated that his alternative could grow our economy and at the same time th rough technologies improve our environment21 in supporting his new national climate change technology initiative he stated americas the leader in technology nd innovation we all believe technology offers great promise to significantly reduce emissions especially carbon capture storage and sequestration technologies so were creating the national climate change technology initiative to strengthen research at universities and national labs

costeffective thus impr oving the economy not penalizing it this winwin perspective appeared clearly in the george w bush administrations 2002 climate action report president george w bush said last year 2001 that technology offers great promise to signif icantly and costeffectively reduce emissions in the long term our national circumstan ces our prosperity and our diversity may shape our response to climate ch ange but our commitment to invest in innovative tec hnologies nd research will ensure the ccess of our response24 according to proponents the cost of tec hnological approach to the climate change issue appears to net out to zero or ev to save money depending on how the benefits from increased efficiency are estimated the technological lens tends to focu s costbenefit analysis on bottomup methodology that evaluates the relative costs of projected compliance techniques as summarized by national academy of sc iences technological costing develops estimates on the basis of variety of assumptions about the technical aspects together with estimates often more than guesses of the costs of implementing the required technology25 assumptions are technological in terms of technological performan ce economic in terms of costeffectiveness and behavioral in terms of penetration rates in the year 2000 does five national laboratories oak ridge lawrence berkeley

advanced scenarios and in both timeframes 2010 and 2020 the estimated annual energy bill savings exceed the sum of the annualized policy implementation costs and the incr emental technology

energy future november 2000 such conclusion raises the question if technological fixe s such as enhanced energy efficiency could actually save m oney why arent people voluntarily doing it now one possible answer is that the pr ojections are wrong th technological fixes are mirages and the market has correctly ignored them an alternative answer the one focused on by the technology lens is th at widespread commerc ialization of these technologies is blocked by technological economic or instituti onal barriers for example barrier might be that the initial cost of an energy efficient appliance is higher than lower efficiency alternative even though th lifetime cost is less this can be barrier to purchaser who is not aware of the comparative life time costs andor who cannot afford the upfront cost spite the longterm savings an activist viewing the problem through the technol ogy lens would look to methods for overcoming that barrier such as providing information on lifetime costs andor financial help technology proponents tend to look favorably on governmental assistance in overcoming such barriers this assistance can include public sector research development and demonstra tion efforts incentives to private enterprise through direct funding beneficial ta x treatment for research ex penditures and costsharing programs to help overcome technical ba rriers and to improve the conditions for commercialization gove rnmental subsidies to technol ogy regulatory interventions that create markets for new t echnologies and regulations to address institutional and market barriers such as energy efficiency labeling requirements some of these incentives eg hybrid and fuel cell vehicles tax credits were enacted as part of the energy policy act of 2005 and increased ergyrelated research and development funding was authorized by the energy independence and security act of 2007 key issue in lowcarbon technological devel opment has been volatile energy prices while high energy prices create investme nt opportunities in ne w technologies eg solar and wind generation of electricity alternative fuels for autos low priceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs10 28 see for example steven kelman what price incentives economists and the environment boston auburn publishing co 1981 diminish the attractiveness of those investment options as discussed in the next section car bon tax or capandtrade program could create more positive long term investment climate for energy alternatives by establishing predictable floor for prices of highcarbon energy sources the technology lens focuses attenti on on two basic issues what drives technological development and what barriers impede it from this perspective government can help stimulate the former and help remove the latter for those who envision technological fixes that can achieve environmental goals with minimal economic costs governmental intervention may be necessary antidote to market failures and unnecessary barriers but even for those who would rely primarily on markets and minimize the role of govern ment the technological perspective is considered optimistic dynamic and oriented toward the future economic lens background viewing environmental issu through an economic lens focuses attention on markets price signals and market imperfections in this view the recognition of environmental problems should lead to adjustments in market signals changing producers inputs nd handling of wastes as well as the composition and level of cons umer demand so as to ma ximize net social welfare cleaning the environment entails costs which can be weighe d against benefits the governments role in this scenario is to ensure the correct market signals to ensure correct signals the government can make consumers and producers aw are of information on economic costs and benefits adjust prices through taxes or fees and affect supply through tradeable pe rmits for products as with leaded gasoline in the early 1980s or fo r productionrelate d emissions as with sulfur dioxide emissions or through other marketoriented devices viewed through the economic lens the marketplace with the correct signals can operate to find the optimal solution economic considerations have been an ex plicit or implicit part of environmental policymaking since environmental quality b ecame federal issue in the 1960s the use of economic mechanisms to implement environmental goals was debated in the 1960s and early 1970s but usually rejected on various grounds28 excluding economic considerations fro m environmental protection proved difficult however as laws began to be implemented economic costs became increasingly consequential although generally masked under practical or feasibility concernshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs11 29 for background see crs report 94213 marketbased environmental management issues in implementation by john l moore et 30 steven kelman what price incentives economists and the environment boston auburn publishing co 1981 31 to facilitate the phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals required under the montreal protocol and subsequent amendments the united states imposed tax on the production or importation of certain chem icals including chlorofluoro carbons or cfcs in 1990 this tax was designed to supplement the allowance trading program that the epa had designed to implement the international agreements also inventories of certain cfcs held on january 1 of each year are subj ected to floor stocks taxas achievement of some nvironmental standards within specified deadlines proved impossible automobile standards were delayed ozone compliance was postponed and other issues were litigate d economic concepts began to reemerge in the debate over the environment with the need to extend deadlines and to provide more flexibility to polluters to achieve mandated standards29 the preferred economic approach to envi ronmental problems traditionally is the pollution tax economists observe that pollution imposes costs on society that are not incorporated in the price of the goods or services responsible for the pollution these are called external costs an ideal pollution tax internalizes these external costs by making the beneficiary of the polluting activity pay for the socially borne costs polluter pays as long as polluters find it costeffective to reduce their emissions to avoid paying the tax they would add pollution controls until further controls would have higher incremental costs than the tax likewise innovators would be encouraged to develop new technol ogy that reduce emissions at cost less than the pollution tax when the tax is set at the level at which the marginal costs of more control would equal the marginal benefits society gains by future reductions societys net welfare is maximized despite the theoretical benefits of the pollution tax methodology environmental taxes have received li mited practical use in the united states for technical as well as political reasons30 there are existing us models of an emissions tax although five european countries finla nd the netherlands sweden denmark and norway have carbonbased taxes the clos est us example is tax on chemicals that deplete stratospheric ozone 31 with the economists favor for pollution taxes not gaining policymakers adherence attention shifted to other economic mechanisms to increase polluters flexibility in achieving environmental st andards based upon regu lation unlike tax that focuses on the price demand for pollutant these mechanisms focus on the quantity supply of th pollutant permitted the tradeable allowance system for sulfur dioxide control in the acid rain program title iv of the clean air ac t amendments of 1990 represented significant step in the evolution of economic mechanisms commonly called caphttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs12 32 see crs report rl33799 climate change design approaches for greenhouse gas reduction program by larry parker 33 however emissions may not cause ambient levels to exceed the national ambient air quality standard for so2 regardless of how many allowances the owners of emitting facilities holdandtrade system the acid rain control pr ograms success has led to calls for use of similar system with other pollutants including carbon dioxide32 capandtrade program like title ivs is based on two premises first set amount of pollutant such as so2 emitted by human activities can be assimilated by the ecological system without undue harm thus the goal of the program is to put ceiling or cap on th total emissions of the pollutant rather than limit ambient concentrations second market in pollu tion rights between polluters is the most costeffective means of achieving given reduction this market in pollution rights or allowances each of which in the acid rain program is equal to one ton of so2 is designed so that owners of allowances can trade those allowances with other emitters who need them or retain bank them for fu ture use or sale thus the allowance has value and hence becomes in effect the price of emitting sulfur while marketbased mechanisms such as cap and trade are sometimes regarded as the private markets alternative to regulatory commandandcontrol program the interactions are more complex the socalled market for pollution rights would not exist if not for governmental role in altering what the market would do in the absence of governmental action if gove rnmental regulations did not restrict so2 emissions there would be need for so2 allowances government creates the market and defines the boundaries of accep table market responses under the so2 trading program facilities ma buy allowances to meet necessary reductions instead of installing equipment to control pollution33 the choice depends on cost by allowing polluters to choose th eir lowest cost abatement actions implementing environmental goals through market mechanisms represents general elevation of economic efficiency as the sine qua non of decisionmaking pragmatically achieving this efficiency presumes substantially complete knowledge by producers and consumers of costs abatement alternatives and product substitutions as well as substantial flexibility in achieving compliance the market approach simultaneously maintains the general principle of polluter pays as the underlying ethical rationale fo r the distribution of costs among parties through the market the polluter who pays includes not only the producer but also labor stockholders and the consum er who demands the produc t and who pays somewhat more for the embedded costs to control pollution those viewing environmental policy through the economic lens generally presume that governmental interference whether through subsidies or regulation should be minimal in reality the distri bution of impacts through the market often leads to calls for political interventions that compromise efficiency and the polluter pays principle the political process tends to weigh relevant differences between various groups affected by an environmen tal mandate and speci treatment may be deemed

economic lens reflects traditional american belief in individual choice and private markets given the correct pr ice signals producers and consumers will adjust their behavior accordingly this adjustment will be done in the most cost efficient manner and with minimum of governmental involvement consumers desires are seen as responsive to price th issue then is for th price to reflect the costs of relevant externalitie s with the right price supply and demand will find the level that maximizes social welfare34 policymakers using the economic lens see consumers and producers adjusting their be haviors to the new reality of an environmental problem by responding to th price signals that take into account particular environmental goal but this approach creates clear winners and losers in terms of who will profit and who will pay the tab as result policymakers adjust governmental intervention to achieve change at pace and impact that are socially and politically acceptable application to global climate change the economic lens focuses policymakers on marketbased approaches to address global climate change these include marketable permit allowance programs and various taxes fees and rebates as well as research and development education and market related information current proposals for controlling carbon di oxide and other greenhouse gas emissions center on

that attempts to be comprehensive or equitable39 these concerns multiply as the global nature of the climate change issue is considered along with other potential greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide40 in the view of most economists carbon tax would be the most efficient approach to controlling co2 emissions41 the approach is generally conceived as levy on natural gas petroleum and coal according to their carbon content in the approximate ratio of 06 to 08 to 10 respectively with the millions of emitters involved in controlling co2 the advantages of tax ar selfevident imposed on an input basis administrative burdens such as stack monitoring to determine compliance would be reduced also carbon tax w ould have the broad effect across the economy that some feel is necessary to achieve longterm reduc tions in emissions in other ways tax system merely changes the forum rather than the substance of the policy debate because paying an emissions tax becomes an alternative to controlling emissions the debate over the amount of reductions necessarily becomes debate over the level of tax imposed those wan ting large reductions quickly would want high tax imposed over short period of time those more concerned with the potential economic burden of carbon tax would want low tax imposed at later time with possible exceptions for various events taxing emissions basically would remain an implementation strategy policy determinations such as tax levels would require politicalregulatory decisions also tax would raise revenues the disposition of these revenues would significantly affect the economic and distributional impacts of the tax the difficulties in crafting carbon tax or multinational trading program should not be underestimated with the 19 97 kyoto

compliance phase of the european trading system has been adjusted to address some of the problems identified in the first phase resulting in more stable and mature market system42 more improvements are planned for the next phase beginning in 2013 the choice between tradeable permit approach and tax approach depends in part on ones sensitivity to the uncertainty in the benefits of reductions in greenhouse gases versus the uncertainty in the costs of the program those confident of the benefits to be received from reducing greenhouse gases tend to focus on the quantity of pollutants emitted and to argue for specific mandated emission level for example the kyoto agreement mandates specific allowable emission level based on historical baseline 19901995 depending on the gas for specific compliance period 20082012 while ceiling is pl aced on emissions ceiling is placed on control costs implementing such reduction program through marketbased scheme such as tradeable permit program would probably assure that the costs would be dealt with efficiently through the marketplace however those costs are not capped this is the approach used under the current so2 control program after decade results indicate that control costs under the so2 program are considerably less than they would have been under an alternative command nd control scheme however there is lid on the costs which may rise in the future as growth in electricity generation pushes against the cap on emissions alternatively tax in effect places ceiling on control costs although the actual reductions achieved are subject to some certainty for example if carbon tax of 100 ton were levied polluter would pay more than 100 ton to reduce carbon emissions thus under worstcase cond itions the program costs would be 100 ton however the actual reductions that ch tax might achieve would have to be estimated based on econo mic simulations or actual m onitoring reductions would not be guaranteed as any polluter could c hoose to pay the tax rather than to reduce emissions reductions could also vary ove r time as new technology or other events raise or lower the cost of reducing emissions carbon tax or tradeable permit progra m would affect ec onomic behavior in at least three ways 1 effectively reduce real income through higher prices and therefore reduce overall consumption of goods particularly in the shortterm 2 encourage manufacturers nd consumers to substitute less carbonintensive or carbon free energy sources for current carbonintensive ie fossil fuel energy sources and 3 encourage research nd

the carbon tax on the economy thus th impact of carbon tax on the economy would depend on combinati on of policies beyond just the level of the tax the tax level necessary to achieve given reduction is also subject to wide range of estimates the stanford energy modeling forum compared 13 models under series of control scenarios with common assumptions where possible including one that would have stabilized carbon emissions at 1990 levels by the year 200044 about half of the models studied estimated the carbon tax necessary to meet the stabilization target in the year 2000 to be about 30 per ton or less while the other half estimated the necessary carbon tax to be about 100 or more further studies by the stanford energy modeling forum on the cost to comply with the kyoto protocol and on the global compliance cost of various stabilization scenarios resulted in similarly wide range of estimated tax levels45 because the problem of greenhouse ga s emissions is seen in terms of internalizing currently external cost the economic lens implies that the marketplace is the most efficient means of controlling undesirable pollutants the private sector can solve the problem if given sufficient incentive with minimal governmental interference the governments role prima rily consists of providing marketbased signal to private industry about the extern cost eg emission taxes

health and welfare such efforts can promote climate of opinion in which environmentally responsible decisions are socially ndorsed and environmen tally irresponsible decisions are stigmatized as not socially acceptable pollution protection gets on the national agenda not on the basis of affordab ility or whether control technology exists but because an environmental problem is recognized as threat to human health or welfare the ecological approach views the pr oblem of environmental policy implementation to be the moral educati on of individuals and institutions to the dimensions of the ecological crisis c hanging the climate in which decisions are made and providing opportunities for indi viduals and institutions to make decisions based on ecological concerns rather than having those choices limited to alternatives dictated so lely by econom ic criteria application to global climate change one could argue that global climate change is the quintessential issue for an

in terms of support for educational endea vors as in support for nvironmental interest groups as well as through market choices ba sed on ecological impacts rather than on pure economic costs indeed these actions can go against prevailing economic or technological trends for example people may choose to pay more for product or service because it is perceived as being more green or climate friendly than alternatives based on trad itional economic or technologi cal considerations in sense customer preferences can outrun the marketplace by creating demand for product that producers did not anticipate in such cases economic and technological mechanisms follow the ecological imperative rather than defining limits to it as noted earlier some states now offer consumers green electricity alternative to conventionally produced electricity in response to consumer demand many actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases can serve multiple social ends such as energy conservation nd

viewed through the lenses the technological lens focuses atte ntion on the outcome of the innovation actions are justified if they resolve th pollution problem and costs and benefits should be weighed in terms of the outcome not in terms of the transitional costs in contrast those viewing the issue through the economic lens tend to focus on costs and benefits as the critical metric for evaluating policies actions are justified when the benefits outweigh the costs but not otherwise the ecological perspective basically suggests that policy choices can be based on recognition of rights rather than costs and benefits the principles of protecting life and of preserving the ecosystem for future gene rations govern choices these differing viewpoints have implications for the timing and focus of invested resources looking through the technological lens policymaker would focus on investing resources directly in technical options some investment in understanding the problem may be necessary to delineate technical options but new technologies may make extensive research in understanding the problem moot as when process change eliminates use of chemical of concern looking through the economic lens policymaker would typically first invest resources in understanding the problem and the costs and benefits of alternatives that assessment would reveal whether society would be better off adopting policies and committing resources to action eg to re duce carbon dioxide emissions looking through the ecological lens policymaker who perceives risk to health andor ecological systems would tend to prom ote immediate action investments in understanding the problem and the costs nd benefits would be undertaken only to the extent appropriate to ensure costeff ectiveness of those actions because the ecological lens portrays benefits larg ely in noneconomic terms sustainability equity efforts to quantify and monetize those benefits may be viewed as inappropriate even immoral

analysis is on costeffectiveness of solutions not so much on the benefits of the policy economic lens the view through the economic lens fits the global climate change issue within the boundary of market economics the motivations of people in reducing pollution is unimportant the critical assumption is that people will act in their own selfinterest as dictated by price signals the global climate change issue becomes another consideration in setting prices an externality that needs to be internalized if that price increment does not result in significant reductions it is because none is economically justified under the economic lens the potential impacts of controlling greenhouse gases on the economy versus expected benefits is central variable in determining the degree and time frame of reductions econo mic efficiency is the primary criterion for assessing emission reducti on programs any existing inefficiencies in the economic system are assumed to reflect market reality and to be difficult to eliminate and eliminating them may be undesirable uncertainty about the potential benefits is understood to be factor in determining the stringen cy of any reduction program and potential reason for stretching out compliance for this lens costbenefit analysis is very important in assessing potential control programs to the extent that new technologies are projected to be costeffective and to overcome any existing market barriers or distortions they are included in the costbenefit analysis as viable alternatives to existing control options ecological lens those looking through the ecological lens are suspicious of attempts to measure the economic effects of global climate change options most efforts to measure economic effect involve comparing carbon control scenario with baseline projection the baseline genera lly is defined as the path the economy would take assuming changes attributable to adoption of climate change policies however the baseline also tends to connote path with distortion it is the path from which distortions are measured th is conveys some normative legitimacy on the baseline if global climate change arguments are correct then the current path is not sustainable in the long run and th baseline means little concern reflected in proposals to incorporate green accountin g into major economic indicators such as the gross domestic product gdp67 arguably if an ecological perspective returned the actual path to longterm sustainability that scenario would represent the more reasonable baseline discussions of economic growth and distortions are relative to ones perspective on the longterm potential for economic growth in world with increasing carbon dioxide concentrations commonly those looking through the eco logical lens tend to dismiss economic cost analysis and particularly costbenefit analysis as being of limited usefulness in the overall debate on global c limate change while acknowledging that they can have utility in developing and choosing specific options from the ecological perspective people should respond to the global climate ch ange crisis because of its threat to important values such as the

as welljustified on the basis of some narrowly fined costbenefit analysis traditionally such analysis tends to place value only on those benefits that can be easily quantified while dismissing or ignoring many values that would be seen as governing through the ecological lens viewed through the ecological lens lives and such values as intergenerational equity should not be quantified as commodity68 what people need are alternatives to many of the choices that the marketplace provides based on traditionally defined ec onomic considerations69 at the same time burgeoning area of study is ecological economics and in particular analyses to determine the economic benefits of ecosystems services which include climate regulation70 such studies may serve to defend environmental values that are rarely accounted for in traditi onal economic analyses they also provide another example of the inte rtwining of the viewpoints the role of science as viewed through the lenses although some would prefer that scie nce dictate the timing and magnitude of environmental policymaking scientific knowledge actua lly represents continuum of knowledge and uncertainty policy initiatives go forward when sufficient majority of the society concludes that what is known about the problem outweighs the uncertainties or that the risks of delay despite uncertainty are not acceptable in some cases increases in knowledge about an environmental problem lead to more uncertainty not less in other cases in creased knowledge about problem leads to widening the issue not narrowing it in the case of global climate change at least three parameters help determine how one is willing to balance the knowledge uncertainty aspect of science these three parameters involve one s perception of the potential risk of the problem the potential effectiveness of any reduction pr ogram and the potential cost of the solution if one perceives the potential risk of the problem to be slight the potential effectiveness of any response to be questionable andor th potential cost to be high one will tend to require high threshold with respect to scientific certainty before one is willing to act conversely if one per ceives the potential risk to be high the potential effectiveness of any response to be reasonable and the potential cost to be low one will likely be willing to act at substantially lower threshold with respect to scientific certaintyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs28 71 lester b lave and hadi dowlatabadi climate change the effects of personal beliefs and scientific uncertainty environmental science and technology vol 27 10 1993 pp 1968 1972each of the three lenses contributes to differing views on these parameters and on different courses of action for exampl being optimistic that energy efficiency can be gained at low cost the technology lens can accept somewhat lower threshold with respect to scientific certainty becau the risk of high cost is discounted likewise the ecological lens concern about unintended consequences and the protection of future generations lends itself to accepting lower threshold with respect to scientific certainty because of the precautionary need to protect the biosphere regardless of cost in contrast the economic ns leads one toward cost aversion response because the uncertainty may mean fewer benef its less effective response and potentially high cost those viewing the issue through this lens likely seek more certainty before any significant investment is made in any solution in study of the effects of personal beliefs and scientific uncertainty on climate change policy71 two researchers lave and dowlatabadi concluded that uncertainty and the degree of optimism of the decisionmaker were both important but less so than whether the policymakers decision criterion hinged on minimizing expected costs or on being as precautionary as po ssible the former criterion focused on costs essentially reflects the economic lens the latter focused on the precautionary principle essentially derives from the ecological lens in mix of scenarios lave and dowlatabadi found that those focuse d on minimizing expected costs would most often support moderate abatement given ex isting uncertainties while those focused on being precautionary would more often s upport stringent abatement despite costs this interplay of uncertainty info rmation and costs is summarized in table 2 the perspective on uncertainty can have tangible policy implications as evidenced by the ongoing debate between those who believe action to address global climate change is justified and those who do not federal policy as viewed through the lenses faced with fundamental problem ch as the potential for global climate change policymaker who is looking thr ough the technological lens and focusing on technical fixes tends to take an activist view of the governments role to support innovation and commercia lization in the same situation policymaker who is looking through the economic lens and fo cusing on the costs and benefits of action tends to view the governments role as limited to ensuring that any misfunctioning of the market is corrected and policym aker who is looking through the ecological lens and focusing on the need for action to solve the problem tends to see the government actively playing crucial roles to inform public understanding to seek public commitment and to make available options for solving the problem these differing propensities on the role of government among the three perspectives are summarized in table 3 as described in this report these differences have consequences for ones expectations for government action depending on the lens one views global climate change through at the same timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs29 these differing expectations can have c onsequences for how one views the lenses themselves that is persons with predisposition for limited government are likely to find the economic lens more appropriate way to approach the issue than the other two lenses whereas persons with pred isposition for activist government may be more comfortable with the tec hnology andor ecological lenses httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs30 table 2 influence of the lenses on policy parameters approachseriousness of problemrisk in developing mitigation programcosts technologicalby itself the lens is agnostic on the problem the focus of the lens is on developing new technology that can be justified from multiple criteria including economic environmental and social perspectivesbelieves any reduction program should be designed to maximize opportunities for new technology risk lies in not developing technology by the appropriate time focus on research development and demonstration and on removing barriers to commercialization of new technology viewed from the bottom up tends to see significant energy inefficiencies in the current economic system that currently or projected available technologies can eliminate at little or overall cost to the overall economy economicunderstands issue in terms of quantifiable costbenefit analysis generally assumes the status quo is the baseline from which costs and benefits are measured unquantifiable uncertainty tends to be ignored believes that economic costs should be examined against economic benefits in determining any specific reduction program risk lies in imposing costs in excess of benefits any chosen reduction goal should be implemented through economic measures such as tradeable permits or emission taxes viewed from the top down tends to see gradual improvement in energy efficiency in the economy but significant costs quantified in terms of gdp loss resulting from global climate change control programs typical loss estimates range from 1 to 2 of gdp ecologicalunderstands issues in terms of its potential threat to basic values including ecological viability and the well being of future generations such values reflect ecological and ethical considerations adherents see attempts to convert them into commodities to be bought and sold as trivializing the issuerather than economic costs and benefits or technological opportunity effective protection of the planets ecosystems should be the primary criterion in determiningthe specifics of any reduction program focus of program should be on altering values and broadening consumer choicesviews costs from an ethical perspective in terms of the ecological values that global climate change threatens believes that values such as intergenerational equity should not be considered commodities to be bought and sold costs are defined broadly to include aesthetic and environmental values that economic analysis cannot readily quantify and monetizehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs31 table 3 summary of lenses approach view of the problem guiding principles role of government technologicalproblem seen as opportunity for new

technologies also restrict the available choicesencourage climate in which environmentally responsible decisions are more socially acceptable and less responsible decisions are stigmatized through public education and policies ensure availability of green options for consumershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs32 conclusion balancing the three lenses to develop policy the technological economic and ecological lenses represent ways of viewing responses to environmental problems none is inherently more right or correct than another rather they overlap and to varying degrees comp lement and conflict with each other most people hold to each of the lenses in varying degrees and combinations for example person who is quite concerned about the potential of global climate change from an ecological pe rspective but concerned also about the economic costs and the effectiveness of reduction program might see regrets policy as most prudent under the circum stances in contrast an ecological perspective combined with strong tec hnological perspective would see reason for not pushing forward with strong re duction program without delay third possibility could be risk aversion perspective deriving from costbenefit concerns combined with technological perspective combination that could lead one to strong research and devel opment program combined with phasedin and selective technological incentives based on potential costeffectiveness the combination of possibilities are many depending on the depth of commitment to any one perspective or to any particular aspect seriousness effectiveness costs of the problem table 3 summarizes the three lenses identified in this report as indicated they reflect differing assumptions about the natu re of the problem the means to solution and the governmental role in crafting th at solution the lenses are not mutually exclusive but rather reflect differing emphases on what is very complex issue these different emphases can be seen when examining the lenses according to different policymaking criteria the governmental role differs substantially between the lenses in actual implementation any global climate change response would involve the government in multiple roles promoting new technology ensuring that the marketplace functions properl and educating the public table 4 presents other policymaking criteria once again one sees conflict and complementarity across the different lens eliminating nonmarket barriers can be key to technological deve lopment removal that those peering through the economic lens would likely see as appropria although difficult similarly those employing the technological lens have objection to the ecological orientation of those using that lens although they might question the need for such considerations especially since those looking thr ough the ecological lens might demand such thorough analysis of the implications of new technologies that its costs of development could be greatly increased or its adoption might be delayed however those viewing through the economic lens might object to the perspective given by the ecological lens if it were to give weight to values or concerns that could not be justified through costbenefit analysis analysis to which those peering through the ecological lens might objecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs33 table 4 review of lenses

effective over the longterm however the timeframe involved is unclearimplementation involves combination of public education and public policy to provide consumers with the opportunities to act responsibly elements of all three lenses can be seen in the policies promoted during the george w bush administration and in the actions of the congress although different perspectives dominate for th administration the technological and to lesser degree the ecological lens appeared very important to the longterm success of its initiatives the focus of administration initiatives was on development and use of technology to achieve reductions without significant economic pain that the administration rejected mandatory program suggests that the economic lens heavily influenced the design of its climate change program unlike the clinton administration the george w bush viewed costs to be major obstacle to reducing greenhouse gases in the near term for the congress the failure to date to enact any comprehensive climate change legislation seems to reflect focus on in creasing certainty about the problem and on the costs of actions consistent with the economic lens while congress did ratify the 1992 framework convention on climate chan ge and enacted veral global climate change provisions in the 1992 energy policy act goslow approach is manifest by such actions as the senates unanim ous vote of 950 in support of sres 98httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98738crs34 which stated the administration should sign agreement that would result in serious harm to the economy or that did not include developing countries along with developed countries within its control regime in addition the resolution stated that any agreement submitted to the senate include detailed and comprehensive economic impact assessment of the treaty yet while similar concern about the economy was expressed in samdt 866 in 2005 that action also put the senate on record for taking action action was initia ted in 2008 with the reporting of and floor debate on s 2191 which would have established capand trade program to address climate change this approach itself is consistent with viewing the issue from an economic perspective but the fact of action suggests either shift toward perceived benefits outweighi ng costs or perhaps refocusing through other policymaking lenses the effort by various interests to convi nce the public that their perspective is correct and that those of ot hers reflect either wishful thinking misinformation or excuses will likely continue such efforts will be affected by improvements in the scientific understanding of global climate change and of the domestic and international implications for strategies for addressing it however the pivotal decisionmaking point whether that unde rstanding warrants action or not will be mediated in large part by the lens through which policymakers view the new knowledge ultimately it is the balance between all three pe rspectives that will shape policy options and eventually determine the character and timing of any policy response to the problem
