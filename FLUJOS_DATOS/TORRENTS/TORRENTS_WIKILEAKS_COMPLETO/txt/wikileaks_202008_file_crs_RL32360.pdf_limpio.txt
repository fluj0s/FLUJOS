legislation for servicemembers whose service to the nation compromises their ability to meet obligations and protect their legal interests during the civil war congress enacted an absolute moratorium on civil actions br ought against soldiers and sailors during world war i congress passed the soldie rs and sailors civ il relief act of 19181 which did not create moratorium on gal actions against servicemembers but instead directed trial courts to apply princi ples of equity to determine the appropriate action to take whenever servicemembers rights were involved in controversy during world war ii congress essentially reenacted the expire d 1918 statute as the soldiers and sailors civil relief act of 1940 and then amended it substantially in 1942 to take into account the new economic and legal landscape th at had developed between the wars congress has enacted amendments on several occasions during subsequent conflicts including in the 107th congress when the benefits of the sscra were extended to certain members of the national guard called up by their respective state governors to support fede ral efforts during national emergencies such as the war against terrorism2 most recently on december 19 2003 congress enacted pl 108189 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32360crs2 3 one of the amendments effected by pl 108189 is the change in the name of the act from soldiers and sailors

order to lessen the potential hardship suffered by those whose entry into active duty military service materially affects their ability to meet financial obligations and to protect their legal interests the scra provides certain rights and other types of legal protection to enable servicemembers to devote their full attention to their military duties the law does not forgive any debt s or extinguish contractual obligations on behalf of servicemembers who have been called up for active duty nor does it provide absolute immunity to servicemembers from civil lawsuits instead it provides for the suspension of claims ag ainst servicemembers and protection from default judgments as well as certain other contractual rights and protections in this way it seeks to balance the interests of servicemembers with those of their creditors and others to whom the servicemember ow legal obligation spreading the burden of national military service to broader portion of the citizenry many of the scra provisions are especially beneficial for reservists activated to respond to national crisis but many provisions are also useful for career military personnel5 one of the measures that affects

the defendant to appear in court may result in the awar d of default judgment on behalf of the plaintiff this section protects servi cemembers from default judgments in civil actions while they are unable to appear in court due to military service before court can grant default judgment the plaintiff must file an affidavit stating that the defendant is not on active duty in military rvice showing necessary facts to support the affidavit19 or that the plaintiff was unable to determine whether or not the defendant is in military service false affidavit to that effect is punishable by imprisonment for up to one year fine of up to 1000 or both the court before entering judgment must also appoint an attorney to represent the person on active duty in order to protect his or her legal righ ts and interests however if the attorney appointed to the case cannot cate the servicemember acti ons by the attorney would not waive any defenses of or otherwise bi nd the servicemember additionally if the court is unable to determine if defendant is in military service the court may require bond which may later be used to indemnify the fendant if it is determined that he or she was in military service and the judgment against the defendant is set aside or vacated in part moreover if court enters default judgment against servicemember the court may set aside its judgment if the servicemember files motion within 60 days after leaving active military service and can demonstrate that military service prejudiced his or her availability to appear in court unless the default was based on false affidavit by the plaintiff regarding military service of the defendant in which case such showing is unnecessary and that there are meritorious or legal defenses to the suit this is change from the previous sscra where the motion had to be filed within 30 days after leaving military service this section does not provide means to challenge judgments resulting from cases in which the servicemember made an appearance before the court some courts have found that communication to the c ourt regarding the servicemembers military status and the resulting applicability of the scra to the suit constitutes an appearance and bars the servicemember from asserting certain defenses20 such as lack of jurisdiction of the court ove r the servicemember and negates the servicemembers

military duty requirements materially affect their ability to appear and state date when the servicemembers will be able to appear and submit letter from the servicemembers commanding officer certifying that leave is not authorized for the servicemember to attend proceedings at that time courts have been divided as to how to allocate the burden of proof regarding the issue of whether the servicemembers ability to appear in court is materially affected by military duty courts must also take into account the interests of the opposing party while stay is reasonable imposition upon an individual citizen on behalf of those discharging their obligations to the common defense it is not available to shield wrongdoing or lack of diligence or to post pone relief indefinitely or to be used to stay proceedings in matters where the intere sts or safety of th general public may be at stake courts may deny stay in cases involving purely legal issues or where the servicemember is not the true party in interest in which the servicemembers presence is not essential request for stay under this secti on does not constitute an appearance for jurisdictional purposes or waiver of any substantive or procedural defense therefore servicemember may apply for relief without waiving the right for example to assert that the court has ju risdiction in the case moreover additional stays may be granted based on continuing material effect of military duty on the servicemember if additional stays are nied the court must appoint counsel tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32360crs11 22 see roger
