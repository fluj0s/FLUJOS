coordinator resources science and industry division october 3 2008 abstract congress has become concerned with the rise in mineral prices and the eﬀects on the us industrial economy of course the rise in price of petroleum and other mineral fuels has been subject of great public concern and front page news but many manufacturers and others in industries such as construction have been at least equally concerned about recent surges in the price rises especially in 200708 in steel and other metals in the short run congress will consider the eﬀect of higher material costs in public contracts particularly in infrastructure projects ﬁnanced by federal resources more indirectly the federal budget and domestic economic growth are being aﬀected by layoﬀs and employment contraction as industries are hit by the double eﬀects of slower economic growth and higher metal materials input costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34695 order code rl34695 minerals price increases and volatility causes

divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34695minerals price increases and volatility causes and consequences summary rise in the prices of minerals has had major impact on us manufacturers and consumers mineral pri ces have risen while the ec onomy as whole has entered period of slowing growth this has created serious difficulties for consuming industries and concern in congress this re port reviews the increases in price across wide range of metals commodities pri ces have at least nearly doubled between 2001 and 2008 in the case of steel the most wi dely used industrial metal the rise in price appears largely driven by the high prices of iron ore and steel scrap weak demand and increasing supply may reduce tals prices but it is also widely believed that prices will not fall to the leve ls seen earlier in this decade the long term trend of declining real prices for metals inputs which boosted the competitiveness of the us industrial economy throughout the 20th century may be over fundamental changes in commodity mark ets may explain why rise in metals prices is not simply cyclical or tem porary phenomenon consolidation of ownership of minerals companies has given them increased pricing power market speculation may have driven up the prices of mineral commodities the 2000 commodity futures modernization act pl 106554 exempted both energy commodities and metals from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc the 2008 farm b ill pl 110246 partially closed this exemption and other bills have been introduced to extend cftc regulation another oftenheard explanation for high er minerals prices is the ongoing and rapid industrial developmen t of lowerincome countries this report discusses chinas efforts to improve and increase its access to foreign mineral resources which may have the effect of raising pri ces for us domestic industrial users the report examines in detail the rela tionship between prices production and availability of selected meta l minerals essential to the u s economy it focuses on iron ore aluminum bauxitealumina copper manganese molybdenum moly zinc platinum group metals pgms uranium domestic metals production generally declined since the 1990s but has increased again in recent years however the upturn in supply has not been adequate to meet domestic or global demand c ongress has extensively debated the

other mineral fuels has been subject of great public concern and front page news2 but many manufacturers and others in industries such as constr uction have been at least equally concerned about recent surges in the price rises especially in 200708 in steel and other metals in the short run congress will consider the effect of higher material costs in public contracts particul arly in infrastructure projects financed by federal resources more indirectly the federal budget and domestic economic growth are being affected by layoffs and employment contraction as industries are hit by the double effects of slower economic growth nd higher metal materials input costs there is also some evidence that the longterm decline in relative metals prices as it evolved through most of the twentieth century has been succeeded by an era in which metals prices are increasing relative to other economic inputs as the united states has moved into position in which it imports significant amounts in some cases virtually all of its i ndustrial metal ores this could have dampening effect on us economic growth and industrial em ployment such fundamental economic shift could have even more important consequences fo r policy makers than the shorterterm budgetary and employment impact s although metals mineral prices may have peaked in mid2008 and may dec line going forward most analysts believe that they will not return to the much lower levels seen earlier in the decade the policy actions to reverse or ameliorate this situation may be relatively limited some members have cited the possible impact of increased minerals commodity speculation which they believe s artificially increased the price of oil and other industrial mineral commodities they have s upported legislation aimed at limiting the role of financial speculators members have also debated the question of mining on public lands and whether u s mining laws should be reformedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34695crs2 3

higher rate even as us economic growth has sl owed separate s ubsection reviews the acrosstheboard rise in prices of steel the most widely used industrial metal causes of minerals price increases some analysts have suggested that the structure of the market for minerals is fundamentally chan ging and this has resulted in higher prices for us industr ial consumers of such materials such changes may be due both to the increased pressures of globa l supply and demand as well as to active market manipulation causal factors that have been widely discussed and which will be reviewed in detail are consolidation and the development of oligopolies in metals and ore production increased commodities market speculation growth of demand for metals and metal ores among rapidly developing countries especially china metals mineral resources while there are general trends that affect metals supply demand and price developments ar specific for each metal commodity any study of supply and demand of industrial metals must necessa rily be selective the report will review specific mineral resources their sources and availability and policy issues that may affect thei r availability in the us economy concern over the impact on the us economy of nonfuel min erals availability led the national research council to prepare study minerals critical minerals and the us economy that will be referenced throughout the current crs report3 the nrc study chose to focus primarily on those minerals that might be considered critical to the united states as defined by both the risk to supply of the mineral and the impact of any supply restriction t he criticality matrix emphasizes that importance in use and availability supply risk are the key considerations in evaluating minerals criticality4 the nrc examined in detail three metal minerals as potentially critical under this finition copper rare earths as group and platinum group metals pgms it c oncluded that rare earths and pgms could be defined as critical but that copper was not despite its importance of use it was considered widely available the nrc further examined some other metals and concluded that niobium indium and mangan might be defined as critical andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34695crs3 5 nrc critical minerals ch 4 6 nrc critical minerals pp 2930gallium might be added to this list5 as with this crs report the nrc did not evaluate the strategic importance of minerals for national security6 this crs report takes broader view of the significance of metal minerals for the economy consequently the range of minerals upon which this report focuses are those that may be used more broadl in the economy than those on which the nrc focused although there is some overla p the specific metals studied in this report are iron ore aluminum bauxitealumina copper manganese molybdenum moly zinc platinum group metals pgms uranium this group covers wide range of gene ral and specialty uses the first three products in their refined state are probabl the most widely used industrial metals in the us and global economies manganese and molybdenum are metals that are critical in the use and production of steel while zinc is used to galvanize steel especially for construction products wh ile these metals ar all base metal commodities platinum is precious metal mined and traded in small quantities together with the other pgms it plays an important role in the automotive industry uranium is chemically defined as meta l though its importance is primarily as nuclear fuel for some of these metals us industry is mostly reliant on domestic resources for others the united states is almost completely reliant on imports issues for congress the report concludes with review of the issues and legislation that congress pa ssed or considered and its effects on mineral markets it examines recent legislation to deal with commodities specu lation and concludes that it has so far only had limited effects on commodity markets and prices the report also examines legislative proposals to reform the rules governing mining on federal lands but notes that these issues primarily affect only

20078 2008 report for lehman brothers new yorkbased investment bank calculated that the cost of mineral commodities in the average new motor vehicle as of february 2008 was 2241 up by 421 19 ove r the cost one year earlier this was contributing to higher vehicle prices even though market demand in early 2008 was substantially down across the board nd especially for the larger and heavier vehicles that used more metal according to this report the average new vehicle contains 2200 pounds of steel 300 pounds of aluminum and 60 pounds of copper even metals used in much smaller quantities contribute significantly to overall costs the report noted for example that only small amounts of pla tinum and palladium primarily used in catalytic converters c ontributed 6 to the average commodity cost figure because the price per pound is much hi gher than base meta ls despite efforts to reduce vehicle weight to improve fuel economy the average new vehicle car or light truck sold in the united stat today weighs more than 4000 pounds compared to 3200 pounds in 1980 this change largely reflects the net effect of the consumer market shift to s uvs and trucks in the 1990s9 another source

economic growth13 iron ore and steel prices the data in figure 1 do not include iron ore which after mineral fuels is probably the mineral product most widely used by industry primarily in the form of steel mill products iron ore prices inte rnationally and domestically are set by contract moreover the impact of increased prices of both iron ore and ferrous scrap input prices on the economy in this decade has been reflected primarily in rising prices of steel mill products which w ill be reviewed parately below14 iron ore trades only in limited amounts in the open market internationally the key price has been set in annual contract negotiations between the three largest international producers on the one side the big brazilian iron ore producer vale and two large australian producers bhp billiton and rio tinto and the large japanese and korean steel producers on the other since 2004 the chinese steel companies negotiating as group have become the majo r importers but they have not been able to lower the price set by the traditional negotiators in 2005 after booming global recovery in steel demand and explosive growth in china vale succeeded in negotiating 715 annual increas in

rate in early 200818 to protect their own domestic steel industries some foreign countries have enacted restri ctions on scrap exports policy that has been considered in the united states but not

but only sufficient for 45 of its global needs it is seeking to expand its holdings both in north america and elsewhere the major i ndependent source of domestic iron ore is clevelandcliffs which sells most of its ore under longterm contracts but which tends to follow the global iron ore price clevelandcliffs pri ce is reported to have increased from 2007 average of 66 per ton to about 85 in

american inte grated mills in produc ing coldrolled coil steel of about 130 per ton under the cost of min imills22 nucor the largest us minimill producer is reported to be planning to build large new blast furnace to offset this cost disadvantage23 meanwhile the weak exchange rate of the dollar continued trade remedy tariffs on produc ts from some countries and high ocean freight rates have combined to discourage steel imports24 because it is difficult to develop meaningful and comparable price series for iron ore and because us steel mills may use iron ore or scrap as their principal charge this report shows instead the price changes for wide range of steel mill products which are the most widely used intermediate goods produced from iron ore all ferrous scrap was orig inally processed from iron ore some sample product prices since 2001 are illustrated in table 1 they show roughly the same magnitude of price increases as displayed for mineral prices as with mineral commodities by 2 007 many steel mill product prices were double or triple the levels seen earlier in the decade this pr ice increase put serious pressure on consuming industries as ma ny smaller manufacturers and other steel consumers testified be fore congress in 200425 as seen in table 1 the prices either declined or rose more slowly between 2004 and 2007 but in early 2008 there was further runup in most steel product pr ices even though demand for final goods using steel products was not nearly so robust the clearest exampl is in sheet steel which in the first half of 2008 averaged 300 per ton higher than in 2007 despite declines in homebuilding and automotive production only stainless steel products showed small price decline in early 2008 this price escalation in 2008 is shown in

price increases35 in many ways the commodity markets including those of the metals covered in this report are similar to markets for c onsumer goods but in several specific ways they differ the major similarity between commodity and consumer goods markets is that in both cases their prices are dete rmined through the interaction of demand and supply in the case of many commodity markets there are actually two markets that contribute in the pr ice determination process the first is the real physical commodity market it is composed of firms that use these commodities in production processes and thus create the demand side of the market the other part consists of the firms that supply this physical market the second market is the financia l market which is composed of firms that desire price predictability and hedge real commodity market transactions and financial speculators who are willing to accept the risk that real commodity users wish to reduce risk transfer of this type is key factor in enhancing market efficiency ensuring relatively stable cost structure that can translate into less volatile consumer prices on the market in recent years an additional class of speculators financ ial investors have begun to use commodity markets as portfolio investment instruments critics have asserted that this new class of speculators has contributed to increased commodity prices as well as price volatility others counter that unless special conditions exist that have created financial bubble th new participants in the financialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34695crs13 markets represent transactions similar to t hose already taking in place in the market and are unlikely to affect prices in any systematic manner demand for commodities the demand for metals commodities di ffers from consum er goods demand because it is derived demand derived demand is characterized as one for which ultimate consumers have direct need fo r the commodity itself as consumer good the purpose of these goods is largely to serve as inputs in the production process of other goods that do serve ultimate consumer needs as result the demand for metals commodities in general depends on the strength of the demand of the consumable goods for which they are input s this characteristic of derived demand has several important implications for the demand relationship and how prices are determined economists theorize that the law of demand holds for essentially all commodities this law states that when the price of good rises the quantity demanded falls in the case of derived mand the relationship is more complicated the extent to which the quantity demand declines when the price of metal rises depends largely on the degree to which its pr ice increase can be passed on to the final consumer as well as the proportion of the final goods price that is accounted for by the metal commodity for example if final consumer good is viewed as an essential by consumers and only small fraction of its price is related to the cost of the metal contained in it it is likely that the metals quantity demanded at least the part related to that partic ular consumer good will be insensitive to changes in its price in this case the seller of metal commodity will be able to pass through the price increase of the metal and the metal quantity demanded will be relatively insensitive to price increases alternatively the cost of metal may be significant proportion of the cost of the final consumer good this final produc t may be subject to intense competition from other products and the tal may be subject to hi ghly price sensitive demand then the producers of that metal might not be able to pass price increases on to final commodity users and might themselves face highly pricesensitive demand relationship in addition it may be possible to substitute other ma terials for the metal in question when its price increases if substitutes are available then once critical price is reached demand may move to the substitute commodities resulting in reduced quantities demanded of the primary metal commodity in the residential home market copper was used for water pi pe systems but was replaced by plastic pipe as result of cost pressures as result of these price effects it is possible that the quantity demanded of metals commodities might either remain relatively stable grow or decline when their own prices increase for goods that are charact erized by derived demand the demand conditions for the final consumer goods to which they contribute are key factors the major variables that determine the growth in demand for consumers goods are price and income growth general consumer price changes are measured by changes in the consumer price index

have increased since 2004 their increase has remained less than the growth in the prices of minerals and steel products as shown earlier in this report moderate growth in consumer prices suggests that either mineral materials cost s were not passed on to consumers or if they were the cost of minerals were only small fraction of the total cost of the consumer products other expl anations are that falling bor costs could have offset rising material costs this factor might be important for goods whose production has shifted to china or other emerging market nations substitutes might also have been identified for some mineral commodities eg plastic pipe for copper which would result in reduced quantities demanded income growth as measured by the growth in world gross domestic product gdp has been rising since 2003 world gdp growth rates coupled with relatively low prices for goods coming from lowwa ge economies entering the global economy have likely increased the demand for metals

collateral ffect of raising prices for metal minerals resources well above price changes previously associated with given levels of economic activity in the united states and other advanced industrial economies supply of commodities economists theorize that under ideal market conditions firms will tend to supply more of good to the market when its price rises the logic suggests that firms can employ more resour ces used in the production process even if those added resources are less productive or more expe nsive as the price of the good being produced rises this analysis is partially applicable to the metals markets however significant differences exist between tals and manufactured goods in general metals production depe nds on the existence of resource deposit and is capital intensive these two factors limit the poten tial for shortterm expansion of output although existing mines may expand produc tion in the short run and utilize any accumulation of stockpiled ore

development of new ore bodies which may take s ubstantial capital investment and long development period because of the need to find new reserves as well as historically cyclical behavior of metals

offering additional output the supply conditions in the market may be ch aracterized as inel astic or relatively insensitive to price changes market power market imperfections may cause obser ved prices on commodity markets to differ from those that would be set under compe titive market c onditions key market imperfection can be the actual or potential use of market power market power exists when market participant usually firm or group of firms can manipulate or influence the market to its benefit in this sense the market is controlled by firm with market power market power can be accumulated through the process of merger and acquisition the decreasing number of comp etitors coupled with the growing size of the remaining firms in the industry makes it more likely that potential

now dominate this part the industry there has been similar consolidation on the minimill side of the business40 market prices markets with inelastic supply as well as inelastic demand are likely to have volatile prices if demand increases price might increase sharply because little extra output enters the market to offs et the additional demand under these conditions price increases ration the good to highvalue users who can afford the higher price and effectively force lowvalue users of the commodity out of the market process called dema nd destruction only those uses that can bear the higher costs of the commodity will continue to procure adequate supply similarly if supply is reduced prices are likely to increase sharply because of buyers relative insensitivity to price variations especially if cost increases can be passed on through the production process to final consumers during most of the past century co mmodity prices have trended downward relative to manufactured goods at rate of about 16 per year41 however the downward trend has been interrupted by price spikes in the mid 1970s the late 1980s and again since 2003 the declin ing prices of the 1990s may have created conditions that led to the recent price incr eases poor incentives to expand capacity low investment due to declining profit exp ectations and longterm decline in real prices net of inflation likely left th minerals industries unable to expand to meet the needs of world economy whose gdp growth rates accelerated as shown in table 3 if mineral prices are strongly correlated with the business cycle and virtually every period of rising prices is tied to increasing world gdp growth it is likely that world economic slowdown in 2008 could lead to moderating prices for the future the major question is whether the industr ies have used the recent period of high prices to begin expanding to meet the requirements of the next growth surge financial markets in addition to physical spot market and contractual relationships many commodities including metals are traded on forward exchanges these market activities are represented by futures contracts and options on futures contracts historically these markets have served the valuable function of allowing commodity producers and consumers to guarantee future prices and costs reducing risk for this type of hedging activity to work financial traders ta ke financial positions opposite that of the commodity buyers and sellers th rough this type of transaction price risk is transferred from the real commodity market to the speculator although economists have debated whethe r this type of activity increases or decreases pricehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34695crs18 42 the standard poorsgoldman sachs nd the dow jonesaig commodity indexes are commonly used in this type of investmentvolatility in market few have claimed that excess price volatility or sustained upward movement in prices occurs as result of hedging transactions recently new kinds of investors have entered commodity markets including metals markets possibly contributing to the price increases of the past several years these investors are interested in neither the real commodity market nor the speculation on price movements of the trad itional hedging transaction these new investors including pension funds unive rsity endowments and insurance companies are taking long ownership positions in the commodity futures markets purely as longterm portfolio investments investors might be interested in this ty pe of transaction because they are thought to contribute to risk reduction for the overall portfolio the risk associated with price movements for individual securities is thought to be minimized through diversification after an i nvestment portfolio is fully diversified to essentially eliminate the risk associated with individual securities market risk remains market risk is associated with price movements of the market as whole the reason portfolio investors find the commodities fu tures market attractive is that many believe that price movements in commod ities tend to counter price movements in equity markets this counter price moveme nt is factor in reducing the market risk of an investment portfolio for example if the price of metal rises implying the possibility of consumer price increases and possibly contribution to general in flation equity markets might respond with falling share prices for specific firms or industries or even the equity market as whole however rising prices for the metal in the futures market creates value for investors who are long or in an ownership position in futures contracts offsetting potential losses in the equity market in this way market risk may be reduced by diversification into futures markets this type of investment can be achieved through the purchase of commod ity index funds these funds have the further benefit to investors in that the i ndex is composed of substantial number of commodity contracts in many different markets further contributing to the diversification of the overall portfolio42 because portfolio investors are interested in longer term positions they may use buy and hold investment strategy as result potentially permanent increase in demand occurs in the futures market ra ising prices and keeping them elevated as long positions are rolled over and new investors are attracted to the market to follow the success of earlier investors inde x speculators have increased their claim on variety of metals over th period 2003 to 2008 as shown in table 4

increases in commodities point to the data in table 4 as evidence that the demand for commodities has increased due to the activities of financial investors the question remains whether the paper demand for metals commodities represented by the futures contracts held by the various financial funds is likely to result in real commodity demand anytime in the future in general the answer appears to be that it will not futures contracts are settled in cash or by delivery of the commodity as the contract matures experience suggests that cash is the preferred settlement method if the settlement payment is not us ed to buy the metal on the spot market but is simply recycled into futures contr acts or other financial assets the holdings represented in table 4 represent different category of

have worked in tandem it may be that th underlying demand and supply conditions in the real commodity market largely related to high world gdp growth and lack of expanded productive capacity due to prolonged period of low and declining prices has resulted in tight market with bias for increasing prices the later sections of this report that review specific mineral commodities show for many of them period of output decline especially in the dom estic us market followed by period of increased output starting around 2003 howeve r the increased output has not kept pace either domestically or internationa lly with gdp growth resulting in rapid rise in price this has been coupled with financial market that has consistently bought into the market since 2003 for i nvestment reasons the result has been financial bets on the futures markets that prices will increase these financial bets have largely been validated by tig ht market conditions on the real commodity markets if this interaction has resulted in financialreal market price spiral it might reverse itself when world gdp growth slows chinas growing role as minerals consumer43 chinas strategic minerals policy stems from vision of where its leaders want the country to go over the near future it is partly born of exigency partly of legacy and partly of ideology as is the case for any nation china faces two vital national interests plus one existential in terest for the countrys leaders44 the vital interests are security and prosperity wh ile the particular interest is the survival of the chinese communist party as the

combined with chinas legacy of being subject to trade boycotts and th mind set of economic control legacy from socialism to generate policies that ultimately reach deep into the hinterlands of the

2003 some metals analysts belie ve that china may face aluminum production constraints as result of electric power shortages but they also note that current high inventories may minimize the effect of any supply cutback increasing world demand for aluminum has generated interest in more planned aluminum capacity and the restarting of idle capacity experts predict that aluminum supplies should be ample in the foreseeable future but making aluminum is energy intensive as noted above this results in high production costs should prices fall significantly many highcost produ cers may cut back on

new mines in the united states and elsewhere begins to catch up the recent slump in the u s housing market is likely to decrease domestic demand for copper from the build ing and constructi on industry which could also affect prices in response to persistent global dema nd for copper particularly from china some commodity analysts have conclude d that planned copper production at mines will

us copper production from mines has increased by 59 since 2003 even though the price for copper has qua drupled over the same time period labor and equipment shortages at us copper mines have constrai ned production which affects supply and prices however us copper reserves and anticipated new mine production are both likely to be large nough to meet domestic demand over the longer

june 16 2008 the rapid increase in copper prices ggests that an in crease in demand as opposed to drop in supply from producing mines has been the primary force driving the higher price of copper ce 2003 fluctuations in price may reflect changes in the shortterm availability of copper either from stocks or other sources of refined or recycled copper resources of copper available to mine both in the united states and abroad are likely sufficient to meet foreseeable global demand even in view of chinas economic expansion however industry analysts identify key factor known as mine capacity utilization the ratio of total production to annual production capac ity which has hindered the production of c opper from mines and has likel affected copper prices which as seen in figure 1 earlier have risen more steeply than any other mineral prices labor unrest adverse weather nd shortages of skilled labor electricity and other raw materials and supplies all contribute to lower the mine capacity utilization rate so that actual mine output does not ma tch planned output according to industry analysts global mine capacity utilization averaged roughly 90 from 2002 to 2007 reasonably high rate it declined to 82 during the first quarter of 200869 thus while copper production from pl anned mine expansions and new mines both in the united states and abroad may theoretically ease tight supplies in the near future unknown disruptions to mine production may contribute to lower than anticipated mine capacity utilization and c ontinued high copper prices024681012141618 19 981999

import reliance as result of high platinum costs imports of pl atinum scrap have in creased from about 5700 kg in 2003 to 39400 kg in 200785 uranium86 unlike base metals such as c opper moly and zinc which are used primarily in manufacturing the primary commercial use for uranium is in nuclear reactors to generate electricity accord ing to some industry experts the cost structure of nuclear power generation hi gh capital costs and low fuel costs has traditionally made it easier to predict demand for uranium than for other commodities87 demand forecasts have thus largely depended on installed and operable capacity regardless of s hortterm economic fluctuations88 in the absence of spike in demand in the past two years some industry observers attribute the spike in the spot price for uranium in 2007 to perception of scarcity89 perhaps due to the exhaustion of stockpiled uranium held by utilities even though global uranium production from mines s remained relativel constant since 2003 other factors such as continued economic growth in china and increasing electricity demand as well as concerns bout the greenhouse gas emissions of coal and natural gasfired electricity plants may also lead to perception of uranium scarcity amidst higher demand an analysis of the factors influencing uranium prices is beyond the scope of this report however the rise in uranium prices has sparked interest in developing new us uranium resources rene wed interest in developing new uranium mines or reopening shuttere d mines has also raised concerns about access to uranium deposits on both public and private land and concerns about possible environment consequences of reinvigorated uranium mining industry note especially the controversy discu ssed below about mining near the grand canyon like copper moly and zinc and the ot her metals discusse d above the average annual price for uranium has risen subs tantially in the past few years see figure 12 unlike copper and zinc which are widely traded and priced on formal commodity exchanges such as the london and new york metal exchanges uranium is mostly traded through direct contracts between buyers and sellers and price indicators

over 30 per pound however the spotmarket price p eaked at over 130 per pound between june and july 200793 according to one price indicator the uranium spot market price has dropped since the 2007 peak and as of june 16 2008 was pproximately 56 per pound uranium mining and production has been cyclical industry in the united states with production of uranium linked to its price the last price spike for uranium occurred in the mid 1970s and early and mid 1980s after which prices fell and remained relatively low throughout the 1990s bottoming out at approximately 10 per pound in 2001 not adjusted for inflation over the past 10 years us production of uranium from mines and mills has averaged about 34 million pounds per year with low of two million pounds per year in 2003 and high of 47 million pounds per year in 1998 us production has increased each year since 2003 and in 2007 was 45 million pounds per year more than double the amount produced in 2003 most of the uranium purchased in the united states is imported however usproduced uranium accounted for less th an 10 of us purchases in 2007 see figure 12 the rise in uranium prices over the past several years has led to an increase in exploration activities for new sources of uranium in the united states uranium exploration and development drilling incr eased in 2007 by 90 over 2006 levels total of 9347 boreholes drilled for comb

exploration employment was below 100 personyears in 200595 in addition to mining industry statistics news reports in the past year have pointed to the rise in uranium mining claims on public lands in

report rl34555 speculation and energy prices legislative responses mark jickling and lynne j cunningham more detail on each of the issues covered in this section as well as summaries of each piece of proposed legislation can be found in that report 101 enron corporation supported the idea of exempt commoditiesissues for congress99 financial market policy issues100 the 110th congress has considered more than 36 bills to cont rol the ab ility of speculators and financial investors in general from exerting undue influence on commodity market prices although this proposed legislation is primarily directed to oil market speculation some of the provi sions may apply to trading in metals as well both energy commodities and tals are exempt co mmodities under the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 pl 106554 and thus have been exempt from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc specifically trades that are on principa ltoprincipal basis not undertaken on marketlike trading facility and trades carri ed out on an electronic trading facility are exempt from cftc oversight cr eating the socalled enron loophole101 speculation and trading based on standardized contracts traded in market like the new york mercantile exchange nymex are subject to cftc regulation the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 also known as the farm bill extended cftc regulation into electronic trading facilities if the cftc finds that the contract traded had significant role in pr ice determination that is if the price is reference point for other transactions or trading facilities the provisions of the farm bill partially close the enron loophole private transactions not carried out on trading facility in exempt commodities including metals are still not under cftc oversight number of bills in the 110th congress seek to close what has been dubbed the london loophole this results from di fferent regulatory standards between nations in this case the united states and the united kingdom the potential problem is that contracts essentially identical to the nymex contracts can be purchased in the united states but trad ed on an exchange based in london which potentially might allow investors to bypa ss cftc technical trading requirements another provision the socalled swaps loophole has also been the focus of number of bills in the 110th congress institutional investors are likely to establish positions in commodity markets through the use of an intermediary commodity index fund or transaction with an investment bank the dollar value of institutional investors portfolios is large relative to the size of commodity markets through these investments institutional investors can exceed the limits established by the cftc on the number of contracts held the net effect is that some investors who are speculating on price movements mig ht hold positions in the market large enough to influence the

materials necessary to maintain national security economic well being and industrial production 102 it may be useful to assess periodically industry vulnerability to supply di sruptions congress could review with industry how the united stat is positioned to effectively address potential supply disruptions or restrictions other areas that may be of interest to congress include an understanding of us producti on potential and capacity based on reserve estimates exploration expenditures investment in downstream facilities and labor and infrastructure requirements the role of secondary recovery of materials and whether federal research and development rd i nvestment could assist in the review and possible development of technologies and infrastructure for secondary supply sources the role of substitute materials including whether these materials exist and at what point do they become economic also is there federal rd role in the development of substitutes that could minimize risk of potential supply disruptions gaining clearer picture of s upply risk where and how supply disruptions might occur and how th ey are addressed by examining the supply cycle of materials pr oduced domestically and elsewhere closer government monitoring of data for supply and demand of essential material requirements for the us economy during the 110th congress attention has been focused on reforming the general mining law of 1872 one issue for congress is access to public lands for mining uranium and other hardrock minerals cu rrently authorized under the 1872 mining law the house passed broadbased legi slation hr 2262 to reform the 1872 mining law on november 1 2007 and the senate committee on ergy and natural resources has held oversight hearings on hardrock mining on federal lands but mining law reform legislation w ould not likely have much impact on the domestic mining capacity or the import reliance of the essential minerals reviewed in this report the vast majority of mining activity on federal lands is in gold mining according to the last data published by the interior department103 gold accounted for 88 of the total dollar value of hardro ck base metals and nonmetals minerals mined on federal lands although that repor t was written in the 1990s it is unlikely that golds dominance has decreased since then because while other metals priceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34695crs44 104 this section was prepared by marc humphries and stephen cooney 105 mining engineering annual mining review may 2008have risen so has the price of gold the in terior report also show ed that federal lands mineral production only repres ented about 6 of the va lue of all minerals produced in the united states for example federal lands contributed about 1 of the value of copper mined in the united states according to the report further the report indicated that while all platinum group tal mines were initially located on federal lands nearly all of those claims were later patented transferred to private ownership congress has also been interested in the environmental impact of mining on public lands uranium mining claims on fe deral lands have ju mped from about 100 in 2003 to near 10000 in 2007 according to the partment of the interior this has been controversial because several of these claims are located in what are described as environmentally sensitive areas ie near the grand canyon on june 19 2008 representative raul grijalva chair of the house subcommittee on natural resources subcommittee on nati onal parks forests nd public lands introduced resolution to withdraw public lands adjacent to the grand canyon national park from uranium mining on june 25 2008 the house natural resources committee adopted the resolution because signifi cant fraction of us uranium resources is located on public lands in the west re form of the 1872 mining law or other congressional action to limit or permit access for uraniu m exploration and mining could affect future us uranium production legislation that has been introduced the grand canyon watersheds protection act of 2008 h r 5583 would withdraw about one million acres around the grand ca nyon and thus prohibit uranium mining in those withdrawn areas while the broad impact on the metals and ores covered in this report may be limited congress is continuing to examine the subject issues of the best use of public lands fair returns to the public fo r access to publicly owne d natural resources and the environmental and economic consequences of the domestic mining industry are of interest conclusion104 in general the high prices of the mineral commodities reviewed in this report are result of rapidly increasing globa l demand increasing production costs and tightening supplies while production is expa nding at the mine or refinery stage in most cases it has generally not kept pace w ith rising demand higher metals mineral prices have led to expansions of some existing operations re opening of historic projects such as some iron ore mines zi nc mines in tennessee and possibly the climax moly mine in colorado and the development of new mining projects high mineral prices have also resulted in sign ificantly higher exploration expenditures annually world exploration expenditures rose from around 2 b illion in 2002 to over 10 billion in 2007105 the increase is spread across the precious metals and basehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34695crs45 metals spectrum and as s hown above hi gh uranium prices have led to dramatic increases in the number of uranium cl aims staked on us public lands this review of selected minerals and metals has shown that while mining and refining capital expansion projects may be in the works any number of bottlenecks might arise among both domestic and foreign producers such as electric power skilled labor and equipment shortages labor unrest weather or transportation delays and oppositi on on environmental policy grounds any of these could raise costs exacerbate the tightness of supp lies and thus raise prices higher prices have led to more efficient use of materials in some cases for example there has been reduction in the amount of platinum used in auto catalytic converters or the substitution of the ss expensive palladium for platinum when possible as prices rise nother area of increased interest is secondary recovery of certain materials such as sc rap iron and steel copper aluminum and pgms there is well established global infrastructure fo r secondary recovery for some materials but not for others such as manganese although secondary recovery is beyond the scope of this report it is worth notin g that the amount of secondary material produced and imported into the united states has risen dramatically over the past five years and so have exports of material such as ferrous and nonferrous scrap of which the united states is major global supplier the united states is reliant on impor ts of many minerals that support its economy for several minerals studied here the united states is more than 90 importreliant eg manganese 100 bauxite 100 platinum 94 and uranium 90 for other minerals examined in this report such as iron ore and molybdenum the united states is selfsuffi cient for refined aluminum zinc and uranium the united states chief trading partner is canada while import reliance may be cause for concern high import reliance is not necessarily the best measure or even good measure of supply risk us companies may be invested in overseas operations eg copper and bauxite mines and supply sources may be diversified of higher quality of lower co st and located in countries that have extensive reserves and production capacity such conditions may not always exist in the united states even when resources are present estimates of the global reserves of minerals reviewed in this report are substantial and appear to be sufficient to meet material needs in the foreseeable future however as shown in the review of market conditions and policies including rising foreign demand prices may still be more volatile in the short term at best from the viewpoint of us metals cons uming industries increased production and supply of ores and metals ma bring relative price stability over the longer term but despite increased production f undamental market changes could reverse the historic longterm downward price trend of the twen tieth century and us industry could be in for long period of rising metals prices
