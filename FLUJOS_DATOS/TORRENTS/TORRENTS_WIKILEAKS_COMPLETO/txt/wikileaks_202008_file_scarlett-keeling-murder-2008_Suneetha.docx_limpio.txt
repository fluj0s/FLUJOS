bit about your background on family education and career where are you located for your work generally i am practising advocate and member of the supreme court bar association i am also currently the legal counsel for the russian federation in goa have handled matters related to small spectrum of law my work has involved with company law marital law narcotics conveyancing corporate law fema international law constitution law and of course criminal law how did the scarelett case come to you greek friend whom i had helped out two years back on matters of fema and company law was approached by fiona who desperately needed sincere legal advice fiona was being stone walled by the police in treating scarletts death as case us 174 ipc she was recorded as an accidental death due to drowning in sea water fiona needed help and she didnt have the money to pay for it fiona wanted justice and offered to sell her land to pay my legal fees i was touched and i offered the help free of cost i too have daughter who is now fourteen i did feel her pain as parent and felt my guidance and energy to fiona was essential at that point of time to my mind money had relevance in an issue like this it was the decent thing to do please give short version of the case as you see it there are several versions in the media the case is too complicated for to give short version of it while doing justice to the facts but to my mind and in few words its about the state being oppressive in refusing to either acknowledge or investigate crime as serious as homicide what is exactly your position regarding the case why did you become involved and how involved you are right nowwho else is helping fiona right nowi am not writing any suppositions and heresays but your take on it i have been the instructing attorney when fiona was stone walled at the police station level i have assisted to take it towards its logical conclusion i have tried to get the crime acknowledged as well as the cover up investigated to my mind the police officers and other individuals who have tried their best to cover up this crime should be prosecuted and made an example of strong punishment would send message to other police officers that neither are they above the law nor should they try and steer the course of justice tell about the crime scene in goa related to the case and how scarletts case is partis this typical case that got into lime light because fiona has been brave enough to take the bull by its horns yes there have been other instances where there is clear possibility of foul play in the reported deaths and the police have treated the case as death due to drowning or an overdose of drugs we are investigating list of such possibilities the case of scarlett got into the lime light because of fionas firm resolve to get to the truth the legal guidance provided by and the energy provided by dakini runningbear an american national who heard about scarletts case fiona and dakini lived in my house for four weeks and the three of us took this case to its current position i read that this very year had some 12 people being killed in goa do you think the govt doesnt care enough and isnt this being handled badly its not about the entire govt its about few individuals in power who are brazenly confident that they can steer the course of justice and dont feel answerable to the public how is the law in goa equipped to handle this particular case are there loop holes human law is never without loopholes where the intentions are malafide the loophole is exploited where the intentions are bonafide the law does assist justice how do you think is the tourism industry in goa india affected by the case is the law in general equipped to handle such situations do we need more laws or do we need more effectice implementation where is the weak link the tourism industry would suffer time would tell to what extent this incident has been shameful for not only goa but the entire country what has been revealed is the latitude provided to investigating officers and their abuse of the powers given to them an investigating officer for homicide does need considerable powers and all civilised nations do provide for this but when these powers are visibly abused then the punishment for such an abuse too should be huge interestingly this was the second incident when the investigating officer of this very case has abused his powers in similar fashion in the first incident which happened three years back psi nerlon albequerque tried his best to pass homicide as suicide he was exposed suspended and promptly reinstated in service such mild punishment clearly was not detrimental enough for him to have treated the case of scarlett with the level of professionalism required there have been cases of pedophile crimes going overboard in goa why is this conc in the tourism areas like goa and kerala is the law equipped to handle this or do we need more framing for this the goa childrens act is adequate in dealing with paedophiles what is missing is the political will to take these crimes seriously politicians are too busy in their struggle to remain in power most of the crimes get the lime light only when reported the subsequent stages of investigation prosecution and acquittals are rarely followed up by the media partial interest never results in complete solution how are you handling the pressure yoga and pranayam how is fiona handling this what is her condition now is she hopeful tell bit about her fiona is wonderful mother her six children who had to live in my office for two weeks because of security reasons are clear indicators of the quality of her parenting the children are lovely quiet always helpful and assisting in the house work humour was the visible bond within them the older children helped the younger ones and the younger ones were obedient the sparkle of honesty and trust they have for the people around them was apparent the entire troop would go for walk and come back to tell fiona all that they had seen fiona too trusts everybody she meets there is not shred of cynicism or suspicion in her despite her huge problems and pressures she would gladly take the time off to help an injured puppy or kitten her quick eye would spot every little animal or bird in the building she would not even kill cockroach in the kitchen she does not wear any footwear and walked barefeet everywhere the hot tarmac or the floor of the morgue did not dissuade her to from being barefoot she says she loves to feel the bare earth below her feet and does not want to be disconnected her children too do not wear any footwear for trip to the market with my wife aurora the youngest who is five fell and cut her leg on stone but instead of crying she smiled it off and quickly joined the others in their walk with her ankle still bleeding my wife had to make her sit on bench while she got band aid for her fiona has nine acres of land in england and breeds horses dogs and chickens her children ride bare back on the ponies and swim in the sea off devon as well as the river this family truly belongs to the earth like our farmers some of whom do not wear footwear they have that sparkling quality of truth and trust which we urbanites find impossible to reconcile with scarlett was everybodys favourite and that is visible in the cards the children made for her ceremony on the beach where they found her body scarlett would spend most of her time with her siblings answering questions and helping them learn she played the saxophone and enjoyed singing and dancing has the media given you good deal so far there are several versions of the story of fiona in the reportsthehootorg did an analysis of the media coverage recentlyhere is the linkhttpwwwthehootorgwebhomestoryphpstoryid3000mod1pg1sectionid1validtrue the media has mind of its own and the perceptions of the facts have been naturally restricted to the quantum of words in the article or the minutes of broadcast permitted by the editors the sceptics have restricted themselves to detail of fionas failings or other peripheral issues raked up by couple of scribes the peripheral issues raked up were on unsubstantiated allegations like fiona is negligent mother there are forces trying to tarnish the image of goa who are these outsiders who come to goa and cast aspersions on our police force why cant these foreigners dress up more conservatively these foreigners are trying to buy our land goa should not be up for sale fiona has raked up this issue because she wants long term visa to stay in this country this entire game is being played by some politicians who want to destabilise the govt but mostly the media has focussed on the core issue of the crime of rape assault and murder as well as the attempted cover up by the police and the government the media in its role to ensure check and balance in the executive has passed the litmus test here now that the cbi enquiry is to come in what is the possible direction that the case can take does fiona hope for justice yes fiona is hopeful for justice she is aware that her tiring efforts cannot bring scarlett back to life but sustained campaign would expose the nexus between the drug mafia the police and the politicians such an expose might prevent similar crimes for few years is this the first case which has put you in international limelight have you had offers of help from anywhere else in the world on this this is not the first international case i have handled i have also handled the matter of the russian mafia in goa and that case is still not over there have been offers for assistance but plenty of statements of moral support future plans reg the case that you can revea there are future plans regarding the case which i can reveal whats your advice to the tourists that visit india your levels of alertness must remain high in dealing with unknown persons or situations with that caution in mind i would say that india remains beautiful country and is definitely great tourist destination
