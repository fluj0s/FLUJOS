this report describes the emerging areas of information operations electronic warfare and cyberwar in the context of us national security it also suggests related policy issues of potential interest to congress for military planners the control of information is critical to military success and communications networks and computers are of vital operational importance the use of technology to both control and disrupt the flow of information has been generally referred to by several names information warfare electronic warfare cyberwar netwar and information operations io currently io activities are grouped by the department of defense dod into five core capabilities 1 psychological operations 2 military deception 3 operational security 4 computer network operations and 5 electronic warfare current us military doctrine for io now places increased emphasis on psychological operations computer network op erations and electronic warfare which includes use of non kinetic electromagnetic pulse emp weapons and nonlethal weapons for crowd control however as high technology is increasingly incorporated into military functions the boundaries between all five io core capabilities are becoming blurred dod also acknowledges the existence of cyber domain which is similar to air land and sea this new domain is the realm where military functions occur that involve manipulation of the electromagnetic spectrum this report will be updated to accommodate significant changes

views information operations as core military competency with new emphasis on 1 use of electromagnetic energy 2 cyber operations and 3 use of psychological operations to manipulate an adversarys perceptions department of defense dod officials now consider cyberspace to be domain for warfare similar to air space land and sea 1 each service has organizations with information operations io and electronic warfare ew responsibilities 1 the naval network warfare command netwarcom is the navys central operational authority for space information tec hnology requirements network and information operations in support of naval forces afloat and ashore2 2 the army reserve information operations command has responsibility for conducting information operations the us army io proponent is responsible for developing requirements for io doctrine and training and the army intelligence and electronic warfare directorate provides testing services for electronic warfare3 and finally 3 the air force has created new cyber command with responsibility for its portion of cyberwarfare electronic warfare and protection of us critical infrastructure networks that support telecommunications systems utilities and transportation 4 the dod views information itself as both weapon and target in warfare in particular psychological operations psyop provides dod with the ability to rapidly disseminate persuasive information to directly influence the decision making of diverse audiences and is seen as means for deterring aggression and important for undermining the leadership and popular support for terrorist organizations5 however 2006 report by the rand corporation describes how io can also affect audiences outside of the intended target stating in contingencies involving an opponent information operations planning and execution should include noncombatant considerations that may have nothing to do with affecting the enemys activities or defending friendly force

will most likely influence all parties in opposition impact various and varied noncombatant groups and be interpreted in different ways by members of the media and audiences worldwide 6 thus new technologies for military io also create new national security policy issues including 1 consideration of psychological operations used to affect friendly nations or domestic audiences and 2 possible accusations against the us of war crimes if offensive military computer operations or electronic warfare tool s severely disrupt critical civilian computer systems or the systems of noncombatant nations because of the new communications technologies and the growth of the internet ew and io have taken on new importance insurgents use cell phones and other electronic devices to detonate roadside bombs and afterwards transmit video images of successful attacks against us troops for broadcast on the local news or the internet to influence public opinion about the future outcome of the war in some cases populations may have these video broadcasts or local tv news stories in their native language as their only source of information dod is seeking methods to counter these actions where violence may be seen as secondary to the use and manipulation of information this report describes dod capabil ities for conducting military information operations and gives an overview of related policy issues g6g142g143g146g151g146g157g146g152g151g156g561 g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 information is resource created from two things phenomena data that are observed plus the instructions systems required to analyze and inte rpret the data to give it meaning the value of information is enhanced by technology such as networks and computer databases which enables the military to 1 create higher level of shared awareness 2 better synchronize command control and intelligence and 3 translate information superiority into combat power

many forms for example 1 to slow adversary computers the software may be disrupted by transmitting virus or other malicious code 2 to disable sophisticated adversary weapons the computer circuitry may be overheated with directed high energy pulses and 3 to misdirect enemy sensors powerful signals may be broadcast to create false images other methods for io attack may include psychological operations such as initiating tv and radio broadcasts to influence the opinions and actions of target audience or seizing control of network communications to disrupt an adversarys unity of command computer network defense cnd is the term used to describe activities that are designed to protect us forces against io attack from adversaries part of cnd is information assurance ia which requires close attention to procedures for what is traditionally called computer and information security dod places new emphasis on the importance of dominating the entire electromagnetic spectrum with methods for computer network attack and electronic warfare dod also emphasizes that because networks are increasingly the operational center of gravity for warfighting the us military must be prepared to fight the net 8 because the recently declassified source document containing this phrase has some lines blacked out it is not clear if net means the internet if so then this phrase may be recognition by dod that psychological operations including public affairs work and public diplomacy must be employed in new ways to counter the skillful use of the internet and the global news media by us adversaries g6g17g6g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g5g152g155g142g561g5g138g153g138g139g146g149g146g157g146g142g156g561 dod identifies five core capabilities for conduct of information operations 1 psychological operations 2 military deception 3 operati ons security 4 computer network operations and 5 electronic warfare these capabilities are interdependent and increasingly are integrated to achieve desired effects

targeted foreign audiences to influence their emotions motives objective reasoning and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments organizations groups and individuals9 for example during the operation iraqi freedom oif broadcast messages were sent from air force ec130e aircraft and from navy ships operating in the persian gulf along with barrage of email faxes and cell phone calls to numerous iraqi leaders encouraging them to abandon support for saddam hussein at the same time the civilian jazeera news network based in qatar beams its messages to well over 35 million viewers in the middle east and is considered by many to be market competitor for us psyop terrorist groups can also use the internet to quickly place their own messages before an international audience some observers have stated that the us will continue 8 dod information operations roadmap october 30 2003 p 67 httpwwwgwuedunsarchivnsaebb nsaebb177info_ops_roadmappdf 9 dod dictionary of military terms

global media wars until it develops coordinated strategic communications strategy to counter competitive civilian news media such as jazeera10 partly in response to this observation dod now emphases that psyop must be improved and focused against potential adversary decision making sometimes well in advance of times of conflict products created for psyop must be based on indepth knowledge of the audiences decisionmaking processes using this knowledg the psyops products then must be produced rapidly and disseminated directly to targeted audiences throughout the area of operations11 dod policy prohibits the use of psyop for targeting american audiences however while military psyop products are intended for foreign targeted audiences dod also acknowledges that the global media may pick up some of these targeted messages and replay them back to the us domestic audience therefore sharp distinction between foreign and domestic audiences cannot be maintained 12

mildec is defined as actions executed to deliberately mislead adversary military decision makers with regard to friendly military capabilities thereby causing the adversary to take or fail to take specific actions that will contribute to the success of the friendly military operation as an example of deception during operation iraq i freedom oif the us navy deployed the tactical air launched

process of identifying information that is critical to friendly operations and which could enable adversaries to attack operational vulnerabilities for example during oif us forces were warned to remove certain information from dod public websites so that iraqi forces could not exploit sensitive but unclassified information

exact capabilities of the jiowc and jfccnw are highly classified and dod officials have reportedly never admitted to launching cyber attack against an enemy however many computer security officials believe the organization can destroy networks and penetrate enemy computers to steal or manipulate data and take down enemy commandand control systems they also believe that the organization consists of personnel from the cia national security agency fbi the four military branches and civilians and military representatives from allied nations 14

from disruption or destruction cnd includes actions taken to monitor detect and respond to unauthorized computer activity responses to io attack against us forces may include use of passive information assurance tools such as firewalls or data encryption or may include more intrusive actions such as monitoring adversary computers to determine their capabilities before they can attempt an io attack against us forces some dod officials believes that cnd may lack sufficient policy and legal analysis for guiding appropriate responses to intrusions or attacks on dod networks therefore dod has recommended that legal review be conducted to determine what level of intrusion or data manipulation constitutes an attack the distinction is necessary in order to clarify whether an action should be called an attack or an intelligence collection operation and which aggressive actions can be appropriately taken in selfdefense this legal review should also determine if appropriate authorities permit us forces to retaliate through manipulation of unwitting third party computer hosts and finally dod has recommended structuring legal regime that applies separately to domestic and to foreign sources of computer attack against dod or the us critical infrastructure 15

before crisis develops dod seeks to prepare the io battlespace through intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and through extensive planning activities this involves intelligence collection that in the case of io is usually performed through network tools that penetrate adversary systems to gain information about system vulnerabilities or to make unautho rized copies of important files tools

computers and computer networks as distinguishing feature cna normally relies on data stream used as weapon to execute an attack for example sending digital signal stream through network to instruct controller to shut off the power fl ow is cna while sending high voltage surge through the electrical power cable to short out the power supply is considered electronic warfare however digital stream of computer code or pulse of electromagnetic power can both be used to also create false images in adversary computers during operation iraqi freedom us and coalition forces reportedly did not execute any computer network attacks against iraqi systems even though comprehensive io plans were prepared in advance dod officials stated that toplevel approval for several cna missions was not granted until it was too late to carry them out to achieve war objectives16 us officials may have rejected launching planned cyber attack against iraqi financial computers because iraqs banking network is connected to financial co mmunications network also located in europe consequently according to pentagon sources an information operations attack directed at iraq might also have brought down banks and tm machines located in parts of europe as well such global network interconnections plus close netw ork links between iraqi military computer systems and the civilian infrastructure reportedly frustrated attempts by us forces to design cyber attack that would be limited to military targets only in iraq17 in meeting held in january 2003 at the massachusetts institute of technology white house officials sought input from experts outside government on guidelines for use of cyberwarfare officials have stated they are proceeding cautiously since cyberattack could have serious cascading effects perhaps causing major disruption to networked civilian systems 18 in february 2003 the bush administration announced nationallevel guidance for determining when and how the united states would launch computer networ k attacks against foreign adversary computer systems the classified guidance known as national security presidential directive 16 is intended to clarify circumstances under which disa bling computer attack would be justified and who has authority to launch such an attack g7g149g142g140g157g155g152g151g146g140g561g25g138g155g143g138g155g142g561g507g7g25g508g561 ew is

control of the entire electromagnetic spectrum including the capability to disrupt all current and future communication systems sensors and weapons systems this may include 1 navigation warfare including methods for offensive space operations where global positioning satellites may be disrupted or 2 methods to control adversary radio systems and 3 methods to place false images onto radar systems block directed energy weapons and misdirect unmanned aerial vehicles ua vs or robots operated by adversaries 20 for example recent military io testing examined the capability to secretly enter an enemy computer network and monitor what their radar systems could detect further experiments tested the capability to take over enemy computers and manipulate their radar to show false images 21

in short pulses may permanently disable enemy computer circuitry for example an electromagnetic nonkinetic weapon mounted in an aircraft or on the ground might disable an approaching enemy missile by directing high power microwave hpm beam that burns out the circuitry or that sends false telemetry signal to misdirect the targeting computer 22 also at reduced power electromagnetic nonkinetic weapons can also be used as nonlethal method for crowd control the active denial system ads developed by the air force is vehiclemounted nonlethal counterpersonnel directed energy weapon currently most nonlethal weapons for crowd control such as beanbag rounds utilize kinetic energy however the ads projects focused beam of millimeter energy waves to induce an intolerable burning sensation on an adversarys skin repelling the individual without causing injury pr oponents say the ads is safe and effective at ranges between 50 and 1600 feet the nonlethal capabilities of the ads are designed to protect the innocent minimize fatalities and limit collateral damage 23 the pentagon reportedly has requested immediate deployment of at least 8 ads devices to iraq to assist marines in guarding posts countering insurgent snipers and protecting convoys the ads system would be the first operationally deployed directedenergy weapon for counterpersonnel missions24 20 dod information operations roadmap

indicates they are building force to operate in that domain secretary of the air force michael w wynne recently stated that the new mission of the us air force is to fly and fight in air space and cyberspace for the air force this means that military action in cyberspace now includes defending against malicious activity on the internet and anywhere across the entire electromagnetic spectrum including the energy spectrum bands for radio microwaves infrared xray and all other options for directed energy where national security is threatened 25 secretary wynne stated that cyberwarfare flows naturally fro m the air forces traditional missions such as downloading data from platforms in space and that us capabilities should be expanded to also enable the shut down of enemy electronic networks consequently the 8th air force headquartered at barksdale air force base has been designated as the operational cyber command responsible for organizing training and equipping the air force for cyberspace operations26 the new cyber command will draw on resources from all air force commands to gather needed expert capabilities air force officials led by the air force chief of staff gen michael mosley met at the pentagon in cyberwarfarethemed summit during november 2006 to make plans for the new air force cyber command27 general elder stated that the planning session will include an assessment of cyberwarfare requirements to defend the nation28 homeland security reportedly will also be large part of the cyber commands new responsibility including protection of telecommunications systems utilities and transportation several issues to be considered may include 1 what kind of educational skills technical skills and training are needed for staff at the cyber command and 2 what kind of career path can be offered to those in the air force who want to participate in defending the new cyber domain in addition the air force materiel command will review the research now ongoing at the 8 th air force headquarters to identify which work should receive funding as part of the new cyberwarfare function29 some examples of systems or projects that could be affected by the cyber command mission include 1 the airborne laser system at edwards afb 2 the active denial system at moody afb 3 the joint survei llance target attack radar system at robins afb and 4 efforts to protect

specific emphasis on the ability to perform information operations designed to weaken an enemy forces command and control systems 38 terrorist groups also use wireless electronics to detonate roadside bombs improvised explosive devices they also use the internet to transmit financial transactions and use free global positioning system gps signals and commercial satellite video and images to direct their ground attacks against us and coalition troops39 reportedly only small portion of the iraqi populace watch and listen to the current government run television and radio news broadcasts with the majority preferring instead to support the foreign satellite news stations such as aljazeera and alarabiya observers say that most arabs believe that us sponsored news broadcasts are managed too closely by the coalition powers and do not objectively present the news when the iraqi governing council igc prohibited jazeera and alarabiya from covering all igc events during short period in early 2004 this action reportedly gave many iraqi people the impression that the coalition provisional authority cpa was manipulating their information 40 some observers have also stated that terrorist groups through use of the internet are now challenging the monopoly over mass communicatio ns that both stateowned and commercial media have long exercised strategy of the terrorists is to propagate

problem after computer network attack is accurate and timely identification of the attacker this uncertainty may affect decisions about how and against whom or even whether to retaliate on april 27 2007 officials in estonia moved sovietera war memorial commemorating an unknown russian who died fighting the nazis the move stirred emotions and soon incited rioting by ethnic russians and the blockading of the estonian embassy in moscow the event also marked the beginning of series of large and sustained distributed denialofservice ddos attacks launched against several estoni an national websites including government ministries and the prime ministers reform party42 the attacks were described as crippling owing to the limited it resources of estonia initially the russian government was blamed by estonian officials for the cyberattacks but it is unclear whether the attacks are sanctioned or initiated by the russian government nato sent computer security experts to estonia to help protect government systems against continued attacks and to help recover from the attacks however some analysts later concluded that the cyber attacks targeting estonia were not concerted attack but instead were the product spontaneous anger from loose federation of separate attackers technical data showed that so urces of the attack were worldwide rather than concentrated in few locations the computer code that caused the ddos attack was posted and shared in many russian language chat rooms where the moving of the statue was very emotional topic for discussion these analysts state that although various estonian government agencies were taken offline there was apparent attempt to target national critical infrastructure other than internet resources and extortion demands were made their analysis concluded that there was russian government connection to the attacks against estonia 43

the military and the offensive tools and other capabilities used by dod to stage retaliatory strikes against enemy systems are highly classified experience has shown that reactive defense is not very effective against increasingly powerful and rapid malicious cyber attacks or against other malicious activity using the electromagnetic spectrum more effective defense against these attacks is to incorporate predictive active and preemptive measures that allow dod defenders to prevent deflect or minimize the efforts of the attacker

electronic warfare operators45 each year dod conducts cyber defense exercise where teams of students from the nations military academies advance their cyber skills in practice competition where they deliberately hack into test networks and also protect these test networks against intrusions by other teams however dod must attract train and retain skilled information technology professionals beyond those enrolled in the military academies in an attempt to solve this problem the air force research laboratory afrl cyber operations branch offers 10week summer program each year for university students consisting of intensive studies in cyber security the advanced course in engineering ace cyber security boot camp has been held at rome ny for the past 4 years and involves between 40 and 60 student applicants from air force and army precommissioning programs some national science foundation cyber corps fellows and some civilian college students for 2006 the theme was cybercraft described as nonkinetic weapon platform that seeks dominance in cyberspace corresponding to the new mission of the air force to fly and fight in air space and cyberspace according to program director dr kamal jabbour students study legal and policy issues cryptography computer network defens and attack steganography and analysis of malicious code ace students also spend an average of three days per week in internships at the air force research laboratory or with local industry partners and participate in officer development activities the faculty for ace is drawn from syracuse university west point and norwich university dhs and the national science foundation nsf have recognized the ace program as an official internship program for federal cyber service scholarship for service sfs program the sfs program seeks to increase the number of skilled students entering the fields of information assurance and cyber security by funding universities to award 2year scholarships in cyber security graduates are then required to work for federal agency for two years recent ace graduates are now working at the air force office of special investigations the afrl and the nsa also as result of ace summer

could provocative actions for example intelligence gathering by the us military that involves using intrusive cyber or electronic warfare tools to monitor enemy system activity or copy important data files be challenged by other nati ons as violation of the law of armed conflict exploratory intrusions by us military computers to gather intelligence may provoke other strong or unexpected responses from some countries or extremist groups that are targeted for monitoring by dod several questions also may arise when considering retaliatory cyber or electronic warfare counterstrike 1 if the attacker is civilian should the attack be considered law enforcement problem rather than military matter 2 if us military cyberattack against foreign government also disables civilian infrastructure can it be legally justified or 3 how can the military be certain that targeted foreign computer system has not been innocently set up to appear as an attacker by another third party attacker some observers have stated that success in future conflicts will depend less on the will of governments and more on the perceptions of populations and that perception control will be achieved and opinions shaped by the warring group that best exploits the global media 46 as result of the increasingly sophisticated use of networks by terrorist groups and the potentially strong influence of messages carried by the global media does dod now view the internet and the mainstream media as possible threat to the success of us military missions how strongly will us military psyop be used to manipulate public opinion or reduce opposition to unpopular decisions in the future another emerging issue may be whether dod is gislatively authorized to engage in psyop that may also affect domestic audiences 47 dod joint publication 313 released february 2006 provides current doctrine for us military information operations and explains the importance of achieving information superiority48 however the dod information operations roadmap published october 2003 states that psyop messages intended for foreign audiences increasingly are consumed by the us domestic audience usually because they can be rebroadcast through the global media the roadmap document states that the distinction between foreign and domestic audiences becomes more question of usg us government intent rather than information dissemination practices by dod 49 this may be interpreted to mean that dod has 46 maj gen robert scales ret clausewitz and world war iv armed forces journal july 2006 p 19 47 psychological operations
