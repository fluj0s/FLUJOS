defense dod face difficult and potentially costly choices when considering updating key facet of the us electronic warfare ew force structure presently the navys ea6b prowler is the only airborne radar jamming system available to protect navy marine corps and air force aircraft the prowler though still capable is aging and in short supply its retirement is scheduled for 2015 there has been debate on how much ew is required to protect an aircraft force that increasingly incorporates stealth technology however recent operational experience suggests that future us military aviation superiority will be best achieved by combination of ew and stealth techniques indeed the recent conflict in kosovo reportedly indicates that the united states needs to augment the ea6b force immediately to maintain its capability until longterm replacement is found in the past congress has been strong supporter of the ea6b specifically and ew in general congress has consistently increased the administrations request for ea6brelated procurement funding over the last five years the 106th congress has exhibited continued support for ew by forming congressional working group and initiating joint service electronic attack analysis of alternatives study in december 2001 this study is due to release its roadmap for replacing the ea6b fleet specifically and rejuvenating dods electronic attack capabilities in general today and in the near future congress will face variety of decisions about the size and composition of dods ew force structure in the nearterm congress faces decisions on how to maintain and modernize dods current active and passive ew force structure the options congress may consider to augment the present ew force include speeding up the planned ea6b upgrade program promoting the development and deployment of smart radar decoys resurrecting some number of retired ef111 radar jamming aircraft and retroactively putting ew capabilities on aircraft other than the ea6b congress will also be faced with overseeing dods choice of permanent replacement for the ea6b the options include converting the fa18ef super hornet the f15e strike eagle the joint strike fighter the f16cj fighting falcon and the f22 raptor using uavs or designing new ew aircraft there are variety of criteria which can be used to measure the pros and cons of each aircraft these criteria include the platforms unit cost operations and maintenance considerations whether or not the platform is joint and variety of operational characteristics that will effect the platforms ability to escort aircraft strike packages in future threat environments finally congress is faced with identifying the potentially high payoff rd pathways to future ew capabilities in the post 2020 timeframe considering the time that many dod programs require to move from the drawing board to the field it has been suggested that new ew technologies be investigated as soon as fy2001 two potential future ew platforms that congress may wish to investigate include networked microuavs unpiloted air vehicles and satelliteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639contents introduction 1 issues for congress 1

issues for congress congress and the department of defense dod face difficult and potentially costly choices when considering updating key facet of us electronic warfare ew force structure presently the navys ea6b prowler is the only airborne radar jamming system available to protect navy marine corps and air force aircraft1 the prowler though still capable is aging and in short supply it is scheduled to leave the active inventory in 2015 congress will face variety of decisions about the size and composition of dods ew force structure in the nearterm to about 2010 congress faces decisions on how to maintain and modernize dods current active and passive ew force structure recent experience in kosovo has drawn attention to the ew mission area and the negative consequences of potential ew shortfalls the ea6b prowler has been credited with effectively protecting allied aircraft during the 1999 air campaign yet dod found that they didnt have as many prowlers as they required nor were those aircraft particularly adept at destroying serbian radar systems that employed deceptive tactics furthermore there is consensus in the intelligence community that the types of threats that airborne radar jammers are designed to counter will likely grow in the future some options congress may consider to improve ew capabilities in the near term include 1 modernizing the ea6b prowler to improve its effectiveness and potentially extend its life 2 improving ea6b inventory management 3 accelerating the development and production of electronic protection technologies such as decoys 4 bringing some number of ef111 radar jamming aircraft out of retirement 5 giving existing us aircraft such as the b52 an ew capability to augment the prowler fleet 6 restarting the ea6b production line

military and associated terms us department of defense httpwwwdticmildoctrinejeldoddictin the midterm 20102015 congress will be faced with the need to replace the ea6b aircraft due to the long development time lines of many dod acquisition programs congress may wish to focus today on deciding which aircraft or platform is best suited to replace the ea6b in the 2015 era while many different options could be considered most of the options now being evaluated would replace the ea 6b with another manned aircraft dod appears to be focusing on ew variants of air force aircraft such as the f15 f16 or f22 the navys fa18ef super hornet the joint strike fighter or some combination of these platforms building new ew aircraft from scratch or developing an ew uav are also possibilities to be assessed each of these aircraft have strengths and weaknesses in the ew realm and congress may likely wish to assess these qualitative and sometimes elusive distinctions when deciding on acquisition programs measured in billions of dollars finally when considering how to best allocate near term research development test and evaluation rdte money congress may wish to examine current investment opportunities in ew that will likely pay dividends in and beyond the 2020 era the most likely investment areas will be in networked microuavs and space based jammers these investment areas offer risks and opportunities that arent always obvious congress might therefore survey these technology areas to identify potentially high payoff pathways for todays ew rd background brief overview of electronic warfare the department of defense defines electronic warfare as any military action involving the use of electromagne tic and directed energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum or to attack the enemy the three major subdivisions within electronic warfare are electronic attack electronic protection and electronic warfare support2 this report will focus on the electronic attack facet of electronic warfare specifically electronic attack against enemy radars however the three ew subelements are mutually supporting as evidenced by the fact that the ea6b jamming aircraft employs ew self protection systems and is an important consumer of electronic warfare support information and are intimately linked references will be made to electronic warfare support and electronic protection throughout this report as needed brief descriptions of electronic warfare support electronic protection and electronic attack follow electronic warfare support several systems contribute to dods electronic warfare support efforts that division of electronic warfare involving actions tasked by or under direct control of an operational commander to search for intercept identify and locate sources of intentional and unintentional radiated electromagnetic energy for the purpose of immediate threat recognition jcs pub 1 02 in other words electronic warfare support is passive activity that intercepts enemy signals locates them and analyzes them so they can be exploited by otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs3 users several dod systems contribut to this mission area the ep3e aries for instance provides indications and warning for the naval battle group commander the usaf rc135vw rivet joint surveillance aircraft are also equipped with an extensive array of sophisticated intelligence gathering equipment that monitors the electronic activity of adversaries using rivet joint data analysts can precisely locate record and analyze much of what is being done in the electromagnetic spectrum electronic protection electronic protection involves actions to protect personnel facilities and equipment from any effects of friendly electrom agnetic emissions or enemy employment of electronic warfare that degrade neutralize or destroy friendly combat capability radar homing and warning receivers that are organic to every modern military aircraft are an example of an electronic protection system chaff and decoys are other important and ubiquitous electronic protection systems chaff is thin narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses dispensed from aircraft and used to reflect radar echoes and confuse the enemy decoys are more advanced countermeasures they are small devices that emit signals that emulate manned aircrafts signal and thus actively draw an enemy missile to it decoys can be towed behind aircraft expended from aircraft to lure threatening missile or launched earlyon to fly tactical missions in an autonomous mode electronic attack electronic attack is broadly defined as that aspect of electronic warfare involving the use of electromagnetic directed energy or anti radiation weapons to attack personnel facilities or equipment to degrade neutralize or destroy enemy combat capability antiradiation weapons differ from other airto surface weapons primarily in that they employ passive radar seeker that listens for enemy radar transmissions and then follows this energy to its source to physically attack enemy radars the department of defense relies predominantly on the agm88 harm high speed antiradiation missile the harm can be launched from the ea6b fa18 and f16 cd aircraft the agm88 is normally fired against radars whose frequency and wavelength have been preprogrammed into the harms database however if fired from an ew aircraft such as the ea6b the harm can be reprogrammed in flight based on inputs from the aircrafts radar warning receiver and thus attack unanticipated threats the navy and marine corps also use the agm 122 sidearm lighter shorterrange and less expensive system than the agm88 to attack enemy radars based on the aim9c sidewinder airtoair missile the sidearm can be fired from ah1w super cobra helicopters and av8b and fa18 fighter aircraft presently dod has only two aircraft dedicated to jamming enemy electronic emissions the ec130h compass call and the ea6b prowler the compass calls mission is to jam enemy voice and data communications the prowler is optimized to jam enemy radars and also has the capability to attack communications emissions

radar jammers may also be divided into two general approaches standoff jamming and mission jamming as the name implies standoff jamming positions the airborne jamming platform at distance from the target the standoff jammer creates jamming corridor between the target and the attack aircraft in mission jamming the airborne jamming platform flies in close formation with the attacking aircraft in

corporation3 development of the aircraft began in the fall of 1966 the prowlers first flight was on may 25 1968 and delivery of the first 12 production aircraft started in january 1971 the prowlers initial operating capability was established in july 1971 the last of total of 170 aircraft were delivered on july 29 1991 in constant fy2001 dollars the final ea6bs when procured at rate of six per year in the early 1980s had unit procurement costs ranging from about 50 million to 90 million when procured at rate of 12 per year in the late 1980s unit procurement costs ranged from 45 to 60 million since the a6ea6b production line has since been shut down additional ea6bs procured today would likely have higher unit procurement cost at least initially4 one analyst has called the prowler one of the most expensive military aircraft in servicedue to its short production runs and its complex electronics5 the operating cost of the ea6b has been estimated at 509100 per flight hour6 the

prowler is the analq99 tactical jamming system sophisticated collection of electronic gear that forms the major portion of the us navy ea6b ecm aircrafts operational payload the prowler can carry external fuel tanks chaff and flare dispensers and harm antiradiation missiles the analq99 is comprised of five external pods each capable of housing two very highpowered jamming transmitters tracking receiver and antennas the pods can be detached from the aircraft and can hold various combinations of transmitters to cover any desired frequency bands another key system is the anusq113 communications jammer by attacking both vhf and uhf communications the anusq113 enables the ea6b to attack the archer rather than the arrows while single surfacetoair missile sam system may be troublesome an integrated air defense system iads composed of numerous sams and their associated radars is significant threat to us aircraft by jamming communications between the individual sams and their command and control c2 nodes the ea6b can degrade or totally disrupt the iads and thus force the sams to operate individually the individual sam can then be more easily avoided or attacked ea6b upgrades the original ea6b operated with the initial analq99 ew system and was limited to the four jamming frequency bands used by early sovietmade early warning and fire control radars since then the system has undergone series of upgrades to keep pace with the expanding threat the number of frequency bands covered have doubled and other improvements in operational use and reliability have been made the prowlers first upgrade was the excap expanded capability program first delivered in 1973 which upgraded the analq99s capability from four to six frequency bands the upgrade also improved the systems computer enabling new operating modes the icap increased capability upgrade followed excap in mid1976 the icap upgrade replaced the ea6bs alq100 deception jammer with the improved alq126 it also reduced the analq99s processing times provided new cathode ray tube crt displays and improved communication navigation and iff equipment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs7 7northrop grumman

representing the next improvement in the program icap2 upgraded the receivers displays and software to cover wider range of known surveillance and surfacetoair missile radars icap 2 jammers were also able to attack two different frequency bands simultaneously perhaps most importantly the main computer was upgraded to enable the analq 99 to act in concert with equipment on other prowlers so that three aircraft could together mount coordinated countermeasure missions there were three different icap 2 configurations designated block82 block86 and block89 for the years in which they were introduced these block configurations provided the following highlighted capabilities block 82 provided softwaredriven rapidly re programmable universal exciter which generates the systems radar energy block 86 provided receiver and communications upgrades and block 89 upgraded safety the navy is currently upgrading all 124 prowlers to common standard known as icap 2 block 89a which improves navigation and communication capabilities the next planned upgrade for the analq99 was the advanced capability advcap program that began even as icap2 was being delivered late in 1982 advcap upgraded the processing equipment new central computer jammers replacement of analq92 jammer by the analq149 receivers better passive detection and displays new headsup display out of 130 ea6bs 105 were to be remanufactured with the advcap to extend the service life of the aircraft to 2020 the first engineering model advcap version for the ea6b was delivered in early 1988 further improvements to the alq99 transmitters were made just prior to operation desert storm in 1991 but the advcap program was cancelled in late 1994 the most recent ea6b upgrade program began in march 1998 when the navy awarded northrop grumman contract to develop the icap iii the intent of icap iii is to keep the joint prowler force going until 2015 icap iii will upgrade and replace the 1960s era receivers improve connectivity and provide lowrange jamming northrop grumman is expected to have the first batch of icap iii prowlers finished in late fy01 with fullrate production decision made in june 2003 the first ea6b icap iii prototype completed its initial test flight on november 16 20017 icap iiis key feature is the introduction of selectivereactive jamming instead of jamming all the frequencies on which enemy radars might be emitting icap iii is designed to automatically identify prioritize and jam only those frequencies actually in use many modern enemy radars are capable of employing very fastfrequency hopping techniques to deceive radar warning receivers and radar jammers if threat radars use frequencyhopping techniques the selectivereactive system will instantly shift its transmissions to match the adversarys actions8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs8 9on november 22 2001 it was reported in the washington post that marine corps ea6b crashed into the ocean 26 miles off

aerospace expeditionary force wings has contributed to the prowlers already high operational tempo optempo in fact ea6b utilization rates are at an all time high due to this high wear and tear the prowler may actually be retired as early as 2010 one strong indication that the prowler fleet is under stress is the grounding of eight ea6bs on november 28 2001 due to structural fatigue cracks in the center wing section memo from the commander of navair to the chief of naval operations and commandant of the marine corps describes the basis for this action in may 2001 navair analysis predicted as many as 51 ea6bs had extensive center wing section cracks the prowler fleet was restricted to flying 3g or less maneuvers to mitigate the risk posed by this fatigue subsequent analysis found that the eight grounded aircraft had accrued the highest level of fatigue damage and the potential for catastrophic failure of the wing13 fatigue assessment of the remaining ea6bs is ongoing table 2

shaping the battlespace the future of airborne electronic warfare sea power march 2000 40 17 joint doctrine for electronic warfare joint publication 351 us department of defense washington dc viithe importance of exploiting and controlling the electromagnetic spectrum has grown as the revolution in information technology which has so profoundly affected global business economics and society in general has been paralleled in military affairs one military analyst has written the most important single outcome of technological progress during the decades since world war ii has been that on the modern battlefield blizzard of electromagnetic blips is increasingly being superimposed on and to some extent substituted for the storm of steel in which war used to take place15 many future us warfighting capabilities are premised on revolution in military affairs this revolution will be one in which us military forces will achieve dominant battlespace awareness over the enemy us forces will make decisions and coordinate operations by building commo n operational picture and by exploiting vast and intricate array of computer and communications networks among other techniques this force of the future will generally exploit various information technologies in ways that will allow it to mass weapons effects against an adversary over great distances and from widely dispersed locations therefore one analyst believes that ew will increase significantly in importance for future warfighters as the ability to monitor suppress manipulate and exploit enemy electronic transmissions will become essential to assure military superiority16 within dod ew is generally recognized as an important part of doing business the joint staff considers ew military capability that must be integrated into given joint operation as it supports all phases and aspects of campaign17 while the importance of militarily dominating the electromagnetic spectrum is established the best mix of resources and most effective methods for achieving this dominance today and in future scenarios is currently being debated among the military services for instance differences of opinion on the how and how much aspects of ew can be observed the air force has procure d two dedicated manned stealth platforms and has generall been more aggressive in applying stealth technology to existing platforms it has also deemphasized the use of active ew relative to the navy as evidenced by the ef111s retirement and the navys continued use of the ea6b when considering ea6b followon options it is useful to recognize that there are two overarching schools of thought regarding the importance and application of ew in modern warfare and how these schools of thought have influenced operations and force structure to date the first perspective contends that stealth technology is substitute for ew and can be called stealth vs ew the counter perspectivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs11 18 usaf plans to keep 12 ef111s through fy98 aerospace daily september 22 1995 453 19 usaf requirements chief defends airborne electronic warfare program aerosp ace daily july 20 1995 91 20the us air force employed the f117 in panama during operation just cause 1989 the panamanian air defense system was not serious threat however and the six aircraft were used because of their precision bombing and night flight capabilities rather than because they were stealthyholds that stealth technology and ew are complementary and can be characterized as stealth and ew stealth as substitute for ew the first perspective on the use of ew in modern warfare contends that in many applications active ew works at cross purposes with lowobservable or stealth technology the more stealthy platform or force structure is the less need there is for ew if an enemy radar cant detect stealthy platform there is little need to jam or attack the radar furthermore active radar transmissions such as those emanating from an ew platform are easily detected by adversaries thus active ew is not only unnecessary to protect stealthy planes but it contradicts stealths basic function by loudly broadcasting the jamming aircrafts location in the theater of operations stealthy aircraft are often able to achieve tactical surprise by avoiding detection right up until they drop their bombs or shoot their missiles this stealthiness not only enhances aircraft survivability but it also increases mission effectiveness the enemy has time to make defensive preparations adherents to stealth vs ew perspective would argue that active ew platforms make tactical surprise impossible one of the many arguments put forth to support the air forces decision to retire the ef111 raven was that stealthy aircraft would require much less dedicated jamming than conventional aircraft air force chief of staff general ron fogleman stated that the air forces increasing use of lowobservable platforms such as the f 22 fighter and the jast which became the jsf leads to lot less need for standoff jammer18 the increased use of standoff weapons was another related argument for the reduced need for the raven thenbriggen david mccloud argued that standoff munitions mean that i expose myself to the highthreat environment less than i had to before and if i have cruise missiles that launch from 100 or 200 or 300 miles out then that dramatically changes the picturethat changes the need for standoff or penetrating jamming19 the 1991 persian gulf war operation desert storm marked the first concerted use of stealthy aircraft in combat20 the gulf war also witnessed large and sophisticated ew campaign following the conflict there was little if any criticism regarding either the effectiveness of the stealth fighter or the jamming aircraft and the suppression of enemy air defenses sead campaign senior pentagon officials said that stealth technolo gy represented another electronic combat success although they accounted for only 25 of the air forces combat assets the f117shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs12 21nordwall bruce d electronic warfare played greater role in desert storm than any conflict aviation week space

remembered as an outstanding success22 what was debatable however was whether and to what degree the f117 stealth fighter operated with support from jamming aircraft those who believed that stealthy aircraft reduced the need for dedicated radar jamming argued strenuously that the f117 was not supported either by the ef111 or the ea6b and that operation desert storm proved their perspective on the diminishing need for active ew adherents to the stealth versus ew perspective claimed that the f117 operated quite autonomously during operation desert storm the stealth fighter evaded enemy radars and required only minimal coordination with support aircraft official information on how effectively the f117 evaded detection by the iraqis air defense radars is still classified however trade press articles from that time period report that iraqi radar apparently never tracked the f117 which was referred to in intercepted iraqi communications as the ghost23 because they were not tracked by the iraqi radars supporters argue the stealthy f117 did not require either the dedicated ew support nor the fighter escort that tradition nonstealthy attack aircraft required to survive in hostile air

proponents of the stealth vs ew perspective concede that the united states did plan to support the f117 with ef111 jammers during the very first air attacks against baghdad when iraqs air defenses were strongest however due to an operational mix up the ef111s never arrived and the f117s that attacked the first targets in the capital including the att building and the telecommunications center flew into over and through the heart of the fully operating air defenses of baghdad with support from electronic countermeasures24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs13 standard packageprecision

and 1990s the stealth vs ew perspective was the dominant mindset among many in the defense establishment and has been powerful factor shaping force structure and operations the air force for instance with its stealthy f117 and b2 bombers and its lack of dedicated radar jamming aircraft can be characterized as having chosen the stealth route the navy on the other hand has lacked true stealth aircraft and has assumed the joint responsibility for jamming with its ea6b aircraft the navy can be characterized as having pursued the ew route source secretary of the air force safosx 1991 stealth and ew are complementary number of factors have given rise to contradictory school of thought regarding stealth and ew this perspective contends that lowobservable aircraft and ew jammers are not contradictory but are in fact complementary and should be procured and used collaboratively those who subscribe to this philosophy would argue that ew and stealth are both designed to increase aircraft survivability and that it is impractical if not dangerous to put all of ones eggs in one basket proponents of the stealth and ew perspective maintain that stealth aircraft are not totally invisible to enemy radars nor invulnerable to sams there are variety of radar techniques and technologies that have been and will increasingly be employed to detect stealth aircraft if stealthy aircraft is detected it is vulnerable to attack unless ew aircraft are nearby to protect it while the united states continues to reduce the detectabili ty of its aircraft it is prudent to also improve and use ew to protect those aircraft according to this view furthermore while ew emissions do clearly broadcast the position of the emitting aircraft there are operational techniques that can be

jammer for instance could protect stealthy aircraft as it traverses target area without giving away its exact location as an escort jammer might also the evolution of technology will make the use of radar in general less susceptible to enemy interception new generation of radars is being developed called aesa or active electronically scanned arrays that are planned to be deployed on jsfs and f22s and potentially retrofitted onto other aircraft such as the fa18ef and even legacy aircraft the aesa is made up of thousands of very small transmitreceive tr modules located on the face of the radar antenna high speed computer processors and sophisticated computer algorithms each aesa tr module can send out its own pencil thin beam of radar energy that is very difficult to detect the aircrafts stealth profile is further protected by the fact that the aesa quickly alters the pencil beams wave form to make it look as though it came from different radar and broadcasts it at different and variable frequency thus even if the enemy intercepts the aesa radar beams the signals appear to be from variety of sources and the aircrafts location is safely lost in the noise finally even if an enemy was finally able to detect and recognize the aesa radar signals it would find it difficult to lock onto and target the aircraft because the aesa has limited built in jamming capability that could also be employed this jamming capability has been described as very discriminating jamming only long enough to break the ground based guidance radars or missile radars lock25 those who believe that synergy exists between stealth and ew also find evidence in recent military operations to support their perspective this perspective would argue that the portrayal of the f117 as lone wolf during operation desert storm is false one first while support aircraft might not have flown wingtowing with the stealth fighter jammers and air superiority escorts did fly the same missions the desert storm lessons learned report of the 37th tactical fighter wing for instance describes unambiguously how their jamming aircraft were incorporated into f117 operations furthermore f15 air superiority fighters always flew cap combat air patrol within striking distance of the f117 which carries limited airto air weapons26 not only did jamming aircraft support the stealth fighter it is argued but they employed innovative techniques to improve the f117s survivability for instance f 117 pilots report the jammers were used to indicate false target locations to the iraqis27 the iraqis then attacked these false targets leaving the f117s unmolested another clever technique was to turn the jamming on at for example 7 minutes before the time on target the aaa fire would start but would stop in about

stealth fighter from any enemy air defenses that might have survived the attack perhaps even more innovative than the jamming techniques described above us forces attacking baghdad successfully employed unpiloted ew systems ie the air force bqm74 drone and the navy tactical air launched decoy to draw attention away from f117 operations and to incite enemy radars into exposing their positions so that harmfiring aircraft could destroy them in one mission the united states created massive ew feint the air force launched approximately 75 bqm drones toward the iraqi air defenses which converged with 25 navy decoys also flying toward iraq totally deceived by what appeared to be huge attack the iraqis lit up the sky with their radars meanwhile the real air strike commenced more or less unopposed 29 there was much evidence from operation desert storm that ew capabilities played an important role in the victory and that ew aircraft and stealth aircraft were not oil and water even so the time period following desert storm has been described as period of neglect of the electronic warfare mission30 for instance it has been argued that during this era the ea6b was not upgraded with numerous technologies such as night vision devices and key communications links required to keep the prowler current with threats and advanced operational concepts furthermore it was during this time period that the air force decided to retire the ef111 and allow the navy to assume the ew mission for all services kosovo the ew experience operation allied force the 1999 nato operation in kosovo appears to be an important watershed in the debate over current and future us airborne ew needs the military leader of the operation general wesley clark described how critical role ew played in the allies success he testified that we couldnt have fought this war successfu lly without the ea6b contribution we really need the electronic warfare capacity that we have there31 yet following

harms at serbian radars38 despite the very positive outcome of the operation allied force ew campaign serious issues have been raised within academic dod and congressional circles scarcity of ew aircraft perhaps the most prominent issue raised by the kosovo conflict was the perception that there just werent enough ea6bs to optimally execute the air war this caused problems both in the execution of operation allied force and in the satisfaction of military commitments elsewhere in kosovo the 27 prowlers were used to protect hundreds of nato aircraft flying 3722539 combat sorties over 78 days since on average combat strike package is composed of four aircraft those 37225 sorties could translate into 9306 strike packages each in principle requiring protection by ew aircraft if those 9306 hypothetical air strikes were spaced out evenly over 78 days and each strike package required just one ea6b for protection in reality they frequently required several prowlers then each prowler would have to fly over four sorties per day for 78 straight days generating this sort of sortie rate is an operational impossibility for both crew and aircraft at the current prowler force level during the 78day air campaign each marine corps ea6b averaged 95 hours per month one aircraft flew 123 hours in one month these numbers are significant if one considers that planned aircraft utilization rates during sustained operations are 36 hours per month40 us military planners took extraordinary steps to protect all combat sorties with ew jammers keeping air crews healthy and at

conus based units at normal rates despite these efforts and the negative consequences of deploying so many prowlers to kosovo the navy and marine corps prowlers could not keep up with the pace of combat sorties in operation allied force the scarcity of ea6bs slowed the allied operational tempo the prowlers have been described as crucial pacing element for the air campaign sorties were geared around the availability of ea6bs if prowlers werent available operational planners either had to wait until prowlers became available or risk flying without them however on the basis of assistant secretary of the navy lee buchanans testimony to the senate armed services air land subcommittee on march 22 2000 in which he said that the ea6b accompanied all us strikes in kosovo and also some coalition strikes it would appear that operational planners generally chose to wait for the prowlers in addition to the general scarcity of prowlers the ea6bs lack of night vision devices nvds has been identified as limiting factor in target prosecution for night missions the lack of nvds rendered the aircrew incapable of performing precise aircraft positioning through visual means at night and in some cases reduced their effectiveness since most of the air campaign was fought at night this shortcoming might have been factor in slowing operations50 integration with stealth aircraft

countermeasures as well as taking advantage of our stealth capability which all totaled up to survivability for the platform that is simply what we did52 bgen robert flanagan usmc testified that ea6bs were incorporated into operations with lowobservable aircraft due to the marine corps prowlers presence during the buildup phase they were briefed in and allowed to participate in these sensitive missions as result every lowobservable aircraft mission conducted during oaf had dedicated marine prowler support53 the f117 that was shot down in kosovo was reportedly not properly supported by jamming aircraft for variety of reasons the ea6bs were too far from the f 117 they may not have been properly aligned with the enemy radars54 the apparent use of ea6bs to support f117 and b2 aircraft during the kosovo conflict lends credence to the stealth and ew philosophy new issue regarding stealth and ew aircraft integration arises from this experience however namely whether the intense secrecy protecting stealth aircraft operations might be hindering joint training and the development of operational concepts that would enable even better integration of ew and stealth aircraft stealth technology has long been considered an important comparative military advantage for the united states it is silver bullet that only the united states employs pervasively the standard operating procedure is to withhold f117s from air force exercises and experiments such as red flag thus important details regarding how ew assets should best be integrated with stealth platforms are not universally understood for example what frequencies should they work on where should the jamming aircraft be positioned relative to the stealth aircraft where in the formation should the harmshooting aircraft fly according to gen richard hawley former commander of the air combat command this desire to classify and protect as much information about stealth technology as possible was most likely factor in the f117 loss and backfired on the services55 some analysts recommend more consideration on how to better train exercise and experiment with stealthy aircraft in the total force package

during the 78day war response to serbian tactics in many areas including ew operation allied force was unlike operation desert storm in 1991 the united states destroyed most if not all of iraqs key radars and sams early in the conflict and kept the residual threat very low until the end of the war in operation allied force dedicated suppression of the serbian air defenses was never completely accomplished56 rather than continually sweeping the skies with their radars as the iraqis had done the serbs turned on their radars sporadically they exploited vast network of observers to track us aircraft then turned on their radars just as the us planes were passing overhead while this tactic limited the effectiveness of the serb system it also made it extremely difficult for us ew and sead assets to find target and suppress or destroy mobile radars and sams at the campaigns end only fraction of serbian early warning radar networks and sams had been destroyed to illustrate how successful the serb tactics were nato believes they only destroyed three of the serbs 22 sam batteries57 consequently bombing missions on day 78 were potentially as dangerous as missions on day one58 this need for continuous ew support kept ea6b optempo high throughout the entire conflict serbian tactics and the nato allies difficulty in countering them suggest that the united states may need to emphasize the acquisition of systems and the development of operational concepts optimized for finding targeting and destroying mobile radars and sams that arent emitting intelligent decoys while chaff flares and decoys have been part of aircraft selfprotection suites for some time their contribution to ew during the kosovo conflict is noteworthy with regard to the coming debate regarding ea6b follow on options the ale50 towed decoy and the genx expendab decoy are examples of new generation of decoys that proponents argue will greatly increase aircraft survivability against radar guided missiles these systems defeat guided sams by transmitting decoy signal that looks just like that of the targeted aircraft except bigger the sam is tricked into attacking the decoy sparing the aircraft these

been destroyed in worst case scenario this could have resulted in the death of 48 crew members and the destruction of approximately 25 billion in materiel the political ramifications of losing such high value asset are more difficult to calculate but probably significant as well in more likely scenario after one or two aircraft were shot down the b1bs would have been withdrawn from the campaign until an effective defense or counter tactic was devised this suggests that decoys could be an important component of an overarching ew strategy that could reduce the number and or types of dedicated ew jammers required ea6bs in operation enduring freedom60 thus far it appears that in many ways operation enduring freedom has placed fewer demands on the ea6b fleet than did operation allied force first much smaller percentage of active and reserve prowlers have been deployed to afghanistan than were during operation allied force maximum of two aircraft carrierbased ea6b squadrons have flown missions at any one time compared to the 105 squadrons deployed in kosovo this relatively low level of ea6b deployment is likely due in part to the low number of attack aircraft sorties flown in this conflict visavis the number flown in kosovo second the ea6b squadrons that are deployed to afghanistan appear to have less sead work to do than those deployed in kosovo the talibans air defenses are notably inferior to serbias and that appears to be reflected in the number of support jamming missions press accounts claim that even on the first night of bombing the strikes were aided by relatively small number of support aircraft such as ea6b stand off jammers61 as us air strikes took their effect on the talibans defenses it appears that the need for escort jamming diminished further other

the accuracy of these advanced reports is unclear it appears likely that the ea aoa will present menu of choices to replace the ea6b rather than single solution congressional action over the last five

purposes conference report 104344 november 15 1995 82an unwise and risky course of action and fraught with too many risks for our national security74 in fy1996 authorization conferees expressed concern that the administrations budget request included funds to either expand the navys fleet of ea6b aircraft improve its capabilities or to accommodate the requirement of the ef111by other means therefore the conferees agree that modernization of the departments tactical electronic warfare aircraft fleet is priority item of special interest the fy1996 authorization conference report went on to admonish the navy noting the inconsistent nature of the navys actions regarding airborne tactical ew in recent years and saying that the conferees were deeply concerned with the navys vacillating commitment and for meaningful upgrades to the ea6b aircraft to indicate the seriousness of their concerns authorization conferees agreed that the secretary of the navy should not obligate more than 75 percent of funds appropriated for procurement of the fa18cd for fiscal year 1996 until he had accomplished the modernization activities specified in the report appropriations for fy1996 followed the authorization lead providing 165 million for the modernization programs delineated in the authorization report appropriations conferees saw particular need to procure the 910 band transmitters and encouraged the navy to buy these systems expeditiously75 in addition to the ea6b modernization the appropriators provided the navy with 97 million in rdte funds for ew development in fy1997 congressional conferees authorized 2016 million for ea6b procurement 101 million more than the budget request conferees strongly expressed their concerns regarding the retirement of the ef111 and the reliance on the prowler as the department of defenses only dedicated radar jammer attack aviation continues to require robust electronic warfare capability the decision to retire the air forces ef111s and rely on the ea6b for the departments tactical jamming mission makes it imperative that the ea6b fleet be structurally sound and modernized to meet current requirements the conferees note that the current jamming transmitters on the ea6b have not changed substantially since originally designed in the 1960s although there have been several generations of improved surfacetoair and airtoair missiles since then and many of these new systems operate in the high radio frequency range also the great majority of current antiship missiles employ seekers in the band 910 frequency range consequently the conferees agree to authorize an increase of 40 million to the budget request to procure 60 shipsets of these transmitters the conferees agree to authorize an addition of 11 million to

conferees noted that although funds were authorized and appropriated for fy1996 to initiate reactive jammer program for the ea6b the department of defense chose not to initiate such program and elected instead to program funds for such an effort from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2001 conferees criticized the dods decision as unacceptable calling the ea6bs jammers obsolete conferees

address the state of ew within the pentagon84 issues and options for congress issues based on the operational and force structure conditions noted earlier in this report there appear to be three overarching issues of potential congressional interest regarding the ea6b force first when assessing the immediate deficiencies in dods ew capabilities the following questions stand out how might our existing airborne ew platforms be upgraded or augmented before the prowler is retired in 2015 what approaches exist for increasing the number of airborne radar jamming platforms between 2000 and 2015 are techniques or technologies available that would help defeat adversaries who employ their radars sporadically as the serbs did in kosovo when considering ways to improve dods radar jamming capabilities issues include which options are available in the short term and which would most easily transition to or facilitate the transition to longerterm solutions the second set of issues concerns options for replacing the ea6bs when they leave service sometime in the 2010to2015 era what is the best longterm strategy for satisfying the airborne radar jamming requirement in the 2015 and beyond time frame which platform is best suited for future ew operations when considering options for replacing the ea6b relevant measures of effectiveness include 1 how joint the platform is 2 the platforms cost in terms of both unit platform cost and potential operations and sustainment 3 the time frame in which the platform would be operational and 4 characteristics such as range speed payload and stealth capabilities which would determine the platforms operational effectiveness third set of issues concerns the future of ew in the 2020 and beyond time frame what are the longerterm capabilities that might supplant manned tactical aircraft as the backbone of dods radar jamming capability what merit is there in basing radar jammers on very small uavs or satellites what are the primary strengths and weaknesses of each approach what are the primary obstacles to turning these concepts into reality if congress were to appropr iate rd funds to nurture longterm concepts would it get good return on its investment options for each of these three time periods are discussed belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs32 85source naval aviation systems command navair 86telephone conversation with ea6b pilot naval air station whidbey island may 18 2000 telephone conversation with retired ea6b electronic countermeasure s officer washington dc may 26 2000nearerterm options for augmenting the ea6b fleet expedite icapiii upgrades one possible measure to improve the ea6bs capabilities would be to speed up the navys plan for icap iii upgrades the current plan is to upgrade 123 aircraft over 10 years between the years 2000 and 2004 two prowler airframes will be upgraded starting in 2005 the plans for icap iii upgrades fluctuate between 18 aircraft per year 2005 to 23 aircraft per year 200985 congress may wish to examine the feasibility and costs of accelerating this plan if for example the navy were to enter into low rate initial production lrip of the icap iii upgrades earlier say in 2004 it appears that they could upgrade 32 more ea6bs from 2004 to 2006 than is currently planned when asked to identify the number one thing that could be done to improve ea6b effectiveness current and former ea6b crew responded implement the icap iii upgrade and incorporate link 1686 among other things the icapiii upgrade will give the prowler the ability to conduct electronic support measures esm at the same time the prowlers are jamming enemy radar emissions conducting esm gives the prowler crews heightened battlespace awareness which in turn gives them the ability to conduct their missions in more proactive manner rather than letting the enemy take the initiative the wideband datalink link 16 information distribution system would allow the ea6b to more effectively disseminate electronic order of battle and other information to other prowlers sead aircraft and aew aircraft like the e3 awacs or the e2c hawkeye in effect link 16 would enable these aircraft to work more as an ew team inventory management there are 124 ea6b airframes in the inventory however at any one time14 prowlers are either used for testing or for fleet support and do not fly operational missions these 14 prowlers are said to be in the pipeline while military aircraft will always need to be pulled from operational status and move through the pipeline for basic maintenance and upgrades there may be measures that could be implemented to make the ea6b pipeline leaner and thus keep more prowlers flying ew missions for example reducing the number of ea6bs in the pipeline from 14 to 10 aircraft could create another operational squadron the navy is developing an integrated maintenance concept which congress could assess that they hope will produce maintenance cost and schedule savings this concept would include an examination of the amount of work performed at government maintenance facilities naval aviation depots or nadep compared to commercial maintenance facilities as regulated by law such as usc title 10 chapter 146 section 2464 there is also the issue of how the services manage their ea6b fleets currently the marine corps operates four ea6b squadrons composed of five aircraft each the navy operates 15 squadrons of four prowlers each can greater combat effectivenesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs33 87castelli christopher j navy

marine corps and navy ea6b squadrons to serve national security interests better that question appears to be on the minds of senior dod officials secretary of the navy richard danzig was quoted as saying weve got marine ea6bs weve got navy ea6bs how can we operate them together more efficiently87 some have observed that landbased deployments overseas such as operations northern and southern watch have disproportionately burdened some of the ea6b squadrons the marine corps squadrons and five navy squadrons formed to fill the gap created by the ef111s retirement have borne this burden while navy ea6bs assigned to aircraft carriers have seen relatively light service over the past several years some argue that it would make more sense to rotate all ea6bs through operational hot spots and thus spread the flying hours and wearandtear proportionally through the fleet referring to the ea6b squadron s nowretired commandant of the marine corps charles krulak said whether those requirements be for landbased or seabased commitment they should be filled on longest homenext to deploy schedule all of these aircraft in my view are national asset and should be apportioned as such88 others argue that deploying carrierbased ea6b squadrons away from their aircraft carrier threatens the integrity of carrier airwings increase use of smart decoys another option would be to accelerate the introduction of radar decoys into the active air force navy and marine corps inventories as described earlier in this report towed radar decoys such as the ale 50 proved very successful in kosovo protecting b1b and other aircraft from serbian sams however these systems though relatively cheap as well as effective are not deployed on every us aircraft also more sophisticated variants are experiencing developmental difficulties for example the joint navyair force idecm with its fiber optic towed decoy fotd has experienced 14 month delay in engineering and manufacturing development emd and 50 percent increases in the average procurement unit costs the idecm is slated to begin production in fy200489 unlike towed decoys tactical decoys can be launched from outside theater and fly long distances to invade enemy airspace the tactical airlaunched decoy and the bqm74 for example were used effectively in operation desert storm more advanced decoys might be developed which could simulate us aircraft more convincingly than todays decoys but might also appear as multiple aircraft on enemy radars the air force has begun converting some surplus agm86b airlaunched cruise missiles

military operations planners avoid reliance on any one technique or system instead they apply numerous mutually reinforcing techniques and technologies to avoid singlepoint failure and increase the likelihood of achieving mission success to ensure aircraft survivability against radar directed sams us aircraft will require not just stealth features and dedicated electronic jamming but also smart defensive countermeasures such as towed and expendable decoys all three of these assets together will enhance aircraft survivability against wide and evolving set of threats much better than any one alone martin van creveld writes in the case of electronic warfare as in any other kind of warfare weapon and method is sufficient on its own not one is suitable for use under all conditions and each separately is capable of being countered in ways which if far from simple are often obvious enough91 considering the inevitable waning of the ea6b over the next 15 years another option would be to emphasize the defensive countermeasures leg of the ew triad this would include producing and deploying decoys on many aircraft types many allied and friendly countries such as france germany sweden and the uk are also developing sophisticated decoys if development problems with us decoys preclude their timely and ubiquitous deployment import of decoys from allied nations may be an option to consider when augmenting dods active jamming capability resurrecting the raven returning some ef111 ravens to active service might prove another useful short term measure to augment todays overworked

commandfacility is often referred to colloquially as the us military aircraft bone yard these aircraft began their internment at amarc in september 1997 the process culminated in 1998 when the raven was retired and withdrawn for service92 the ef111 ravens at amarc are currently being stored under number of conditions some are in type 1000 long term storage where the integrity of the aircraft systems is maintained aircraft are preserved every four years and parts can be scavenged from them without air staff approval other ravens are in type 2000 storage for reclamation where parts can be removed and either returned to active service or exported to fms foreign military sales countries that still fly the f 11193 returning ef111s to service would entail more than just reconditioning the aircraft the personnel including both pilots and ground crew maintenance and logistics support structures would also need to be revived eb52 another measure that might be considered to augment the ea6b fleet in the near term is the potential use of the b52 to perform standoff jamming the us air force has initiated study to assess the feasibility of converting nine b52s into standoff jamming platforms as near term augment to the ea6b initial air force thinking on concept of operations suggests that b52s could fly long range bombing mission and still have enough fuel to loiter outside the range of enemy sams and antiaircraft guns and protect other fighters and bombers with radar jamming and deception as they enter operate within and exit hostile air space it is estimated that the conversion program would cost approximately 334 million and would take about three years of testing and renovations to convert three b52s to the new mission configuration the remaining six bombers would be completed in another two years94 one obstacle which must be overcome is that fact that the b52 currently is fitted with older electronic warfare gear designed for self protection more modern receivers and processing equipment would need to be integrated into the platform to allow it to effectively conduct electronic attack missions the b52s large airframe presents engineers with number of possibilities for integrating ew equipment the air force study is examining offtheshelf jamming equipment already in service rather than developing new systems the jammers antenna for instance could be located in pod mounted under wing the electronics required to generate the jamming signal could be installed inside the b52s pressurized crew quarters the b52 crew currently includes an electronic warfare officer whose primary concern is protecting the b52 by identifying threatening radars and missile launches and operating the bombers missile and radar defenses the proposed new

section at the front of this reportwould require the electronicwarfare officer to watch over wider area and help protect planes other than his own b52 by using signals from the jamming equipment to deceive enemy weapons95 restarting the ea6b production line ea6bs produced in the early 2000s could incorporate modern manufacturing techniques that might reduce cost and the aircraft could surely be upgraded with modern electronics and engines the primary obstacle to this approach is that the last prowler was delivered in 1991 in effect the ea6b production line has lain fallow for 10 years the atrophy of an aircraft production lines people processes and technologies including subcontractors and specialized human expertise gathers momentum over time proponents of reopening the ea6b production line would argue that production lines have been resurrected in the past and that the ea6b line could be functioning in approximat ely five years96 opponents would counter that the only aircraft production lines that have successfully been restarted did so after only short pause such as the e2c hawkeye which was reopened after two year hiatus97 restarting the ea6b production line at this stage would not be cost effective they would argue because the resulting aircraft would be very expensive the cost of restarting the line would be amortized over short production run extending the ea6bs service life another option would be to extend the ea6bs service life beyond 2010 or 2015 this may be feasible but it might also be expensive by the 2015 time frame many ea6bs will be more than 40 years old to achieve this long life span the ea6b has been given almost continuous upgrades since the early 1970s including modifications to the central wing sections98 many would argue that the ea6b has already experienced its slep service life extension program and that keeping the prowler flying past 2015 will realize diminishing returns those in favor of sleping the ea6b past 2015 might point out that the b52 which entered the operational force in 1955 is older than the ea6b and is projected to fly even longer than 2015 why not the prowler first unlike the b52 the ea6b is very high demand aircraft as discussed in the current status section of this report the ea6b accompanies every us air strike as described in the section of this report on kosovo the navy and marine corps literally flew the aircraft around the clock second the ea6b lands on aircraft carriers the violence of carrier take off and landings puts stresses on the ea6b airframe that the landbased b52 never experiences also the maritime environment itself is harsh on seabased aircraft finally the b52 flies relatively benign flight profile compared to the prowler ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs37

april 23 1999does not fly tactical missions that often put heavy stress on the airframe from high rates of acceleration or maneuvering the ea6b has more occasion to fly stressful flight profiles converting a6s to ea6bs final possibility would be to transform the a6 intruder aircraft into ea6bs most defense analysts concur however that this conversion would not be economically feasible because the prowler was developed concurrently with the a6 not derived from it99 the prowler is four seat plane versus the two seat a6 it has longer sturdier fuselage to accommodate much heavier bring back weight to the aircraft carrier in addition to the additional crew the ea6b possesses distinguishing characteristics such as its podshaped fairing at the top of the vertical fin which holds sensitive surveillance receivers an ea6b derived from preexisting a6 would cost as much as brand new ea6b but the airframe would already have the milage of the original a6 aircraft100 midterm options for replacing the ea6b in 2015 while some of the options detailed above might usefully shoreup current ew capabilities they would not provide dod with longterm joint airborne ew capability to replace the ea6bthe marine corps and the navy have stated their desire to continue conducting this mission in the postprowler era and the air force is reexamining its stance on this issue this section will focus on several platform options for replacing the prowler in the 2015 time frame when considering fixed wing aircraft to replace the ea6b prowler five aircraft designs are most frequently discussed the fa18g super hornet the joint strike fighter the f15e eagle f16 fighting falcon and the f22 raptor building new aircraft one designed specifically to conduct the ew mission or employing uavs for ew are also options to be assessed each of these are discussed later in this section assessment criteria number of attributes might be usefully assessed in considering the merits of various ea6b replacement options these attributes are 1 aircraft unit cost 2 operations and maintenance considerations 3 degree of jointness 4 number of crew for manned aircraft options 5 initial operating capability and service life and 6 variety of operational characteristics that would affect the planes ability to penetrate enemy airspace and escort attack aircraft into and out of the target area these attributes are described below and will be used as framework to assess the pros and cons of various ea6b replacement options cost all things being equal an ew aircraft that costs less than another is obviously advantageous however data on potential procurement cost is generally available but information on annual operating and maintenance om costs is generally not available making it difficult to make comparative calculationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs38 every aircraft in the services inventory in fact every military platform requires an operations maintenance and logistical support structure much of the cost and equipment in the military is associated with what is often called the tail eg those systems that dont go into combat as opposed to the tooth eg those systems that do go into combat the tail is usually larger than the tooth therefore by reducing the number of different kinds of aircraft dod can sometimes reduce operations and maintenance costs the ef111 for instance was able to use the same maintenance facilities as the f111 the maintenance crews responsible for taking care of the f16 didnt require additional or unique training to maintain the f16cj if four s3 viking aircraft took up given amount of space in an aircraft carrier hangar four es3as consumed the same amount of space all existing us ew aircraft whether attack jammers such as the ef111 ea6b and ec130h elint or ecm aircraft such as the rc135 and ep3e or sead aircraft such as the f4g and f16cj are variants of parent aircraft jointness if dod uses one aircraft to replace the ea6b it almost certainly will be joint aircraft joint aircraft would be one that could land on aircraft carriers and satisfy the expeditionary needs of the air force and the amphibious needs of the marine corps this assessment will therefore consider particular aircrafts degree of jointness as measure of merit however it may prove impossible to procure single joint aircraft that satisfies all future dod ew needs instead it may prove most practicable for each service or at least the air force and navy to base their ew capabilities on aircraft specific to their service in this case however it also appears likely that the ew gear itself could be joint the pods antenna s transmitters exciters and computers or at least should maintain very high degree of commonality crew number aircraft that originally have only pilot would need to be converted to two crew configuration increasing cost and potentially degrading aircraft performance while increased automation and the use of computer decision aids will reduce the need for four crew aircraft such as the ea6b it is probably infeasible for single pilot to effectively operate an ew aircraft flying the aircraft monitoring the electronic spectrum for popup threats directing jamming signals and modulating the wavelength and frequency of the signals would be too much work for one person to perform effectively uavs face an even greater challenge in this regard initial operating capability ioc gap in us ew capabilities would put us forces at unnecessary risk as discussed earlier the prowler is planned for retirement in the 2010to2015 time frame and its high operational tempo will make extending this date unlikely the exact number of aircraft required to replace the ea 6b has yet to be determined this number will depend on variety of factors including assumptions on future military threats and the types of conflict the us is likely to face as rough planning factor however one can assume that dod will require more ew aircraft than the 124 prowlers that exist today it is there fore important to assure that replacements are fielded at rate that would insure smooth transition some analysts recommend the 2006 2007 time frame converting existing operational aircraft to the ew mission could be advantageous in terms of ioc and availability compared to developing new aircraft however new aircraft would have the advantage of longer service lifehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs39 101see crs issue brief ib92035 fa18ef super hornet aircraf t program for more details 102conversation with rear admiral john nathman director air warfare division n88 office of the chief of naval operations april 4 2000 103skibitski peter j nathman favors fa18g alternative as ea6b prowler complement inside the navy march 27 2000operational characteristics the most effective strike package of the future envisioned by many analysts would be one where all the aircraft not just the attack aircraft were stealthy this strike package including the ew plane would use their low observability to evade enemy early warning and tracking radars and achieve tactical surprise over the target optimally the ew aircraft would only turn on its jammer at the last moment to increase the strike packages survivability and to protect the aircraft after they released their payloads and egressed the target area of course the ew aircraft would also use its jammer earlier in the mission if the strike package were detected and threatened to operate along these lines the ew platform would not just need to be stealthy but also would require the range speed and maneuverability to keep up with the attack aircraft inherent in this assessment is an assumption that the aircraft has sufficient payload capacity to carry the required ew equipment the ability to carry the equipment internally as opposed to in external pods is also advantageous as this would help maintain stealthy profile fa18g101 the fa18 aircraft is manufactured by the boeing company at its mcdonnell douglass plant in st louis missouri an ew variant of the fa18ef dubbed the growler is favored by many parties to replace the ea6b prowler chief of navy aviation radm john nathman has said that he thinks the fa18g is the most pragmatic solution for navy102 he has been quoted in the press as having said very good answer for us is growleran f18efbased aircraft it uses the icap iii capability of the ea6bits tailhook aircraft its also striker its an aircraft that provides for i think much more compatibility with the strike force because of the equal speeds103 proponents of the fa18g as followon to the ea6b would emphasize the following attributes first the fa18f is large two seat aircraft the aircraft can carry almost 18000lbs of external payload more than enough to accommodate the alq99 and other jamming equipment second the super hornet is tailhook aircraft that can land on aircraft carriers although the fa18f hasnt been designed with specific air force specifications in mind it can be just as joint as the prowler which is flown by air force crews third the fa18ef is already going to be part of carrier fighter wings so making an ew variant will realize om savings throughout the force finally and perhaps most importantly the super hornet is real aircraft its supporters would argue it has been in production since 1997 and is expected to enter service in 2001 it will be available in sufficient numbers in the prowlers planned retirement window opponents of an fa18g variant to replace the ea6b would argue that the super hornet is not joint aircraft only the navy is buying it opponents would also say that although the navys purchase of hundreds of super hornets will result in some om economies of scale the jsf will by way of compariso n be bought inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs40 104see for instance gao report nsiad9698 105more information on the jsf can be found in crs report rl30563 joint strike fighter jsf program background status and issues 106skibitski peter j nathman favors fa18g alternative as ea6b prowler complement inside the navy march 27 2000thousands of units across three services making an ew variant of this aircraft would result in much greater om savings than the growler variant furthermore at approximately 73 million per aircraft the fa18g is more expensive than other ew options also opponents of the fa18 option would argue that the growler may have operational shortcomings compared to other aircraft candidates that would result in difficulty executing the optimal strike package operational concept described earlier for instance the fa18 is not stealthy aircraft it also has short range compared to other attack aircraft finally the gao104 and others have criticized the super hornets lack of maneuverability and chronic wing vibrations that damage externally carried armaments what effect might this vibration have on delicate ew gear all of these deficiencies the fa18s opponents would argue would make it difficult for the growler to escort attack aircraft into around and out of enemy territory joint strike fighter105 two teams are competing to produce the joint strike fighter the boeing company and its subcontractors are pitted against team led by lockheed martin and northrop grumman it has been reported that the marine corps wants to retain the electronic attack mission and the service has proposed using the joint strike fighter106 while the jsf program office has yet to sponsor any official studies of jsf ew variant the contractor teams led by lockheed martin and boeing have initiated internal studies of how the aircraft could be modified to fill the gap created by the ea6bs retirement those in favor of creating an ew jsf variant would point out first that the jsf is truly joint aircraft designed with all the services requirements in mind it can land on an aircraft carrier or if need be unfinished runways and similar rough surfaces also since the current plan is to buy very large number of the aircraft almost 3000 units the jsf option will generate more om savings than any other theater aircraft buying even more of them to perform the ew mission will only add to the infrastructure savings furthermore with projected cost of 3041million copy in fy2001 dollars the jsf could be less expensive fighter or attack ew aircraft than anything else that hasnt already been built and perhaps even competitively priced with legacy aircraft second proponents of the jsf would highlight the aircrafts favorable operational capabilities the jsfs stealthy profile will be second only to first tier stealth aircraft such as the b2 and f22 it will have good range and maneuverability which in addition to its low observability will enable the jsf ew variant to escort an attack package throughout the mission flight profile also depending on which version of the jsf is chosen for production the jsf could have large internal weapons bay 140 cubic feet enough for two 2000 lb bombs whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs41 107there were confirmed kills of mobile scud missile launchers during this conflictcould accommodate the ew gear and thus not degrade the aircrafts stealthy profile with externally mounted hardware finally the jsfs proponents would note that the aircraft is an advanced system in the early stages of development this is advantageous on two levels first ew components could be more easily incorporated directly into the aircraft design rather than added on to an existing airframe in retrospect second as next generation joint airframe the jsf is based on versatile and modular designs this makes future retroactive modifications to the aircraft relatively easy those against building jsf ew aircraft would point out that the jsf is currently envisioned as singleseat aircraft regardless of the aircrafts modular foundation adding another seat would require aeronautical tradeoffs in the airframe and would likely increase the jsfs unit cost finally jsf opponents would also make the basic point that the jsf simply does not exist the program is in the early stages of development and in fact there are guarantees that it ever will be built defense appropriations for fy2001 reduced jsf funding by 150 million and has delayed the program by three months even in best case scenario the jsfs 2010 ioc would likely leave real gap between the ea6bs retirement and fully functioning ew jsf force the united states needs to take tangible steps today to replace the ea6b and the jsf development and production timelines do not make this aircraft viable option its opponents would argue f15e strike eagle the f15 is manufactured by the boeing company at its mcdonnell douglass facility in st louis missouri the f15c is currently the premier air superiority fighter in the air force inventory the current plan is to replace the f15c with the f22 raptor for air superiority missions the f15e strike eagle is heavily modified twoseat dual role variant with both airtoair and airto ground capability forty eight strike eagles were used against iraq in the 1991 persian gulf war primarily hunting scud missile launchers using its lantirn low altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night system107 it is expected that the joint strike fighter and to some degree the f22 will assume the f15es airto ground duties in the future there were funds in the administrations fy2001 budget request for f15c or f15e aircraft those in favor of replacing the ea6b with an f15e variant would make the following points first the strike eagle is an operational aircraft currently in the us inventory and could be given an active ew capability well prior to the prowlers retirement also the strike eagle is battle proven and effective airframe with good range and payload capability second the f15e has other qualities that make it promising candidate for the ew role it is for instance two seat aircraft also strike eagle crews are already operating sophisticated ew gear the f15e uses an integrated countermeasures system called the tews tactical electronic warfare system strike eagles tews can jam radar systems operating in high frequencies such as radar used by shortrangehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs42 108mulholland david f15 costs can be slashed says boeing report janes defense weekly june 14 2000 109air force magazine 2000 usaf almanac may 2000 140surfacetoair missiles aaa and airborne threats tews is being upgraded to give it the ability to jam threats in midtolow frequencies such as longrange radar systems third f15e proponents would argue that the strike eagle offers cost savings compared to other ew platform options at approximately 55 million each the strike eagle would be less expensive to produce than either the f22 or the fa18g furthermore it was reported in june 2000 that boeing study concluded that new manufacturing technologies should enable boeing to reduce the cost of building f15 aircraft by about half108 if this were true 275 million strike eagle would make an even stronger argument finally proponents would argue that although not new aircraft the f15e is robust and can be expected to be operationally useful for decades it has strengthened airframe for increased gross weight at takeoff and can maneuver at high gravities gs the f15e structure is rated at 16000 flight hours double the lifetime of earlier f15s opponents of an ew variant of the f15e would point out that the strike eagle is neither designed to land on aircraft carriers nor is it joint aircraft second the f 15e is an old design although upgraded significantly in the 1980s its basic design and technology derive from work in the 1960s the f15e is not stealthy aircraft its opponents would observe while the f15e might appear to have lower cost than some other potential ea6b replacement options the strike eagle will require significant upgrades and modifications to make it useful jammer this could drive up the unit price opponents would argue f16 fighting falcon the f16 is manufactured by lockheed martin of fort worth texas the f16 is described as compact versatile and lowcost multirole fighter aircraft that is highly maneuverable and has repeatedly proved itself in airto air combat and airtosurface attackthe f16 is the workhorse of the usaf fighter fleet109 although very successful aircraft both in terms of performance and numbers manufactured and exported the f16 is slated to be replaced by the joint strike fighter in the 2010 time frame those in favor of building an ew variant of the f16 would probably point out first that this aircraft already has been optimized to conduct the suppression of enemy air defenses sead mission approximately 100 f16cj 1 seat and f16dj 2 seat models employ the agm88 harm missile harm targeting system hts and the alq119 electronic self protection jamming pod while the sead mission is not synonymous with the active ew mission the technologies and operational concepts employed are similar to active radar jamming for instance crew operating the f16j can autonomously locate enemy threat radars and launch the harm missile thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs43 110for more information on the f22 raptor see crs issue brief ib87111 f22 raptor aircraft programaircraft and the crews already have capabilities in the ew realm that make them good candidates to replace the ea6b proponents would argue another argument in favor of the f16 is its unit cost by far proponents contend the f16 is the most reasonably priced fighter in the us inventory unit costs are affected by variety of factors such as the number of units procured but even at its highest estimates 25 million the f16 is tens of millions of dollars less expensive than the lowest estimate for the jsf and one seventh the cost of the f22 also operations and maintenance costs would likely be kept to minimum since the f16 is already copiously represented in the us air force inventory opponents of an ew variant of the f16 would make the following points first this is usaf aircraft it is not joint and not found in the inventories of the marine corps nor the navy furthermore the f16 can not land on aircraft carriers and is thus unsuitable for the navy more important opponents would say the f16 is an old design although it has performed admirably it is based on 1960s technology and wont last much past the jsfs ioc in 2010 as an older aircraft it doesnt incorporate stealthy designs and future efforts to reduce its aircraft signature will be difficult especially because the aircraft has internal weapons volume and all ew gear will need to be hung from underwing f22 raptor110 the f22 is built by lockheed martin in marietta georgia and fort worth texas the boeing military airplanes division in wichita kansas is major subcontractor the f22 raptor is nextgeneration fighterattack aircraft using the latest stealth technology to reduce detection by radar equipped with more advanced engines and avionics than the current f15 eagle the f22 is expected to maintain us air force capabilities against more sophisticated aircraft and missiles in the 21st century the current plan is to buy 341 raptors those in favor of creating an ew variant of the f22 would point out that the raptors expected ioc of 2005 would make it available well in advance of the ea 6bs retirement also the aircrafts good range and excellent stealth capabilities would enable it to escort strike package through the most hostile airspace furthermore the f22s payload capability enough internal storage to carry two 1000 lb bombs and four underwing hardpoints capable of carrying 5000 lbs each should be sufficient to carry the required ew equipment proponents would argue proponents main argument would probably be that the f22 will be the worlds most advanced aircraft and will already be outfitted with the most powerful and capable computers and radars these systems will combine with the requisite ew apparatus to create very effective ew capability those against creating an f22 ew platform to replace the ea6b would point out first that the raptor will be

laborrelated costs associated with manufacturing many copies of particular item in succession as more units are produced workers learn how to perform their steps in the producti on process more quickly and laborrelated costs are reduced for discussion of the learning curve in defense acquisition programs see crs report 96785 f navy major shipbuilding programs and shipbuilders issues and options for congress by ronald orourke washington 1996 september 24 1996 p 95110 this discussion focuses on learning curve effects in shipbuilding but can be applied to learningcurve affects in aircraft manufacturing where learningcurve theory was first developedallnew aircraft design another option to consider would be to develop an entirely new airplane design given the 15 to 20year period that might be needed to develop new aircraft design such program if begun now might permit the first newdesign aircraft to begin procurement around 2015 or 2020 when the ea6bs are scheduled to leave service developing an allnew design might also permit dod to develop joint ew aircraft that reflects input from all the services on desired operational characteristics such plane could offer lifecycle cost advantages to dod by permitting the use of common training and maintenance facilities and spare parts supplies for the ew planes operated by all the services an entirely new aircraft design however would likely require several billion dollars and possibly more than 10 billion dollars to develop this substantial development cost would be amortized over somewhat limited production run of perhaps less than 200 aircraft adding tens of millions of dollars to the average acquisition ie development plus procurement cost of each aircraft the acquisition cost of these aircraft would be further increased by virtue of them being the first aircraft built to this basic design industry may need to acquire new tools jigs and other equipment to build the aircraft and the entire aircraft production run would be at or near the top of the manufacturers learning curve for producing the design114 lastly these aircraft being of different basic design from existing dod aircraft would not be able to take advantage of the training and maintenance facilities and spare parts supplies already established for existing dod aircraft types in this sense an allnew design even if it employs common set of training and maintenance facilities and spare parts supplies for ew aircraft operated by all the services might still incur higher operating and support costs than an ew aircraft derived from an existing aircraft design making this option potentially disadvantageous to dod in terms of lifecycle costs the potentially high costs associated with developing procuring and supporting limited number of allnew aircraft appear to be the major reason why periodic dod examinations in recent years of this option have resulted in decisions not to pursue it and why there is little if any discussion of this option today given the costs of this option the most likely scenario for pursuing it would be determination not currently anticipated by most observers that ew aircraft derived from existing aircraft designs would be operationally inadequate in some way uavs final option would be to deploy ew uavs as replacements for the manned ea6b current uavs and those now under development appear to lack the size and power needed to carry todays ew jammers and antennas the ew uav option would thus appear to involve developing new uav design with adequatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs46 size and power possibly in conjunct ion with parallel effort to develop new ew jammers and antennas that are smaller and require less power to operate the ew uav option might be broadly consistent with the policy goal set forth during senate armed services committee hearing on february 8 2000 by sen john warner for the armed serves to have unmanned vehicles account for onethird of all their strike platforms by the year 2010 consistent with this goal the services are now pursuing programs to develop strikecapable uavs known as unmanned combat air vehicles ucavs if the services in the future deploy ucavs it might be operationally appropriate for these unmanned vehicles to be escorted and supported by unmanned ew uavs rather than manned ew aircraft it might also be viewed as broadly consistent with the earlier history of developing us manned ew aircraft the ef111 and ea6b from existing manned attack aircraft the f111 and a6 the technical feasibility of the ew uav option in this time frame is not clear dod uav development programs are generally regarded as having proceeded slowly and haltingly since the early 1980s on the basis of dods rather limited rate of progress in developing and fielding uavs over the last 20 years it might be reasonable to question whether dod could develop and begin procuring new ew uav by 2015 or 2020 some observers however argue that dods relatively slow progress on uavs in the past has been due to lack of enthusiasm or outright opposition to uavs on the part of dod rather than any technical difficulties associated with uavs indeed dods efforts to manage its uav development programs have been criticized by congress and others on several occasions on these grounds it might be argued that an ew uav just like new ew manned aircraft could be developed in 15 or 20 years provided that the effort received adequate emphasis and support from dod and congress even with adequate support however developing an ew uav might pose significant technical difficulties the ew functions performed by the crew members of ea6bs are complex automating these functions might require the development of very sophisticated uav hardware and software and extensive system integration given dods recent experiences with other sophisticated weapons acquisition programs the software development and system integration work might pose particular challenges even in program with 15 or 20year time schedule parallel effort to reduce the size of todays jammers and antennas might also pose technical challenges even with continued advances in electronics the potential cost implications of the uav option are difficult to assess developing fully capable ew uav might require several billion dollars parallel effort to develop smaller and lowerpower jammers and antennas would add further to development costs once developed however an ew uav could have unit procurement cost lower perhaps substantially lower than that of manned aircraft due to the avoidance of costs associated with crewrelated design elements such as the cockpit display systems and lifesupport systems once fielded ew uavs would not incur the operation and support costs associated with maintaining pilot and other airborne crew members but there would be offsetting costs associated with maintaining the groundbased personnel that would likely be needed to remotely operate the aircraft ew uavs would also require their own training andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs47 115a more detailed explanation of r2 including the exact mathematical equation can be found continuedmaintenance facilities and spare parts unless these could be made common with those of other uav and ucav programs an ew uav like ucav might offer potential operational advantages in terms of greater stealth due to reduced size the avoidance of the need for having cockpit which is potential source of radar reflections and the ability to locate other features such as the landing gear doors in places where they are better hidden from radar and the ability to perform more stressful maneuvers than can be performed by manned aircraft and as with ucavs and other uavs an ew uav if shot down would not risk the loss or capture of any crew members as with other uavs however an ew uav even if equipped with sophisticated onboard systems might not be as operationally flexible might not be able to react quickly to changing battlefield conditions as manned aircraft whose onscene crew can observe conditions at first hand and make rapid decisions on how to react to them given the potential for enemy forces to employ mobile airdefense systems decoys and other deceptive techniques the more limited operational flexibility of an ew uav could be significant operational disadvantage longerterm options for 2020 and beyond it is probably not too early for congress to consider how dod will conduct ew in the post 2020 time frame considering the length of time it currently takes to field major weapon system todays rd investments will probably have tangible impact on the programs that emerge in the second decade of the 21st century there are two areas that are frequently discussed as post2020 ew options these areas are 1 spacebased jamming and 2 micro uavs evaluating future ew platform effectiveness there is fundamental physical principle that dominates ew platform design operations and effectiveness this principle is often referred to as r2 pronounced rsquared and it refers to the dissipation of radar energy understanding this concept helps illustrate the pros and cons of basing ew jammers on small uavs or in space and why these are longterm options jamming energy density decreases rapidly with distance from the jammer the amount of radar energy that must be transmitted to jam given radar increases at the square of the distance from the radar therefore jamming platform that is twice as far away from the target as another jamming platform requires four times as much power to have the same effectiveness while jammer four times farther away as another requires 16 times the power to have the same effectiveness there are two ways to increase jamming power the first method is to transmit more radar energy this energy is measured in the number of watts kilo watts or mega watts the second method of increasing jamming energy is to increase the physical size of the antenna also known as the radar aperture115 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs48 115continued in toomay jc radar principles for the nonspecialist lifetime learning publications bellmont ca 1982 5 116email communication with nrl tactical electronic warfare division personnel 117moniac rudiger germany funds final phase of taifun uav janes defen weekly april 26 2000 3given this principle that the energy required to jam an enemy target increases at the square of the target range platforms that can penetrate enemy territory and jam enemy transmissions from very close range have big advantage over those platforms that cannot because they would require one quarter the power either in terms of watts of energy transmitted or in terms of the antenna size of those platforms that operate twice as far away penetrating jamming platforms might also be much smaller and potentially less costly currently power supply is one of the heaviest and most costly components of military platforms and large antennas present aeronautical design complications standoff jammer one that operates from distance has the advantage of increased survivability it has lower likelihood of being successfully attacked and destroyed by an adversary however because of r 2 the standoff jammer pays heavy penalty in terms of power the greater the distance the greater the penalty micro uavs as noted earlier dod does not yet have an operational uav radar jammer and size and weight limitations challenge the feasibility of making todays uavs effective jammers however because the r2 principle affords great advantage to ew platforms that can get very close to their targets as microuavs potentially could small uav jammers may merit attention there have been recent advances in developing very small low power uavs to jam radars one example is four year old program run out of the navy research laboratory nrl using commercially available technology nrl scientists have developed simple jamming module that weighs approximately 12 grams mounted on uav with an eight inch wingspan this jammer has proven the ability to totally obscure the radar screens of search radars from as far away as 50 yards it is estimated that the jamming modules on these small uavs could cost as little as 100 each116 the united states isnt the only country conducting research in uav radar jammers the german parliament for example has allocated dm1539 million to complete development of the german armys taifun attack unmanned air vehicle uav an electronic countermeasures variant the mucke is expected to provide the german army with the capability to jam enemy transmissions from range of 100km and should be in service by 2005117 in addition to the advantage of not exposing pilot to sams micro uav jammers might also have some operational advantages visavis manned ew aircraft for instance manned ew aircraft escorting strike package might effectively obscure enemy radars but the adversary has little doubt of the general direction ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs49 118the information in this section was primarily derived from conversations with mr ivan bekey president bekey designs and former director of advanced programs nasaattack certain sectors of the enemy radars will be more powerfully obscured than others indicating attack angle and the timing of the attack because you cant loiter indefinitely thus even if the enemy cant see the us aircraft with radar they have good idea of the direction and timing of the attack and might be able to shoot at us aircraft using different sensors micro uav jammers on the other hand could be covertly emplaced days or weeks prior to an attack by flying them or launching them into the area where the iads system is located they could then be activated remotely just prior to the real attack and used to confuse the radar operator for instance the microuav could emit radio signals that would mimic those of attacking us aircraft but from the opposite direction of the real attack this would confuse the adversary seduce them into directing their attention in the wrong direction and increase the us forces tactical surprise if employe d in large numbers and effectively networked micro uavs might be able to spoof or jam entire enemy radar network s paving the way toward uncontested us aerial attacks spacebased jamming118 the department of defense is increasingly expanding the use of outer space as base from which to conduct military operations spacebased or overhead assets already contribute greatly to military as well as civil and commercial communication navigation and observation activities basing an asset in space often gives it advantages of scope and perspective that are difficult to realize on the earths surface or even in the atmosphere spacebased systems can also enjoy access to solar energy unimpeded by the earths atmosphere and cloud cover however placing objects in earths orbit is expensive and typically only those commercial and military systems that can realize an advantage over surface and air based systems are launched into space according to studies at nasa and elsewhere however the cost of placing and maintaining objects in earths orbit is expected to drop significantly in the next 1520 years due to advances in materials energy and miniaturization technology if these advances take place by the year 2020 it could be possible to consider effective spacebased jamming satellites these spacebased jammers might be able to overcome the r2 problem in two ways first the jammer would collect huge amounts of solar energy and convert it into up to four megawatt s of power for comparison purposes radio communications transmissions frequent target of jamming operations are typically in the 10000 to 100000 watts of power four megawatt jammer would be 40 to 400 times more powerful than these radio transmissions second the jammer could possibly employ antennas much larger than those currently employed on aircraft perhaps up to 40 meters in diameter as discussed earlier increasing antenna size is basic way of increasing the power of jamming signals so even though the jamming signal would dissipate at the square of very long distance from the target ie low earth orbit or leo the power with which it was transmitted could more than make up for this challenge and effectively shut down enemy transmissionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs50 such spacebased jammers could be built today but they are not economically feasible the cost of building solar arrays or alternative power sources would need to be reduced by factor of 100 the cost of building jamming transmitters and the miscellaneous spacecraft components would need to be reduced by factor of 10 there are also operational challenges associated with all leobased satellites in terms of keeping the satellite in orbit and ensuring the systems are positioned over the appropriate theater of operations at the right time although it is not an ew jamming satellite dods discoverer ii satellite program is grappling with many of the technical challenges that would be faced by spacebased jammer thus its success or progress may be indicative of the future attractiveness of spacebased jammers the discover ii program is attempting to design fabricate and launch two prototype satellites which would perform the same ground surveillance function as todays e8 jstars aircraft as with an ew jammer the discoverer ii satellite will have to overcome cost and operational challenges associated with launching and employing large antenna eight meters in diameter powered by large solar panelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30639crs51 appendix
