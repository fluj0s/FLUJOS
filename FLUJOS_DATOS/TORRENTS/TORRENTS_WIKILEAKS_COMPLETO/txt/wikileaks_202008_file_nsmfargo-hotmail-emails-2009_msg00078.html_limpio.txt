herring ns greetings glad you liked my statement i meant every word of it i am tired of 12 hearted losers and drama queens this fight is real for and the weak hearted need to get out of the way yes i know about the importance of oaths that is why i addressed it it is very important to and should be to every single ns in the world in regards to the trip i do hope you can ride along with at this point it might just be you and i going from here the other guys here either cant get of work or dont have any to go and the unit leader is having back surgery i cant imagine you would need more than 350 for the trip that should be more than enough i dont think i will have any more than that myself plus you can always split the cost of motel room with someone or several people the 2 nights we are in milwaukee worse case scenario if you are running out of i can cover the gas i have to be there anyways so dont worry about it the main thing is to be there and if you are in pinch i am always willing to help brother if its just us 2 going i will probably end up driving my own car if another person wants to go we will have to rent small car my back seat is only small enough for children lol i will let you know about motels when you figure out where the bus is dropping you off if it comes down to st paul mpls or hutchinson hutchinson motels will be little cheaper if you are going to the city i suggest st paul bus stop not mpls due to the bridge collapse mpls is pain in the ass and will slow us down st pauls bus stop is right on university ave i think so that works too i would put you up here at our place but with 6 children and very pissed off woman and not much extra space its probably not good plan i am very impressed by your dedication and devotion to our cause and look forward to talking with you on the trip about the job the party has in mind for you and just general comeraderie 88 commander schoep on 101607 william herring nsmfargohotmailcom wrote this needed to be said i couldnt agree more commander lately i have become angered and even disgusted by the petty bullshit i have seen and heard i asked myself more than once about certain individuals i am going to follow man or woman who acts like this the nsm is the finest nationalist group in the world and like any other large group it will have its growing pains and often the wheat must be separated from the chaff i particularly like what you wrote about the importance of mans oath in the society of our ancient fathers to break your word was considered the highest of crimes right up there with murder and child molestation that is why i have not yet mailed in my official oath sheetbecause in my eyes that will be it an unbreakable bond that i would rather die than violate that is how serious i view mans oath i am an odinist and i take the creed of iron to heart the havamal and the words of allfather are as important to as the words of our beloved fuhrer i have been waiting for you to issue statement like this before i sent in my oath now i know beyond doubt that you are the man who needs to be in charge of this organization finally i said to myself man who isnt afraid to show his innerviking lol i am doing all that i can to make sure we have all the bills taken care of and i have enough cash to make the miluakee trip i will be working my ass off until then i will check on the bus schedule and see if i can get as close to your vacinity as possible perhaps you can point in the direction of the cheapest motel in the area i dont really give damn bed and toilet works for but i am only going to be able to pull maybe 350 for the trip after i pay all the bills angela is still on maternity leave so 65 night hotels on this trip as the date gets nearer i will finalize my plans sincerely st first class w herring date tue 16 oct 2007 012939 0500from commandernewsaxonorgto nsmworldyahoogroupscomsubject honor the oath open letter to members of the party nsm party comrades i am addressing this publically but it is directed at active party members when i first joined the nsm i knew it would be something i would stick with the rest of my life it was not club gang or some fleeting thrill for the moment it was commitment to way of life and direct link to many of our forefathers who fought for blood and soil fellow party members most of you have taken the oath of loyalty to the party and those that have not yet taken your oath as read in the membership handbook are expected to do so as soon as possible it is commitment and proves your serious about helping us to bring about changes in our nation it also creates solidarity and kinship with your fellow brothers and sisters in our struggle in this modern day materialistic society to some an oath or pledge of loyalty means nothing for those of us that live by the old ways breaking an oath defiles your honor and leaves you with nothing but an empty shell that once held your life force if man can not stay true to his oath then he is man but rather castrated maggot devoid of any trace of purity or an aryan soul your oath also holds you to the battlefield until this fight for our race and nation has been won i often reflect about socalled comrades that have abandoned their oaths to the party and i wonder how they can live with themselves as the rest of us face such large scale enemy in zog and they give up without fight or before the fight is finished we at party hq always hear multitude of excuses from the oath breakers sometimes their reasons are based in serious issues still there is reason serious enough to break your oath but more often than not it is trivial matters such as personal problems with another member so and so had their feelings hurt or this or that person was not thanked enough for their work or did not get promoted or did not like certain rule in the chain of command or religion or insert excuse here ____ these same oath breakers often claim to take great pride in the 3rd reich and claim they are national socialists truth be known had they lived during the 3rd reich and broke their party oaths there especially in the war years they might have met the hanging judge roland freisler and be dangling from piano wire it comes down to this comrades and prospective party members if you are not serious about our party leave now i am opening the door now for any current member to leave with their oath in tact i want to shake out any of the uncommitted nonserious members right now considering they are not needed as we move forward to the frontlines to the prospects and probate nsm members this message is for you also if you are not in this fight with us to the bitter end now would be the time to walk away furthermore the nsm does not operate as democracy your pledge of loyalty is to the party and its leadership honor you oath and your pledge of loyalty to the party or get out of our ranks now while you still can to the rest of you the party faithfull the warrior archetypes you men and women forged in iron and steel ready to stand against the zionist hordes and their beloved illegal slave laborers your party salutes and honors you providence has already promised us victory in our fight and your ancestors march alongside of you in spirit the men who fought at valley forge stand along side of us as do the brave men of the alamo as do the thousands that perished on the eastern front fighting communism and every other meaningfull battle where our racial kinfolk have sacrificed their lives let those who abandon us and break their oaths run away quickly with their tales between their legs if they can live with that shame and dishonor so be it for the rest of us duty calls new stormtroops and party members gave their oaths to the party at the successfull
