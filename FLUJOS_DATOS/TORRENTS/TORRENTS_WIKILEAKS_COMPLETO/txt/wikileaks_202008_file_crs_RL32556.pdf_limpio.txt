division november 14 2007 abstract in february 2004 proposal the sec asked for public comment on the need for additional changes to rule 12b1 among other things it proposed requiring distributionrelated costs to be directly deducted from individual shareholder accounts rather than from aggregate fund assets potentially beneﬁtting investors by giving them more direct and thus better understanding of sales charges but critics say such reform would result in investors accounts eventually paying smaller nominal amounts as they age giving brokerdealers added incentive to churn the accounts there are additional concerns that such changes might result in complicated recordkeeping burdens and added tax liabilities for investors the 2004 proposal also asked for public comment on whether rule 12b1 should be repealed but some observers have however noted that the plans are ingrained in the ﬁnancial system and repeal could mean reduced service for small investors by brokers and shift to frontend loads which do have the beneﬁt of greater visibility relative to 12b 1 fees in the spring of 2007 sec chairman cox announced that due to perceptions that 12b1 fees had strayed beyond their original intent the agency would be reexamining 12b1 which it is currently doing if the agency adopts reforms it might possibly involve changes to the way 12b1 fees are disclosed hr 3225

exchange commission sec in 1980 pursuant to the investment company act of 1940 ica the rule allows funds whose boards approve 12b1 plans structures under the rule to draw from fund shareholders aggregate assets to market or advertise and distribute sell fund shares something they had not been allowed to do prior to 1981 funds were allowed only one means of compensating the broker who sold them the frontend load but in 1980 the sec adopted rule 12b1 after years of lobbying from various funds who cited financial hardships and need to use fund assets to underwrite expanded marketing and distribution to boost their size viability ultimately lowering their investors costs the rule allows funds to deduct percentage of funds assets each year to pay the broker an annual fee the 12b1 fee initially the agency expected that 12b1 fees would be temporary fix to help smaller struggling noload funds to grow healthier but fund companies began using the fee to either eliminate or to offset frontend loads as well now the vast majority of funds levy 12b1 fees the research consensus is that 12b1 pl ans do not appear to have helped to lower fund investors costs as was originally hoped they have however helped to provide them with the benefit of greater choice in the fund payment structures available to them but some brokerdealers who sell the funds may not be steering investors into the most beneficial structures reports indicate that minority of funds that are closed to new investors still charge 12b1 fees though the practice is permissible critics condemn it as violation of rule 12b1s original intent allowing assetbased funding to attract new fund investors funds fund distributors and some independent industry observers however say that investors in closed funds still demand and receive attention from brokerdealers who may have sold fund to them years ago and 12b1 fees still need to be collected to continue to pay for those services in february 2004 proposal the sec asked for public comment on the need for additional changes to rule 12b1 among other things it proposed requiring distributionrelated costs to be directly deducted from individual shareholder accounts rather than from aggregate fund assets potentially benefitting investors by giving them more direct and thus better understanding of sales charges but critics say such reform would result in investors

same fee for all brokers who sell the fund from 1940 to 1981 the sec empowered by this act to regulate funds allowed only one type of broker compensationthe frontend load if an investor wanted the services of broker he or she paid percentage of the money invested at the time of the investment and nothing more in the late 1970s various mutual funds confronted troubling outflow of fund assets and the industry lobbied the sec to allow it to use fund assets to underwrite expanded marketing and distribution thereby boosting funds size and viability in 1980 after substantial lobbying from mutual funds the sec adopted rule 12b1 which allows funds to deduct percentage of the funds assets each year to pay the broker an annual fee the 12b1 fee1 in doing so the agency reversed its longheld position that funds assets should not be used to help sell more fund shares and made it legal to use such money to pay for marketing and distribution expenses initially the sec expected that 12b1 fees would be temporary fix to help smaller struggling noload funds become financially viable2 but fund companies began using the fee to either eliminate or to offset frontend loads which were running as high as 85 during the 1980s later the revenue from 12b1 fees was also applied to the cost of selling funds through large financial product supermarkets like charles schwabs onesource the sec shares regulatory responsibility over the 12b1 fees with the financial industry regulatory authority finra nongovernmental regulator for all securities firms that do business in the united states 3 finra limits the annual rate at which 12b1 fees may be paid to brokerdealers to more than 075 of funds average net assets per year funds are also allowed to include an additional service fee of up to 025 of average net assets each year to compensate sales professionals for providing ongoing services to investors or for maintaining their accounts according to the investment company institute ici the major mutual fund national trade group about 70 of all funds currently levy 12b1 fees in 2004 ici reported that 40 of 12b1 fees were used for compensation to financial advisors for initial assistance in helping investors 1 the agencys adoption of rule 12b1 pursuant to the ica is an example of the rulemaking process under which federal agencies implement federal laws in the securities areas major legislation such as the securities act of 1933 the securities exchange act of 1934 and the ica provide the framework for the secs oversight of the securities markets the statutes tend to be broadly drafted and largely focused on establishing basic principles and objectives the secs central goals are to maintain fair and orderly markets and to protect investors to carry out these goals as securities markets have evolved the agency has used the aut hority granted to it under the laws to amend its regulations or to adopt new ones 2 central controversy surrounding the secs decision to permit the fees is between those who assert that the fees were largely response to the financial needs of floundering fund industry and were only intended to be temporary fix and those who disagree characterizing the assertions as misperceptions at an secsponsored roundtable on 12b1 fees in june 2007 some former sec staffers who were involved in implementing the 12b1 fee rule reportedly observed that such the assertions were not true 3 in 2007 finra merged the nasd and the member regulation enforcement and arbitration functions of the new york stock exchange heretofore the nasd formerly the national association of securities dealers established under the 1938 maloney act amendments to the securities exchange act of 1934 had responsibility for regulating every brokerdealer in the united states with public secu rities business which included setting the parameters for 12b1 fees

g8g158g151g141g561g8g142g142g156g561 shareholders are assessed number of fees and expense charges in return for the opportunity to invest in mutual funds there are two broad ca tegories of costs transaction fees and annual operating expenses transaction fees are costs that are charged directly to the shareholders accounts for specific transactions and include sales loads and redemption fees ongoing or annual operating expenses are costs associated with the normal cost of operating funds such as maintaining offices and staff they include assetbased charges like management fees and 12b1 fees in contrast to transaction fees these costs are not charged directly to an investors account but are deducted from fund assets prior to the earnings being distributed to shareholders the various components of the annual operating expenses combine to form the expense ratio the central gauge of funds costs visavis the value of its assets fund is often composed of number of generic classes each with claim on the same underlying assets thus the classes have identical performance characteristics where the classes do differ is in the way that their transaction fees or their annual operating expenses are structured these generic fund classes and their constituent fees including their 12b1 fees are described below class shares charge investors transaction fee called frontend sales load the fee is generally associated with the purchase of fund shares and is used to compensate financial professionals such as brokers and financial planners for their services in marketing the funds legally such charges can never exceed 85 of the amount invested the fees tend to be in the 4 to 6 range they may also include 12b1 fee class b shares generally have upfront charge although occasionally they may impose an upfront transaction fee that is smaller than what is charged by class shares instead they generally have transaction fees called contingent deferred sales or redemption fees that are charged when shareholders redeem their shares these fees generally range between 5 and 7 of assets and usually decline over time disappearing after several years the intermediaries who sell class b shares to investors are paid commission by the fund companies who generally then recoup that money from their shareholders in two basic ways 1 via the backend charge described above and 2 sometimes through 12b1 fees that range from 025 to 10 of assets after several years b shares may convert to shares before 1980 most mu tual funds were class atype front end load funds class c shares generally charge upfront or backend fee although some impose redemption fees if investors redeem shares within couple of years class c shares generally carry the highest 12b1 fees usually 1 year and unlike class b shares c shares usually do not convert to other classes with lower 12b1 fees the intermediaries who sell the shares generally get their commissions from the fund company which relies substantially on the proceeds

that are pure noloads defined as shares that do not impose frontend charges redemption charges or 12b1 fees have been in steady decline through the years in the early 1990s class c shares with 12b1 fees below 025 annually were allowed to call themselves noloads after the sec permitted the use of 12b1 fees in 1980 class b shares that combine 12b1 fee and contingent deferred sales charge grew ma rkedly while ownership of frontend load funds plummeted despite significant overall decline in load size in contrast to an observed indifference to the impact of annual operating expenses investors are generally identified as being more sensitive to frontend loads in part be cause they are clearly identified as deductions from an investors initial investments in the fund investors account statement4 noload funds were small part of the mutual fund landscape until the 1970s when companies like dreyfus vanguard and fidelity dropped their front load funds and began selling pure loads directly to the public but as the size of fund investments held by the average investor rose demand for financial intermediaries who can guide them in their investment decisions has grown apace likewise the dramatic growth in the number of funds has also boosted the demand for the intermediaries guidance and load fundsa development that has been at the expense of the loads and while loads have replaced noloads th sizes of the load have fallen development that is at least in part traceable to the increased use of 12b1 fees as partial substitute for them

that the fee would help underwrite expanded distribution and marketing resulting in fund economies of scale that would ultimately benefit fund shareholders with an expansion in fund size the assumption was that the fixed costs of fund management would be spread over larger base of assets resulting in reduced average cost of management per fund investor dollar there was additional hope that more consistent inflow of new investor cash would mitigate some of the volatility of fund deposits and redemption flows it was also thought that this would allow funds to hold less cash and invest more of the funds assets yielding increased returns to the fund research conducted by sec on the question of whether 12b1 plans have helped funds to grow to the benefit of shareholders found that the plans generally helped funds to grow faster than non 12b1 funds it also found that shareholders have not benefitted through lower average expenses or lower flow volatility fund manager compensati on generally grows with the size of the fund assets under their management and the research concluded that fund managers were the true beneficiaries of 12b1based fund growth 5 it joined

concluding that 12b1 fees impose deadweight loss7 on mutual fund investors8 another study found that the link between 12b1 fees and holdingperiod returns is complicated one and among the complicating factors are the length of time an investor holds fund the size of any front or deferred load the size of the 12b1 fee itself and other details of mutual funds fee arrangement for example it noted that investors with short horizons will tend to be better off paying higherthanaverage 12b1 fee thus incu rring higherthanaverage expense ratio to avoid paying higher front loads but overall it concluded that current fund fee structures do not generally allow for definitive judgments on the shareholder welfare implications of 12b1 plans and expense ratios without taking account of the complicating roles played by front and deferred loads 9 some observers however argue that this kind of research on the cost implications of 12bplans is misguided given the contemporary realities of how the plans are actually used it is widely agreed that the 12b1 fees have largely become alternatives to frontend loads alternatives that have given fund shareholders greater investment choices thus they argue that research on the way in which the fees have or have not contributed to lower shareholder costs has thus become irrelevant10 instead they emphasize the role 12b1 plans have played in the creation of the various fund fee classes that are described abovestructures that gi ve investors range of choices with respect to various fee structures and payment arrangements as rule economic theory says that there should be positive correlation between consumers level of satisfaction and the number of choices consumer has but this benefit may be mitigated by the way in which the multiclass share structure may foster confusion among investors to the benefit of the brokerdealer class b shares do not impose frontend sales charge but they may charge higher expenses that investors are assessed over the lifetime of their investment in fund as compared to class shares class b shares also normally impose contingent deferred sales charge cdsc which you pay if you sell your shares within certain number of years b shares may appear to be more appealing to investors than shares with frontend sales load such as shares but they may have higher longterm costs brokerdealers may be relatively better compensated for selling them giving them added incentives to push the shares incentives that investor may not be well informed about in early 2005 number of fund companies including the large franklin templeton family announced that they would longer be selling class b shares 11 6 when rule 12b1 was adopted sec officials appears to have hoped that the 12b1 fees would allow fund firms to grow eventually attaining scale economies that would lower their expense ratios 7 deadweight loss is defined as the value of real resources lost to some type of market inefficiency 8 for example see the various studies identified in sean collins the effect of 12b1 plans on mutual fund investors investment company institute march 2004 9 sean collins the effect of 12b1 plans on mutual fund investors in one example the study noted that investors with short horizons will tend to be better off paying high erthanaverage 12b1 fees with higherthanaverage expense ratio in lieu of paying front load 10 for

centerpiece of the federal securities regulatory system overseen by the sec because of the continually changing nature of the nations financial landscape the body of required disclosures continues to be revisited such is the case with mandatory 12b1 fee disclosures when fund charges 12b1 fee it is identified as line item in the fund prospectus fee table as part of the funds annual operating expenses the fee is also incorporated in the funds total annual operating expense disclosed in the fee table and in the hypothetical example of fund expenses that accompanies the fee table funds that levy 12b1 fee must also disclose in their prospectuses that 12b1 fees will increase the co st of an investment in the fund and may cost the investor more than paying other types of sales charges however the disclosure protocol has been criticized for being insufficiently revealing various investor advocacy groups say that many fund investors do not understand that when they avoid funds with loads they may still be paying for marketing costs indirectly through continuous 12b1 fees there are related concerns over what some perceive to be widespread lack of investor awareness of the significance of 12b1 fees and their contribution to total fund costs lipper found that while the average largecap core stock fund gave 068 of its assets to its advisers it charges nearly identical 064 to pay for 12b1 marketing fees 12 the research firm has also identified inadequate disclosure as the central problem with 12b1 fees noting that most fund pr ospectuses do not identify where the fees go13 some observers argue that there should be additional mandatory disclosure among fund companies concerning 12b1 fees particularly concerning how they are used and how they are charged the expanded disclosure would ostensibly enable fund investors to make more informed decisions but the science of securities and fund investor disclosure is very inexact discipline the bottom line issue of whether prospective disclosure is meaningful and useable will vary depending on host of key factors including 1 the clarity of the disclosure 2 an investors level of financial sophistication and 3 the extent to which an investor is willing to invest time in examining the disclosure documents it is widely acknowledged that at best many fund investors do very cursory reading of fund disclosure documents through the years in pursuit of more investor friendly documents the sec has pushed for but not completely succeeded in requiring less minutiaeladen more streamlined key disclosure documents such as fund prospectuses in addition to factors that may influence the useability of disclosure data such as the clarity of the disclosure language an investors interest in reading disclosure data nd how financially sophisticated an investor is an additional factor may be the extent to which document is characterized by data overload some research indicates that when consumers confront too much data

mandatory disclosures on how 12b1 fees are used and how they are charged as part of their disclosure documents would be negligible the key concerns involve the disclosures usefulness for investors and the extent to which it could contribute to potentially counterproductive disclosure data clutter or overload as discussed above new disclosure on the nuts and bolts of 12b1 fees may run the risk of being dauntingly complex for many unsophisticated investors and the sec has recently adopted and proposed number of additional fund disclosure requirements heightening the potential for disclosure overload from newly mandated disclosures the clearest public beneficiaries from the 12b1 fee disclosures would probably be the minority of sophisticated fund investorsinvestors far less likely to be confused or overwhelmed by such disclosures because of concerns over the potential contribution of new 12b1 fee disclosure to disclosure document data overload some argue that the public would be better served if the disclosures were done through other means one such alternative would be disclosing the data at the time when fund investor purchases fund shares from broke rdealer the pointofsale brokerdealers would be required to give fund investors information on the embedded 12b1 fees when fund shares are acquired transactions conducted by phone would probably involve oral disclosure facetoface transactions could either involve oral disclosure or the provision of printed matter research indicates that information that is transmitted verbally tends to be remembered better than information that is read suggesting that oral pointofsale disclosures may have certain advantages but pointofsale disclosures would still confront issues concerning their usefulness posed by the complicated subject matter moreover in contrast to mandatory fund disclosure documents regulators would have much more limited ability to monitor and enforce the quality of pointofsale disclosures currently perhaps the least controversial and most widely embraced disclosure reform which includes support from the ici would involve scrapping the rather opaque 12b1 designation and replacing it with more descriptive and meaningful identification 15 hr 3225 the mutual fund fee reform act was introduced in august 2007 by representative michael castle the bill which was referred to the house

funds is legal sp officials and others have said that the existence of closed funds that still charge 12b1 fees as clear violation of the intent behind rule 12b1 that fund assets should be used for marketing and distribution to generate new sales of fund shares17 funds fund distributors and some independent industry observers however say that investors in closed funds still demand and receive attention from brokerdealers who may have sold fund to them years ago and 12b1 fees still need to be collected to pay for these services as well it is also argued that closed funds still remain open to existing shareholders if they want to buy more shares and that the funds use ongoing annual 12b1 fee payments to recoup frontend commissions that they advanced to the fund distributor period often lasting six or seven years information on details such as how long the funds that still charge 12b1 fees have been closed relative to those that are closed and longer charge the fees are not available but on the face of it the existence of the large number of closed funds that do not currently charge 12b1 fees would appear to help undercut arguments defending the practice 18 representative castle indicated that it is not fair that investors in closed funds be subject to fee thats purpose is to support marketing and distribution when the fund is longer open to new investors19

of fund currently experiences the 12b1 fee through lower total return on the fund since the fee reduces the expense ratio but under the proposed change the investor would more explicitly and more directly pay for 12b1compensated services by periodic payments to his or her brokerdealer through some share redemptions sec officials suggested that the alternative scheme might better benefit fund shareholders because actual sales charges would be clearer they would not have to pay for sales to new investors and longterm shareholders would not pay 12b1 fees that exceeded their fair share of distribution costs mutual funds and fund intermediaries like brokerdealers and financial planners have said that given the services provided to fund investors 12b1 fees are quite reasonable producing number of efficiencies they also have argued that the fees provide middle income investors more payment options and might be the cheapest way to pay for certain shareholder services like ongoing investment advice phone counseling nd reviewing investment strategies some fund distributors acknowledged that deducting the 12b1 fees from shareholder accounts would be cleaner than the way they are currently deducted from the overall fund but they had larger concerns that such system would generate in vestor confusion by making investors think 12b1 fees go straight to the brokerdealer or investment adviser others are concerned that because the shareholder accounts would eventually pay smaller nom inal amounts as they age the risk that the brokerdealer would trade the account may increa increasing the possibility of churning and there are other concerns that the proposal would result in complicated recordkeeping burdens and added tax liabilities for investors but others question the claim that the proposal would trigger additional tax liabilities 21 g20g142g153g142g138g149g146g151g144g561g20g158g149g142g561g343g344g139g556g343g561 in its february 2004 proposal on rule 12b1 the sec also requested public comment on whether rule 12b1 should be repealed supporters of repeal basically say that funds use of rule 12b1 has evolved far beyond what was originally expected but most mutual funds and the distributors who sell them generally say that given the services provided to fund investors 12b1 fees are quite reasonable and rule 12b1 should remain as it is 22 continued directed brokerage arrangements may harm funds and their shareholders including that the portion of brokerage commissions that pay for distribution is not disclosed as an expense they can give brokerdealers financial incentives to recommend to customers the funds that provide the best compensation to the broker instead of the funds that are best for the client and they can increase fund advisers advisory fees and reduce their outofpocket expenses for distribution in august 2004 the sec commissioners adopted the staff recommendation that directed brokerage be prohibited

has acknowledged that the manner in which rule 12b1 has evolved was at odds with the original intent of the sec but the fund trade association has stressed that the ways in which the rule has been used were not at all inconsistent with its administrative history the rules adopting release stated that the rule was intended to be sufficiently flexible to cover new distribution financing arrangements that might emerge from the fund industry and that the agency would closely monitor the rule and make any necessary adjustments 23 the trade group has also noted that through its various regulatory actions including its sanctioning of multiclass shares the sec has been an integral part of the creation of the infrastructure supporting the 12b1 fees24 but through the years the sec has been not given unqualified support to rule 12b1 through the years the agency has floated number of proposals meant to put curbs on the way the rule was being applied for example the agency promulgated number of proposed amendments to modify rule 12b1 in 1988 proposals which sparked significant fund industry opposition 25 and in 1992 noting that while multiclass fund fee structures had given fund investors greater choice agency staff expressed serious concerns over the role they potentially played in inhibiting interfund price competition and recommended that the agency propose legislation to permit the introduction of new fund entity called unified fee investment company ufic with much simple r fee structure the agency never adopted the recommendation26 the idea of repealing rule 12b1 however confronts reality in which 12b1 fees have become deeply ingrained fixture of the mutual fund and the brokerdealer worlds report released by lipper in 2004 observed that dismantling or modifying the rule would wreak havoc on all aspects of the financial services industry27 sec officials have also acknowledged the profound impact that eliminating 12b1 fees would probably have on the fund and brokerdealer industries28 more explicit perceptions of the probable impact of repealing rule 12b1 and 12b1 fees include the prospect that 23 bearing of distribution expenses by mutual funds sec release ic11414 rule 12b1 adopting release october 28 1980 24 ibid 25 the proposals included limiting the use of excess distri bution expense recoupment expenditures beyond 12b1 plans maximum may be recouped in subsequent years updating nasd limits on maximum sales charges to include 12b1 fees restricting the ability of funds to define themselves as noloads when they charge 12b1 fees requiring more methodical analysis between 12b1 plan expenditures and shareholder benefits realized formally validating that 12b1 payments are within range that would have been recognized at armslength and requiring annual shareholder approval of 12b1 plans only the noload fund definition and the nasd sales charge cap rules on funds levying 12b1 fees were adopted by the agency since then the sec has considered various revisions to rule 12b1 but some observers suggest that it chose not to reexamine rule 12b1 per probably b ecause of limited resources and more pressing concerns for example see testimony of jeffrey keil vice president for global fiduciary review lipper inc in us congress senate governmental affairs committee financial management subcommittee january 27 2004 26 the ufics would have had single fixed fee set by the funds investment manager and separate sales charges or redemption fees in addition all fund expenses except brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses

to recoup lost 12b 1 fees by switching the accounts from one fund to another brokerdealers could be less inclined to market the class fund shares explained above frequently described as the best type of product for many fund investors in return for lost 12b1 fees front end loads may increase and the prospect that smaller investors may be ignored by financial professionals and may thus be precluded from owning some funds if repeal were to result in larger proportion of funds sold with front end loads this would translate into fewer structural choices for fund investors in at least one area it might benefit investors in contrast to frontend loads 12b1 plans permit investors to give greater consideration to the timerelated aspects of their investment goals the plans do enable investors to earn returns on the full amount of money they invest rather than having portion of their assets immediately deducted via the front end load to compensate the fund distributor but frontend loads are onetime charges that are deducted before an investors assets are invested in fund thus they are widely perceived to be much more clear and transparent to fund investors than are the ongoing 12b1 fees moreover the extent to which funds would respond to ban on 12b1 fees by raising their loads is an open question some research on the fund purchase and sale decisions of over 30000 households with accounts at large us discount brokerage firm found fund investors to be fairly sensitive to funds with high transaction fees like frontend loads 29 in the absence of the 12b1 fee structure there are some concerns that smaller investors could be particularly disadvantaged but as in the scenario proposed by the sec if in exchange for their services brokerdealers are directly compensated by the fund investorswhether the investors are big or small probably should not matter any move to eliminate 12b1 fees and to restructure the way that fund sellers are paid would necessitate radical changes
