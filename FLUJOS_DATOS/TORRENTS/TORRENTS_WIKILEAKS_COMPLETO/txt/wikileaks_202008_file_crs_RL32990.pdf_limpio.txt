harvesting cocoa is laborintensive in west africa cocoa far ming typically begins with the thinning or partial clearing by hand of pr imary or mature tropical forest growth which is used to shelter the cocoa trees although some varieties of cacao trees can thrive in sun if sufficient nutrients and water are present shade also helps to reduce damage by certain types of tree pests and diseases and helps retain adequate moisture such forest areas are also used because they provide readymade source of shade that does not require planting of cover plants and because forest areas are rich in nutrients resulting from the d ecomposition of organic forest detritus the tropical soils in many areas of west africa where cocoa is grown are thin and easily leached of their nutrients mature forest

ghana and nigeria july 2002 available at httpdigitalcommonsilrcornelleducgiviewcontentcgiarticle 1151contextkey_w orkplace 8 see section entitled harkinengel protocol for more informationagricultural technique is to open new or longdisused land to farming use it until the soil is exhausted and then leave it in regenerative fallow for lengthy periods sometimes many years such practices are changing in many areas the application of chemical fertilizers and alternatively the use of organic growing methods are becoming more common increasingly allowing more intensive farming to take place traditional land use methods how ever remain widespread and in many areas cocoa farming continues to be undertaken by clearing mature forest areas planting of seedlings which are usually transplanted after propagation and take three to five years to reach productive fertility also takes place by hand as does weeding which is especially intensive in th year or so after forests are cleared for planting and the application of fertilizers and pesticides harvesting which is usually ongoing during several months of the year is so laborintensive cocoa pods must be cut carefully from the cacao tree branches known as brooms so as not to damage the flower cushion from whic h the fruit grows pods are then usually split and emptied by hand to remove the seeds and pulp for purposes of fermentation and drying which are typically undertaken at the farm level it is in the harvesting process that child labor has b een reportedly most commonly found child labor in the west african cocoa sector7 reports of children being trafficked to work on cocoa farms and stories of children working under abusive conditions began to emerge in 2000 following these reports some began calling for

manner that complies with ilo convention 182 concerning the prohib ition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labor to end the use of abusive child labor in cocoa production8 the protocol widely known as the harkinengel protocol after senator tom harkin and repr esentative eliot engel outlines six steps the industry formally agreed to undertake to end abus ive and forced child labor on cocoa farms by july 2005 the protocol is voluntary and nonlegislativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32990crs7 the six steps of the harkinengel protocol 1 issue public statement of the pr oblem and develop the terms of an action plan 2 form multisectoral advisory gr oup to investigate labor practices in west africa and develop appropriate remedies for the elimination of the worst forms of child labor in the growing and processing of cocoa 3 sign joint statement on the need to end the worst forms of child labor in cocoa production and iden tify alternatives for children removed from the cocoa sector 4 develop memorandum of cooperation that blishes joint action program of research information exchange and steps to enforce the internationallyrecognized and mutuallyagreed upon standards to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in cocoa pr oduction establish an independent system to monitor and report compliance with standards 5 establish joint international f oundation to manage and sustain anti child labor efforts promote fi eld projects and establish clearinghouse of best practices to eliminate the worst forms of child labor 6 develop an industrywide certification process that ensures that cocoa beans and their derivative products have not been grown andor processed with any of the worst forms of child labor critical component of the protocol wa s to ascertain the extent to which abusive child labor and trafficking ccurred in cocoa production as the numerous reports on the practice were largely anec dotal in july 2002 the international institute of tropical agriculture iita completed study to determine the extent of child labor in the four major cocoa produc ing countries of west africa the study was carried out with

consequently the organization has questioned the validity of the data and plans to c onduct its own survey of cote divoire and the cocoaproducing sector 9 nonetheless the survey provides the most

number of children found to be working under hazardous conditions not how many children were found on the farms overall the survey also did not provide extensive information on nonpaid working children detailed information was provided however on salaried child workers farmers hiring salaried child workers d produced nearly twice as much cocoa as those who did not larger farms we re also found to use significantly more children from within farm families an estimated 4630 farmers were employing some 5120 children as fulltime permanent workers in côte divoire versus 61600 adults in ondo state nigeria 1220 children versus 11800 adults were fulltime workers all of the salaried child workers in côte divoire originated outside of the cocoaproducing zone sixtytwo percent 756 of the salaried child workers expected to be paid personally while 32 390 reported that their earnings were received by their family members and 6 indicated that payment was made to the intermediary who had brought the child to the work site the latter situation may in some cases be an indicator of the use of indentured labor child labor in cocoa farming the study also found that in west africa children in rural areas have traditionally worked in agriculture as part of the family unit family labor is the only type of labor employed on 31 of the cocoa farms in côte divoire 23 of cameroonian farms 17 of ghanaian farms and 10 of nigerian farms family labor is the most used labor type eg in côte divoire 87 of permanent labor in cocoa farming came from the family with family children accounting for

the study which found that in west africa cocoa pr oduction is laborintensive most production is by smallscale farmers with few resources who often use the entire family to contribute to cocoa farming average annual cocoa revenues ranged from 30 to 205 per household member however wages varied significantly in côte divoire child workers reporte d mean annual payment of 80 while adult workers reportedly r eceived 135 per year in nigeria children reportedly earned 115 annua lly while adult workers were paid an annual average salary of 205 cocoa accounts for large share of total household income among cocoa farmers 50 in cameroon 55 in ghana 66 in côte divoire and 68 in nigeria even though cocoa farming is the main source of income the quantity of cocoa production is rela tively low making it difficult for families to have sufficient income to meet their needs child trafficking in west african cocoa production the practice of trafficking of children to work in west african cocoa production is widely acknowledged but information bout its extent is not widely available much of the information is anecdotal and focused on côte divoire the largest cocoa producing country11 for example in 2000 the bbc broadcast documentary that portrayed children being trafficked from mali into côte divoire and made to work on cocoa farms where almost all child ren involved in co coa produc

farms had ties to the family owners of the farms some have sugge sted that this in itself is evidence of child trafficking although iita did not dr aw that conclusion in its report 13 see iloipec

hazardous conditions as revealed in the iita child labor survey above12 in july 2001 knight ridder published series of reports on young boys who had been tricked sold or trafficked to ivoi rian cocoa farmers among other things these reports of child trafficking gave impetus to the harkin engel protocol discu ssed in this report the extent to which west african cocoa producers employ child labor is in part function of economic factors13 the extent of child trafficking is likewise affected by such factors these include low cocoa prices low incomes of family farmers and large numbers of small hol der farmers who cannot afford to engage hired labor lack of adequa school facilities in coco producing areas also plays role cultural factors are involved too so ciologists point out that not only is there tradition of children partic ipating in household and farm work from an early age the iita study but there is strong tr adition in west africa of child migration both within countries and across borders ch migratory patterns make it difficult to monitor and control child trafficking14 study of malian children points out that children are often sent to live outside th family village or country for work family solidarity or education and concludes that migration is rite of passage and financial necessity for many15 acknowledging that reliable and verifiab data on child trafficking in west african cocoa production are very scarce one nongovernmental organization save the children proposes that anti trafficking efforts should be undertaken along two tracks prevention and protection16 preventive measures would include such actions as developing and imple menting national action plans to combat trafficking including legal and legislative frameworks to make child trafficking crime it would be up to national governments to provi care for intercepted and repatriated children most likely in coope ration with local and international ngos working in regions where children are at

this position is based on the notion that abusive child labor is injurious to health and that children have been repor tedly found to be usin g pesticides without adequate protection proponents of banning cocoa imports because they are produced using abusive child labor practices also argue that recent wto dispute panel decisions validate broad approach to enfo rcement of member countrys laws when health considerations are involved some contend that an import ban on co coa produced using abusive child labor might contribute little to improving the lot of children in rural côte divoire or other cocoa producing countries critics do not ar gue that abusive or unsafe child labor practices should be ignored but rather that the underlying cau of child labor is rural poverty which should be the focus of fforts to improve the lot of children questions of targeting and fair ness are also at issue as trade data above show while the united states imports about 14 of its cocoa beans from côte divoire about 65 of ivorian cocoa goes to europe from which the united states imports cocoa products to what extent would an im port ban cover imports of products from europe manufactured from cocoa

it is undergoing continued review by partic ipants and observers some may argue however that creating similar process aimed at ending abusive labor processes in the cocoa industry could delay imp lementation of efforts to ach ieve that goal since the time that would likely be involved in negotiating such an agreement could be lengthy in addition such an effort could lead to the adoption of lowest common denominator labor standards since imple mentation of such framewo rk would likely be arrived at by voluntary consensus by participating governments some of which may lack the capacity or legal mechanisms to ensure adherence to strict labor standards in addition some nonparticipa ting countries might object to such scheme as restraint on trade under wto rules and ch allenge it in the

trade regime from this perspective such regime might not conflict with wto rules multilateral poverty reduction strategies researchers note that cocoaproducing c ountries could use findings about

service program low world prices for cocoa interviews conducted during the iita surv ey revealed that greater employment of family labor was common response to the drop in cocoa prices during the 1990s and the resulting decline in cocoa incomes in addition to the substitution of family labor for paid labor farmers have also reduced the use of purchased inputs such as fertilizers the net effect of both of these factors has led to lower productivity and incomes and to reduced household inve stments in childrens education some analysts argue that the fall of world cocoa pr ices led to an increase in the use of child labor55 labor rights advocates argue that if farmers could gain greater profits from their crops then they would be less likel to use children in cocoa production for
