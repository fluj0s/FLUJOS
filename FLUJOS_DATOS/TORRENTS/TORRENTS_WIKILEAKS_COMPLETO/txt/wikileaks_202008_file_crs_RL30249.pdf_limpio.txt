overview of its rationale and application summary as delin eated in the constitution the separation of powers doctrine represents the belief that government consists of three basic and distinct functions each of which must be exercised by different branch of government so as to avoid the arbitrar exercise of power by any single ruling body this concept was directly espoused in the writings of montesquieu who declared that when the executive and th legislature re united in single person or in single body of magistracy there is liberty because one can fear that the same monarch or senate that makes tyrannical laws will execute them tyrannically the framers of the constitution shared thi s1 view with james madison stating that the accumulation of all powers legislative executive and judiciary in the same hands whether of one few or many an d whether hereditary selfappointed or elective may justly be pronounced the ver definition of tyranny2 to alleviate the dangers inherent in centralized power the constitutio n establishes three separ ate branches of government the legislative the executive and the judiciary through this structure the framers sought to create an efficien t governmental system which would limit the power vested in any one branch realizing that mere textual separation would be insufficient to guard agains t aggrandizement by the respective branches however sys tem of checks and balances was developed by which the three arms of government could resist agains t encroachment through this system the various branches of government share certain interdependent characteristics which enable efficient governance while othe r functions are staunchly protected so as to prevent the accumulation of excessiv power by any single branch

rationale and application framework of the doctrine the constitution of the united states establishes the framework by which th federal government exercises power cornerstone of this structure is the doctrine of separation of powers which stands for the proposition that certain politica l functions must be allocated amongst various governmental branches so as to avoid domination by any one entity although th separation of powers concept plays key role in the american political process the constitution does not expressly delineate the scope and effect of the doctrine rather the doctrine

article ii establishes3 that the executive power shall be vested in president finally article iii provides4 that the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court5 the main reason for this division of governmental functions stems from th desire of the framers to prevent the concentration of power in the hands of any one entity as an outgrowth of this concern the framers departed from pur e6 separation of powers model and established system of checks and balances in the constitution giving each branch measure of power over the other the effect f7 this system is to limit the power of each branch encouraging competition in an effort to maintain relative balance of power 8 aims of the doctrine origin and evolution the origin of the doctrine of separation of powers is often traced to ancien t greece and the writings of aristotle aristotle maintained that the political process was characterized by distinct functions which he identified as deliberative magisterial and judicial this notion of the distinct cha racter of various governmental actions did not contemplate however that such functions should be entrusted to and exclusively exercised by specific groups of people rather these functions were seen as method to attain balance between the various classe s of society and to enable them to play role in governmental functions such dynamic is evidenced by the9 mixed governmental structure which existed in classical greec as opposed to clear separation of powers model the modern separation of powers concept began to develop in england in the middle of the 17 century during period of significant conflict between th eth monarchy and parliament as the concept of mixed government fell out of favor 10 scholars nd statesmen recognized the need to place limits on the power of both the king and parliament furthermore the english civil war served to draw attention to11 the need for government consisting of bodies restrained to the exercise of specific and appropriate functions with th eventual resurgence of the monarchy however12 pure separation of powers model could not exist ultimately refined model of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30249crs3 id at

8521concept emerged in the balanced constitution of england specifically the concept13 manifested itself in an amalgam of mixed gove rnment legislative supremacy and the separation of powers 14 while english experience with the doctrine undoubte dly influenced the framers it is clear that fundamental differences between the english governmental structur and the republican aims of the newly formed united states prevented substantia l reliance upon the english concept of separated powers as was noted by th e15 supreme court early in the nineteenth century the distribution of political power in the united states differs significantly from the authority and sovereignty exercised by the monarchy in the english system 16 ultimat ely the framers relied more upon philosophical and scholarl considerations of the separation of powers concept than the actual englis h experience indeed the writings of montesquieu and john locke are largely credited17 with assisting in the development of the theory of separation of powers as expressed in the constitution locke for instance expanded upon the notion that governmental functions should be dispersed for the sake of efficiency by maintaining that th centralization of ruling authority would lead to oppressive authoritarianism and the loss of liberty illustrating this contention locke explained that person should18 be permitted to act as both judge and executioner or as both lawmaker and judge as individuals with such authority would inevitably develop and apply self servin g standards and laws 19 similarly montesquieu perceived man as having tendency towards evil and desire for power this perception of human nature gav rise to concern on the part20 of montesquieu regarding the arbitrary exercise of political power leading to th exposition that liberty is destroyed in government f unseparated powers building21 upon earlier works regarding the doctrine montesquieu envisioned governmental structure in which power would be dispe rsed among three branches with system of checks and balances in montesquieus view this arrang ement was superior to pure separation of powers structure in that checks and balances s ystem would allow each part of government to veto or circumscribe the actio ns of the other such division of power according to montesquieu would enable an arm of government to ac t efficiently without usurping the powers of anotherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30249crs4 the federalist papers 48 at 301 j madison22 vile supra note 9 at 15316023 the federalist papers 48 at 308 j madison24 buckley v valeo 424 us 1 121 197625 id26 vile supra note 9 at 9327the early velopment and acceptance of the separation of powers doctrine by the founding fathers was heavily influenced by these perspec tives indeed the framers were strong proponents of the doctrine possessing similar distrusting view of the human desire for power such concern was evidenced by james madison wh warned that the accumulation of all powers legislative executive and judiciary in the same hands whether of one few or many and whether hereditary self appointed or elective may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny in22 refining the doctrine as it was to apply to the new union the framers following the ideas of locke and montesquieu forsook the pure separation of powers concept in favor of hybrid doctrine designed to check and balance governmental powers23 madison served as the most eloquent proponent of this refined doctrine maintaining that separate bra nches of government cannot remain independent if their supposedly distinct powers are based merely upon definitional boundaries this theory led t madisons argument that the members of respective branch of government would continually seek to aggrandize the power exercised by that branch accordingly madison explained that ambition must be made to counteract ambition through the use of checks to thwart power struggles inherent in the political system as result of these concerns the framers divided power among the executive legislative and judicial br anches to assure their existence as independent and coequal entities with branch possessing directly or indirectly an overruling influence over the others in the administration of their powers 24 from this emphasis on checks and balances model it is evident that th framers recognized the need for interplay among the branches such an appreciation is manifested in the constitution which by means contemplates total separation of each of the three essential branches of government as was noted by th e25 supreme court this fact illuminates the role of the framers as pragmatic politicians who saw the separation of powers doc trine as an essential tool against tyranny while at the same time realizing that hermetic sealing off of the three branches f government from one another would preclude establishment of nation capable f governing itself effectively this model is based in part upon montesquieu s26 notion of implementing positive as well as negative checks the effect of such an27 allocation according to the theory would be to allocate specific and independen t functions while creating level of interdependence to prevent particular branc h from abusing the power of its core functions this maxim has manifested itself i n separation of power s jurisprudence with justice

separateness but interdependence autonomy but reciprocity28 with this view of the doctrine the framers of the constitution developed separation of powers m odel which avoided imposing rigid barriers between the arms of govern ment leading to system which would allow for efficient and effectiv governance the independence and interdependence created by this system can b appreciated by analyzing the interaction among the three branches of government separation and branch independence building upon the notion that certain governmental functions should be unde r the exclusive control of particular branch the constit ution establishes explicitly and implicitly the independence and separation of the branch this is seen in the speech or debate clause which provides for the independence and integrity of th legislature and also reinforces the separation of powers the purpose of the29 clause was to prevent intimidation by the executive and accountability before possibly hostile judiciary there are other specific grants of pure legislativ e30 authorit such as art i 5 which mandates that each house judge the election returns and qualifications of it members to make rules governing its ow n proceedings and to maintain the confidentiality of such proceedings to furthe r assure the separation of the branches art i 2 prohibits ny individual from holding an executive office while also serving in congress similar autonomy may also be found in the executive bran ch where the supreme court has recognized absolute presidential immunity from civil liability for officia l acts as well as qualified executive privilege to maintain the confidentiality f presidential communications which derives from the supremacy of the executiv branch within its assigned area of constitu tional responsibilities this independence31 is further illustrated by the constitutional precept that the president may only b removed from office through impeachment32 the judiciary also exercises certain powers outside the purview of the othe r branches with the court recognizing clear in stitutional protections contained in the constitution guaranteeing judicial independence among these protections

the aforementioned provisions identify core protections under th doctrine it again must be stressed that the constitution by means contemplates total separation of each of these three essential branches of government rather34 as was noted by justi ce story while power is diffused under the doctrine in order to protect liberty the constitution contemplates that pra ctice will integrate the dispersed powers into workable government it is through this structure of checks an d35 balances that the constitution prevents the aggrandizement of particular branch namely by giving each arm of government degree of overlapping responsibility duty of interdependence as well as independence36 employing this maxim the constitution contains express provisions establishing such interaction among the branches for example laws passed by congress ar subject to veto by the president which may be overruled by supermajority vote of both houses the vice president serves as president f the senate and possesses the37 power to brea k ties in that body this quasisymbiotic relationship is also apparent38 in the impeachment context specifically congress possesses the power to remove the president vice president and civil officers of the united states however while39 the house has the s ole power of impeachment and the senate has the sole power to try and convict in impeachment proceedings the chief justice presides over trial of the preside nt the independence of the judiciary is maintained in the same fashion40 as judges are removable only upon i mpeachment and their salaries may be increased but not diminished by an act of congress subject to presidential veto furthermore41 while the president possesses authority to make treaties and appoint officers including independen t judicial officials this power is contingent upon the advice and consent of the senate additionally the president as commander in chief 42 possess the authority to commit troops while congress alone has the

powers doctrine fashioned in the constitution assigns clear rights and duties to the three branches of government providing framework for their exercise of power however it is also apparent that the express language of the constitution does not provide definitive expositi on of the doctrines principles while the first three articles of th constitution define the branches of government and delineate their respectiv functions the full scope and effect of the prov isions are not explained furthermore45 while the provisions discussed above are useful in illustrating the general doctrine and the checks and balances dynamic it has become evident that there are numerou s issues implicating the separation of powers doc trine which fall outside the definitional boundaries contained in the constitution because of the nebulous parameters of the separation of powers doctrine th supreme court has often been called upon to clarify its scope task which s become more and more common with the increase in the administrative nature f governmental activity in attempting to determine whether the separation of powers46 doctrine has been violated in particular case the court has developed two mai n analytical frameworks by which it scrutinizes the allocation of power among th branches referred to as functionalism and formalism these approaches share common concern regarding the allocation of power and branch aggrandizement but differ greatly in their views regarding the scope of the doctrine and the extent t which governmental functions may be intermingled47 formalist approach to the consideration of separ ation of powers issues focuses upon the text of the constitution in an effort to ascertain to what degree branc h powers and functions may be intermingled specifically the crux of formalism is that the power delegated to branch should be exercised exclusively by that branch s the constitution sought to divide the delegated powers of the new federa l government into three defined categories legislative executive and judicial48 accordingly formalism mandates textual analysis of the constitution as sort f bright line test to identify action which unconstitutionally encroaches upon r aggrandizes the power of particular branch the effect of this approach is t o49 ascertain whether the activity in question is judicia l executive or legislative in

beyond the constitutionally assigne d functions of particular branch stated differently the court looks to see if there is clear and explicit textual commitment of power or function to one branch contrary to formalis ms textual focus functionalist approach to separation of powers issues centers n the notion that precise definitional boundaries cannot serve as basis for the resolution of separation of powers issues this premise wa s explained by j ustice jackson who stated that the actual art of governing under our constitution does not and cannot conform to judicial definitions of the power of any of its branches based on isola ted clauses or even single articles torn from context50 thus functionalist approach permits the sharing of power between branches concerning itself mainly with the preservation of the core function of particula r branch where there has been exclusive textual commitment to particular branch51 this notion of core function derives from the functionalist theory that th constitut ion ascribes unique and essential power to each branch of government which must be protected from usurpation by the competing branches this concept of core function is more flexible than the definitional boundaries imposed by th formalist approach branches may exercise the powers of another so long as th ability of the original branch to exer cise such power is not impaired essentially the52 functionalist approach does not hinge on textual commitments focusing instead on the actual effect of the exercise of power and the determination of whether suc h action impinges upon core function of coordinate branch 53 application of the doctrine in addition to the independent powers and che cks and balances discussed above the separation of power s doctrine also plays significant part in defining the roles of the respective branches in the legislative process this asp ect of the doctrine manifests itself in the executive branch through the authority to advocate legislative agenda which is d eemed necessary and expedient as well as in the ability of the president to exercise veto power over bills pa ssed by both houses the court has expounded54 upon the impor tance of the presidential veto power noting that this ability serves as prophylactic against legislation which runs contrary to the public good and allows the president to preserve the authority and power of the executive branch fro m legislative aggrandizement55 in keeping with the aims of the doctrine however the presidential veto power is not absolute and cannot

aforemention ed provisions it is evident that the constitution protects the interests of the executive branch by bestowing upon the president the ability t intervene in the legislative process it i s

be lawmaker specifically justice black maintained that presidentia l59 authority to issue such an order must stem either from an act of congress or from the constitution itself applying this formalist reasoning justice blacks opinio n60 for the court determined that as statute or constitutional provision authorize d such presidential action the seizure order was in essence legislative act the court further noted that congress had rejected seizure as means to settle labor disputes during consideration of the tafthartley act given this characterization the court61 deemed the executive order to be

five concurrences in the case four of which maintained that implie d presidential authority adheres in certain contexts of these concurrences justic e63 jacksons has proven to be the most influential even surpassing the impact of justice blacks majority opinion specifically jackson established tripartite scheme fo r analyzing the validity of presidential actions in relation to constitutional an d congressional authority64 jacksons first category focuses on whether the president has acted according to an express or implied grant of congression authority if so according to jackson presidentia l authority is at its maximum for it includes all that he possesses in hi s own right plus all that congress can delegate and such action is supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation65 secondly justice jackson maintained that in situations where congress has neither granted or denied authority to the pres ident the president acts in reliance only upon his own independent powers but there is z one of twilight in which he and congress may have concurrent authority or in which its distribution is uncertain in the third66 and final category justice jackson stated that in instances where presidential action is incompatible with the express or implied will of congress the power of th president is at its minimum and any such action may be supported pursuant to only the presidents own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers f congress over the matter in such circumstance presidential action must res t67 upon an excl usive power and the courts can uphold the measure only by disabling the congress from acting upon the subject68 applying this scheme to the case at hand justice jackson determined tha t analysis under the first category was inappropriate due to the fact that presiden t trumans seizure of the steel mills had not been authorized by congress eithe r implicitly or explicitly justice jackson also deter

veto in clinton v city of new york the court addressed the question of whether the provisions of the line ite m veto act conflicted with the separation of powers doctrine by violating th presentment c lause of the constitution specifically the act imbued the president73 with the p ower to cancel provisions of certain spending laws such as specific dollar amounts of discretionar budget authority items of new direct spending and limited tax benefits the president could cancel such provisions within five days of having signed them into law if he determined that such cancellation would serve to reduce the budget deficit not impair essential government functions and not harm th national interest74 addressing these provisions the court noted that the practical effect of the act was to give the president th power to repeal legislation enacted by congress this75 power conflicted with the constitution according to the court as the president does not possess the authority to amend or repeal legislation rather as the cour t explained the presentment clause dict ates that upon being passed by both houses of congress bill becomes law only when approved and signed by the president the76 court stressed that consti tutional silence regarding presidential repeals functioned as an express prohibition on such activi ty clarifying this statement the court explained that the article i procedure for statutory enactment resulted from the great debates and compromises that produced the constitution itself accordingly the cour t77 emphasized that the enactment power could only be exercised with single finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure given this maxim the cour t78 determined that the act authorized the president to essentially create law which had not been

whether the federal courts were constitutionally required to stay all private actions against the president until his vacation of office acknowledging the unique importance of the presidency in the constitutiona l scheme the court nonetheless determined that the doctrine would not be implicated by allowing private action to proceed the court explained that the proscriptions of the doctrine serve as safeguard against the encroachment or aggrandizement of one of three equal branches of government at the expense of another80 specifically the court noted that there was evidence or suggestion that the federal judiciary would be exercising let alone encroaching upon any executiv functions rather the court declared that the judiciarys decision to allow th procession of private legal action would merely be an exercise of the courts article iii jurisdiction to decide cases and controversies accordingly likelihood f executive curtailment could be said to exist the court dismissed arguments tha t permitting such privat actions would place unacceptable burdens on the presidents ability to perform his official d uties noting that there was historical or evidentiary foundation for such co ncern

of the need for assistance from the c oordinate branches however the court has allowed legislative delegation where congress lays down by legislative act n intelligi ble principle to which the person or body authorized to exercise delegate d authority is directed to conform83 because of the pragmatic necessities of government the court has granted broad power to congress to delegate legislative authority to the coordinate branches84 indeed the court has invalidated such grants of authority only in two instances where it was determined that congress had improperly delegated its article i

the statut e91 permitte d either house of congress to execute legislative veto the cour t determined that the provision was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine92 with its decision in chadha the supreme court established that congress may exercise its legislative authority only in accord with single finely wrought an d exhaustively considered procedure namely bicameral passage and presentation93 this formal stance by the court evidences the traditional concern regarding th potential aggrandizement of the legislative branch as was noted by the court i n chadha the constitution places specific limits on congress as result of th profound conviction of th framers that the powers conferred on congress were the powers to be most carefully circumscribed accordingly the judiciarys concern94 with preventing legislative ggrandizement has led to its review of other cases where congress has departed from the express practices delineated in the constitution in this context par ticular attention has been paid to congressional encroachment upon the presidents removal and appointment powers as well as legislative attempts t enforce the laws in

while the decision in myers seemed to establish clear limitations on the ability of congress to interfere with the presidents appointment and removal power th supreme court in humphreys executor v united states employing functionalis t analysis unanimously upheld law proscribing the presidents ability to remove n agency off icial specifically the court addressed provision of the federal trade99 commission act which provided that the president could remove an ft c commissioner only on the basis of inefficiency neglect of duty or malfeasance i n office distinguishing the case at hand the court held that myers was limited to100 purely executive officers and could not include officers not in the executiv department and those who exercised part of the executive power vested by the constitution in the president explaining that the ftc was not an executive body101 but rather functioned as quasilegis lative or quasijudicial agency the court ruled that congr ess possessed the authority to control the terms of removal for suc h officers102 this functional approach to removal questions was extended in morrison v olson where th supreme court clarified that the proper inquiry regarding removal power questions shoul d focus not on an officers status as either purely executive quasilegislative or quasijudicial but rather on whether removal restriction interferes with the ability of the president to exercise executive power and to perform his constitutional duty applying this maxim to the independent counsel statute 103 which placed removal power in the attorney general the court found that whil imbued with the power to perform law enforcement functions the independen t counsel lacked significant policymaking or administrative authority as such th court determined that removal power over t he independent counsel was not essential to the presidents successful completion of his constitutional duties104 in buckley v valeo the court analyzed provisions of the federal electio n

passed by congress two members would be appointed by the speaker of the house two by the president pro tempore of the senate and two by th president subject to confirmation by both houses of congress chief among the106 duties of the commission was the imposition of penalties upon individuals r organizati ons that violated provisions of the act given the substantial dutie s107 assigned by law to the commission the court determined that it was an executiv body noting that it is to the president and not to th congress that the constitution entrusts the responsibility to take care that the laws by faithfully executed th court explained that the statute violated the appointments clause which require s appointment of officers of the united states by the president contingent upo n confirmation by the senate thus as it did in chadha the court in buckle y108 employed formalistic approach to the separation of powers doctrine wherea s chadh established that congress could not circumvent the bicameralism an d presentment requirements of article i through the use of legislative veto buckley limited congress ability to direct the composition of executive bodies i n contravention of the express provisions of the appointment clause in addition to limiting t he ability of congress to depart from the strictures of its legislative function or to exercise power beyond the scope of the appointments clause the constitution also limits the ability of the legislative branch to encroach upon the core functions of the other branches in keeping with this principle the court s carefully proscribed legislative attempts to extend its p ower into the executive branch in bowsher v synar for instance the court interpreted the separation of power s doctrine as it applied to the grammrudman deficit re duction act under the act109 the comptroller gen eral was empowered to review deficit estimates from the office of managem ent and budget and the congressional budget office and to mandat spending reductions to meet specified deficit level this report by the comptroller general would then be forwarded to the president who was required to issue an order enforcing the spending reductions the order would become eff ective unless congress passed legislation which reduced spending to meet deficit estimates furthermore the comptroller general could only be removed by congress via joint resolution110 the supreme court found that the act imbued the comptroller general n official appointed by the president but removable by congress with the power t interpret provisions of the act and to dictate the means by which the executiv branch implemented budget reduction measures according ly the court determined111 that the comptroller general legislative branch officer was in essence

1995119the functions of an executive officer in executing law passed by congress dut constitutionally committed to an officer of the executive branch this dynami c112 rendered the act unconstitutio nal as the court explained because of the maxim that once congress makes its choice in enacting legislation its participation ends113 subsequent to enactment congress may control the execution of its enactment only indirectly by passing new legislation the court determined that by placing the114 authority to implement the act in an officer subject only to congressional removal congress in effect retained control over the execution of the act an d unconstitutionally intruded into the executive function 115 through its decisions in cases such as myers buckl ey and chadha the supreme court relied upon formal textual interpretation of the constitution in determining that congress violates the separation of powers doctrine when it attempts to directly or indirectly enforce the laws or exercise appointment or re moval power over officers charged with executing the law it is important to note however that concer n regarding legislative aggrandizement extends beyond congressional activity whic h implicates explicit provisions in the stitution specifically the supreme court has been careful to proscribe congressional activity which would influence interbranc h relations contrary to the doctrine in metropolitan washington airports authority v citizens for the abatement of aircraft ise the court reviewed the congressional establishment of board of review over the metropolitan washington airports authority compact betwee n the district of colu mbia and virginia the authority selected its own members but was bound by congr essional mandate to select members of congress to serve on the review board specifical ly the statute in question subjected the airports authority116 to the veto power of the board of review and stated that members of congress served in their individual capacities the court d etermined that irrespective of the117 statutes claim that members did not act in their official capacities the board f review in fact acted as an agent of congress giving the legislative branch facto control over the operations of the airports authority as such the court concluded that the veto power was an unconstitutional aggrandizement of legislative power118 this focus on limiting congressional ability to exercise power beyond th traditional scope of the legislative branch was further illustrated in hechinger v metropolitan washington airports autho rity in hechinger the court of appeals119 for the district of columbia addressed continued congressional attempts to exer t influence over the airports authority specifically congress subsequent to th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30249crs18 the court of appeals for the district of columbia had shortly prior to hechinger 120 addressed similar question regarding impermissible congressional

requirement was permissible in that it provided for an advisory an d informational ro the court explained that the purpose of the membership requirement was to influence the commission by plac ing

in the original case created another board of review which possessed only the power to delay the airport s authoritys decision making and implementation pro cess such distinction from the veto power of the original case was deemed irrelevant as the court determined that the purpose of the board was to influence the authoritys decision making process accordingly the court held the statute unconstitutional as such an extension f legislative power was an impermissible aggrandizement under the doctrine120 however in keeping with the framers belief that flexible doctrine wa s necessary to allow for effective governance the supreme court has departed from formal interpretation of the separation of powers principle in circumstances wher legislative power is not extend ed to the detriment of the other branches in morrison v olson for instance the court addressed the constitutionality of the independen t counsel statute specifically congress provided for the appointment of n independent counsel charged with the investigation of government officials suspected of illegal activity as well as for their subsequent prosecution as passed b y121 congress the statute further p rovided that an independent counsel may be removed from office other than by impeachment and conviction only by the personal action of the attorney general and only for good cause physical disability menta l incapacity r any other condition that substantially impairs the performance of such independent counsels duties122 it was argued that the removal provision violated the separation of power s doctrine by interfering with the presidents removal power in its disposition of the issue the court distinguished morrison from bowsher v synar explaining tha t whereas congress had usurped executive branch authority in bowsher by retainin g control over the removal of the comptrolle r general the independent counsel statute belied such congressional intent and in fact placed removal power squarely i n the hands of the executive branch this was significant in that while the statute123 impinged upon the free exercise of exec utive power such limitation was necessary to ensure the independence of the office of the independent counsel so as to avoid what congress perceived as possible conflicts of interest in department of justic ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30249crs19 id at 693124 id at 691 in cases employing such functional reasoning the court utilizes the balancing125 test formulated in nixon v administrator of general services 433 us 425 1977 there the court explained that in determi ning whether particular act disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate branches the inquiry should focus on the extent to which it impinges upon core function of branch interfering with accomplishment of constitutionall assigned function id at 443 it is only upon ascertaining the potential for such infringement that the court will then wei gh the impact of the disruption to determine

id at 365 specifically the dissenters argued that there was significant possibility tha t members of congress did possess standi ng in such situation id the issue of standing was revisited in raines v

separation of powers doctrine see supra note 71 and accompanying text discussing line item veto act the court denied the member s standing explaining that they had alleged injury to themselves as

with justice breyer that the members did indeed possess standing id at 829 enforcement policy accordingly the court determined that the doctrine had not124 been violated as the statute did not usurp the remo val power of the executive branch rather the statute protected the independence of the office while imbuing th attorney general with sufficient authority to protect the presidents ability t perform his constitutional duty 125 from these decisions it is apparent that the doctrine was carefully crafted t confine congress to its legi slative role as has been shown the separation of powers principle as delineated in the constitution prevents congr essional attempts to enforce the laws which it enacts and prohibits interference with the presidents power f appointment or removal this dynamic is furthe r evidenced in the judiciarys refusal126 to grant standing to individual members of congress wishing to pursue declaratory or injunctive relief for leged executive branch failings in

power is circumscribed in certain ins tances by the executive privilege doctrine which allows the executive branch t maintain the confidentiality of records and documents under certain circumstances130 c judicial infringement and aggrandizement in additi on to delineating the scope of congressional and executive power the constit ution also protects and prescribes the functions of the judicial branch i n relation to the executive and legislative bodies indeed the constitutional separation of powers serves both to protect the core functions of the judiciary and to prevent judicial review of matters outside its purview regarding matter s of jurisdiction the separation of powers doctrine has served to provide congress with degree of control over the judicial branch whil preventing the exercise of excessive power over the federal courts in ex part mccardle for instance the supreme court had exercised jurisdiction over habeas corpus proceeding pursuant to an act pas sed in 1867 while the case was pending131 congress amended the act repealing the pr ovision which allowed for an appeal from the judgme nt of circuit court to the supreme court and further repealed th jurisdiction of the supreme court to hear any such cases pursuant to th e132 congressional amendment the supreme court dismissed the appeal declaring tha t there was question that the repealing of the act had stripped it of jurisdiction prohibiting further consideration of the case specifically the court explained tha t jurisdiction is power to declare the law and when it c eases to exist the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause 133 temperi ng this congressional authority however is the maxim that congres s may not require the federal courts to exercise the judicial power of the unite d states in manner repugnant to the text structure and traditions of article iii134 as such in united states v klein the supreme court struck down reconstruction statute mandating that presidential pardon could be introduced or considered in evidence to support claim for the return of confiscated property the statute in135 question also established that proof of loyalty was to be determined by congressional enactment and ordered the supreme court to dismiss on appeal for want f jurisdiction cases which employed other criteria finally

ration of the statute the supreme court acknowledged congress authority over the creation and jurisdiction of inferior federal courts as well as it s power to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court136 however the court determined that the statute withheld appellate jurisdiction only as means to an end determini ng that the statute essentially prescribed rule137 for the decision of cause in particular way the supreme court struck down the provisions in particular the court explained that mandating the effect of evidenc in case was outside the scope of congressional authority to make exceptions and prescribe regulations to the appellate power by enacting such statue according to the court congress had inadvertently passed the limit which separates th legislative from the judicial power 138 the separation of powers doctrine was again employed by the supreme court in plaut v spendthrift farm inc to strike down statute which encroached upon the power of the judiciary under article iii specifically at issue was 27ab of the139 securities exchange act of 1934 which required federal courts to reopen fina l judgments in priv ate civil actions under 10b of the act noting that article iii140 establishes judicial department with the province and dutyto say what the law is in particular cases and controversies the court determined that the judicia l branch possesses authority under the const itution to rule on cases subject to review only by sup erior courts in the article iii hierarchy central to this authority 141 according to the court is the understanding that decision resolves cas conclusively as an inherent aspect of judicial power is the ability to render dispositive judgments upon noting this principle the court determined that congress d violated the separa tion of powers doctrine by retroactively commanding the federal courts to reopen final judgments142 in addition to protect ing the rights of the legislative and judicial branches in the jurisdictional context the separation of powers doctrine has also been integral i n establishing the extent to which judicial nd legislative authority may be intermingled in mistretta v united states for instance the court addressed the constitutionality of the united states sentencing commiss ion and its congressionally delegated power to issue sentencing

foste ring judicial encroachment upon the executive branch by delegating to commission comprised in part by sitting federal judges the power to establish sentencing guidelines acknowledging that executive or administrativ e145 duties may not generally be imposed on the judicial branch the court clarified this rule noting th at nonadjudicatory responsibilities may be assumed by the judiciary in certain instances specifically the court explained that rulemaking is not a146 function exclusively committed to the executive branch and may be assigned to the judicial branch when appropriate to the central mission of the judiciary147 having explained the basis for judicial rulemaking the court found that the role of the commission in promulgating guidelines for the xercise of that judicial function bears considerable similarity to the role of this court in tablishing rules of procedure under the various enabling acts the import of this observation was that th e148 commissions functions were roughly analogous to the preexisting role of th judiciary in creating procedural rules the court f urther found that the function of the commission was intimately related to the traditional d uty and power of judges to hand down appropriate sentences in individual cases and to determine the sentencin g factors to be applied in any given case accordingly the court held that th e149 commissions activities were characteristic of the acknowledged mission of th judicial branch and did not dilute the power of the executive or legislativ branches as such the court determined that the dynamics of the commissio n150 were not violative of the separation of powers doctrine conversely this pragmatic appr oach has also been used to justify activity which could be construed as legislative encroachment upon the judicial sphere i n commodity futures trading commission v schor the court addressed provisions in the commodity exchange act which gave the commodity futures tradin g commissio

regulations usurped essential attributes of judicial power as well as the factors which led congress to authorize such delegation the court ruled that th commissions ability to adjudicate

interaction between the judicial and legislative branch the supreme court has acknowledged limitations upon the power of the judiciary to review certai n congressio nal and executive acts in marbury v madison the court first originated the political question doctrine noting that questions in thei r nature political or which are by the constitution and laws submitted to the executive can never be made in this court the modern concept of the doctrine was delineated in baker v carr 153 where the court explained that political question adheres when an issue i s demonstr ably committed to political body by the text of the constitution wher effective judicial standards are absent where nonjudicial policy determination i s necessary for disposition where the court s decision of an issue would impinge upon the respect owed to the other branches where unique circumstances call fo r adherence to previously made political decis ion or finally where differing opinions from various departments could lead to confusion and embarrassment154 applying these principle s to case involving an appeal by an impeached federal judge the supreme court elaborated upon the parameters of judicial review specific ally in nixon v united states the court was asked to consider whether i t was constitutional for the sena to employ special trial committee in impeachment proceedings as opposed to conducting full trial before the entire senate the155 argumen t before the court was that the senate rule authorizing the use of tria l committees was in violation of the article i requirement that the full senate try impeachments the court determined that the term try did not constitute n156 implied limitation on the method by which the senate might proceed in tryin g impeachments and furthermore l acked sufficient precision to afford any judicially manageable standard of review of the senates actions this was especially so in157 light of the express limitations of the impeachment trial clause requiring tha t members act under oath that the chief justice preside over trial s of the president and that conviction rest upon twothirds vote 158 with this understanding of the clause the court stated that judicial review would be inappropriate as it would conflict with the framers intent to vest impeachmen t trial power in the senate furthermore the

nonjusticiable as review thereof would result in lack of finality and difficulty in fashioning relief 160 the checks and balances concept is further illustrate d in united states v munoz flores where the court determined that the judic ial branch possesses authority under the constitutional separation of powers doctrine to review origination claus issues in munozflores the court addressed the argument that the order of a161 federal magistrate requiring the respondent convicted of two misdemeanor offenses to pay an assessment to the crime victims fund as established by the victims f crime act of 1984 violated the origination clause of the constitution specifically the argument centered on the assertion that as the assessment p rovision had originated in the senate it violate d the origination clause requirement that all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives 162 prior to addressing the merits of the argument the court res ponded to assertions that the separation of powers doctrine precluded judi cial review of origination clause conflicts the governmen t argued that the question was outside the scope of review as the house possessed the ability to protect its institutional interests by refusing to pass bill which it felt infringed upon the origination clause the government also maintai ned that review was inappropriate as compliance with the assessmen t provision would not significantly affect individual rights noting that neither f163 these arguments was sufficient to trigger application f the political question doctrine the

labeling the issue political question166 turning to the individual righ ts argument the court stated that the political question doctrine was not implicate d as the identity of litigant was irrelevant to its focus on restraining the judiciary from interfering in the business of the other branches167 furthermore the court explained that the governments assertion that originatio n clause compliance was irrelevant to ensure individual rights was incorrect specifically the court explained that t he separation of powers doctrine was designed to secure liberty rega rdless of whether the activity in question related to interbranch activity or activity within the legislative branch itself accordingly the cour t168 determined that it possessed constitutiona l authority to review the origination clause issue169 d judicial apprehension in relation to interbranch conflicts potential separation of powers conflicts often adhere to statutes enacted b congress particularly in the executivelegislative relations co ntext the effect of such legislation is readily apparent in cases such as buckley v valeo and bowsher v synar discussed above given that wide body of statutory enactments raise potentiall serious separation of powers issues the supreme court has traditionally engaged in practice of statutory interpretation which avoids constitutional conflicts to as great degree as possible specifically the court has explained that when the validity of an act f congress is drawn in question and even if serious doubt of constitutionality i s raised it is cardinal principle that this court will first ascertain whether construction of the statute is fairly possible by w hich the question may be avoided170 furthermore the court has deemed this approach applicable so long as suc h construction would not be plainly contrary to the intent of congress the court171 has explained that such an approach appreciates the congressional as well as th judicial responsibility to uphold the constitution finally the court has declared172 this principle to carry special weight in the separation of powers context173httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30249crs26

conflic t with the presidents appointment power raising significant doubts as to the constitutionality of the ac t under the separation of powers doctrine 176 noting the im portance of the cardinal principle of statutory construction the court cautioned that it could not press statutory construction to the point f disingenuous evasion even to avoid constitutional question following thi s177 proviso the court determined that the prior regulatory scheme and the legislativ history of the act revealed the congress probably did not intend to subject the aba committee to facas requirements when the aba committee offers potentia l advice regarding presidential appointments to the federal bench given thi s178 analysis the court held that as faca did not show clear congressional intent t include the aba committee sound sense counseled deference to the rule f caution accordingly the court ultimately held that faca was inapplicable 179 avoiding separation of powers conflict the court

congress before assuming it intended the presidents performance of his statutor duties to be reviewed for abuse of discretion since the act did not expressl y182 provide for review of the presidents actions the court held tha t it must presume such actions were not subject to its requirements183 judicial reticence in ruling on direct conf licts of constitutional authority between the legislative and executive branches is also evident in the executive privileg context in united states v american telephone telegraph co for instance subcommittee of the house interstate and foreign commer ce committee subpoenaed documents from att in an effort to ascertain whether legislation was needed t curb alleged abuses of power in the authorization of warrantless wiretaps conducted for asserted national security purposes the executive branch argued that th e184 requested documents contained sensitive intelligence information the disclosure f which could compromise national security when negotiations between the justic department and subcommittee chairman john moss proved unsuccessful the justice department sued to enjoin att from complying with the subpoena and th subcommittee chairman intervened as defendant 185 in its initial consideration of the case the court of appeals for the district f columbia held that it was appropriate to direct the parties to continue settlemen t negotiations rathe r than to decide the nervecenter constitutional questions raised by the conflict between the rig ht of the executive branch to protect national security information and the authority of the legislative branch to investigate and acquir information by subpoena when further negotiation was not successful the court186 of appeals again considered the iss ue and again refrained from decision upholding either of the claims of absolute authority instead the court mandated n187 information sharing procedure tailored to the concerns of both branches eventually leading to the settlement of the conflict 188 judicial branch refusal to resolve such direct conflicts was again displayed i n united states v house of representatives there the unite d states district court

the distric t court determined that resolution of the executive privilege claim was not necessary as the epa administrator was not defendant in any legal action by congress190 accordingly the district court sought to maintain the delicate balance of power s among the power s established by the constitution by prevailing upon the parties to settle the conflict without further judicial involvement191 conclusion from the above analysis it i s evident that the separation of powers doctrine has played an extremely significant role in defining the scope of legislative judicial and executive power and responsibility t he framers desire for an efficient governmental structure which would serve to secure liberty and prevent the tyrannical exercise of power led to the development of tripartite struct ure which bestows power upon the separate branches of government according to their constitutionally defined roles while this principle has served to invalidate and block action by the respectiv branches which impinges upon core function of the other the hybrid doctrin crafted by the framers av oids the problems inherent in mere parchment barriers192 as noted by madison more adequate defense is indispensably necessary to guard against branch encroachment and enable efficient governance accordingly the 193 supreme court in adhering to th is maxim has adopted both formalist and functional approaches in dealing with separation of powers issues without adopting either as an exclusive analytical rubric r ather while the court has often taken formalist stance in situations where an sential constitutional function of branch is impinged it has also employed functionalist analysis in recognizing the need for efficient and effective government as achieved through sharing of tasks among the branches this checks and balances structure as f ormulated by the framers and enforced by the courts has served to protect the independence and equality of the three branches whil permitting certain functions to remain interdependent ensuring workabl government
