distributes most of these funds to regular appropriations accounts and generally requires additional notifications to congress of transfers in cases where the administration is given additional flexibility the largest fund proposed was 599 billion for the dods defense emergency response fund that would cover the costs associated with the war in iraq the continued us presence in afghanistan enhanced security at us military bases and postwar occupation in iraq the conference includes 157 billion in new iraq freedom fund but distributes the remaining funds to specific accounts congress

the house and senate approved the conference version of the fy2003 supplemental hr 1559hrept 10876 providing 7849 billion to cover the costs of military operations in iraq relief and reconstruction of iraq ongoing us costs in afghanistan additional aid to coalition partners and nations cooperating in the global war on terrorism and homeland security this total is 374 billion more than the request and roughly 500 million more than the 7793 billion passed by the house and the 7795 billion passed by the senate the conference version includes 31 billion airline industry relief package that was not requested by the president1 president bush signed the legislation on april 18 pl 10811 reflecting congressional priorities the conference version of the bill includes additional funding for homeland security programs such as customs and border protection and baggage and passenger screening hr 1559 further includes 700 million for protecting highthreat urban areas up substantially from 50 million requested by the administration the emergency supplemental also provides 223 billion for first responders about 10 higher than requested on international assistance issues the conference version generally provides amounts proposed but adds 369 million for food aid for iraq and elsewhere and drops 150 million for presidential crisis fund the 2475 billion iraq relief and reconstruction fund will follow the authorities of regular foreign aid programs that are usually managed by the department of state and the us agency for international development usaid nevertheless congress agreed to the presidents request for broad discretion in the allocation of iraq reconstruction money that allows direct apportionment to several federal agencies including dod for defense spending hr 1559 as enacted funds the 626 billion requested by the administration but appropriates all but 157 billion in regular appropriations 1 see congressional record april 12 2003 p h 3400 for tables showing total costs these totals include only direct appropriations for airline industry relief and do not include the cost of suspending airline security service fees and extending unemployment benefits to eligible airline employees these elements do not require an appropriation but will result in the loss of revenue from fee collections and higher unemployment benefit costs as estimated by cbo the inclusion of these additional airlinerelated costs push the supplemental total up to 7919 billion as enacted and 7898 billion as passed by the senate crs2 accounts rather than providing 599 billion as requested in the defense emergency response fund to be spent at dods discretion instead congress appropriated 157 billion in new iraq freedom fund where dod will have spending flexibility as long as it stays within several ceilings and floors and provides 5day advance notifications of transfers congress also increased combat pay and separation allowances for us forces costing an estimated 650 million supplemental overview within days of the initiation of us military operations in iraq president bush sent congress 7475 billion supplemental package largely divided into three parts defense

provided combination of direct appropriations for grants to the airlines and changes in fees and unemployment benefits for airline workers that do not require direct appropriations the enacted version of hr 1559 follows the senate framework of direct appropriations and other items although at different levels amounts shown in brackets for the senate and enacted levels represent cbo estimates of the costs of fee changes and unemployment benefits b includes only direct appropriations and excludes the nonappropriated costs of the airline industry package shown in brackets congressional action on administration request as passed on april 3 in both bodies the bills were at senate or just below house the request for defense both bills increased appropriations for iraq reconstruction and other foreign crs3 aid the house slightly to 798 billion and the senate more significantly to 845 billion mainly due to 600 million amendment for additional food aid for iraq for homeland security the house measure was slightly below the presidents request mainly because of the denial of funding for the white houses proposed emergency fund while the senate increased homeland security by about 770 million to 514 billion hr 1559 provided 32 billion for airline industry relief while s 762 included an estimated 35 billion2 as requested the conference version of the bill provides 6258 billion for defense but as recommended by appropriators in both houses the enacted legislation reduces the flexibility in using those funds that was requested by the administration as passed hr 1559 appropriates most of the funds to regular appropriations accounts however it also sets up new 157 billion iraq freedom fund to give dod additional flexibility within the new fund established for iraqi relief and reconstruction the conference bill appropriates funds to the president giving him the flexibility to allocate those funds to various agencies including the department of defense in response to administration concerns the conference version eliminated restrictions that would have prevented dod from administering any of these funds the enacted appropriation however provides that the funds are to be designated as bilateral economic assistance and spent consistent with the foreign assistance act of 19613 for homeland security the conference version provides 512 billion 749 million more than requested for airline relief the final bill provides for 31 billion package including direct appropriations authority to extend by 26 weeks unemployment compensation for displaced workers and temporary suspension of certain passenger and air carrier security fees from june 1 to september 30 20034 while details of each of these components are discussed below one overriding theme that was apparent throughout the supplemental package was the presidents desire for the maximum degree of flexibility in managing and allocating these resources under the proposal most of the funds would be have been placed in emergency response funds which the president the secretaries of defense justice and homeland security could draw upon purposes for which the resources would be used were justified in general terms but extensive discretion would have been allotted to executive officials among the proposed emergency funds were defense emergency response fund 599 billion iraq relief and reconstruction fund 24 billion department of homeland security counterterrorism fund 15 billion department of justice counterterrorism fund 500 million 2 see footnote in table 1 above regarding costs of the airline industry relief package these estimates are based on those issued by the congressional budget office 3 hrept 10876 p 15 and p 7072 4 airline relief funding costs are based on cbo estimates that include both direct appropriations and the costs of fee changes and unemployment benefits extension crs4 executive office of the president emergency response fund 250 million legislative branch emergency response fund 125 million administration officials argued that such flexibility was needed due to constantly changing circumstances in and around iraq and uncertainty over the duration and magnitude of the military campaign the demands posed for nearterm humanitarian relief and longerterm reconstruction of the country and the ongoing global war on terrorism in the enacted legislation reflecting both house and senate action funds are generally directed for more specific purposes than proposed by the white house the iraqi relief and reconstruction fund is the exception where congress gives the president flexibility to allocate funds to five federal agencies including the department of defense previous versions of the supplemental appropriation as passed by the house and the senate would have limited the presidents ability to apportion the funds directly to dod and required that fund be managed by the state department and the us agency for international development usaid for defense the conference version allocates much of the 599 billion requested by the department of defense in the defense emergency response fund to regular appropriations accounts reserving 157 billion in new iraq freedom response fund to be allocated by the president subject to various ceilings and floors set in the bill hr 1559 substitutes the presidents request for two department of homeland security funds totaling 35 billion with specific allocations for port security state and local government law enforcement and national guard reimbursements checked baggage explosive detection systems at airports among others the conference report also allocates most of these funds to specific accounts the enacted supplemental also distributes nearly all of the 500 million proposed justice department counterterrorism fund among several activities allocating portion for fema disaster relief hr 1559 further requires advance notification of how the money will be spent and directs the administration to reimburse foreign aid accounts that have previously been drawn upon to fund pre conflict needs in iraq amendments during floor debate during floor debate lawmakers considered amendments affecting each of the three main areas of the presidents supplemental request defenserelated proposals that were adopted included stevens amendment to increase combat pay 650 million estimated cost adopted by voice vote and included in the conference agreement allard amendment to create panel to examine claims of sexual misconduct at the air force academy adopted by voice vote and included with modifications in the enacted legislation within stevens amendment sa 522 section that would prohibit contracts for military airlift services to any carrier that is not crs5 effectively controlled by citizens of the united states5 the amendment with modifications remained in the enacted legislation the senate also rejected an amendment by senator landrieu that would have added 105 billion for national guard and reserves procurement tabled 5247 house and senate amendments regarding iraq reconstruction and international assistance focused generally on efforts to add humanitarian resources for iraq cut aid to turkey and colombia and restrict eligibility of reconstruction contractors the senate approved an amendment by senator kohl adding 600 million for pl480 title ii food assistance programs including requirement that 155 million be used to reimburse food accounts from which resources had been previously taken for iraq hr 1559 provides 250 million for these same purposes the enacted bill provides 369 million for food assistance the house defeated three amendments cutting international assistance cunningham amendment to delete 1 billion in aid to turkey defeated 110315 defazio amendment to cut aid to turkey by 207 million transferring the funds to establish national guard weapons of mass destruction civil support teams defeated 113312 mcgovern amendment eliminating 61 million in counter narcotics funds for colombia and increasing appropriations for the office of domestic preparedness defeated 209216 on aid contracting and related issues the house approved voice vote proposal by congressman kennedy mn that prohibits the use of funds for iraq reconstruction to purchase goods or services produced by france germany russia or syria although us subsidiaries of companies organized in those countries would be eligible two senate amendments related to this issue were withdrawn ensign amendment to prohibit reconstruction funds in way that would benefit businesses and citizens of france and germany unless physically located in the us landrieumikulski amendment to require that american flag commercial ships be used to transport us assistance hr 1559 as enacted however deleted the housepassed kennedy amendment most amendments considered in both houses focused on increased spending for homeland security purposes the senate adopted modified proposal by senator bayh adding 105 million for grants to states for smallpox and other bioterrorism inoculation programs originally the amendment would have provided 340 million the conference version of hr 1559 includes 100 million for such inoculation programs the senate further agreed to an amendment by senator specter 6532 adding 200 million to the office for domestic preparedness odp and rearranging odp funds so that resources for highthreat urban areas would grow 5 samdt 522 in congressional record april 3 2003 part ii p s 4868 crs6 from 100 million as reported in s 762 to 600 million hr 1559 as approved raises this total to 700 million the senate also adopted an omnibus amendment by senator stevens that included provisions increasing homeland security by about 150 million mainly for doe nuclear security programs conferees generally supported these doe activities but the house and senate rejected several other efforts to add to the presidents request for homeland security senator hollings amendment to add about 1 billion for port security tabled 5247 senator breaux amendment to add about 267 billion for various homeland security programs tabled 5246 senator schumer amendment to increase odp funding by 233 billion tabled 5146 senator boxer amendment to earmark 30 million for rd and deployment of technology to protect commercial airliners from man portable defense systems tabled 5047 congressman obey amendment to add 25 billion for homeland security ruled out of order congressman nadler amendment to increase port security funds by 15 billion ruled out of order the senate also rejected an amendment by senators byrd and hollings that would not have increased homeland security spending but would have allocated resources to specific accounts rather than leaving the secretary of homeland security with broad discretion the administration generally supported actions by the house and senate but raised objections in few areas largely related to executive flexibility matters the white house suggested that senate language allocating defense funds to specific accounts might slow timely and effecting funding of urgent needs the administration raised the same concern regarding house text that allocated homeland security resources to specific activities rather than placing the money in central fund this the white house claimed would hinder the homeland departments secretary from applying the funds to the most critical threats the executive further expressed concerns about the house bill which directed that iraq relief and reconstruction fund resources be managed by the state department and the us agency for international development usaid removing presidential flexibility over involving multiple agencies in reconstruction operations finally the white house considered the airline industry relief packages in both bills excessive6 details concerning each of the supplementals major components are discussed

on the department of defenses request the administration requested 626 billion for the department of defense dod for the cost of the war in iraq continued us operations in afghanistan and the global war on terrorism and enhanced security at military bases in the united states the dod fy2003 supplemental request funded the deployment and redeployment of us forces and equipment to the persian gulf and the prosecution of short intense conflict in addition the request included funding for an occupation force in iraq for the remainder of fy2003 repair and restocking of military equipment and munitions as well funds to conduct firefighting and restore and repair iraqi oil fields and small amount of funding for humanitarian assistance7 although dod did not specify the amount its request also included funds to cover the cost of us forces in afghanistan operation enduring freedom as well as the cost of enhanced security in the united states operation noble eagle for the remainder of the fiscal year8 dod received 61 billion to cover its expenses for these missions in the first part of the year in the fy2003 consolidated appropriations resolution pl 1087hjres 29 dod has estimated expenses for the remainder of the fy2003 to be about 6 to 8 billion10 citing the unpredictable nature of the us conflict in iraq the department of defense requested that 599 billion 96 of its total be appropriated to the defense emergency response fund derf transfer account where dod could exercise discretion in spending the money for purposes that it considers appropriate and move funds into the relevant appropriation accounts11 although dods proposed language required quarterly reports to congress about the allocation of actual expenditures some members of congress expressed concerns about the extent of flexibility that dod would have in allocating almost 60 billion in response to these 7 department of defense fy 2003 supplemental request for military operation in iraq and the global

supplemental appropriated 75 of the funding in the supplemental to specific accounts and added various reporting requirements to give dod flexibility to develop and exploit cooperative military relationships with other nations in the global war on terrorism the defense department requested 14 billion for military and logistical support to pakistan jordan and other key cooperating nations in the war on terrorism 150 million to support indigenous or irregular foreign military forces and 50 million to support the regular forces of foreign nations working with the united states in the global war on terrorism some of these proposals were controversial and congress rejected dods request for indigenous forces and reduced and limited the request for regular forces but agreed to provide the 14 billion for military and logistical support with additional reporting requirements the request also proposed to raise current statutory limits on the amount of funds to be used at the discretion of the secretary of defense and combatant commanders for unanticipated military requirements including support for foreign military forces dod again cited the war in iraq and the global war on terrorism as the rationale for these changes the request also proposed major increase from 2 billion to about 9 billion in the total amount of funding that dod could transfer between appropriations after notifying the appropriations committees12 the enacted version raises the statutory limits and gives dod additional transfer authority but at levels lower than requested in remarks at the pentagon president bush characterized the fy2003 supplemental as urgent and dod officials called for quick passage to ensure that dod does not face shortages in operating expenses dod characterized 303 billion of its 626 billion request as costs incurred for the buildup phase of the iraqi war including expenses such as transportation of equipment and personnel or as committed costs such as those for the return of troops and equipment theater of operations13 in the enacted version of the supplemental congress appropriated these costs in regular appropriations accounts rather than providing them in the defense emergency response fund as requested by dod issues in the dod request the major issues that arose during congressional consideration of the supplemental and that are discussed below included

foreign military forces who cooperate with the us in combating terrorism and congress responded by adding reporting requirements compensation for war duty congress increased combat pay and family separation allowances for military personnel in theater because of concerns about adequacy defining dods postwar role the administration request allowed the president to allocated funds for reconstruction and relief activities in iraq to any agency including dod and congress agreed and costs and other effects of the war costs beyond fy2003 and effects on dods readiness and forces over the longerterm are unclear from dods request and remain concerns of congress there was little debate about the total amount requested by dod for fy2003 although congressional action adjusts the mix of funds requested by the administration and reduces dods flexibility see tables 2 2a and 2b and discussion below further details about the administrations request are in the section entitled dods funding request by appropriation account conference resolution of issues the conference version of hr 1559pl 10811 addressed the issue of flexibility by reducing the extent and type of funding flexibility for dod congress did establish new iraq freedom fund account with 157 billion in funding where dod would have discretion over about 10 billion to 11 billion of those funds see table 2 below the enacted version also allows the administration to give dod large new role in postwar reconstruction and relief activities see section on defining dods postwar role and key issues in iraq reconstruction and international assistance below there was little controversy about the total funding level requested for dod and the enacted version generally provides amounts consistent with dods request see table 2b below balancing flexibility with congressional oversight the conference version of the bill blends the approaches used by the two houses to reduce dods 14 for information about

monies for combat stability operations crs11 reconstituting forces replacing munitions and equipment and other costs as long as dod stays within several ceilings and floors that are set within the

amounts the unallocated total would be greater if dod met the floors and spent up to the ceiling levels dod would be still able to transfer at least 104 billion from the fund to various appropriation accounts at their discretion that funding flexibility could be larger if dod spent below the ceilings in recent press conference dod comptroller dov zakheim stated that dod would have unfettered flexibility for about 105 billion to 11 billion15 dod is still however required to notify congress 5 days in advance of transferring funds and to submit quarterly reports on transfers beginning on

levels because dod will have flexibility to allocate over 10 billion of the funding in the fy2003 supplemental the final distribution of funding is not yet available based on dods initial request and congressional action table 2b below shows the administrations request house and senate action and the enacted version of funding for the department of defense congress provided 6258 billion the same as the amount requested and close to the amounts provided by the house and the senate the slightly lower level in the house reflects smaller amounts for military construction the house recommended 6246 billion and the senate appropriations committee sac recommended 6255 billion based on the illustrative breakdowns of expense that appear to be included in dods request it appears that the enacted supplemental generally adopts dods projections for various types of expenses the enacted version however includes over 3 billion more than dod proposed for military personnel reflecting discussions with the services and possibly concerns about whether dods request assumed adequate troop levels for occupation see table 2b since dod did not include the assumptions underlying its cost estimates in terms of troop levels or the duration of the war comparisons and assessments are difficult table 2b funding allocations or appropriations in fy2003 supplemental for dod request house and senate action

within the operation iraqi freedom fund where dod generally has flexibility h funded through om appropriations accounts i may not add to total due to rounding additional transfer authority and reporting requirements in addition to setting up the new iraq freedom fund congress gives additional flexibility by allowing dod to transfer up to 2 billion of the funds in the supplemental to different appropriation accounts as long as normal notification procedures are followed although this ceiling on transfers is less than the 9 billion crs15 requested by the administration it is proportionately six times greater than the transfer limit set in the fy2003 dod appropriations act pl 10724817 to increase the information available for oversight congress also requires that dod submit to the defense committees financial analysis on fy2003 spending that covers not only the fy2003 supplemental but also the regular fy2003 appropriations and the additional funding received by dod in the fy2003 consolidated appropriations resolution18 increasing flexibility in use of military construction funds dod requested 128 million for air force and 48 million for navy military construction of several projects in guantanamo bay and the persian gulf including an 85 million project called millennium village for headquarters billeting and other support facilities for some 2000 military and civilian personnel at classified location19 although the conference version lists the particular projects to be funded within the 201 million appropriated the enacted version gives more flexibility than normal by permitting dod to transfer up to 150 million to the contingency construction account and then allocate funds from there to individual projects as long as the defense committees are given notifications seven days in advance and cost estimates and documentation 15 days after obligating funds the enacted bill provides 110 million for millennium village20 flexibility to fund foreign militaries in the global war on terrorism increases another area of controversy was dods request for additional flexibility in reimbursing foreign military forces who cooperate with the us in combating terrorism the conference version of the fy2003 supplemental gives dod some but not all of the flexibility requested coalition support although congress allows dod to spend up to the 14 billion requested by the administration to reimburse foreign military forces of key cooperating nations for their military and logistical support in the global war on 17 the 2 billion transfer limit allows dod to transfer up to 43 of the 469 billion in the supplemental that is appropriated to regular accounts transfer out of the iraq freedom fund are not subject to this limit the limit on

expenditure of these funds by july 1 2003 if dod does not provide the financial plan any unobligated funds for coalition support will revert to the treasury as the administration proposed dod must get the concurrence of the secretary of state and consult with the office of management and budget about these transfers21 the 14 billion provided is substantially more than the 490 million dod already received in the two previous supplemental giving dod additional funding to use to work out cooperative relationships with foreign militaries in addition congress caps dods total spending for coalition support at 14 billion in the fy2003 supplemental plus the 490 million previously appropriated for these purposes in earlier supplementals pl 107206 and pl 10711722 according to the dod request some of these funds are to reimburse pakistan for patrolling its borders to search for terrorists and some for jordan other nations and could be used within iraq dods plans may become clearer when it submits its financial plan to congress on july 1 200323 appropriating funds to reimburse dod for military equipment already provided to afghanistan from its stocks was not controversial because these actions were endorsed in previous legislation24 dod support of regular and irregular foreign military forces another tool that dod requested to help establish cooperative relationships with foreign military forces was 150 million in funding for support of irregular or indigenous forces controversial proposal this request was rejected by both houses and not included in the final version in response to dods request for 50 million to support regular foreign military forces the enacted supplemental permits dod to spend up to 25 million and restricts the funding to counterterrorism training in addition

change as follows for equipment from 7 million to 10 million for joint exercises from 1 million to 10 million and 26 for military education and training from 1 million to 10 million congress also expands the funding available for the secretary of defense for emergencies and extraordinary expenses from the current 345 million limit to 50 million less than the doubling requested according to dods justification materials these funds could be used for joint warfighting capabilities in support of military operations in iraq and the global war on terrorism activities that could involve initiatives in support of either us or foreign militaries27 increasing compensation for war duty in the enacted supplemental congress increases imminent danger pay and family separation allowances for those forces deployed for the iraqi conflict an increase in compensation that was not proposed by dod based on the stevensdurbin amendment that was unanimously adopted in the senate samdt 436 as modified combat pay increases 50 from 150 month to 225 month and family separation allowances increases 150 from 100 month to 250 month retroactively to the beginning of fy2003 these increases are intended to provide additional compensation for military personnel including activated reservists for their service in the iraq war senator durbin who originally proposed higher levels emphasized that these levels have not been adjusted since 1991 after the first gulf war in 1991 the levels adopted represent compromise between higher levels originally proposed by senator durbin and those offered by senator stevens28 these higher levels could offset some of the difficulties experienced by activated reservists serving longer than anticipated tours an issue of concern to congress29 cost estimates for this change range from 650 million to 825 million for fy2003 although this change is only in effect for fy2003 the armed services 26 see section 1304 in hrept 10876 p 9 27 see section 1305 in

new natural resources risk remediation account and also requested flexibility to use any foreign contributions either to this new fund or to the defense cooperation account that was set up during the first gulf war funds in the defense cooperation account can be transferred to the new account in the enacted version congress agrees to provide the 4893 million for new natural resources risk remediation account to repair and rebuild iraqs oil wells and facilities before spending these funds dod is to use any foreign contributions to this fund or from the defense cooperation account dod would not need to return to congress for specific appropriation of any foreign contributions reversal of the requirement in current law that requirement was adopted after the first gulf war to ensure congressional monitoring of foreign contributions31 the scope of foreign contributions to iraqi reconstruction is currently unclear in addition to the amounts requested for the new account the administration requested 24 billion for iraq relief and reconstruction fund with the president having discretion about who would manage these funds see section reconstruction efforts below from administration actions it appears that dod may play major role in managing these funds established by the president in january 2003 as the nerve center of us postwar activities the new office of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance was placed within the department of defense and is headed by lt general jay m garner ret who reports to general tom franks the commander of the us central command and the secretary of defense32 although responsibilities for reconstruction activities remain unclear the role of the state department and usaid appears to be less than in the past short and longterm costs and effects of the war during recent press conference dod comptroller dov zakheim suggested that the 626 billion for dod would be adequate to fund dods costs for the war in fy2003 based on the estimates provided at that press conference the cost of the iraq war for dod 30 estimate cited by senator stevens in the congressional record april 2 2003 p s4662 and p s4676 and higher dod

the adequacy of the supplemental may depend on how many us troops need to be kept in iraq now that hostilities have ended assessing the adequacy of the supplemental for the remainder of the year or the potential cost in fy2004 is difficult because dod has not provided its assumptions about troop levels that may become possible when dod submits reports of its expenditures for the war as well as financial plan covering all of fy200334 recently the pentagon suggested that the us may need to keep 125000 troops in iraq for the next year35 33 crs calculations based on dod transcript of under

deployed troops for fy2003 in pl 1087 congress set floor of 11 billion for fuel costs due to higher prices compared to the 430 million assumed by dod in its request f congress allocated 17 billion more for military personnel than dod included in its request see hrept 10856 p 10 however if dods estimates are correct and the funding is not needed dod can transfer the funds elsewhere for the longterm the chief cost issue is likely to be the number of troops who remain in iraq according to recent study if us troop levels declined from level of 75000 in the first year to 25000 by the third year the fiveyear cost of that crs21 occupation force would be 45 billion36 unlike the experience in bosnia and kosovo it is unlikely that the us will share these costs with other countries37 some observers have also suggested that keeping significant numbers of troops in iraq could also affect the readiness of us forces by putting strains on us forces both actives and reserves those effects are however difficult to measure and could be offset to some extent by the elimination of patrolling of iraqi airspace in operations northern watch and southern watch missions that have been carried on for the past ten years previous congressional action the sections below give details on previous action in the house and senate floor debate in the house and senate during floor debate on the fy2003 supplemental the house did not adopt any amendments affecting the department of defense during floor debate the senate added an amendment that increased imminent danger pay from 150 to 225 per month and increased family separation allowances from 100 to 250 per month changes that were retained in the conference version the senate also adopted the allard amendment samdt 451 establishing seven member panel to review and report to the secretary of defense and the armed services committees within 90 days about the effectiveness of policy and actions taken at the air force academy in response to allegations about sexual assaults38 this amendment was included in the final version more controversial senate amendment adopted by the senate but dropped during conference was the stevens amendment to make certain improvements samdt 522 including provision that would prohibit any funding in the bill going to airlift contracts to any firm that is not us controlled39 sense of the senate amendment offered by senator hollings samdt 479 that would require the president to submit proposal to raise revenues to pay for the cost of the fy2003 supplemental was rejected 79 to 1840 both the house and the senate supported the funding requested by the administration but provided different ways to increase congressional oversight about the allocation of those funds see discussion below 36

recommended appropriations of 62464 billion and the senate appropriations committee sac recommended 62559 billion both close to the 62587 billion requested by the administration both committees however devised different ways to restrict funds to specific accounts rather than providing the bulk of the funds in the defense emergency response fund as requested by the administration in some cases the appropriators also added notification requirements before obligation of funds or reporting requirements after funds are spent see below compared to the administrations request for flexibility for 599 billion the house version gave flexibility in the use of 254 billion as long as dod stayed within certain ceilings while the senate distributed all but 110 billion of the funds in the derf to specific appropriation accounts at the same time the house version required sevenday advance notification for transfers from the new fund while the senate permitted dod to allocate those funds with quarterly afterthefact reporting as proposed by the administration house appropriations committee hac limits house appropriators established new operation iraqi freedom response fund totaling 597 billion within that fund the hac allocated funds by setting limits on dods subsequent transfers to various appropriations accounts for 343 billion in funding appropriating 26 billion into specific accounts and setting up third category for 25 4 billion for the later stages of the war where dod would have flexibility to allocate funds as long as it stayed within various floors and ceilings set in the bill under the hacs transfer limits dod could spend less than or equal to the ceilings for specific appropriation accounts outlined in the bill see table 2b above41 the house appropriators allocated 17 billion more than the administration requested for military personnel accounts based on their belief that the services would need additional amounts to cover such expenses as imminent danger pay family separation allowances and the cost of mobilizing reservists42 within the new operation iraqi freedom response fund the hac set aside 254 billion that would be available for combat stability operations and force reconstitution costs new category included in the bill and required 7day advance notification to congress of dods transfers of these funds to individual appropriation accounts this category appeared to cover costs that would occur later in the war or during an occupation phase within this 254 billion category the house appropriators reserved 4 billion that dod could not spend until july 1 2003 for additional military personnel or defense health costs in 2003 set floor of 18 billion for classified programs 41 see hr 1559 as passed by the house and hrept 10855 p7 p23 42 hrept 10855 p 15p16 crs23 set ceiling on total operation and maintenance of 202 billion set ceiling on procurement of munitions and equipment of 42 billion set ceiling on rdte accounts of 57 million and set ceiling of 400 million for dod to transfer to the department of homeland security for coast guard operating expenses43 since the total funding for all the ceilings and floors in the bill was 307 billion over 5 billion more than the 254 billion reserved for combat stability operations and force reconstitution costs dod would have had to fund some accounts below the ceilings senate appropriations committee sac limits the senate appropriators reduced the administrations 599 billion request for the defense emergency response fund to 11 billion transferring the remaining 512 billion to other specific appropriations accounts based on discussions with dod the sac transferred funds that dod characterized as incurred costs for example for deployment of troops and equipment or setting up base camps see table 2 and table 2a below as well as other funds where expenses could be more predictable44 both house and senate appropriators provided amounts requested by the administration for counter drug activities in colombia 34 million and for reimbursement for drawdown in its funds and stocks for the afghan army for procurement the administrations request can only be broken out at the service level rather than by individual accounts the house and senate bills appear to distribute some of the 37 billion requested by the administration for munitions and equipment replenishment in procurement defensewide to individual services support of foreign military forces both the house and the senate appropriators agreed to the administrations request that 14 billion be made available for military and logistical support to pakistan jordan or other key cooperating nations in the war on terrorism but each house proposed different restrictions in addition to quarterly reporting on the use of funds the hac required 7day notification in advance and required that dod provide report within 30 days of enactment about their plans for using the funds or the funds would revert to the treasury the sac required 15day advance notification for use of these funds neither the house nor the senate approved the administrations request that the secretary of the defense be allowed to spend 150 million to support irregular or indigenous forces in response to the administrations request that the secretary of defense with the concurrence of the secretary of state be allowed to spend 50 million to support the regular forces of other nations who cooperate in the war on terrorism the senate approved the requested new authority with advance notification but the house did not include any provision for this funding 43 hr 1559 p 15 and hrept 10855 p 13 p 21 44 see s 762 as reported and srept 10833 p 7 p14 crs24 as requested appropriators in both houses gave the combatant commanders and the secretary of defense flexibility to use certain funds at their discretion both the hac and the sac recommended that the combatant commanders cincs be allowed to double from 25 million to 50 million the amount that they could spend from the cinc initiative fund that could be used to support either us or foreign military forces the hac and the sac also agreed with the administrations request to increase the amount available to the secretary of defense to spend at his discretion for emergency and extraordinary expenses the house increased the ceiling from 345 million to 690 million as requested and the senate agreed to raise the amount to 450 million use of defense cooperation account and natural resources risk remediation account in response to dods request to be able to use immediately any foreign contributions to the defense cooperation account originally set up to receive donations from foreign nations in the first gulf war both the hac and the sac set conditions on use of any contributions the hac required prior approval of any transfers from the fund to an appropriation account the sac retained current statute which requires that contributions be appropriated in subsequent appropriations acts before dod can use the funds both the hac and the sac approved the 489 million for the new natural resources risk remediation account to cover the cost of firefighting and repair of iraqi oil wells see below for use of foreign contributions the sac agreed to allow dod to use any contributions without restrictions the hac however required prior approval of any transfers of contributions request for higher total on transfers in response to the administrations request that the total amount that dod can transfer annually between appropriations accounts be raised from 2 billion to almost 9 billion the hac retained the current ceiling and the sac capped transfers at 35 billion per year administration request to maximize flexibility the defense departments fy2003 supplemental requested almost all of its 626 billion in funding in the defense emergency response fund derf transfer account proposals to maximize flexibility although most of dods funding in the fy2002 supplemental for afghanistan and enhanced security was also provided in the derf transfer account based on the same rationale that dod needed flexibility in its efforts to combat terrorism after september 11th attacks the 11 billion in funding was substantially smaller than the current request dod also requested various changes to existing law to increase its flexibility to provide aid to foreign militaries and to transfer funds between accounts ceilings within derf account to place some limits on the 626 billion requested in the derf dod proposed ceilings and floors within the derf account in the categories below crs25 cap of 37 billion for munitions replenishment cap of 10 billion for procurement and rdte necessary for war with iraq and global war on terrorism cap of 50 million to support the military operations of foreign nations and floor of 53346 billion for military operations in iraq and the global war on terrorism it is not clear however how these caps or floors could be enforced because the categories were not defined according to dod the 599 billion in the derf appropriation account was intended to cover costs incurred in the war with iraq deployment of forces and equipment and redeployment costs when they return dods estimated costs of short but extremely intense war repair and replenishment of equipment and munitions damaged or used during the war mobilization of reserve forces and some rdte as well as other expenses for the war on terrorism45 as in the fy2002 supplemental dod provided illustrative allocations of derf funds but these allocations were not binding see table 2c above funds for coalition support continuing practice begun in the fy2002 supplemental dod is requested 14 billion in the operation and maintenance defense wide account to fund coalition support according to dod that support would include payments of 13 billion to pakistan jordan and countries providing logistical support to the us in afghanistan and payments of 1 billion for logistical support to those supporting military operations in iraq the proposed language did not bind dod to any specific amounts for individual countries as in the fy2002 supplemental the proposed language required that the secretary of defense consult with the director of omb and receive concurrence from the secretary of state before providing funds to allies the current proposal did not however include the 15day notification to congressional committees before making payments that was included in the fy2002 supplemental46 new natural resource remediation fund dod requested 4893 million for new transfer fund the natural resource remediation fund for emergency fire fighting repairing damage to oil facilities and infrastructure and preserving distribution capability and ensuring availability of fuel to the iraqi people the fund was also to also receive foreign contributions some observers were 45 department of

httpwwwwhitehousegovombbudgetamendmentssupplemental_3_25_03pdf crs26 concerned about the nature and extent of dods role including the potential for mission creep the expansion of dods role beyond its traditional missions dod also proposed that any contributions to the defense cooperation account set up after the first gulf war for foreign contributions would be considered to have been approved in the fy2003 supplemental appropriations act this proposal to give dod discretion in advance to use foreign contributions was not consistent with the practice in the past when congress approved the transfer of allied contributions to specific accounts requests in specific accounts dod requested funds total of 26 billion for specific accounts including 430 million to cover higher oil costs that dod experienced in the early months of the year because of the initial spike in oil prices related to the war funding for several military construction projects in guantanamo and at several undisclosed locations overseas an additional 34 million for counter drug activities in colombia 34 million is also provided for the andean counter drug initiative in the state department section and 165 million for reimbursement to the services for expenses already incurred in training and equipping the afghan army as well as assisting jordan proposed changes to current law to increase dod flexibility dod requested several changes to current law to increase dods management flexibility contending that such changes are necessary to allow dod to adapt quickly to the demands of the war on terrorism several controversial proposals included two proposals to permit the secretary of defense to provide monies to regular foreign militaries and to irregular indigenous forces two proposals to increase the amounts available to combatant commanders and the secretary of defense to respond to unanticipated expenses where funds could be used to provide support to foreign military forces and large increase from 2 billion to about 9 billion in the ceiling set on the total amount of funds that could be transferred between appropriations providing aid to regular and irregular foreign forces the supplemental request also included general provision that would have allowed dod to use up to 150 million of funding in the supplemental to support indigenous forces assisting us operations in support of the global war on terrorism the provision was intended to clarify dods authority to promote military cooperation crs27 in the global war on terrorism47 see additional discussion in section on foreign operations within the derf account dod also proposed that up to 50 million could be used to support the regular military forces of foreign nations to further the global war on terrorism as long as the secretary of state concurred with the secretary of defense in providing funds according to dod this new provision would have enabled dod to provide aid to foreign forces rapidly in response to emerging unanticipated emergency requirements48 the request also raised the total amount available to the combatant commanders in the commanders in chiefs cinc initiative fund from 25 million to 50 million this fund is available to combatant commanders for wide variety of activities including not only training and selected operations of us military personnel but also education training and personnel expenses of foreign defense personnel in cooperative programs49 to increase dods flexibility in carrying out these purposes the supplemental request also proposed raising the limits that currently apply to purchases from 7 million to 15 million to payments to foreign countries participating in exercises from 1 million to 10 million and to military education and training of foreign nationals from 2 million to 10 million50 all these proposals would have given dod additional authority to reimburse foreign military forces for expenses including procurement personnel costs and exercises although the secretary of defense would need the concurrence of the secretary of state in order to spend the additional 200 million in funding 50 million for regular foreign forces and 150 million for irregular forces the request did not provide mechanism for congressional oversight of these activities before they occur the administrations proposal did include afterthefact reporting

ceiling set on the total amount of funds that can be transferred between appropriation accounts after enactment from 2 billion to about 9 billion52 dod reprograms or shifts funds between appropriation accounts after enactment to reflect changes in priorities dod stated that this additional flexibility along with lifting of the midyear deadline on reprogramming requests would help dod to respond to emerging requirements particularly in iraq53 in the enacted bill congress provides 2 billion in transfer authority for funds in the fy2003 supplemental allocation of dod funding by phase of operations dod provided breakout of the 626 billion according to several phases of operations as shown in table 4 below in its justification material and recent press statements dod characterized the 303 billion of expenses for coercive diplomacy as incurred expenses coercive diplomacy almost half of the 303 billion was for personnel expenses including activation of reservists and special pay for activeduty military in combat and support of those personnel for both the iraqi conflict afghanistan and enhanced security in the united states another 7 billion was for the deployment and redeployment of personnel to and from the theater major conflict dods estimate of the cost of the war itself appeared to assume short intense conflict of about month using plans for deployments and military operations developed by the combatant commanders dod estimated these costs relying on model developed in the mid1990s for contingency operations54 assumptions about these plans underlay dods estimates of costs transitional and stability dod included its postwar operational costs in this category including funding to repair iraqi oil facilities and lower intensity operations that may include the operational costs of an occupation force the initial size and possible phase down of this force was not specified 51 see omb transmittal to speaker of the house j dennis hastert fy2003 supplemental

allocation of dod funding by major type of expense although dods justification materials included illustrative allocations of expenses to be covered in the derf account by appropriation account these allocations were not binding and could be changed in response to the course of the war in iraq or changes in dod priorities table 5 shows these potential allocations personnel and personnel support personnel costs accounted for much of the total cost of the war in iraq continued expenses in afghanistan and enhanced security in the united states they reflected both increases in overall strength levels of activeduty military and activation of reservists the expense breakdown below did not however show either the number of reservists that dod plans to activate over the rest of the fiscal year or the allocation of personnel among the different missions funded in the supplemental or the types of tasks that these personnel carry out starting in january 2003 dod rapidly increased the number of reservists being called up for the iraqi war before the buildup about 50000 to 55000 reservists were on activeduty to provide support for operations in afghanistan or enhanced security in the united states decrease from the 80000 called up in the months after the september 11th attacks the current level of activated reservists is over 200000 according to the defense department dods estimates of cost in table 5 are built on assumptions about the number of reservists needed during the war with iraq and for the occupation force that would remain afterwards but those numbers are not provided in its justification material military operation support according to various sources dod anticipated short intense war of about one month which would be roughly consistent with the 14 billion in operating support shown below this estimate was considerably higher than recent cbo estimate of 10 billion based on current force levels55 dods estimated cost of 100 million reflected its expectation

billion for nearterm iraq reconstruction and relief additional aid to coalition partners and other states cooperating in the global war on terrorism and related state department and usaid administrative expenses most of the funds 76 billion fell under the jurisdiction of foreign operations appropriations programs by comparison the supplemental request totaled little less than half of the 162 billion appropriated previously by congress for fy2003 foreign operations activities the proposal as detailed below in table 5 was roughly divided into two components iraq relief and reconstruction about 285 billion56 and aid to coalition partners and other nations engaged in the war on terrorism about 47 billion reconstruction efforts under the administrations plan the bulk of iraqi reconstruction funds would be deposited in special iraq relief and reconstruction fund which would be managed by the white house out of this 244 billion fund resources would be drawn and transferred to implementing agencies to pay the costs of immediate humanitarian relief and reconstruction activities over 12month period following the end of hostilities normally it would be presumed that transfers for reconstruction and post conflict aid would be made to usaid the state department and other traditional foreign assistance management agencies but with plans for the defense department to oversee the governing of iraq immediately after the end of hostilities the white house wanted to have maximum flexibility over the distribution of resources so the president could transfer some or all of the funding to dod the proposal stimulated immediate controversy with number of critics including members of congress arguing that aid programs should remain under the policy direction of the state department and under the authorities of broad and longstanding body of foreign aid laws they pointed out that during other recent reconstruction initiatives in bosnia and kosovo resources and policy decisions flowed through the secretary of state others argued that groups which would play significant role in postwar rehabilitation efforts nongovernmental organizations ngos foreign donors and international organizations would be reluctant to take direction and funding from the us military this they contended would hamper relief activities57 56 omb documents estimate the total amount for iraq reconstruction was 35 billion figure that included nearly 500 million from dod funding for the repair of oil facilities 57 see for example us bureaucratic battle over postwar aid to iraq heats up agence continued crs34 furthermore the placement of reconstruction funding in presidential account appeared to grant the white house significant discretion in responding to changing and unanticipated demands unencumbered by specific programmatic allocations the administration said only that 543 million would cover humanitarian expenses 17 billion would be set aside for reconstruction needs and up to 200 million would be available to reimburse foreign aid accounts from which funds were drawn prior to conflict according to administration documents reconstruction funds would focus initially on the most urgent needs to restore minimal services to the iraqi population emphasis would be placed on rebuilding water and sanitation capacity restoring public health facilities refurbishing seaports and airports in order to move humanitarian supplies into the country reestablishing food distribution system and generating emergency electricity following this early stage the white house plan called reconstructing broad economic and institutional capacity this second phase would target the restoration of roads schools hospitals markets irrigation systems and electrical generation together with the construction of framework within which to operate education economic agriculture and good governance institutions apart from the relief and reconstruction fund the administration also sought 200 million to replenish refugee disaster and other economic aid accounts that had already financed the costs of food and other commodities portion of these funds would also bolster the size of humanitarian accounts so that future borrowings from other aid sources to meet the needs in iraq would be minimized the state department and usaid further requested appropriations to establish safe and secure temporary facilities in iraq and to eventually build an embassy and aid mission in baghdad congressional action on iraq reconstruction as cleared by congress hr 1559 appropriates 2475 billion for the relief and reconstruction fund slightly higher requested the president will be able to apportion fund resources directly to five federal agencies the departments of defense state health and human services and treasury and usaid in previous congressional debate the house and senate had each expressed their expectations that these funds would be channeled to the secretary of state and in most instances further directed to usaid the report accompanying s 762 specifically noted that the funds were not expected to be transferred to the secretary of defense nevertheless the white house continued to argue for greater flexibility and authority to place reconstruction resources under dod auspices and ultimately conference committee members agreed the enacted legislation however specifies that the iraq fund will fall under the authorities of the foreign assistance act of 1961 and that congress will be notified five days in advance of any obligation of amounts from the fund further these advance notifications will be reviewed under the same terms as regular foreign aid notifications to the appropriation committees process through which

preposition food and medicine stocks in the region and for other preconflict humanitarian purposes the conference agreement directs full and prompt reimbursement of usaid and state department accounts from the iraq fund the supplemental provides 1438 million for international disaster assistance 1125 million of which will restore funds diverted previously for iraq the remaining balance will augment usaid disaster relief resources to respond to foreign contingencies that may arise through the end of fy2003 similarly congress increased the state departments refugee reserve account from the 50 million requested to 80 million in order to address needs in the persian gulf region as well as other global requirements hr 1559 also includes 369 million to reimburse food aid accounts from which commodities for iraq were drawn this includes 69 million to replenish stocks in the bill emerson humanitarian trust the house had added 250 million additional food aid while the senate by way of an amendment by senator kohl had recommended 600 million in total the enacted legislation provides roughly 920 million for reimbursing these foreign aid accounts more than double the administrations 410 million request international assistance the supplemental appropriation proposal would have provided about 47 billion in additional aid to 23 countries and regional programs that are contributing to the war in iraq and cooperating in the global fight against terrorism table 6 provides complete list of proposed recipients among the largest and most complex aid packages would be jordan 700 million in economic grants and 406 million in military transfers this would be on top of jordans regular 452 aid package from the us israel 1 billion in supplemental military aid on top of the 27 billion regular fy2003 assistance and 9 billion in economic loans guaranteed by the us government over the next three years israel would pay all costs fees that may total several hundred of million dollars associated with these economic stabilization loans conditions on the loans similar to those that were applied in the early 1990s when israel drew on 10 billion usbacked loan package would be employed turkey 1 billion for economic grants which could be applied to fees associated with 85 billion in direct loans or loan guarantees afghanistan 325 million in economic grants antiterrorism demining and military transfers this would be in addition to roughly 350 million already scheduled for afghanistan this year egypt 300 million for economic grants portion of which could be used to gain access to up to 2 billion in loan guarantees depending on the terms of the loan if egypt chose to receive the full 2 billion about 120 million or more of the 300 million would be applied to the costs faced by the united states of guaranteeing the crs41 loans the administration further proposes to reprogram 3796 million in previously appropriated commodity import program aid to egypt as cash transfer the supplemental would come on top of 19 billion in regular us aid to egypt pakistan 200 million in military grants and law enforcement assistance pakistan currently receives 305 million in fy2003 the administration further requested 150 million to initiate us emergency fund for complex emergencies contingency account that would allow the president to address quickly unforseen needs of coalition partners the fund which would be managed by the white house had originally been proposed for an fy2004 startup of 100 million congressional action on international assistance hr 1559 as approved includes 452 billion in additional aid to countries and regional programs about 180 million less than requested nearly all of this reduction however comes from congress decision not to fund the presidents 150 million emergency account for complex crises in most other cases the administration will be able to allocate these foreign aid resources has it had intended congress earmarked funding at the requested levels for israel egypt jordan and pakistan while adding resources for afghanistan and the philippines see table 6 turkey may receive not to exceed 1 billion aid that is conditioned on requirement for the secretary of state to certify that turkey is cooperating with the united states in operation iraqi freedom including the facilitation of moving humanitarian aid into iraq and has not unilaterally deployed forces in northern iraq the restriction on turkeys aid package the size of which could grow to 85 billion if the loan option is implemented combines text in house and senatepassed bills earlier the house had defeated two amendments that would have eliminated aid to turkey or reduced it by 207 million for israeli loan guarantees the enacted supplemental includes the full 9 billion proposal but adds conditions not included in the proposal loans may be issued in 3 billion allotments in each of fy2003 to fy2005 provision that will allow the president to reduce disbursements in the second and third years israel violate any of the loan conditions one such condition added by congress prohibits loan resources from supporting any activity in geographic areas that were not administered by israel prior to june 5 1967 this is similar to condition attached to the 1992 10 billion loan guaranty package for israel some of which was not disbursed because of

appropriation provides 167 million c the enacted supplement appropriation includes 30 million for philippine economic aid d following enacted of the supplemental the administration has modified its plans to allocate funds for this recipient see footnote i in table 6 above for the allocated amounts although most of the presidents request for international assistance is supported in the enacted emergency supplemental the administration had to reduce economic assistance in one instance congress cut economic support fund appropriations by 20 million but because earmarks and additions for afghanistan the philippines and 10 million to investigate possible iraqi leadership war crimes crs43 executive officials had 100 million less than requested in economic assistance for countries not protected by legislative directives nonearmarked programs included 50 million for the palestinians 25 million for djibouti and 200 million for the middle east partnership initiative the administration chose to fully allocate amounts for the palestinians and djibouti but cut resources for the middle east partnership initiative including muslim outreach to 100 million half of the level requested the state department also chose to modify its distribution of military aid grants to several central europe states most significantly the executive branch decided to add funds not requested for albania macedonia and ukraine and increase amounts above the requested levels for estonia latvia lithuania and bulgaria as offsets the state department cut funds for hungary and eliminated the 5 million request for slovenia see footnote i in table 6 above for specific amounts allocated to each recipient key issues regarding iraq reconstruction and international assistance the proposed supplemental raised number of issues and concerns including those focusing on the extent of executive flexibility sought by the president how much more iraq reconstruction might cost and whether these demands would erode funding for other foreign aid priorities whether the purposes and amounts of country assistance were appropriate and whether dods request for authority and funds to aid indigenous forces was consistent with traditional us military assistance programs managed by the state department executive flexibility and congressional oversight throughout the supplemental request in both the defense and iraq reconstructioninternational assistance sections the president sought authorities that would maximize flexibility in responding to fluid and rapidly changing demands among the most significant authorities affecting the use of foreign aid funds were iraq relief and reconstruction fund the administrations budget justification for the white house managed 244 billion fund offered only broad purposes for which the money would be used and divided the money into three general categories iraq reconstruction plans submitted by the state department to congress offered some details on specific sectors how the us would respond and the timing of actions over the next year funding amounts for each activity however were not provided as is usually the case with foreign aid justifications moreover since the funds would be appropriated into presidential fund it would be possible for the white house delegate the resources to any agency including the defense department for reconstruction implementation as noted above this prospect of dod management raised disputes within the administration and the american international ngo community with critics arguing that it would be inappropriate for the military to control civilian operation the proposal to establish central fund crs44 most closely resembled how the administration programmed us relief for victims of hurricane mitch in central america in 1999 and bosnia reconstruction efforts in 1996 in both cases congress appropriated money into special funds but placed them under the control of usaid and added numerous directives over how portions of resources should be used and various notifications for informing congress in advance of committing the money moreover the supplemental request for the relief and reconstruction fund would make the appropriations available notwithstanding any provision of law this would remove any of the numerous restrictions and conditions that generally apply to us foreign assistance including provisions relating to human rights proliferation government legitimacy contract negotiations among others waivers of these restrictions are generally applied only to humanitarian programs congress rejected similar request last year for supplemental economic and military aid to the frontline states in the war on terrorism us emergency fund for complex crises for many years administrations have asked congress for various types of contingency resources that can be drawn upon immediately to address unanticipated foreign policy emergencies except in the case of humanitarian situations however congress has been reluctant to support such requests stating that the president has other mechanisms and special authorities for temporarily borrowing funds from other aid accounts over which congress can more closely maintain scrutiny and consult in advance as the purposes of the transfers the presidents 100 million fy2004 request to create the crises fund had already raised concerns among some members during hearings on next years budget request transfer of funds among different accounts the supplemental proposed that up to 200 million of international assistance state department money and the iraq relief and reconstruction fund could be transferred between the accounts for any purpose longstanding foreign aid laws place percentage caps on the amount that can be taken from most accounts 10 and how much the receiving account can increase 2058 annual foreign operations appropriations further require the president to consult and justify the transfer in advance with house and senate appropriations committees in some circumstances the administrations supplemental proposal could have resulted in transfers exceeding the percentage caps the request further did not require any congressional notification or consultation as noted above the enacted supplemental establishes the relief and reconstruction fund proposed by the president but with added oversight 58 section 610 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 crs45 mechanisms put in place while the president may apportion resources directly to dod as well as the departments of state treasury health and human resources and usaid the iraq fund falls under the authority of existing foreign aid laws hr 1559 also adds several reporting requirements as mentioned above and requires notification 5 days in advance of any fund obligations the enacted supplemental further deletes appropriations for the presidents emergency fund for foreign crises and limits to 100 million the amount that can be transferred among the various aid accounts costs of iraq reconstruction and the impact on other aid programs like the costs of military operations it is nearly impossible to estimate what the longerterm expenses of humanitarian relief and reconstruction in iraq will be the administrations 35 billion included in the supplemental request represented general projection of needs over the next 12 months but state department activity justifications cautioned that the timetable was tentative dependent largely on the extent of damage that resulted from the conflict and how future assessments might alter aid priorities some believed that reconstruction needs beyond this initial allotment would be met largely through proceeds from the sale of iraqi oil and the release of frozen assets the international aid community is currently discussing how postconflict relief efforts will proceed but there is great deal of uncertainty over the administrations intentions and the actual final outcome how soon and in what amounts iraq might gain access to borrowing from the international financial institutions will also be factor in how much additional resources will be needed or expected from the united states59 in the meantime usaid and the state department have been drawing resources for iraq from emergency refugee and disaster relief accounts and from other economic aid programs that had been intended for other countries and purposes as of march 25 usaid had utilized an estimated 506 million including drawdowns from the child survival and health csh development assistance da and economic support fund esf accounts for child survival and development programs amounts diverted to iraq contingency activities represented nearly 8 of fy2003 appropriations the supplemental request included about 410 million for either replenishing chh da and esf accounts or increasing disaster and refugee resources so that future borrowings might be avoided and adequate funds would be available for contingencies that might arise later in the year in other regions but the supplemental did not appear to fully cover usaid transfers already made for iraq programs moreover the supplemental provided up to 200 million may be used out of the relief and reconstruction fund to repay these accounts this discretionary language left the final decision up to the white house as to whether these funds would be available for the purposes and programs for which they were originally intended 59 for more discussion of these issues see crs report rl31814 humanitarian issues in postwar iraq an overview for congress crs report rl31759 reconstruction assistance in afghanistan goals priorities and issues for congress and crs report rl31833 iraq recent developments in humanitarian and reconstruction assistance crs46 the conference agreement on hr 1559 adds substantial amounts as noted above for replenishing foreign aid accounts from which money has been drawn for iraq operations the enacted supplemental provides over 900 million to restore funds for several programs including the addition of 369 million in food assistance that had not been requested country assistance the administration asked not only for funds to assist coalition partners and nations that face significant economic and political risks due to the iraq conflict but also to augment support for broader set of countries cooperating in the global war on terrorism some questioned whether supplemental appropriation intended to provide resources specifically related to the iraq situation should include nearly 700 million for this latter group especially since congress approved in midfebruary fy2003 money for this purpose pl 1087 among the countries covered by the request but which are outside the conflict in iraq were afghanistan the administration proposed 325 million to meet immediate shortfalls in afghanistans fy2003 program including resources for the kabulkandahrherat road budget support for the afghan government president karzais protective detail demining and military training and equipment costs although the administration did not submit an official fy2003 afghan aid request congress increased assistance to over 300 million pakistan the supplemental proposed an additional 175 million in military aid to strengthen pakistans ability to track and disable terrorists operating in its own territory and 25 million for better border security colombia included in the supplemental request was 71 million in military and counternarcotics assistance for supporting colombias unified campaign against drug cartels and terrorists the proposal also included an additional 34 million of dod funds for narcotics interdiction operations in the fy2003 foreign operations appropriation congress approved 700 million for the andean counternarcotics initiative for colombia and other countries in the region 31 million less than the president had requested palestinians the request would extend 50 million to support middle east peace objectives generally and specifically for humanitarian activities in the west bank and gaza and for palestinian civil reforms congress had appropriated in august 2002 similar 50 million package together with 200 million for israel in the fy2002 supplemental appropriation president bush chose not to spend the funds because they were part of much larger appropriation for programs he had not requested instead he amended the fy2003 foreign operations request to include the palestinian and israeli funds but congress did not increase overall appropriations to accommodate these additions crs47 philippines the 30 million in military support would allow the philippines to upgrade its counterterrorism capabilities like the palestinian funds above congress provided 30 million for the philippines in the fy2002 supplemental which the president chose not to spend slovenia not member of the coalition slovenia would receive 5 million in military assistance in recognition of its efforts in providing access and overflight rights in operating enduring freedom and contributing to the afghan national army and demining program beyond this list some questioned the administrations 1 billion request for turkey that could be converted into as much as 85 billion in loans the united states had negotiated with the turkish government for months over allowing the deployment of us forces in turkey for military operations for second front in norther iraq reportedly the united states offered 6 billion aid package that could be leveraged into 26 billion in combined grants and loans on march 1 however the turkish parliament rejected the us request to base troops for operations in iraq and the united states withdrew the aid offer turkeys government has subsequently granted us overflight rights for the iraq campaign the administration justifies the 1 billion request on the basis of turkeys role as an ally and frontline state in the war on terrorism and for the significant political and economic risks faced by ankara due to the iraq conflict as noted above the enacted supplemental for the most part supports the presidents foreign aid allocations for requested countries conditions are added to funds for turkey but amendments to eliminate or reduce the 1 billion package failed in the house hr 1559 as approved however will require the administration to make some economic aid reductions for some countries and programs not earmarked possibly including those for the palestinians djibouti turkey or the middle east partnership initiative dod authorities to provide military aid under sections relating to defense department funds and authorities the supplemental proposed two items that drew particular congressional attention the key issue was whether they infringed on congressional oversight and the state departments traditional role in directing foreign aid policy and resource allocations they were both similar to proposals made last year in the fy2002 supplemental that focused on the war on terrorism and were closely scrutinized by congress the first would provide 14 billion for the defense department notwithstanding any provision of law to pay jordan pakistan and other nations that have provided logistical and militaryrelated support to us military operations in iraq or in the global war on terrorism in the past defense officials argue competing demands on regular military aid resources have delayed reimbursement to key friends that provide services to american forces congress approved funding in the fy2002 supplemental for this purpose but included 15day prior notification requirement that is not part of the fy2003 supplemental draft legislation crs48 the more controversial authority concerned dods request for 150 million to support indigenous forces assisting us military operations including those aimed at the global war on terrorism decisions to draw on these funds would be made by the secretary of defense with the concurrence of the secretary of state the defense department defines indigenous forces as irregular forces and resistance movements and notes that such forces generally conduct military and paramilitary operations in enemyheld or hostile territory and conduct direct offensive low intensity cover or clandestine operations60 although it was unclear from the budget justification and bill text exactly what groups and under what scenarios the administration would utilize these resources senior administration official suggested that the intent was to have resources available for groups in iraq deputy secretary richard armitage testified on march 27 that because of the uncertainty of the wars duration it might be necessary to transfer additional arms and equipment for kurdish and other forces and that the 150 million would provide hedge in case of more prolonged conflict61 in last years supplemental appropriation debate dod had asked for 30 million to support indigenous forces funds that would be exclusively under the control of the secretary of defense congress rejected the proposal however the house appropriations committee observed in deleting the request that the secretary of states primary responsibility over us military assistance programs is well established and that the administration has the necessary authorities under existing foreign aid laws to undertake the requested activities62 hr 1559 as enacted provides the 14 billion for nations supporting us military operations in the global war on terrorism but does not authorize the 150 million for aid to indigenous forces homeland security the smallest component of the supplemental proposal covered additional resources for homeland security some critics of administration homeland security policy including some members of congress believe that key domestic preparedness measures have been underfunded and argue for additional resources in

interoperable communications fema and cops70 number of observers have argued that the current level of federal assistance for first responders is insufficient and should be increased above current funding levels other observers however point to evidence of slow state and local utilization of federal grants as an indication that additional funding at this time is not necessary71 still others have suggested that odps distribution formula should be adjusted to increase assistance to areas perceived to be highrisk72 the conference agreement addressed number of these concerns it instructed odp to distribute formula grant funds to states within 60 days of enactment and further instructed states to distribute 80 of funds to localities within 45 days of receipt similar requirements for distribution were applied to the other odp assistance programs conferees also adopted several reporting requirements in the senate bill s 762 these include reports on risk assessments of highthreat

the use of such funding to reimburse any federal agency for costs related to detaining terrorist suspect as well for the department of homeland securitys counterterrorism fund the administrations fy2003 supplemental request included 15 billion to reimburse any homeland security organization for counterterrorism investigations and operations including operations in support of the department of defense among other things such operations could include 1 increasing border and maritime security 2 enhancing elements of the strategic national stockpile 3 providing increased port security for military outloads and 4 deploying various biological attack detection technologies related countermeasures and response assets congressional action as reported by the senate appropriations committee s

funds among several department of justice programs including fbi salaries and construction state and local law enforcement assistance community oriented policing services and interagency law enforcement support the stevens amendment also took 1095 million of the presidents request for the counterterrorism fund and made it available for additional fema disaster relief operations the house measure appropriated 50 million for the fund and an additional 450 million for several other justice department programs including 399 million for the fbi for homeland security counterterrorism fund

suffered adverse reactions from voluntary smallpox vaccinations the administration also proposed 125 million emergency fund for the legislative branch to meet emerging terroristprevention needs congressional action house and senate bills split on the issue of white house emergency response fund s 762 provided 215 million within department of homeland security funds while the house did not include any resources for this purpose as enacted hr 1559 does not provide funding for white house emergency response fund but includes 150 million for the department of homeland securitys

effected the airline industry air travel in the short term has dropped approximately 10 according to the air transport association ata more worrisome for the airlines advance bookings for the months ahead appear to be dropping approximately 30 all of this is happening against the backdrop of the events of september 11th which also had huge negative impact on the industry the airlines lost record amounts of money in 2002 following what had been the previous record loss in 2001 among major airlines only southwest was profitable in 2002 and southwest is the only major carrier believed to have chance at profitability in 2003 the industrys second largest airline united is operating in receivership and the possibility exists that other carriers could find themselves in this position in the near future there is therefore considerable concern that the airline industry is likely to go through period of major structural change after september 11 congress and the bush administration moved swiftly to provide the airline industry with 15 billion in federal financial support air transportation safety and system stabilization act stabilization act pl 10742 the first 5 billion provided

supplemental congress again proposed providing some short term relief to the airline industry the houseapproved package totaled 32 billion in direct assistance while the senate proposed 35 billion as estimated by cbo both bills had the same intent but there were significant differences in how aid would be provided both the house and the senate measures included significant funding for security costs in addition s 762 would provide tax holiday for collections of the existing 250 per flight segment security fee charged to airline passengers the senate measure would also extend to the end of 2004 war risk insurance provisions in existing legislation that expire at the end of this year in addition the senate bill provided additional unemployment insurance to displaced airline industry employees both bills had provisions that would limit airline industry executive compensation the enacted emergency supplemental includes relief package estimated by cbo as totaling 31 billion for fy2003 conferees adopted the senate approach of direct appropriations plus authority to temporarily suspend fees and extend unemployment and war risk insurance as calculated by cbo the airline industry relief package breaks out as follows for fy2003 grants to us flag carriers for aviation security costs 2296 billion compensation to air carriers for secure cockpit doors 100 million
