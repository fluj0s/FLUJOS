department has investigated over 1400 allegations of misconduct it has 17 full time inve stigators most of whom have prosecutorial experience the department is headed by director who reports directly to the president of the bank the int functions much like prosecuto rs office except that it has subpoena authority according to i nvestigators they ma ke preliminary inquiry on all complaints and ascertain the credibility and seriousness of the issue and its importance to the bank in every case the inve stigators say they also attempt to identify the motive which prompted the complaint int must judge how important an allegation is and how one case should be prioritiz ed against other pending cases when complaint is found to be substantia ted the int submits its findings to the banks sanctions committee the sanctions committee has the authority to recommend to the president that firms or individuals be debarred from participation in future bank procurement since the sanctions committ ee was created in november 1998 81 firms and individuals have been barred int may recommend to the general counsel that the case be referred to appropriate national authorities the bank can also institute civil suit against alleged perpetrators also the ba nk can as authorized by provisions in its standard loan contracts require the borrower country to return all the money lent for project which has been tainted by corruption the bujagali case was unusual usually int investigates instances where the alleged corruption has already occurred in this case however the potentially corrupt situation was uncovered before any diversion of funds actually occurred the world bank group has not disbursed any money as ye t for the bujagali project and it appears that the work todate on the project is not covered by the ifc loan or the ida guarantee the overt act the alleged 10000 payment in 1999 to mr kaijuka by the veidekke subsidiary occurred before the norwegian firm was associated with the bujagali project when it was promoting competitive project int made legal referrals of the information it had uncovered to law enforcement officials in the four countries involved action seems to have been taken in the uk or norway ugandan officials report that they are pursuing case against mr kaijuka but progress has been complicated by difficulties acquiring evidence from norway the us department of justice has not reported the status of the case outstanding questions in terms of the world bank there seem to be two outstanding questions first should veide kke asa be debarred from future participation in world bank procurement second should the world bank proceed with the bujagali project in light of the continuing concerns and suspicions about possible corruption on debarment the world bank appears to have basis for sanctions against veidekke there is procedur allowing it to debar firm doing business with the ifc under ifc rules the borrower company has full discretion over the way funds are used to implement the approved project since it pres umably will wish to protect itself against illicit practices problems with ifc loans are not referred to the banks sanctions committee the ifc has other mechanisms and remedies it can use such as covenants in the contract to address possible instan ces of corruption the ida guarantee is also not sufficient link for the bujagali issue to be referred to the banks sanctionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21501crs5 7 world bank inspection panel investigation report uganda bujagali project june 17 2002 the report is available from the bank web site at http wwwworldba nkorg 8 in some instances paragraphs 52 and 53 for example the panel seems to believe that the project must comply with operational rules that were applicable to ida but not apparently to the ifc this is despite the fact that idas participation only took the form of guarantee 9 world bank uganda third power project fourth power project and buj agali hydropower project m anagement report and recommendations in response to the inspection panel report inspr200200021 june 7 2002 considered june 17 2002committee the banks procurement rules do not apply directly to the activities covered by the guarantee hence this case has not been referred to the sanctions committee the other question is whether the buja gali project can pro ceed in th face of concerns about potential corruption bank offi cials say it is important to distinguish between corrupt practices which compromise the merits of project and corrupt practices which do not the merits of the project w ould not be adversely affected by corrupt practices which influence c ountrys decision to seek an or its choice among equally good alternatives by contrast the merits of the project could be seriously compromised by corrupt practices which influence the technical design or adversely affect the technical financial institutional or operational analysis underlying the banks approval of the project plan bank officials say there is evidence that the alleged bribe to ugandan official had any effect on the design or the banks analysis of the bujagali loan proposal findings of the inspection panel in october 2001 seve ral months before it approved the bujagali project the worl d bank executive board asked the banks independent inspection panel to analyze the bujagali plan fina l action was suspended pending receipt of the panels report the report was submitted to the board in june 2002 it was critical of many of the procedures and the analysis used in assessing the bujagali project and related projects the ba nk had funded in uganda previously7 the panel found that the environmental ssessments underlying the bujagali project were of high quality it said however that some of the ifcs other bujagali environmental studies were inad equate and stronger steps s hould be taken to protect and conserve another site the kalagala falls offset it confirmed that the bujagali site was the most desirable site on th victoria nile for the next hydropower development it said though that more attenti on might have been given to lternatives such as geothermal generation rather than constr uction of an additional dam on that stretch of the nile8 the panel found that ifcs economic and financial appraisal of the bujagali project had been carried out with considerable technical skill it questioned thoug h if enough attention had been paid to alternatives and downside risks of the project and their mitigation the panel asked whether the relatively high price of the power to be generated by bujagali was consistent with the bank s poverty reduction goals it also questioned whether the power purchase agreement with the uganda n government was s oundly conceived since the price of power to consumers in uganda c ould increase substantially if the value of the countrys currency were to fall in future year s the panel identifie d several steps which might be taken to mitigate the risks associated with the project and to provide more flexibility in tariff rates for the bujagali projects electrical output bank management responded to the inspec tion panel report expressing strong confidence in the bujagali project9 management noted that the inspection panel agreed that the basic environmental impact assessm ents done in connection with the bujagalihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21501crs6 project were adequate it noted several other instances where the inspection panel found deficiencies however and it recommended to the executive board that certain actions be taken to meet those concerns the bank executive board accepted the management report and approved the proposed reme dial actions on june 17 2002 none of the problems in the bujagali project identified by the inspection panel seems relevant to the issue of corr uption or alleged bribes the panel seemed most concerned with questions of whether the ifc and ida complied with relevant bank rules in their preparation of the bujagali project it said that alternatives geothermal etc to some provisions of the bujagali plan should have been considered there is suggestion however that corrupt practices were involved or that the stre ngth or the integrity of the basic project design was compromised by corrupt practices or illicit concerns it is doubtful that the bujagali project can proceed without the miga guarantee for the export credit agencies in terms of the corruption issue however bank officials seem to believe that the project could go forwar d if stronger than normal requirements for financial oversight and more ri gorous warranties against corrupt practices are added to the ifc and ida contracts according to int the bank included these in draft contracts and aes reportedly agreed to them in january 2002 the final contracts have not yet been signed due to the delay in the miga proposal and the current uncertainties actions by the us government the world bank executive board was originally scheduled to consider the bujagali loan and guarantee proposal on december 13 2001 consideration was postponed until the 18th however to facilitate confidential discussions by the banks executive board on december 18 the bank executive board cons idered the bujagali project and approved the proposed ifc loans and ida guarantee the int subsequently briefed the us executive director and us offi cials concerning its investig ation in january and february 2002 the world bank referred the corruption llegations to the us department of justice and to legal officials in norway britain and uganda treasury officials say that they received assurances from world bank management in december 2001 that the bank had investigated the corruption allegations and determined that 1 actionable evidence of corruption had been found 2 the alleged corruption did not affect the merits of the proj ects in particular the selection of the site or developer or the price to be paid for electricity and 3 contracts and payments in connection with the project w ould be monitored carefully miga became involved in discussions about the bujagali project in january 2002 after the nordic export credit agencies withdrew treasury officials say the miga project was scheduled for board consideration on june 18 2002 however they report consideration was postponed in light of the uncertainties of the situation aes subsequently made public announcement that it wanted to do more due diligence on the project according to us treasury sources the company also said it was concerned about corruption issues unrelated to the world bank financing of the project it is unclear whether the us government had any role in these events
