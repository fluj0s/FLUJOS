scheduled for 2009 it is thought that rising food and energy prices have to an extent undermined popular electoral support for the president there was reportedly widespread discontent with his decision to increase the price of subsidized fuel by 287 in may 20081 it is likely that president susilo bambang yudhoyonos support from coalition partners beyond his own small democrat party will be increasingly limited as elections near yudhoy onos main rival is likely to be former president megawati sukarnoputri yudhoy onos popularity dropped in one poll held 10 days after the fuel price hike

minority sect as well as moderate groups that support relig ious freedom have come under attack by small religious extremist groups in recent months the governments response appears to seek to avoid alienating both religious extremists and moderates on the one hand the government issued decree banning the sect from spreading its message on the other hand it pledged not to persecute ahmediya its move to arrest those extre mists that used violence against moderates demonstrating in support of religious tolerance also monstrates the governments desire to place limits on how far the extremists can go most muslims do not believe ahmadiyyah are true muslims because they do not believe that mohammad was the last prophet many see the issue as indicative of the extent to which the government will bend to religious extremists at the cost of minority groups rights to freedom of religion the extremist komando laskar islam thoug ht to be affiliate d with the islamic defenders front fpi

important was 1999 law that transferre d enormous authority from the central government to provincial and districtlevel government however by 2003 the momentum for reform appeared to be faltering29 president yudhoyono is thought to have moved the reform agenda forward but has been hindered by his limited support in parliament the source of legitimacy or lack thereof for government has changed for the indonesian people over time the dutch co lonial administration was viewed as illegitimate the sukarno presidency sought to base its rule on moral concepts but it did not provide sufficient economic development this was subsequently provided by president suharto until 1997 when the asian financial cris is undermined his ability to do so at that point with econo mic growth declining indonesians were longer prepared to accept what was increasingly viewed as corrupt and authoritarian regime this brought on the era of democr atic reform whose energy prior to 2004 had appeared to be

that the tni had two key reasons for trying to forestall an independent east timor first there was an attachment to the territory after having fought to keep it as part of indonesia second was the fear that east timorese independence would act as catalyst for further secession in aceh and papua the subsequent devastation of ea st timor may have been meant as warning to others who might seek to follow its secessionist example some believe that tni involvement in the violence stemmed larg ely from local rogu elements others believe that it was orchestrated higher up in the military command structure 45 east timor gained independence in 2002 since that time indonesia and east timor have worked to develop good rela tions the joint commission of truth and friendship was established to deal

conflict between mus lims and christians in th malukus and factions of jemaah islamiya ji which have used rrorist methods to promote an extreme islamist agenda with linkages to qaeda there have also been allegations that lashkar jihad was tool of hardliners within the military that opposed the reform movement and who allowed or possibly even assisted lashkar jihad activities that destabilized the nation thereby highlighting the need for strong military that could impose order64 there has also been intergroup conflict elsewhere in indonesia such as between muslims and christians in lawesi and the muluccas and between local dayaks and internal madurese migrants in kalimantan65 there has been much attention focused on the potential rise of islamic sentiment in indonesia in recent years this is most notable in political context with the rise of the pks justice party in the 2004 electi on in that election the pks increased its seats to 45 from 7 out of 550 following the 1999 parliamentar election many have attributed the success of the pks in pa rliamentary elections in 2004 and in more recent local elections to its campaign pl atform of good governance and its party organization

is the is lamic defenders front fpi the fpi targets such businesses for direct violent action squads of fpi cadre have forcibly shut down gambling dens discos nightclubs and bars that serve alcoholic

including more than 30 in west java alone68 the fpi is estimated to have suppor ters in the tens of thousa nds at most it and similar groups receive financial backing from saudi arabia its influence is felt widely partly because police and law enforcemen t authorities have adopted permissive attitude toward its activities arrests of fpi members are few and infrequent despite the governments revisions of public assembly laws to make it easier to disband violenceprone groups69 the second component is pressure by muslim groups on authorities to establish islamic sharia law this is felt primarily on the provincial and local levels the state departments human rights report fo r 2006 cited an estimate that more than 56 shariabased local laws have been issued throughout indonesia these laws often require that women wear head scarves require that officials read the koran in arabic segregate men and women in public places and prohibit alcohol and gambling so far the central government
