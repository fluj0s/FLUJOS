specifications to be included in an order approving electronic surveillance under sec 105 of fisa would also be leted and replaced with new subsection 105c1 which includes in the follo wing order the current subsections 105c1a b c and d and deletes current require ments in subsections 105c1f the latter provision provide s that an order approving electronic surveillance under section 105 of fisa 50 usc 1805 shall specify whenever more than one electronic m echanical or other surveillan ce device is to be used under the order the authorized coverage of the devices involved and what min imization procedures shall apply to information subject to acquisition by each devicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33669crs23 26 current subsection 105e1 provides generally for electronic surveillance for the period specified in the application or for up to 90 da ys whichever is less for the period specified in the application or for up to 120 days whicheve r is less where the target is an agent of foreign power who is not us person and for the period specified in the application or for up to one year for foreign power targets who are foreign governments or components thereof foreign nation or nations or factions thereof not substantially composed of united states persons or entities openly acknowledged by foreign government or governments to be directed and controlled by such foreign government or

foreign power as define d in sec 101a1 2 or 3 and each facility or place to be surveille d is owned leased or exclus ively used by that foreign power it also requires description of in formation sought the communications to be subject to surveillance and the type of electronic surveillance involved including whether physical entry would be required as amended the current language would be stricken and replaced with requireme nt that each order under this section specify the type of electronic surveillan ce involved including wh ether physical entry is required extensions of orders for ectronic surveillance under fisa under current section 105e2 exte nsions of an order author izing electronic surveillance under title i of fisa 50 usc 1801 et seq may be granted on the same basis as an original order upon an application for an extension and new findings made in the same manner as required for an original order26 with two exceptions first an extension of an fisc order for surveillance targeted against foreign power that is foreignbased political organization not substantially composed of united states persons or an entity that is directed and controlled by foreign government or governments or targeted against gr oup engaged in international terrorism or activities in preparation ther efor that is not united states person may be for period not to exceed one year

elect ronic surveillance without court order current subsection 105f 50 usc 1805f provides for emergency authorization of ectronic surveillance without court order for up to 72 hours by the attorney general if he reasonably determines that an emergency situation exists with respect to the employment of electronic surveillance to obtain foreign intelligence information before an order authorizing such surveillance can with due diligence be obtained and that the factua l basis for issuance of an order under thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33669crs24 title to approve such surveillance exists the attorney general or his designee must notify an fisc judge of the emergency employment of electronic surveillance at the time of its authorization during this 72 hour window court order under sec 105 must be sought subsection 105f also currently requires rmination of the surveillance when the information sought is acquired if fisc order approving the surveillance is denied or at the end of the 72 hours whichever is earliest and restricts use or disclosure of information acquired or derived from that surveillance if court order is not obtained under sec 9f5 of s 3931 sec 209 f5 of s 3929 the current subsection 105f of fisa 50 usc 1805f would be deleted and replaced with an new subsection 105f while current law author izes the attorney general to determine whether to authorize electronic surveillance without court order on an emergency basis if he reasonably deter mines that the requisite factors exist the new language would grant such authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate who is authorized by the president to conduct electronic surveillance the new nguage would require that the attorney general be informed of the emergency electronic surveillance while current law requires fisc judge to be informed by th attorney general or his designee at the time of authorization of emergency electronic surveillance the new law would require such judge to be informed as soon as practicable following such authorization that the decision has been made to employ emergency electronic surveillance new subs ections 105f2a and b current law requires that an application for an fisc order authorizing electronic surveillance be made to the fisc j udge so notified within 72 hours of the authorization of employment of emergency electronic surveillance under the new provision an application must be made to that fisc judge or another fisc judge as soon as possible within seven days after th surveillance is authorized under current subsection 105f in the absence of j udicial order approving such electronic surveillance the surveillance shall terminate when the information is obtained when the application for the order is denied or after the expiration of 72 hours from the time when the attorney general approved the emergency electronic surveillance whichever is earliest as amended the pe riod of 72 hours after the attorney general approved the emergency electronic surveillan ce would be replaced by one of seven days after approval of the emergency electronic surveillance by an executive branch officer appointed by the president with th advice and consent of the senate who is authorized by the president to conduct elect ronic surveillance the restrictions on disclosure and use of information obtai ned or derived from such an emergency electronic surveillance in the absence of an authorizing court order parallel those in existing law while under current law if the attorney general authorizes such emergency employment of electronic surveillance he shall require that the minimization procedures required by this subchapter for the issuance of judicial order be followed the revised language would provide that the official authorizing the emergency employment of electronic surveillance shall require that the minimization procedures required by this title for issuance of court order be followed new subsection 105f1d of fisa limitations of liability for provid ers aiding in fisa electronic surveillance or physical search sec 9f of s 3931 sec 209f of s 3929httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33669crs25 would also modify subsection 105i dea ling with limitations of liability for those who provide information fac ilities or technical assistan ce with respect to execution of fisa electronic surveillance or physical search as amended cause of action would lie against any provider of elect ronic communication service landlord custodian or other person including any fficer employee agent or other specified person thereof that furnishes any such aid in accordance with court order or request for emergency assistance under th is title for electronic surveillance or physical search or in response to certi fication by the attorney general or his designee seeking information facilities or technical assistance fr om such person that does not constitute electronic surveillan ce as defined in sec 101f of fisa use of information acquired by ectronic surveillance under fisa sec 106 of fisa limits the use by federal st ate or local governments of information regarding unconsenting us persons acquired or derived from electronic surveillance under fisa it also includes notificati on requirements and pr ovides an opportunity for an aggrieved person against whom such information is proffered in an official proceeding to move to suppress such info rmation if it was unlaw fully acquired or if the surveillance was not made in confor mity with an order of authorization or approval under sec 9g of s 3931 sec 209g of s 3929 sec 106i of fisa 50 usc 1806i which deals with struction of unintentionally acquired information would be modifi ed to provide that where any communication is unintentionally acquired by an electronic mechanical or other surveillance device in circumstances in which person has reasonable expectation of privacy and warrant would be required for law enfor cement purposes and if both the sender and all intended recipients are located in the united states such contents shall be destroyed upon recognition unless the attorney general determines that the contents indicate threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person current subsection 106i includes paralle l provisions but applies only to unintentionally acquired radio communications emphasis added the import of second amendment to s ubsection 106i of fisa 50 usc 1806i in sec 209g1b of s 3886 sec 9g1b of s 2453 is somewhat unclear the provision indicat that subsection 106i of fisa would be amended by inserting contain significant foreign intelligence information or after attorney general determines that the contents inserting contain significant foreign intelligence information or sic as written this language is unclear if one were to insert contain significant foreign intelligence information or contain significant foreign intelligence information or after attorney general determines that the contents the result would be an amended provision reading in circumstances involving the unint entional acquisition by an electronic mechanical or other surveillance device of the contents of any communication under circumstances in which person s reasonable expectation of privacy and warrant would be required for w enforcement purposes and if both the sender and all intended recipients are located within the united states such contents shall be destroyed upon recognition unless the attorney general determines that the contents contain significant foreign intelligence information or indicate threat of death or serious bodily harm to any personhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33669crs26 27 it would seem that the same impact upon subsection 106i might be achieved by the deletion of either of the two iterations of the phrase thus the amendment might be phrased section 106 is amended in subsection i by inserting contain significant foreign intelligence information or after attorney general determines that the contents alternatively the amendment might state s ection 106 is amended after attorney general determines that the contents by inser ting contain significant foreign intelligence information or 28 there is current sec 105g5 of fisa sec 105g of fisa 50 usc 1805g deals with testing of electronic equipm ent discovering unauthorized electronic surveillance training of intelligence personnelthis would expand the circumstances in which destruction of the unintentionally acquired contents of the communication would be forestalled however the inclusion twice in the amending language of the phrase inserting contain foreign intelligence information or suggests that one of these inclusions may be redundant27 sec 9g2 of s 3930 sec 209g2 of s 3929 makes conforming amendment to subsection 106k replacing 104a7 with 104a6 reflecting change made to sec 104 of fisa 50 usc 1804 by sec 9e of s 3930 sec 209e of s 3929

prompt preparation modification and revi ew by appropriate personnel of the department of justice the fbi the nsa and other applicable us government elements of applications for fisc orders authorizing electronic surveillance before their submittal to the fisc such system would permit and facilitate prompt submittal of applications and all other matters including electronic filings to
