to 8714 loan can become even more expensiv for the borrower who does not have the funds to repay the loan at the end of two w eeks and obtains rollover or loan extension an additional fee is attached each time the an is extended through rollover transaction if payday loan of 100 for 14 days with fee of 15 were rolled over three times it would cost the borrower 60 to borrow 100 for 56 days while this is still an apr of 391 this example demonstrates how the loan fees can quickly mount and could eventually become greater than the am ount actually borrowed consumers can also become trapped in backtoback transactions in these cases the customer pays off the first loan but immediately borrows again to meet financial needs if the borrower defaults on the loan serious financia l consequences can occur the lender can deposit the customers personal check which would resu lt in additional fees from the bank for insufficient funds if it did not clear the borrowers checking account and could result in the consumer being identified as writer of bad checks payday lenders found significant demand for these small loans from customers who found themselves unable to meet their current living expens these borrowers would have personal checking accounts but cush ion of savings to meet unexpected expenses or financial emergencies in ddition they might not have easy access to credit elsewhere

or look into his or her ability to repay the loan they only require identification proof of income and ownership of checking account critics of payday lenders consider payday loans to be abusive in
