independence in 1921 in revolution backed by the soviet uni on after this the communist mongolian peoples revolutionary party mprp ruled for almost 70 years maintaining tenuous balance between the soviet uni on and china and receiving substantial financial assistance from each public demonstrations fo r political pluralism in 1990 led to the resignation of the communist mprp government whose leaders declared the end of oneparty communist state since then mongolia has been undergoing political and economic transition to parliamentary democracy under new constitutional rules adopted in 1991 after decades of pendency on soviet aid at one point worth nearly 40 of the countrys gdp mongolia has sought to broaden its foreign contact and trade political trends and conditions2 despite the official demise of communi sm in mongolia in 1990 the formerly communist mprp has continued to play dominant political role3 in the first popular elections ever for mongolias pa rliament in 1990 the formerly communist peoples great hural the mprp won 80 of the seats in turn the same year this mprpdominated parliament elected an mprp member p ochirbat as mongolias first president while new constitution in 1992 created new parliament the state great hural to replace the peoples great hural the mprp also won significant majority in the new body its 71 out of total of 76 seats gave it firm control while mongolias fledgling opposition parties rema ined essentially powerless but the balance began to tip away from the mprp in 1994 when the party turned against ochirbat after he vetoed gislation passed by the parlia ment when ochirbat lost the mprps backing in mongolias first direct presidential election in 1993 he ran and won as an opposition candidate weak governmental institutions corruption mongolias legal and financial institutions remain underdev eloped and are serious impediment to improving the countrys economy and busine ss climate in part because of these weak institutions the existence and enfor cement of laws protecting private property is extremely limited even though the gove rnment passed land ownership law in 2002 that allows the sale of farmland to individuals governmental corruption also is becoming more acute problem and wa s the subject of demonstrations and protests during the 2005 presidential electi on campaign in some respects and with considerable assistance from western democratic organizations the fledgling government has made great strides in the 15 years since it adopted multipartyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34056crs3 4 the

infancy it was only in 2004 for instance that mongolias pa rliament the state great hural sgh passed measures giving par liamentary committees separate budgets staff and rules of procedure the first public hearing by parliamentary committee was held only in 2002 although western groups providing assistance are encouraging the sgh to hold public hearings as routine pa rt of the legislative process legislative elections of 1996 mongolias parliamentary elections on june 30 1996 were the first in which an effective organized opposition existed to ch allenge the mprps 75year rule the democratic union formed over period of about five years by coalition of eight opposition parties was the only party to fiel d clear recognizab political platform to challenge mprp candidates5 it achieved stunning elect oral victory in what was widely regarded as free and fair electi on with 91 of the electorate turning out to vote the democratic coalition took 50 of the 76 seats giving it majority in the parliament as well as the support of pr esident ochirbat the new mongolian leadership was quoted as crediting the victor to help from us political strategists and to study of american political vices the contract with america in particular economic issues political reform and foreign relations dominated the 1996 election campaign in political strategy that many came to view as the cause of the mprps downfall the party offered firm prescriptions for mongolias political problems or for its relations with othe r countries democratic union coalition candidates on the other hand put forwar d more specific policy agenda vowing to make government more transparent sell stateowned media organizations establish pension plans increase teacher salaries and reform mongolias judicial system finally the coalition placed strong em phasis on friendship with the west primarily with the united states which mongolia calls its third neighbor instability in 1997 mongolia held two related elections in 1997 in the presidential election on may 18 the results of the 1993 presiden tial election were reversed and the presidency was won by natsagiin baga bandi the mprp candidate leaving the government divided between the executive and the parliament bagabandi won with 608 of the vote against two other candida tes the incumbent of seven years president ochirbat from the democratic ion coalition which re tained its majority in the great hural from the 1996 electi ons and gombojav from the mongolian unity party mup on august 20 1997 m ongolia held an in terim par liamentary election to replace bagabandi who had to give up his seat in the great hural in orderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34056crs4 to become president bagabandis form er parliamentary s eat was won by mprp member nambaryn enkhbayar to some extent political analysts at the time regarded bagabandis election as symbolic gesture of public frustrati on over the drastic and painful economic reforms imposed by the new government after the 1996 elections under those reforms unemployment crime and taxes rose while other fi nancial and economic policies were not entirely ccessful in addition some believed that the democratic coalition majority elected in 1996 did not communicate its goals and policies effectively enough to the public to sust ain its popularity in the 1997 presidential election cycle most believed that bagaba ndis election would not change the overall direction of democratic velopment and reform in mongolia for one thing mongolias 1991 constitution reserves onl limited powers to the president in principle the power to veto while giving most political power to the great hural including the power to appoint government ministers neverthe less the democratic coalitions 50seat majority in the great hu ral though substantia l was still one vote short of the margin needed to override presidential vetoes breakup of democratic coalition 19982000 mongolias political situation became more tumultuous in 1998 with series of political crises leading to much legislative maneuvering between the mprpled government and the ruling democratic coalition on april 17 1998 prime minister enkhsaikhan announced his resignation in th wake of public discontent over harsh reform measures he had adopted to stre ngthen mongolias economy on april 23 1998 enkhsaikhan was replaced as prime mini ster by mndp member tsakhiagiyn elbegdorj the majority leader in parlia ment who was elected with 60 votes out of the 76 members in the great hural elbegdorj in turn was forced to resign by confidence vote in the great hural on ju ly 24 1998 making his government the shortest in mongolias brief democratic history because of his controversial decision on may 27 1998 to allow the stat eowned renovation bank to merge into the privately held golomt bank the par liamentary group of the mprp charged that the decision on the bank merger violated the mongolian constitution and posed threat to national economic security in the ensuing months the ruling parliamentary coalition struggled with president bagabandi over the naming of new prime minister with bagabandi repeatedly rejec ting the great hurals choice of davaadorj ganbold in december 1998 the new mndp leader janlavyn narantsatsralt became prime minister but his gove rnment fell in scandal in july 1999 on july 30 1999 the great hural endorsed as prime minist er rinchinnyamyn amarjargal another democratic coalition candida ultimately in 2000 the strain of these political crises proved too much for the democratic coalition it collapsed setting the stage for dramatic comeback by the mprp in parliamentary elections in july when mprp candidates won 72 out of the 76 seats in the great hural that month the mprp leader nambaryn enkhbayar became mongolias 5th prime minister in two years in december 2000 the remnants of the former democratic coaliti on including the mndp and the msdp merged to form the

government struggled with growing unemployment allegations of corruption and f actional differences the increasing popular disillusionment w ith the coalitions rule was reflected in presidential elections in may 2005 when mprp candidate and former prime minister nambaryn enkhbayar won the pres idency less influential though still powerful position than that of prime mini ster with 534 of the
