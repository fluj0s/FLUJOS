developments in 20022003 summary after the terrorist attacks on the united states in september 2001 the united states and russia adopted cooperative stance against global terrorism that many observers viewed as including enhanced us recognition that russias conflict in its breakaway chechnya region with population estimated at less than onehalf to one million was in part struggle against terrorism this cooperation became strained in recent months for reasons that included more us criticism of intensified russian fighting in chechnya deemed to violate human rights but appeared to be reaffirmed following chechen terrorist attacks in russia in late 2002 russias thenpremier and current president vladimir putin ordered military police and security forces to enter the breakaway chechnya region in september 1999 and these forces occupied most of the region by early 2000 putins rise to power and continuing popularity have been tied at least partly to his perceived ability to prosecute this conflict successfully he has repeatedly declared that victory and peace are at hand but such declarations have proven inaccurate time and again although russias forces nominally control large areas its ground and air forces continue to carry out major operations rebel violence causes dozens of russian troop casualties per month myriad human rights violations against chechen civilians are regularly reported reconstruction has barely begun and most of the population now lives in makeshift housing while us core national security interests in arms control strategic missile defense proliferation counterterrorism and nato enlargement have dominated usrussian relations us concerns over chechnya have been factor and are linked to us core interests these concerns were reflected in cia director george tenets warning in february 2000 that chechnya threatened to become world center of international terrorism and since the events of 911 such concerns have boosted usrussian cooperation on counterterrorism and other issues the united states has been supportive of some claims by russia that it is combating international terrorism in chechnya however the united states has rejected russias claims that it has the right to preemptive attacks against putative chechen terrorists based in neighboring georgia and has provided military assistance to georgia to help it deal with terrorism and lawlessness along its borders with russia of less than vital interest but still significant the united states has concerns about russias disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force in chechnya its rejection of political settlement of the conflict and the humanitarian needs of displaced persons these concerns also have an antiterrorism dimension with the administration arguing that defeated embittered and poor chechnya could be an incubator of future islamic extremism thus us policy has been critical of russias human rights abuses against innocent civilians in chechnya and has called for peace talks while at the same time the administration has called upon chechens to cut all contacts with international terrorists this report will be periodically updated

augustseptember 1999 and apartment bombings throughout russia during the same time as the triggers for russias counterterrorism campaign in chechnya putins rise to power and continuing popularity have

myriad human rights violations against chechen civilians are regularly reported reconstruction has barely begun and most of the population remains living in makeshift shelters from high of some 140000 russian troops in early 2000 there are reportedly about 80000 remaining in chechnya about 30000 of whom are military and the rest police and federal security service fsb operatives2 russias military has estimated the total number of remaining rebel fighters at less than 2000 including about 250 foreign mercenaries during the snowfree summer months rebels intensify their attacks on russian troops who in turn step up their counterinsurgency efforts in 2002 the cycle of heightened fighting appeared to yield major russian successes in killing or apprehending rebel leaders alleged human rights abuses against civilians during russian troop actions however triggered new international criticism of russia and growing dissatisfaction with the campaign among many russians though the seizure by chechen rebels of about 800 hostages in moscow in october 2002 appeared to lessen such criticism and dissatisfaction at least for awhile 1 the first chechnya conflict occurred in 19941996 for

counterterrorist operations in chechnya against not only chechen terrorists but also terrorist bandit internationale with links to qaeda which operates and funds training camps in the region russian officials also allege that just as with qaeda chechen rebels have cells in russia and two dozen countries that recruit fighters and send money and equipment to chechnya3 since the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 putin also has argued that the united states should welcome russias actions against our common foes in chechnya as major contribution to the usled coalitions global counterterrorism efforts in late october 2002 putin claimed that the moscow theater hostage crisis was intimately linked to other recent international terrorist actions stance endorsed by security council resolution on october 24 that also termed the hostage crisis threat to international peace and security after suicide bombers devastated the government complex in chechnyas capital of grozny on december 27 2002 the russian foreign ministry asserted that the bombing was instigated by global terrorists peace efforts the united states and other countries repeatedly have called on russia to open peace talks with moderate chechen rebels but russia has mostly rejected such calls one official attempt to open talks occurred in late 2001 when putin designated viktor kazantsev the presidential envoy to the north caucasus as empowered to discuss disarmament with chechen rebels and former chechen president aslan maskhadov appointed akhmed zakayev the chechen deputy prime minister to meet with kazantsev the two emissaries facilitated on the chechen side by turkey met in midnovember 2001 the conditions laid down by kazantsev for further talks included rebel disarmament and by zakayev included recognition of maskhadovs presidency the ending of housetohouse searches and the withdrawal of russian forces according to one report kazantsev stated that the rebels could be reintegrated into chechen social and political life after they disarmed russia delayed further meetings despite zakayevs willingness4 another possible attempt to open talks occurred in midoctober 2002 when the newly appointed russian presidential human rights omsbudsman to chechnya abdulkhakim sultygov met with several members of the chechen rebel legislature to discuss holding peace talks observers from the council of europe were also present however kazantsev and other russian officials denounced this meeting as unauthorized perhaps indicating some dissension within the putin administration on the issue of peace talks the reluctance of the putin administration to pursue peace talks has spurred the emergence of several unofficial proposals for ending the conflict prominent proposals include one by former russian legislative speaker and chechen ruslan khasbulatov and former legislative speaker and security council secretary ivan rybkin and one by former us officials zbigniew brzezinski alexander haig and 3 putin has stressed that chechen terrorism because of its international reach and aspirations constitutes global terrorist network that is among the most dangerous faced by the international community fbis december 2 2002 doc cep250 4 shamil basayev formerly maskhadovs deputy has rejected any peace proposal that does not include independence for chechnya bbc worldwide monitoring october 14 2002 crs3 max kampelman khasbulatovs plan would give chechnya substantial autonomy within russia while the brzezinski plan calls for more limited selfgovernment and stresses peaceful and democratic resolution of the conflict at conference in july 2002 the two proposals were basically merged5 most recently akhmadov unveiled peace proposal in washington dc in march 2003 that calls for russian forces to be replaced by peacekeepers in chechnya and for chechnya to become fully independent upon its democratization despite the calls for opening peace talks the putin administration in recent months has appeared more dedicated to military solution to the chechnya conflict particularly after the moscow theater siege it has refused further contacts with zakayev and tried to convince denmark and great britain to extradite him to face criminal charges danish courts in early december 2002 rejected russias request for zakayevs extradition finding russias evidence of his crimes unconvincing zakayev is currently in great britain where the courts at the end of january 2003 began hearings on an extradition request from russia international aid and presence russia initially opposed international aid efforts in chechnya on the grounds that the conflict was domestic affair but the scope of urgent humanitarian needs and international pressure eventually convinced russia to admit international aid groups the dangers of continued fighting and lawlessness however bedevil assistance work prominent aid providers include various agencies the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce international committee of the red cross and doctors without borders dwb after almost two years of bureaucratic delays russian authorities finally permitted sixmember osce assistance group ag to return to chechnya in june 20016 russia wrangled over the mission of the ag demanding that it be limited to aid and not include peace mediation or the investigation of abuses and finally refused to renew its mandate in december 2002 forcing it to leave chechnya dwb suspended its operations for awhile in early 2001 following the kidnaping of staffer who was later released and again in july 2002 after another kidnaping the that same month halted its sizeable humanitarian work in chechnya following the kidnaping of russian working for unicef dwb has resumed some work in chechnyas neighboring ingushetia region and the has resumed work in chechnya there has been some criticism from ngos and governments that russia has tended to somewhat rely on international aid to supplement or substitute for aid it provides to the victims of the conflict7 the united states has been the largest single donor to aid victims of the recent chechnya conflict contributing at least 73 million to agencies and non governmental organizations ngos the united states has refugee coordinator 5 washington post june 21 2002 p a25 the

coordinates aid with the international community and russia and identifies where more aid is needed human rights conditions kidnaping extortion and common theft by russian and rebel forces are widely reported by many observers extremely low pay and provisioning of military and police personnel encourage criminal acts in effect according to some critics russian forces live off the land and even ship large amounts of illgotten goods back to their families on military and police vehicles purportedly with the connivance of higherups sensational report allegedly written by the promoscow chechen government in early 2003 detailed hundreds of murders arbitrary detentions and disappearances of chechen civilians during 2002 and dozens more in the first three months of 2003 in many cases the report listed the russian units carrying out the abuses although chechnyas promoscow chief administrator akhmad kadyrov denied the validity of the report he appeared to give it indirect credence by suggesting on april 16 2003 that masked troops involved in nighttime abductions of chechen civilians might have been russians the next day his premier anatoliy popov was more definite stating that 300 of 500 disappearances of chechen civilians in 2002 had been linked to russian troops8 many international and nongovernmental organizations have continued to criticize russia for human rights abuses in chechnya although some note progress by russia in addressing some abuses for the us response see below these organizations also continue to criticize chechen rebel abuses particularly assassinations of promoscow chechen officials the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe pace was at the forefront of early efforts to condemn human rights abuses committed by russian forces in 2000 it suspended the voting rights of the russian delegation and conditioned reinstatement on russias investigation of crimes amelioration of human rights conditions and opening of peace talks with crosssection of the chechen people voting rights were restored in january 2001 however with the explanation that pace wanted to work with russia to improve the human rights situation in chechnya pacerussian state duma joint working group for chechnya was formed headed by frank judd lord judd and russian dmitriy rogozin in its april 2002 report the nonrussian members of the working group concluded that the human rights situation in chechnya has still not adequately improved because of russian laxity in investigating continuing serious human rights abuses the working group traveled to chechnya and moscow again in july and september 2002 lord judd reported to pace in september that human rights abuses were still being committed by both sides in the conflict and that chechen civilians faced urgent humanitarian needs but he argued that without negotiated and sustainable peace settlement aid efforts could only be palliative9 he presented another report to pace in late january 2003 that the proposed march 2003 referendum was illtimed 8 monde april 11 2003 fbis april 16 2003 doc cep86 sarah karush ap april 17 2003 9 pace report of the 26th sitting september 24 2002

resignation as cohead10 at its early april 2003 session pace approved by wide margin resolution deploring the continuing failure of russia to protect chechnyas population from gross human rights abuses the resolution calls for chechen rebels to stop terrorist activities and for russian forces to be better controlled and perhaps withdrawn from chechnya it calls for memberstates to register complaints against russia with the european court for human rights and warns that if the climate of impunity for abuses does not change an ad hoc war crimes tribunal modeled after that set up for the former yugoslavia should be considered the strong resolution reportedly angered russian delegate vladimir zhirinovskiy who threatened that pace delegates supporting the resolution would find themselves in the dock in such tribunal rogozin reportedly angrily announced that russia would longer discuss chechnya with coe and might not pay its dues11 twentytwo eu members and candidate countries cosponsored resolution submitted to the human rights commission on april 8 2003 accusing russia of grave human rights violations in chechnya the resolution expressed deep concern about ongoing disappearances extrajudicial and summary executions torture illtreatment arbitrary detentions abuses and harassment at checkpoints and during sweep operations and other violations of international humanitarian law perpetrated by russian forces it called on russia to investigate and provide information on abuses and to implement the rule of law in chechnya and to allow free access to international and nongovernment organizations and the media12 on april 16 2003 the commission voted against the resolution 2115 with 17 abstentions see also below recent us policy statements casualties the headquarters of russias unified group of forces in chechnya reported at the end of 2002 that since 1999 there have been about 4500 russian troops killed and about12600 wounded and that over 14000 chechen rebels have been killed russian human rights groups such as memorial and soldiers mothers however have estimated higher numbers of troop deaths estimates of civilian casualties are highly unreliable given the inaccessibility of many areas of chechnya and the dispersal of the population civilian casualties are now seldom the result of largescale russian military operations as in the early months of the conflict but continue on smaller scale memorial has placed civilian deaths at between 1020000 300550 per month and chechen rebel sources at more than 80000 russian officials deny these numbers of civilian deaths and attribute many deaths to chechen intraethnic blood feuds rather than to actions by russian 10 lord judd the house magazine february 24 2003 11 council of

troop abuses russian military and police sources report that their casualties have lessened in recent months as major fighting has wound down instead of directly engaging the enemy except in southern chechnya where such fighting still occurs russian forces have adopted tactics such as checkpoints housetohouse searches or sweeps night raids and setting up bunkers throughout the region to which troops retreat at nightfall rebels largely engage in hitandrun tactics the most lethal rebel attack took place in august 2002 when rebels shot down russian mi26 helicopter killing 119 soldiers and other passengers just outside grozny another lethal attack by suicide bombers in grozny in december 2002 killed 80 troops and civilians14 displaced persons according to the about 660000 civilians were in chechnya in late september 2002 of which about 140000 were displaced from their homes another 110000 displaced chechens are in the neighboring ingushetia region and 30000 are elsewhere in russia the russian government according to the spares efforts to convince displaced chechens to return home15 the russian government failed to get all the displaced in ingushetia to return to chechnya by the end of 2002 but the high commissioner for refugees unhcr estimated that 3040000 displaced persons returned to chechnya in 2002 several hundred people also fled chechnya though russian officials claimed that 5090000 had returned unhcr protested russias closure of camp in ingushetia in early december 2002 which may have forced about 800 inhabitants to return to chechnya alerted by unhcr the united states and other countries and organizations raised concerns about russias forced return of displaced chechens during the harsh winter of 20022003 to face uncertain housing conditions in chechnya human rights watch has reported that russian authorities in recent months have arbitrarily removed displaced chechens in ingushetia from eligibility lists for subsidized housing and food in

immediately demolish 180 13 citing the results of an october 1213 2002 census chechnyas promoscow premier claimed that casualties during the 19941996 and 19992002 conflicts amounted to about 10000

537000 voters in chechnya crs7 shelters previously built russian police in ingushetia also have stepped up abuses against displaced chechens16 sweeps and raids russian officials have argued that russian troops must carry out sweeps where troops cordon off villages or areas and search houseby house for suspected rebels because armed chechen rebels violate international human rights accords by hiding among civilians and that russian troops do not commit human rights abuses during sweeps intense international criticism that russian actions during sweeps often result in indiscriminate violence against civilians however led russian prosecutor general vladimir ustinov in july 2001 to issue order 46 which called for civilian and procuracy presence during sweeps and recordkeeping on those detained this decree reportedly was seldom carried out in late march 2002 the thencommander of the unified federal forces in the north caucasus col gen vladimir moltenskoy in addition ordered federal troops to receive preapproval from local administrators before conducting sweeps to introduce themselves before searching home and to take off their masks the russian governmentowned newspaper rossiyskaya gazeta has criticized this order 80 and other civil law as restraining the russian militarys freedom of action and safety in chechnya17 in july 2001 putin defended sweeps as necessary to combat terrorists however by june 2002 he appeared frustrated by allegations of human rights abuses during sweeps and stated that sweeps by russian troops would be replaced by the end of the year with checks carried out by chechen selfdefense units moltenskoy however asserted that military sweeps would continue and other officers argued that the chechen units were not fully ready for duty according to some critics the pledge to end sweeps was disingenuous designed only to allay western criticism since the sweeps have not ended18 human rights watch in early april 2003 reported that over the previous year abuses by russias forces in chechnya during sweeps dropped off while abuses committed by night raiders increased these raiders who generally wear masks speak unaccented russian and ride in military vehicles invade homes and take away chechens who generally are never seen again or are found dead often blown up other disappearances resulted from detentions at checkpoints these raiders have appeared to target young chechen males who have returned to chechnya besides rising rates of disappearances and extrajudicial killings human rights watch also stated that rates of torture and arbitrary detention were increasing responding to the report which had been submitted to human rights commission meeting underway sultygov on april 15 dismissed it as the fictitious 16 human rights

russian and chechen rebel abuses19 atrocities western and russian media have reported discoveries of several mass graves in recent months20 most of the discoveries have been linked to missing chechens who local witnesses said had been detained by russian troops according to an official of the promoscow chechen government there were 1660 unresolved cases of chechens and russians who were missing in early 2003 with other sources estimating that the bulk of the missing were chechen civilians many of whom disappeared while in custody of russian forces21 besides the discovery of gravesites linked to missing chechens the russian fsb in august 2002 publicized what it termed chechen terrorist concentration camp for kidnap victims who were held for ransom and for slave labor and an associated mass gravesite according to the russian government about 900 such kidnap victims in chechnya remain unaccounted for the council of europe coe and other organizations have been critical of russias investigation and prosecution of its troops who commit crimes in chechnya coe has criticized the inadequacy of investigations of abuses against civilians the lack of access by human rights organizations to all of chechnya and the continuation of human rights abuses even when prosecutors accompany troops coe commissioner for human rights alvaro gilrobles in may 2002 derided the russian prosecutor generals office for admitting that human rights abuses had occurred in chechnya but appearing unable to carry out its constitutional duties particularly in asserting its powers over the military in march 2003 pace legal affairs committee member rudolf bindig criticized russian official data that showed that of 385 investigations of possible crimes by russian soldiers against chechen civilians only 19 were placed on court dockets because there still were not any results in these cases he averred the creation of an international tribunal might be considered the most sensational case has been that of col yuriy budanov the only russian officer to be tried for murdering chechen civilians some in the military backed his prosecution but many others battled against budanovs conviction in military court proceedings lasting nearly three years the moscow serbsky institute an psychiatric institution widely accused of torturing dissidents at the behest of the rulers of the former soviet union reported in december 2002 that the accused had been temporarily insane when he strangled chechen female in march 2000 and the court ruled that he was not guilty the russian supreme

chechnya will take more than 3 billion its pledged funding has fallen short however and some allocations have reportedly fallen victim to graft and corruption as they did during the interwar period of 19971999 the russian budget authorized about 155 million for services and rebuilding chechnya in 2001 1445 million in 2002 and 1124 million in 2003 the russian government reports some progress in constructing schools hospitals bakeries and water sewage electrical and communications systems destroyed by conflict unesco and unicef have reported however that russia has exaggerated the number of operating schools and that teaching remains severely hampered by lack of adequate facilities heat and supplies23 russian officials have called for more international aid to help rebuild the region the constitutional referendum according to some reports the russian security council decided in march 2002 to step up political institutionbuilding in chechnya as means of winding down the conflict under this plan constitutional referendum was planned for late 2002 to be followed by legislative and presidential elections constitutional commission decided on final draft constitution in august 2002 despite statements by putin that constitutional referendum would by held in november 2002 kadyrov and other promoscow chechens argued successfully that unrest in the region precluded referendum until march 26 2003 besides question on approving the constitution voters were asked to approve draft laws on electing president and legislature about 23000 russian troops considered permanently based in chechnya were permitted to vote some chechens protested against holding referendum but kadyrov reportedly dismissed such protesters as enemies24 after calls by the human rights commissioner of the coe russia set up polling places in ingushetia for displaced chechens but pace reportedly balked at sending observers after russia refused to permit the observers free access to polling places handful of osce observers described voting irregularities in the polling places they visited and some journalists reported few observable voters and many voting irregularities25 the central electoral commission reported very high 895 turnout and that 96 approved the new constitution president putin hailed the win as removing the last serious threat to russias territorial integrity the new chechen constitution does not provide the region with special status in the russian federation totally repudiating its uncertain autonomy in 19961999 22 fbis march 1 2001 doc cep243 december 31 2002 doc

powers than those provided in other regional constitutions russian language is designated the exclusive language of official discourse the constitution prohibits advocacy of seperatism and establishes strong federal control over the region specifying the primacy of federal law ensured in part by the centers appointment and direct control over the regional prosecutor the federal government can remove the regional president and the federal legislature can dissolve the regional legislature the constitution creates presidential system of administration in the region with the president able to appoint many officials with advise or consent by the regional legislature and to issue decrees with the force of law26 political institutionbuilding in chechnya has been hamstrung by interdepartmental rivalries at the federal and local levels and inadequate coordination by the center with local administrators leading to wasted resources and ripe environment for corruption reportedly two dozen central ministries and agencies carry out operations in chechnya ostensibly these operations are coordinated by russian deputy prime minister viktor khristenko who heads the commission for the rebuilding of chechnya and stanislav ilyasov minister of the russian federation for the affairs of chechnya further complicating power relations president putin has appointed human rights ombudsman and southern federal district envoy who deals mainly with economic matters at the local level the promoscow chechen leaders feud over their vaguelydefined powers until recently they had only marginal control over federal spending and local appointments kadyrov gained some appointment powers in mid2002 and expects more access to federal funds during 2003 the civilian agencies and leaders vie with the military police and security agencies for control and influence in chechnya stymying rebuilding efforts the fsb has led operational planning for the chechnya campaign as recently as may 2002 putin had intervened in contretemps between the fsb and the interior ministry regarding the eventual transfer of operational leadership in chechnya to the interior ministry stating that it would be premature for the fsb to relinquish leadership at that time but perhaps later to enhance law and order in chechnya general staff chief anatoliy kvashnin visited chechnya in late september 2002 and convinced president putin to decree the establishment of system of 100 military commandants under the authority of the commandant of chechnya lt gen sergey kizyun these commandants would coordinate military police fsb and civilian affairs within their jurisdictions major functions of the commandants include assisting the promoscow chechen police to establish order and investigating civilian complaints of human rights abuses by military and police troops putin apparently changed his mind in november 2002 decreeing the formation of chechen interior ministry that he stated would eventually permit russian military forces to stay in their barracks in chechnya the head of russias interior ministry duly asserted in december 2002 that he was taking control of the commandants offices and defense minister sergey ivanov likewise announced that some military functions within 26 european commission for democracy through law venice commission opinion on the draft constitution of the chechen republic adopted by the venice commission at its 54th plenary meeting venice 1415 march 2003 opinion 2312003 crs11 chechnya would be transferred to the russian interior ministry and its regional affiliate27 russia has trained over 12000 promoscow chechens as local police hoping that these forces can substitute for exiting russian forces some russian officials have considered these chechen police unreliable causing deadlines for more withdrawals of russian forces to be moved back tensions between russian troops and the chechen police have been reported illustrated by gun battle in grozny in september 2002 between the two groups bomb reportedly planted by rebels with assistance of sympathizers within the chechen police force killed over two dozen police officials in grozny in october 2002 federal authorities subsequently decided to redouble screening of the chechen police for rebel sympathizers and to recruit sizable fraction of chechen police from outside the region further doubts were expressed about the loyalty of some chechen police following the december 2002 bombing of the government complex in grozny implications for russia and chechnya strict government control over media reporting was major innovation during the second chechnya conflict and helped to shelter the russian public from news of troop casualties and human rights abuses critics argue that this secrecy vitiates the democratic accountability of russias leaders28 reporters are generally banned from the region except when accredited and accompanied by military escort the main source of news from chechnya comes from the russian military authorities have threatened to prosecute private media that report unfavorable news on charges of revealing sensitive security information allegations of abuses cannot be verified since the military often seals areas from reporters and even promoscow chechen officials who attempt to investigate despite these efforts to keep the conflict from public view however recent events have drawn heavy media attention such as the russian military helicopter shootdown in august 2002 the hostage crisis in moscow in october 2002 and the bombing at the government complex in grozny in december 2002 the moscow hostage crisis in october 2002 shocked many russians who had been told by the media that fighting in chechnya was almost over but otherwise

military commanders involved in the chechnya conflict disobeying putin or other civilian authority primakovs warning appeared to gain further credence in december 2002 when the commander of the north caucasus military district gennadiy troshev refused his reassignment to another post demanding that he stay in place to conclude the chechnya conflict and see the referendum through he was

other issues the united states has been supportive of some claims by russia that it is combating international terrorism in chechnya however the united states has rejected russias claims that it has the right to preemptive attacks against putative chechen terrorists based in neighboring georgia of less than vital interest but still significant the united states has concerns about russias disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force in chechnya its rejection of political settlement of the conflict and the humanitarian needs of displaced persons these concerns also have an antiterrorism dimension with the administration arguing that defeated embittered and poor chechnya could again become an incubator of international terrorism thus the united states has raised the issue of russias human rights abuses against innocent civilians in chechnya in bilateral and multilateral forums37 according to many observers in russia and the west the united states toned down its

2003 iraq conflict see below putin has used language similar to that used by the united states in its worldwide antiterrorism campaign to justify russias actions in chechnya he has argued that he is combating internationally supported and funded terrorism in chechnya and that russia will not negotiate with or reward terrorists he also has asserted that russia has the right under international law and the security councils antiterrorism resolution to preemptively attack chechen terrorists he alleges are harbored by georgia the bush administration has opposed russian incursion into georgia without georgias permission and has provided military training and equipment to georgia to help it eliminate terrorist cells within its territory39 the administration and others likewise reject the identification of all chechen rebels as terrorists and call for peace talks with moderate chechen rebels they argue that even if international terrorists were eliminated in chechnya russia would still face separatist problems in the region in practice however the problem faced by us policy in distinguishing between chechen rebels and terrorists was illustrated by assistant secretary of state elizabeth jones two weeks after 911 she explained that the administration was now more clearly differentiating between the supply of financing and weapons to mujahidin inside chechnya and the legitimate concerns of the chechen people and urged russia to make the same distinctions40 some critics have countered that in reality both rebels and terrorists represent armed threats and that some chechen rebel leaders have welcomed help from international terrorists another dilemma concerns us position on the disposition of terrorists in chechnya if negotiations with terrorists are frowned upon should the terrorists simply be eliminated what role should positive inducements play if they surrender or lay down their arms as part of peace settlement should they be pardoned or should they face civil or extrajudicial prosecution two weeks after 911 the state department hailed speech by president putin that distinguished between terrorists and rebels in chechnya as opening the possibility of russian talks with moderate chechens by april 2002 however putin had seemed to backtrack arguing that separatism and terrorism in chechnya were inseparably linked the united states

united states was not calling for russia to try to reach accord with terrorists but rather to negotiate with moderate chechens such as maskhadov he called on moderate chechens to disassociate themselves from terrorists but he also discounted the extensiveness of such associations by arguing that we have not seen evidence of extensive ties between chechens and qaeda in chechnya but we have seen evidence of individuals or certain factions linked to terrorist elements41 at the june 2001 bushputin getacquainted meeting and the november 2001 and may 2002 usrussia presidential summits bush raised us concerns about russian human rights abuses in chechnya at the june 2001 meeting putin strongly defended russian policy asking bush how he would deal with hypothetical invasion of texas he rejected bushs call for opening talks arguing that what are we supposed to do here talk to the chechen rebels about biblical values anybody wearing cross is an enemy to them42 during the may 2002 summit bush stressed that russian forces should conduct operations like those of the us led forces in afghanistan that safeguard civilians43 the putin administration has criticized us and western admonishments as hypocritical since the usled global war on terrorism appears to emphasize coercive and punitive measures to combat terrorism while urging russia to undertake negotiations with those it deems terrorists these russian officials view negotiations with maskhadov and other socalled moderate chechen separatists as implying that some of these figures could reassume leadership posts in the region which they think would lead to replay of the doomed 19971999 peace settlement some in russia term as hypocritical the advice that russia as in 1996 should give amnesty to chechen terrorists who lay down their arms and should provide them with humanitarian and development assistance viewing such aid as rewarding rather than punishing terrorists some observers warn that weak us and western

moderate chechen interlocutors since even maskhadov failed to quickly repudiate the moscow theater hostage taking he argued48 the march 2003 constitutional referendum in chechnya may mark watershed in the us assessment of the chechnya conflict us emissary to the osce permanent council stated on march 27 that the united states hoped that the referendum would lead to the creation of institutions of

chairmans statement the united states had supported resolutions passed by the commission in 2000 and 2001 the loss of us membership on the commission in 2002 was widely viewed as contributing to the defeat by one vote of similar resolution that year and the regaining of us membership in 2003 was viewed as bolstering the likelihood that such resolution would pass this year although the united states voted for the resolution on april 16 its failure led some observers to view the us decision not to cosponsor as having weakened the resolutions chances for passage these observers juxtaposed the us stance on the resolution to the us determination to forcibly bring democratization and respect for human rights to iraq other observers were supportive of what they viewed as less strident us

questions about rebel links with international terrorism some observers juxtapose the first chechnya conflict to the second viewing the first as largely nationalist conflict albeitly with some foreign mujahidin aid and the second as more deeply influenced by islamic extremism and links to international terrorism various types of links with international terrorism may be distinguished including chechens who travel abroad foreigners who travel to chechnya and financial aid and arms flows to chechnya by most accounts in recent years only few hundred chechens at the most have assisted international terrorism abroad and only few hundred mujahidin have traveled to chechnya to fight or receive training there are links between chechen rebels and afghan mujahidin dating from the early 1990s when basayev and other chechens reportedly received training in afghanistan and then went on to assist rebels in tajikistan and abkhazia georgia several individuals from the middle east assisted the chechen rebels and were martyred during the first as well as the second chechnya conflicts according to chechen rebel sources among the most infamous was the saudi mujahidin samir binsalih binabdallah alsuwaylim better known as khattab who was allegedly killed during russian clandestine operation using biological toxins in march 2002 and whose training camp in chechnya allegedly was linked to qaeda however maskhadov and other chechen rebel representatives have declared that the chechen rebel leadership has links to qaeda53 us officials prior to 911 recognized that some chechen rebels received support from international terrorist groups including qaeda and in principle supported russias efforts to combat these terrorists54 however there was formal us designation of any terrorist groups in chechnya two weeks after 911 president bush emphasized that to the extent that there are terrorists in chechnya arab terrorists associated with the qaeda organization i believe they ought to be brought to justice and we do believe that there are some qaeda folks in chechnya55 us deputy secretary of state richard armitage later stated that we enjoy absolute understanding with

who had fought in chechnya as possible airline hijackers since some of these individuals ostensibly referring to ethnic chechens could avoid detection by racial profiling reportedly this information

chechnya and elsewhere61 the hostages held in the moscow theater in october 2002 included two us citizens one of whom died among other alleged links between chechnya and terrorism of us concern three of the four saudi nationals who confessed to the 1995 bombing of us military training facility in saudi arabia were veterans of conflicts in afghanistan bosnia and chechnya62 another link to chechnya involved the us branch of the islamic charity benevolence international which the us justice department in october 2002 charged with having ties to qaeda and supplying funds to persons and organizations engaged in violence in chechnya some of the charity funds allegedly also were received by chechens in georgias pankisi gorge area63 in mid december 2002 french authorities arrested nine members of terrorist cell with links to qaeda and chechen rebels three had received training in georgias pankisi gorge and the cell leader had fought with rebels in chechnya the group was allegedly
