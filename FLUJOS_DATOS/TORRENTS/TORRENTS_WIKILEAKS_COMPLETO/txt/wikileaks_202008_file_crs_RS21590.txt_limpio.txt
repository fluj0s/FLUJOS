for joint military forces the gig bandwidth expansion program gigbe is component of the overall gig that involves upgrading the capacity of the busiest equipment and transmission pathways composing the central portion of the gig some question whether the gigbe design will support military requirements for transmitting the expected future high volume of encrypted network traffic also because each service is developing separate network architecture that will tie into the gig some observers question whether these differences will limit interoperability of the overall gig and thus reduce its usefulness to warfighters order code rs21590 updated january 9 2006 crs report for congress received through the crs web defense program issue global information grid bandwidth expansion gigbe clay wilson specialist in technology and national security foreign affairs defense and trade division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21590 the global information grid gig is the enabling infrastructure for network centric warfare ncw concept that relies on communications technology to link together us military personnel ground vehicles aircraft and naval vessels through integrated wide and local area networks to provide improved battle space awareness for joint military forces1 the gig bandwidth expansion program gigbe is component of the overall gig which upgrades the transmission pathways composing the central portion of the gig the gigbe program achieved full operational capability as of december 20 2005 however some question whether the gigbe design will support military requirements for transmitting the expected future high volume of encrypted network traffic also because each service is developing separate network architecture that will tie into the gig some observers question whether these differences will limit interoperability of the overall gig and thus reduce its usefulness to warfighters this report will be updated as events warrant background global information grid the dod global information grid gig provides secure networking capability for managing information on demand for warfighters policy makers and support personnel the gig is single network that enables communications and sharing of sensor information among personnel at multiple levels of security in all services in the intelligence community and with us coalition partners the functionality of many sophisticated weapons systems may be critically dependent on the capabilities and reliability of the gig status of the gigbandwidth expansion program gigbe the gig network design includes linkages through radio satellite and land lines the gigbe program enhances the highspeed land lines which form central core of the gig by using optical network technology 1 for more information about network centric warfare see crs report rs20557 navy networkcentric warfare concept key programs and issues for congress by ronald orourke congressional research service the library of congress crs2 the defense information systems agency disa announced that the gigbe program has completed operational testing and achieved full operational capability as of december 20 2005 the gigbe is now accredited to support highbandwidth synchronous optical network transmission of classified data traffic at 10 gigabitsper second between 86 central point defense sites and may eventually extend to link 100 top defense and intelligence sites2 the list of central point sites is classified but includes locations both inside and outside the united states future plans for the gigbe network transmissions for the defense information systems network disn that now operate over leased lines will soon be integrated into the new gigbe transmission pathways which are owned by dod3 the gigbe will eventually be linked with the joint tactical radio system jtrs and the transformational communications architecture to form highspeed highcapacity network the army is upgrading its landwarnet networks to tie into the gigbe through its installation information infrastructure modernization program i3mp the air force will tie all its bases into the gigbe through the air force combat information transport system and the navy will connect with the gigbe through its forcenet httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21590 architecture4 network architectures the architecture of the gig network includes the functional design to support business logistics intelligence sharing and military operations the enterprise architecture plus the technical design for transmission of data within each network the technical architecture each military service is currently creating its own network architecture to support warfighters and tie into the gig the key architectures are the air force c2 constellation b navy and marine corps forcenet and c army landwarnet however many observers are concerned that interoperability problems between the different architectures used by each military service may limit the usefulness of the gig leaving warfighters unable to tap into all network capabilities5 2 jason miller dods gigbe reaches full operational capability government computer news december 20 2005

constellation the c2 constellation program consists of several technical and enterprise architectures some of which are designed to relay information directly between machines using common information standards the constellation platforms include ground stations unmanned aerial vehicles spacebased sensors and possibly new multisensor command and control aircraft within the c2 constellation program the combat information transport system is designed to deliver operational information to warfighters6 the c2 constellation will also support the business process for acquiring future c4isr capabilities7 the architecture is coordinated by group of air force domain councils that in turn are governed by the enterprise architecture integration council8 navy and marine corps forcenet forcenet is concept for communications network that combines all networks and business processes for navy and marine corps systems so that information can be gathered and analyzed in collaborative atsea environment for example naval strike group commanders can use computer network chat rooms to coordinate among their warfare commanders and ships as well as reach back to the continental united states for help in diagnosing problems9 forcenet maintains continual state of evolution based on changes in technology and changes in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21590 the battle space and is not intended to have an end state as such forcenet is not program or system but rather way of integrating wide array of technological resources into distributed networked combat force available in real time to all personnel10 it is an architecture comprised of networked systems processing and computing and interfaces that are secure and transparent to users11 more detailed discussion of the architecture for forcenet can be found in crs report rs20557 navy networkcentric warfare concept key programs and issues for congress by ronald orourke army landwarnet the installation information

units of actionbrigade and division and corps elements located in the deployed theater13 bandwidth needs according to john stenbit former assistant secretary of defense for networks and information integration asdnii the primary problem that must be overcome to make information for network centric warfare ncw easily accessible through the gig is meeting the demand for bandwidth14 encryption requirements for high security for the gig will add considerable management overhead signaling to all network traffic and will significantly reduce the amount of bandwidth that is actually available for conveying message by the year 2010 the congressional budget office cbo estimates that the supply of effective bandwidth required by the army will fall short of peak demand by ratio of approximately 1 to 1015 also disa httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21590 reportedly has projected that requirements for transmission of all encrypted us military information will grow by about 50 percent per year in the future however cbo has calculated that the existing design for the gigbe program which supports the core of the gig is adequate to support military needs through 2015 and possibly through 2020 with technology upgrades16 oversight issues for congress the gigbe program raises several potential oversight issues for congress transmission capacity of the gigbe is the current design for the gigbe sufficient to support future projections for the bandwidth requirements to properly secure classified military transmissions do reported projections for bandwidth requirements adequately take into account extending the functionality of the gig down to each individual soldier and to each individual sensor and individual weapons system in the future do the calculations for growth in gigbe transmission capacity adequately 13 army renames its network enterprise feb 26 2004 at httpwwwinsidedefensecom 14 in certain situations during operation iraqi freedom commanders had access to only one communications channel if someone else was using it first the commander had to wait until it was free for him to use matthew french bandwidth in iraq subject of debate federal computer week oct 20 2003 p 43 15 anticipated hardware improvements by 2010 will shift the existing bandwidth bottleneck from the brigade level to the corps level if the joint tactical radio system jtrs performs as the army projects the new radio may provide more than enough bandwidth for the lower tactical levels of command with margin for growth of demand beyond 2010 however at the division and corps level the projected demand is still expected to be much greater than the likely supply cbo the armys bandwidth bottleneck aug 2003 at httpwwwcbogov 16 cbo issues associated with the global information grid

architectures each military service is creating its own network architecture causing many observers to be concerned that interoperability problems between the different architectures may limit the usefulness of the overall gig leaving warfighters unable to tap into all network capabilities dod officials have reportedly stated that all services network architectures are basically the same network and that once the information systems are integrated all military units will be able to access whatever data they need policy and security features will control the level of access for each individual dod will integrate all the separate architectures using plan known as the joint technical architecture jta and the net centric operations and warfare reference model ncowrm17 new dod requirements development process known as the joint capabilities integration and development system now requires that all technology systems acquired to become part of the gig must include joint operational capabilities as part of their development and delivery18 the dod joint staff has also created new force capability board fcb to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21590 monitor ncw programs for mismatches in funding or mismatches in capability19 the defense department has merged its business systems modernization bsm effort with its global information grid architecture project to ensure that all network architecture efforts comply with gig standards20 however some questions remain to what degree are these dod efforts to integrate differing network architectures proving effective are the immediate needs of the war in iraq reinforcing the use of different network architectures what are some possible vulnerabilities as the enterprise and technology architectures of the gig network become more fully interoperable does increased interoperability also increase the potential for unauthorized access or hacking of the gig under what circumstances might it be better to maintain military communications network using architectures and technologies that are less homogeneous as technology evolves for attacking networks will security for the gig be adequate to insure reliability of equipment and authenticity for users and data 17 brigadier general marc rogers director joint requirements and integration directorate j8 for us joint forces command house armed services
