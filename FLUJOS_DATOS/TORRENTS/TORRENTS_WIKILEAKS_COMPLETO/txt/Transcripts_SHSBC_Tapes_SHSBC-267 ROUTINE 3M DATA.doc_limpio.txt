routine 3m data lecture given on 14 february 1963 okay here we are on 14 february i think its valentines day isnt it14 february ad 13 saint hill special briefing course lecture number onejust be one lecture this evening this is lecture about 3nm 3m it has become and i think its extremely amusing that youve got tiger by the tail called routine 3m because this tiger is going to surprise you very much this is very precise tiger and the only way you can make this tiger go the wrong direction and do the wrong things and upset things in general is by failing utterly to do the usual and to do what youre supposed to do because the first time you do something wrong with this tiger hes going to claw you and after that hes not going to behave well the ill give you an example now on source list you say who or what does the goal so forth oppose or the goaling oppose or somebody or something doing the goal or with the goal whatever it lists the first time you get that out to the end there and grab an item off that line and try to do something with that item youre going to find yourself in very very interesting condition providing you pick up that item call it terminal when it is an oppterm and then oppose it all you have to do is make goof just once on wrong way to or pick up the wrong item or do something like that and all youve got to do is do that just once and after that the rules dont come off well in other words it allows you just one goof and thats too many in other words if you find the item tiger on this goal to be tiger and you find the item something like that off this goals oppose list and then you say well obviously if its to be tiger hehheh hehhehheh to be tiger why naturally thats thats terminal naturally its the terminal am that is the auditor auditing by significance and you dont audit by significance except to this degree if hes got goal to be tiger his first terminal is not going to be tiger think of that its interesting isnt it its going to be somebody who is terrified of tigers its going to be somebody who runs very fast its going to be somebody who is allergic to cats thats going to be the first item up and thats going to be his terminal to that degree youre on the right road with significances but technical tests that is to say precision tests should be made on that first one just because you listed goal oppose dont think youre going to get an oppterm youre not you may get terminal you may get terminal or an oppterm and all youve got to do is take just that one thing the one thing and list it wrong way to and after that things dont fit together now that means this it means that youve done wrong way to you find an item oh yeah that first one will be all right thats what fools you yes its the last rocket reading item on the list taken from the source tiger and then you take that as your reliable item the last one on the list rocket reading everything is fine and you oppose that and you list on down and you might get that one you might get that one pcs starting to look rather green or purple or pink or black or something like that but dont pay any attention to that auditor does pc starts turning some weird color dont ever inquire just plow him in now youve gone that far youve gotten your next ri thats your second ri and then you list from that and you come up with item you go ah and it just disappears into the blue now youre in scramble now you say well maybe if i continued the list of who or what would tiger oppose so you do and the pc gets very coal color he getslooks like coal man who hasnt bathed for three or four lifetimes but so on and you do you find another item and you oppose that and hell wind up with item the list justyouve got couple of rocket reads on it and so then you decide well maybe id really better oppose this tiger further but now you get nothing but rses now you go back and look at the goal and its doing nothing but rs if it reads at all the pc is in pretty bad shape things are looking very grim and finally lightning strikes you get the tremendous idea i wonder if tiger was opposed wrong way to all right so you take tiger now and you treat it as an oppterm which is probably what it should have been in the first place and you list it out and you keep on going youll get someplace youll go on and on and youll get items and youll fit them together but youve upset the frequency of that section of the gpm youve upset its frequency in other words youve messed it up to the degree that for while nothing is going to settle down and youre going to keep having lists which dont have items on them and then having to extend some other list to get an item and then wondering where that appears and then doing goal oppose again and wind up with another item and wonder where it goes on the line plot and oppose that and its just hunt and punch from there on now you get the trickiness of the situation its very tricky therefore i advise you to keep very very strenuous eye on the pc goal oppose all right youve seen this goal rocket read everything is fine so youre going to list it out who or what would the goal oppose all right pc can be expected to turn little bit black on that i wouldnt worry about that but when you take the item which you get then and you take very hightoned item associated with the goal and you say thats terminal and therefore run who or what would this reliable item oppose when it was actually an oppterm youll find the pc starts getting black or green or some other color he discolors he definitely goes down he starts looking older your needle gets tighter and lot of other undesirable things happen now when you notice that you go back and start listing it right way to dont find an item dont find an item dont keep going in some bullheaded fashion just just knock it off right there and list the thing right way to and all of sudden why its running better and your needle loosens up and things look lot better and itll come out and if youve gone that far you wont upset the gpm see you wont upset its frequency then you can go on getting lists where the rocket reading item which is last on the list is the rocket reading item that you want and oppose that properly and so forth and itll go off like clockwork well how critical is this if you find the wrong item on the source list not knowing that the item can appear anyplace you takeyou dont complete the source list and then you take rock slam that appeared on the end of the source list even though there are rocket reads up and down this source list you take this rock slam and you oppose ityou have upset the source list that list is now upset what are you going to do with this list well you just have to somehow or another fumble through how do i mean upset well the funny part of it is is your efforts to complete it are difficult you get odd phenomena occurring such as something that rocket read when it went down on the list now rock slams little oddball things occur now you can always convert rock slam into rocket read if its been rocket read in the first place in other words you saw it go down as rocket read some drillingbig mid rudson the item will turn it back into rocket read that isnt true of all rocks slams you cant do big mid ruds on any rock slam and turn it into rocket read but you can take something which you saw as rocket read which has become rock slam and turn it back into rocket read what im trying to tell you is is be awfully sure of what youre doing and dont go plunging on and on and on and on multiplying error after error after error just because you re supposed to look busy and look like an auditor you be sure of what you do before you do it and its far better just to sit back and give the pc break and look it all over doesnt look good to you go ask somebody get in touch with somebody or if youre in some far reach of the world suspend the auditing intensive until you contact saint hill or something like that its far better for you to do that than to keep plunging on on on on do something new you know the big mistake you can make with 212a is you couldnt find big rock slamming item so you did another list so you couldnt find big rock slamming item so you did another list so you have new source list so then you did another source list so you couldn1 get anyplace there so we did new source list and then we abandoned that and we did new source list you see thats just got to do got to do got to do got to do on and on and on and im telling you you can upset everything by doing that find out where you are before you go on your error is always earlier you always got an earlier error and new action does not fix up this other error see you cant do new action that repairs your old blunder and thats true of both routine 2 and routine 3 if something goes wrong then its something earlier that is wrong and youre not going to repair it by doing something new do you understand that ill give you hypothetical situation of what could happen you get this persons goal thats fine we know how to get goals thats easy at about the fourth item fourth reliable item we find using routine 3 i received most remarkable cable today by the way dispatch rather somebody said that they had read the bulletin about canceling out routine 3 21 and were in terrible condition because they had clearing coaudit and now didnt have anything they can do give you some idea of how people dont read bulletins it goes on to say that you convert the case at once and immediately using the old goal starting from scratch you convert the case right over to routine 3m and this particular person who was trained here he actually didnt bother to read the rest of the bulletin he just went into panic and this tells him right there just convert it but that aside from the fact it shows you how people dont get points that are right there in black and white or red and white so you can count on the fact that this point will be missed let give you this hypothetical case now four items deep and everything starts running wrong they do lists all of sudden there are rocket reads on the listing thats one of the things rocket reads only rses they go back and look at the goal it is now rsing not rocket reading its rsing they keep running out lists and they go totally dead item appears on these lists they all have items on them when theyre written down but you read these items back to the pcgone you may find the first rs on the list is now rsing although there are fifteen rrs followed it you know this is all random stuff see well that doesnt mean anything is wrong with the technique that means something has gone wrong earlier and now look hypothetically you could go on and you could find item after item after item after item straight down the line one after the other and try to patch it in and go back and oppose get the goal oppose again and get new item and then try to go down the line and try to push on out and try to keep going and keep going and going and going and going and then youre gone to hell man because theres way of straightening it out now after while you cant tell whats an oppterm whats terminal whats the package what confronted what and the pc is sitting there saying what the hell whatwhatwhat goes up against what which is who wherewhere is it and hes sitting there and he lists like mad and then you run down the list and theres nothing on it so you extend the list and eventually something appears on it and you take that and oh god heafter while he doesnt know what opposes what your goof is earlier and there is additional action which you can do to repair the goof in other words there isnt new technique which you now do if the thing isnt run according to textbook the reason it stops running according to textbook is you have done something wrong one of the earlier items found is wrong you understand that something has been grabbed wrong off of the list ill give you the chronic errors didnt list the tone arm action out left tone arm action on it didnt go twentyfive items beyond the last rs or rr grabbed terminal and used it as an oppterm or grabbed an oppterm and used it as terminal in other words wrong way to listing for your next item and those are the commonest errors now in view of the fact the fellows in the gpm and hes pretty confused and you ask him if something is terminal or something is an oppterm hes liable to do the most remarkable things hes liable to tell you the terminals are oppterms and oppterms are terminals and actually your mass test you say itthe best wording by the way is who or what would opposejust give him your question that you would use on the top of the list and ask him if more mass turned on with this one or who or what would oppose other way to that ask himread that to him two or three times ask him then if that turned on more mass and then take the one with the less mass thats all very well as test but sometimes he cant tell well very very gingery test listing can ensue but in view of the fact that routine 3 loosens up the needle youre not going to see much needle tighten in other words that needle can tighten up enormously without your noticing it thats one of the bugs you have to look at the quality of item hes putting down youvehes consistently had as his terminal skunk bum 64 tramp you know that sort of thing and thats the type of listing hes doing you see and all of sudden he starts listing this next one as high society swell moneyed person very cultured gentleman well now its bad for an auditor to get too significant about this sort of thing but boy that kind of thing you see hes listing for terminals you call this thing an oppterm and hes listing for terminals actually hes putting oppterms on the list these have always been oppterms for him and it doesnt look right its wrong kind of item hes putting down you should get suspicious and start looking very closely at his face is he darkening up your next thingyour next thing is is the tone arm action is the tone arm action less now the next thing you want to look at and ask him is mass drawing in on him because if hes listing wrong way to the mass comes in the mass comes in and he has hell of time trying to keep the question in his mind by the way he cant remember usually the phrasing of wrong way to items he cant keep the question in his mind as hes trying to list in other words listing is very difficult for him and the more he lists the more hes getting this mass and in comes the mass closer and closer further and further tighter and tighter thatshell tell you about it too but with that you will gradually see that your needle is not very responsive youre not getting much action out of this theres not much tone arm the pc is getting darker in color there are these very specific tests to look at and remember the first wrong way to list will behave like the textbook youll get your item as the last rr on the list youll have rrs it will be an item the pc will have reality on it as an item you get theyou get the liabilities here so its touchy situation which way to are these items ive given you how to how to get around it and ive told you what happens if you dont get around it youve got to always go back to where you did it wrong and now do it right and something will happen and the case will straighten out and feel lot better well now if thats all the tests there were and so forthweve left this to large degree to the auditors observation and weve left this to the pcs statement and so forthand if all these things were wrong you still might get bad judgment on it fortunately theres mechanical test which is the proof of the pudding lets say you found three items and youre listing and everything goes into the blue you dont get any item on the list well you know something now is wrong way to thats what you know that one of the things youve grabbed even though the pc said yes i have always been paragon of virtue see and that was the goal to be virtuous paragon of virtue always have been and so you said all right his goals paragon of virtue so ill list it and fine and everything is fine and youve listed it as terminal ill tell you in the last stages of the goal in the first items which you get on the pc dirty betraying rotten skunk that would cheat anybody is far more likely in fact its probably the item well youyou go back to this thing and you say to the pc well im going to list this paragon of virtue as an oppterm now well you already got an item off of it youre liable to get an argument see routine 3 makes them better so much faster you dont have the real satisfaction of an arc break they just get little bit cross sometimes so they feel little bit cross or misemotional and they really dont even bother to take it out on the auditor they just feel kind of nyah and sometimes wont even express it so you say im going to do this the other way to now were going to treat this paragon of virtue as an oppterm who or what would oppose paragon of virtue well pc will list it and it lists like streak of light and it goes right on out and you find new terminal what do you do with these other two oh well dont upset the pc about them leave them on the plot they undoubtedly fit in but its going to change everything so you dont use them again have you got that you just set those aside dont use either one of them because theyll give you trouble you take what you get from the paragon of virtue right way to and you oppose that but remember it again because youve upset the bank isnt necessarily terminal that you get off of that youre liable to wind up with another oppterm see so from there on youve got to be careful youve got to be more careful than you would be if you did it right the first time the difficult routine 3 is the routine 3 that is started wrong weve already had case out here the source list the auditor actually opposed rock slamming item when there were rrs on the list well that case isnt going to behave exactly according to the book its somehow or anotherhere and there youre going to follow the twentyfive rule and go back and find theres item on the list and have to extend it another twentyfive and then find an item that sticks in you get the idea the exact pattern has been upset by the wrong action so now be alert now the only thing thats going to happen is is things arent going to start appearing early on the list its going to have to be that the lists are longer and sometimes they deadend and sometimes you have to go back and list something else further in order to get new rr or have to go back and get goal oppose new goal oppose list you can always do that its very interesting every time you do goal oppose list weirdly enough you wind up intimately and directly so heres some of the saving graces im going to give you here now everything is going to hell and you cant figure out which is right and which is wrong and what you did wrong and you cant figure out anythingyoure shot youyoure sitting there picking up pieces of paper helplessly crying as the auditor dont you see pc is getting mad and everythings going to hell in balloon you can always do goal oppose and you will wind up with the next item oppterm or terminal thats very amazing ill give you an idea of it youve just done youve just done list which would come up with coventry at the end of the list well if you suspend that list just before you got the item and did goal oppose you would come up with the item coventry on the goal oppose interesting puzzle huh now the funny part of it is if youve got coventry and it is not opposedand here well move into the next oneif youve got coventry as your last item and you do goal oppose and you havent opposed coventry and the only item there thats to come upyoure liable to do goal oppose and come up with coventry thats quite interesting in other words you apparently could do this fantastic thingthis is only theoreticalyou could say do goal oppose list and oppose it you know oppose the ri that you get of course that items liable to appear anyplace on goals oppose list and oppose that see do goal oppose list find nice rr item not two rrs or two rses there and then oppose this reliable item that you get and then not oppose that but go back and do another goal oppose list and youll come up with the next item and then oppose that and then go back and do goal oppose list and youll come up with the next item and you can oppose that get the idea but if you oppose one of those things wrong the bank will be upset and your goal oppose list will go bit awry but you can still go back and always do goal oppose list you got that thats pretty good isnt it lets give you another solution to this situation you have one of these on and on and on characters see or youre supervising somebody who is one see there is action that i should repair i should always do new action you know youve had this and the guy finally hes theres something backwards someplace theres something he should have said oppose tiger and he said who or what would tiger oppose you see wrong way to and the thing has gotten into mess and hes done another goal oppose and now hes not quite sure which of these channels to use and so hes just used both of them and he finally winds up with eight items and they dont quite fit because hes invalidated some of them because hes gotten them by extending lists he ran list all the way out dont you see to an ri and he got that ri but it doesnt fit nowor something he thinks is wrong and they cant figure out where it goes so they go back and extend another list that theyve already found an ri on dont you see theyll come up with new item and they think that invalidates the ri theyd already found on the list which it doesntjust because the thing isnt firing now is reason so theyve taken this new thing and the guy is sitting there with about eight items and you dont know what they oppose and you dontwhat opposes them or where they fit in relationship to each other youve got puzzle on your hands and its mean one because the pc is pretty upset he cant figure it all out you see you told himyou told him you see that hangman opposed judge youve told him that and now youve extended the list out and youve gotten chopping block and he thinks now lets see would hangman oppose chopping block judge would not oppose chopping block but neither would hangman oppose chopping block and hangman hangs people and the chopp and i he doesnt know what youve actually done is found two consecutive terminals or something like this dont you see and you probably now have three items on the terminal side of the line plot and youve got maybe one item on the oppterm side and hes trying to take two of these terminals and make oppterms out of them and package this up and he doesnt know which way hes going hes having hard time heres how you straighten it out you take these eight items and you give each one brief tiger drill to see what fires and you say yes well theywhat fires theyve all been opposed so none of them fire the wrong ones will fire the ones which have not been opposed will still fire its interesting isnt it you can still make them rs even though theyve been listed and you found an item from it if it was all wrong and backwards or something of the sort and it wasnt done right or the list was incomplete youre going to get this weird situation where the thing is still firing so you go back and you take these eight items you tiger drill each one in turn and you see which one fires then you determine whether or not that is terminal or an oppterm and you oppose it and then you determine whether or not the result is terminal or an oppterm and you oppose it and then you determine whether or not the result is terminal or an oppterm and you oppose it and youll get one of these 212 fourway packages and that will box and itll give you something to go on in view of the fact that it will improve the pc enormously why hell feel much better if youve done so now youve got that youve got the charge off dont you see the charge was important because where the pcs atten rock slams or rocket reads his attention still is so you still got his attention on something up here and theyre all his items it doesnt matter how you got them theyre still all his items you know you can sometimes get more items than you needed to get but theyre still his items if they rocket read theyre his items now do this take oneheres the way you package all this up now see youve got the charge off it so hes thinking straighter now take one thing that you know dog dont go on finding more items than just taking the charge off you understand go ahead and find the rest of those items in that little fourway package and the pc isnt going around the bend now now his attention can go onto the other items this is how you use meter to do this take one terminal or one oppterm that youre absolutely sure of you know you were sure that one was terminal or you were sure that one was an opposition terminal youre sure of this take that one and then just read off the remaining seven to him watching the meter and when you read the one that it opposes or opposes it youll get fire theres just little residual fire left there and it goes pssww dont hang around on it too long because its gone and youll get drop of the ta if you start doing this now thats packaging them up so youve got one here now that fired now lets take another one that should come adjacent to it that it might also oppose and put that adjacent to it and then find the remaining youve got three now in line you see now youve gotlets say you had eight youve still got five items floating out around here someplace read the five to him and see which is the best one to go into the next position and that will fire when you get it into position you see and then find one thats very likely as the next position because the one you just find would oppose it or something of the sort and then put that in that position then find out what opposes this and it will psww fire for moment and then you will get your line plot all back together again and the pcll be very very happy you cant do this until youve taken the charge off items the way you take the charge off items is you find which one of those eightill just go over this againyou find which one of those eight as you read it to the pc this is not in packaging you just read it to the pc and youll find one of thems still firing like crazy little tiger drill and this thing goes powpowpowpowpowpowpow take the one that fires best and regardless of whether you thought it was authentic or unauthentic or wrong way to or any other darn thing you establish whether or not its terminal or an oppterm make fourway roundabout package out of that just like in 212 and youve taken the charge off the bank now take the rest of these items and get them back together again all of sudden the pc being oriented on this your line plot starting in with your lowest item which by the way the last item you found ordinarily is still firingyou ignore that one in your other testnow get that opposed and all of sudden it will usually be found that it all comes back on the rules and finishes up very nicely theres how you do it mechanically now the other mistake you can make is to overshoot that happened to so i speak with authority and when you overshoot youre liable to get double group into your next gpm lets say you overshoot like this the pc is maintaining and the meter maintains by being at 30 and having bit of free needle and all that everything is fine and the pc maintains those are the last two items you cant get the first goal to read nothing like this everything is flat everything looks beautiful and then you opposewith an overshoot seeyou oppose the last oppterm you found youre going to go straight into the next gpm now this is not necessarily bad because youre going towithin two items from then oppose oppose you see youre going to have the pcs next goal because hes going to tell you what the goal is and hell tell you two or three versions of it and you just check these two or three versions out and one of them will rocket read like mad thats his goal all right youve got his goal youd better not list pc very far without his goal but actually you cant find two rocket reading items without the pc telling you his goal and the thing rocket reads like mad so you see thats harm on anybody in other words you can find the pcs goal very easily thats nothing to it but to go on without it is mistake and also to now go back and do goal oppose list is mistake of great magnitude why well look you took the two smallestyou took the two basic items of goal one and you opposed let us say the oppterm of those and you shot over here into this other gpm and then you got an item there and you opposedit follows the same rules by the way its the last rocket reading item on the list and so forth the list is complete and then you opposed that properly and you got over here and you got another item the pc says well gee my goal my goal is to be scared person is what the first terminal you found on this new one isa scared person very often by the way itll be something the pc is doing in his current lifetime like salesman and he says thats oh if its the first item at the top of new gpm thats not him even if his goal is to be salesman it is the enemy so youll find his straight goal his goal is probably to be salesman and the first item is to be salesman as the oppterm see thats where you mainly make your mistake youll figure yourself to pieces on this you know you wont realize that the reason the goal isnt practiced any more its totally downgraded he is now haggard buyer dont you see something like this thats as close as he can coming to be salesman all right and youve takenyouve gotten those two items and got the pcs goal now the mistake you make is to do goal oppose list and you do goal oppose list youve had it why well youve already got your two top items of the next gpm now youre going to get two more items except by doing goal oppose because youve entered the gpm maybe at the nonoptimum position you dont know whether those new items that you get from the goal oppose are before or after the items which you have just found and youre going to find yourself carrying two packages down the bank simultaneously the pair from goal opposewhere do they fit and the other pair you got from the last goals opptermwhere do they fit you understand so that if you do sinkthrough like this its perfectly all right for you to do so and probably you will do itmaybe even recommended procedure but i dont say that it is just because it happened to you do this oppose on this key reliable item you do this oppose on it and you fall through into the next gpm see youve gone twentyfive thirty items and that first thing is all run out the goal isnt firing or anything else and then you just one more time you oppose and you go right straight back into the gpm just before that you can get the pcs goal well if you do that dont do the goal oppose you understand dont get fooled because youll find yourself with two pairs of items which youre not sure where theyll fit and the pc gets hopelessly bewildered he gets all mixed up interesting so if you do find your second gpm that lies under the first one when cleared up by doing an oppose you just go on oppose oppose oppose in other words the spiral staircase runs straight down through the first gpm into the second gpm into the third gpm and so on theres the pattern of it you can just do spiral staircases without ever doing another goal oppose but if you ran totally out of items and couldnt find your way anymore you can do goal oppose the essence of all this is when youve found lot of items you want to know which ones are still firing because having been opposed they normally shouldnt be firing now those items which have been opposed reverse way to will still fire therefore youve got to actually straighten them out as terminal or oppterm and do little fourway bing bing and youll find couple of missingcouple of missing items that you otherwise wouldnt have found this is very interesting isnt it now your second gpm below the first gpm is tougher than the first one you shouldyou think it should be easier well it may be shorter but it is tougher its tougher on the pc you see youre running section of track where he was that much bigger and he made his difficulties with more enthusiasm and so therefore youre liable to get into more massy situation in other words its liable to be more massive on your second gpm than on your first one therefore your auditing by that time should be very perfect you shouldnt start goofing on your auditing now the best way to do something like this is to get the fellow down to point where the goal longer fires this is the sequence of goal goal originally before you start to audit the first gpm fires very very sporadically its easily put out its easily lost it easily vanishes you wont even think it exists sometimes goes you see and then you get some items from it with goal oppose list and so on and then it starts firing with great enthusiasm great enthusiasm lots of fire pow pow you never saw such rocket reads as you can get off goal after its had few items run on it they run oh third to half dialthe most enthusiastic thing somebody asked the other daywhere from angeles about reverse rocket reads reverse rocket reads were for the oppterm and right rocket reads for there is such thing as reverse rocket read so this puzzled very much but let us say that we wentthe goal fired with nice rocket read somebody else asked out here the other day he said isnt there theres slow rs so is there such thing as slow rocket read the answer to that is all rocket reads travel by the square root of the umbum theory and they are always exactly on the subject of electrosis of course my answer makes far more sense than the question now rocket reads rocket read if you tell somebody theres slow rocket read youll get fall and hell start running goals because they fall well i can show you any gods quantity of goals that fall rocket read is rocket read it starts out fast and decays slow with great enthusiasm it goes pssww and its over here and going very slow by the time it ends its an enthusiastic response its very satisfactory after an auditor has run goal by 3m hes seen enough rocket readshell never be fooled again in his life because all the items rocket read now the goal goes into this period of very enthusiastic rocket reading i didnt mean to insult angeles angeles is doing fine angeles is doing fine particularly i see angeles is the only one getting any good publicity aroundwhich i appreciate the rocket reading enthusiasm of the goal after youve found four or five or six items is unbounded in other words you only could get this goal to fire by prepcheck one time two times out of three dont you see lot of times youd read it and itd do nothing and then youd read it and itd fire with rocket read and then youso on and nobody could get it prepchecked up you see and so you listed it anyway which is perfectly all right youve seen it rocket read and youve seen it rocket read again it was rocket reading last month and its people have seen it rocket read and the only way youre really going to get it cleaned up is get the items off because the items going into restimulation have dulled its rocket read all right anyhow you never saw such enthusiastic threetimesinarow rocket reading from goal after youve properly run five or six items boy you never saw goal fire like this oh threeinch rocket readpow real enthusiasm every time call itbang you get big rocket read where does it go from there well it goes into periodwhen about half of the gpm is run outlet say ten fourteen fifteen items something like that it goes into period where it rses and itll go this way you call the goal to be tiger rocket read see to be tiger rs nice big rs but to be tigerrs so you say on this goal has anything been suppressed and pc gives you something if you want to get all your suppressions off you know you run suppress fail to reveal and careful of if you just ran those three buttons you could make anything fire anyhow youd run them sort of repetitive and get the real answers back and you can get things to work because of course those are the three left hand buttons now you get this goal drilled perfectly see and its now to where you say to be tigerrocket read to be tigerrocket read to be tigerrocket read and you say boy see you worked three sessionhours to get this goal to fire with rocket reads again and you say haha thats pretty good and you fix it all up and you get the session over and at the end of the line the pc says would you read the goal to just one more time to see if its firing see you say oh why sure you see and you say to be tigerrock slam in other words this thing is getting frayed its moving out toward the edge of the nowexisting gpm and is therefore rock slamming as easily as it rocket reads well you think well thats finished thats finished it goes through the next phase of returning to rocket reading now it goes back to being very solidly rocket reading and itll keep on rocket reading but sporadic and early and late you say to be tiand rocket read to be tigerrocket read you see latent early its not on the button but theyre all rocket reads and that goes into period when youve got about twothirds of the items off the gpm already itll hit very brief period when you hit one of the items and the goal starts discharging and the goal starts discharging psswwpsswwpssww auditors not saying anything you see the goal just starts discharging youve hit the key item youve just found an item that is very very important you see its not the most important or the first item but its very important item and you just watch that thing and instead of the tone arm going down markedly when you find an item boom it rocket reads itself on down and the pc will tell you probably that he can feel the goal firing but it goes psswwpsswwpssww psswwpsswwpssww and you just keep centering your tone arm and you see those rocket reads theyll just go crashcrash crashcrash crashcrash well thats longer rocket read that is barrage and you see this barrage of reads and itthe tone arm sinks down well your goal after that doesnt fire with much enthusiasm but still fires and the rocket reads are still unmistakable but as i say they are early they are late they are one out of three it isnt doing well its sick goal by this time and now very shortly after this maybe two three four items you get the first two items of the bank and theyll be very fundamental the first one will lets say to be tiger well the first item on it is tigerish person see or something like that and the oppterm will be weakling or catnip or something like that in other words those first two will make very fundamental sense theyre quite recognizable and the pc will say theyre recognizable too what you really ought to do when you get that pairyou get that pair all straightened out is read the goal to the pc and youll find out it wont fire and you tryyou try to drill it and it wont fire and you just cant get it it just wont do anything now but the last item you found of this earliest pair for that goal is still firing now what you should do at this state is just package up that bank beautifully just get that gpm all matched off so the pcs happy and youre happy dont go tampering with it particularly but you still might have reverse way to item in it the way you find this out is read all the items off to the pc that youve already found you see get the pc satisfied that theyre all it but reading those items see that one of them doesnt fire if one of them still fires it might have been wrong way to opposed and things might have gotten gummed up at that point well do another little oppose list and get that thing firing right way to and maybe missing item appears or that whole goal bla starts going up in smoke thats the way youre going to get your free needle if you want to take the time to get your free needle youll do it by straightening up those items now its not absolutely necessary but its easier on the pc if you do then you go down here and find this last item youll find its still reading you carefully didnt include that in the number of items which you were assessing and you took that last item which was still reading and you find out if its terminal or oppterm oppose it accordingly and youll drop through to the next gpm you find two items after that the pcyou just ask the pc for his goal hell give his goal thats all he gives you maybe three or four versions of it you find which one rocket reads very fine dandy and so forth make sure youve got the terminal or oppterm straight on that by the way because when they drop through its all upside down now in other words the pc was big person when you got to the bottom you see of thisbecause why hed had long quiet period hed kicked that old gpm over his shoulder hed heaved out his thetan chest and he made himself very very tough and he postulated new goal and there he is into the next bank well he drops from that into the degraded character hes the really degraded character so youve got to be careful that you dont get taken in i told you earlier see isthe next goal let us say is to be dancer and you getyou get as the first crack out of the box you get ballet artist and you say well obviously thats his terminal you knucklehead when you oppose ballet artist who or what would oppose ballet artist you get aa person whoa crippled person who hates the stage see thats his terminal thats where he left that goal thats why he never had any more to do with it dont you see he never had any more to do with it after that he couldnt go any lower hed had it all right so theres the way to find your next goal but theres that little bridge there for you to worry about now ive answered most of the problems that youre going to run into there arent really more problems than i have given you here but im sure somebody is going to dream up some problems that arent germane like should the emeteri shouldnt be sarcastic like this i get it from the instructors you knowbut should the emeter be plugged in during the session you know now should we write up all of the items or should we only take those items which we think look good and write those up should weshould we translate the item into the original language in which it was postulated i dont know i couldi really couldnt stretch my imagination youre going to run into that kind of thing but as far as im concerned the only real trouble that you run into you have to give attention to ive given you in this lecture the gpm is very interestingly put together in that things oppose things and things not oppose things and for some time i have been wondering whether or not we would ever have to use the notoppose and now i find that the notoppose line is the second gpm what the first gpm never opposed was the second gpm and if you ran the notoppose you would probably drop prematurely into the second gpm so this may have happened on the first fourline listing so you probably dont do anything with this at all now can persons bank be so scrambled by early auditing and so messed up that 3m doesnt work well foronly 3m loused up can louse up bank the pc may have been sunk in this bank may have hit various parts of the bank may have had great difficulty in handling the bank may have had all kinds of things wrong and got somatics that never went away and they ran any process there was but frankly there is earlier process that even made dent in gpm it keyed it out that was the only thing that happened to it so youll find the gpm is there intact and routine 3m run straight cuts right into the gpm and the interesting thing that happens as he goes along is there were periods in his auditing when he would hit pictures and sensations which he never understood and never resolved well those uniformly will come up in running the first gpm that is the first goal hell get those pictures out of the road and there they are when he starts running the second gpm he will find out he has some other what he would consider primordialtype pictures more basic more fundamental in his life that he really never paid much attention to of course were getting down past the freudian censor and good thing i would say now in answering up how do you run routine 3m you use all the rules of listing that have been given in the various bulletins how do you find the goal well you can find the goal any way that we have ever found goal you can take 212 terms or oppterms or rocket reading items or stuff like this and make goals lists off of those things we are rich in methods to find the goal these days what if we cant find the goal at all on somebody well weusually hes rock slammer and we have to do 212a package on list one before we can even get him into session this is why he wont answer auditing questions or something like that yet hell answer them on list one dont you see we could prepare the case around there are various ways of handling these but these are all unique problems theyre problems of how do we get the horse to water and 3m is how do we make him drink and theyve always said you couldnt but in our particular case weve got it all taped and we can make the horse drink very well and there goes the gpm and it will run as easy as you follow its exact simple rules and it will run as hard as you goof and think nothing at all of wasting fifteen sessionhours because of goof or finding in ten sessionhours ten ris you get the idea i mean one goof there goesthere goes maybe ten fifteen sessionhours trying to set this thing to rights and finding things and plunging and being upset and all that sort of thing it is only lengthy if you goof so the thing for you to do is to get letterperfect in the handling of it im very happy with this of course and one of the things that has been interesting to about it is for the first time in history probably in this universe we have the adage physician heal thyself come unstuck physicians have never been able to heal themselves look at the ama and so on in this particular case i am quite startled to find out that as messed up and cross way to as we landed into the middle of the second gpm that it isnt fazing im handling it quite well weve got items scattered all over the place now because we landed in the middle of it and did onedid two wrong way to and then compounded it by doing third wrong way to and were still making out and i cant even feel sorry for myself and thats pretty bad thats pretty bad well im getting along fine now and its amazing to when i see what weve been tackling over the years i get ronseye view of it right close up and im quite intrigued im quite intrigued my goals by the way have more gotten in my road than they have assisted because i find in every single instance where i have had difficulty working it was because of my goal and it wasnt anything else i was actually working in spite of my goals and was somehow or another surmounting the gpm all the way along the line and its great you know just to sit back and have it hit in the face and blow off because ive been holding it at arms length for very long time anyway thats enough about thats how you run routine 3m i havent given you on step to step basis but ive given you the data that you most need is how to do it right and how to square it up if you dont and i think youre going to need both equally because its very difficult to tell terminal from an oppterm and pcs lie like hell and sooner or later youre going to do one backwards and wish to god youd never been born well im just calling it to your attention that that is straightenable if you dont carry it too far and if you recognize it soon enough okay thank you very much and good night
