2000 almost 7 billion was spent for such services for teens in 1998 while many youth have used alcohol or other illicit drugs less than 2 recei ved treatment for substance use in 2000 in 1997 costs for such care for children under 18 totaled 604 million in this report the availability of selected mental health and substance abuse services under medicaid and schip for low and moderate income children is explored under schip states may pr ovide coverage by expanding medicaid or creating separate schip program or both data from two crssponsored surveys documenting general limits placed on such rvices as of june 2000 are presented for medicaid including medicaid expansi ons under schip survey results were reported for all 50 states and the distri ct of columbia for separate schip programs survey results we re reported for all 41 progra ms operating in 33 states nearly all medicaid and schip progra ms covered inpatie nt and outpatient mental health services for children and mo st also covered inpa tient detoxification and outpatient substance abuse treatment such benefits we re more frequently unlimited under medicaid than under schip while the majority of medicaid programs covered resi dential treatment centers most schip programs did not in many cases expressing benefit limits as simple quantity eg days of care admissions per year visitshours per ear did not address the full scope of restrictions on coverage other means of limiting benefits were also reported eg use of prior authorization thresholds sp ecific to conditiondiagnosis and treatment plan requirements under schip but not medicaid single quantity limit was often applied to two or more related benef its combined rather than separately for each benefit category coverage policies and be nefit limits for children under medicaid are seldom absolute in part because of special provisions in the law requiring that children receive all medically necessary services authorized in federal statute this guarantee does not exist in schip instead schi p children have access to similar types of benefit packages available in the private sector facing declining revenues and increased expenses some states are implementing number of medicaid cost containment strategies focused on reductions in provider payments and reductions in andor elimination of optional services and populations mostly affecting dults under schip some states are also capping enrollment and increasing benefi ciary costsharing while these proposed strategies appear to leave mental health and substance abuse benefits for children largely intact they could effectively limit access to care finally this report also describes mental health parity and its application to medicaid and schip under curre nt federal law and

smaller proportion just 15 received treatment expend itures for substance abuse services for children under 18 years of age totaled just 604 million nationwide in 19974 which is consistent with the

developmental disabilities and the services provided to them 7 us department of he alth and human services mental health report of the surgeon general 199914 of these costs schip programs were first implemented in 1998 and thus would not have accounted for much of th spending on either mental health or substance abuse services in the late 1990s in this report the availability of mental health and substance abuse services offered to low and moderate income children under medicaid and schip is explored data from two crssponsored state survey s on selected benef its and general limits placed on the amount duration and scope of such services is presented5 specifically this analysis compares the methods stat use in their medicaid versus schip programs to define the breadth of child rens mental health and substance abuse services to provide context for this discussion this report also gives basic overview of who is eligible for medicaid and schip then mental health and substance abuse benefits available under each program are described differences in the design and nature of benefits for children under medicaid and schip are delineated other strategies states use to contain costs under these programs and how those strategies may affect access to care apart from setting limits on benefits is presented finally mental health parity is discussed background what are mental health nd substance abuse services mental health and substance abuse services are designed to ameliorate the negative effects of mental illness and use of or addiction to illicit drugs respectively6 according to the 1999 surgeon ge nerals report on mental health7 mental illness refers to all diagnosable mental disorders which are conditions characterized by alterations in thinking mood or behavior or combinations thereof among children for example attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder is primarily marked by alterations in behavior overactivity andor thinking inability to concentrate

this report the specialty ntal health sector and the general medicalprimary care sector speciality mental health services include services provided by specialized mental health professionals eg psychologists psychiatri c nurses psychiatrists and psychiatric social workers expressly for the provision of mental health care the general medicalprimary care sector consists of health professionals eg family practitioners nurse practitioners internists pediatricians etc who provide the full range of medical and health services incl uding but not exclusively for mental health care various types of mental health treatment are also defined by their duration and setting duration of care is divided into rvices for the treatment of acute conditions versus longterm chronic care settings of care include institutional eg hospital nursing facility residential treatment facilities communitybased eg in public and private schools services provided by mental health professionals in an office and homebased while recent comprehensive analysis of the current system of care for substance abuse in this country is lacking the surgeon general s description of the patchwork nature of the mental health care system likely applies in this context as well substance abuse treatment services are generally of two types 1 detoxification ie to rid the body of the toxic substance and medication management ie to control withdrawal symptoms and dr ug craving and to block the effects of drugs and 2 education counse ling and rehab ilitati on all these services are designed to reduce or liminate use of and dependence on alcohol or illicit drugs to improve th individuals ability to f unction and to minimize other medical and social compli cations of drug abuse8 care is provide d in both

medicaid is federalstate entitlement program that pays for medical services on behalf of certain lowincome indi viduals medicaid provided access to medical services for 443 million pe ople in fy2000

income standard for medically needy cove rage can be up to onethird higher than the statespecific afdc standards as of july 16 1996 the median level for the afdc standard is roughly 44 of th fpl across statesstandards vary considerably among states and different standard s apply to different population groups within state medicaid eligibility is also subject to categorical restrictions generally it is available only to lowincome persons who are aged blind disabled members of families with dependent ch ildren and certain other pregnant women and children in addition cer tain individuals within these categories and with higher income especially those facing high costs for medical care may also be eligible this latter gr oup is sometimes referred to as the medically needy see below for more details the medicaid statute defines over 50 di stinct population groups as potentially eligible including those who must be covered and those for whom coverage is optional eligibility groups have traditiona lly been divided into two classifications the categorically needy and the med ically needy for the purposes of this report this distinction is important because the scope of services that states must provide to categorically needy individuals is much broader than that required for the medically needy in addition to financia l requirements for some eligibility groups disab ility status is also considered for example the mandatory categorically needy coverage group of recipients of supplem ental security income ssi10 requires the presence of disability for children the ssi disability criteria are defined by types of functional impairments affecting daily life and may include mental illness substance abuse is not considered to be disability for ssi purposes and hence for medicaid examples of other major mandatory cat egorically needy groups relevant to children and for which disability criteria apply include 1 members of families who meet the requirements of the former aid to families with dependent children afdc program as in effect on july 16 1996 2 pregnant women and children under six years of age living in families with income up to 133 of the federal poverty level fpl11 and 3 children ages 6 to 19 living in families with income up to 100 of the fpl children with ment illness andor substance abuse problems may qualify for coverage under these latter groups if the fi nancial criteria which in some cases are more generous than the ssi pathway into medicaid are met the medically needy are persons who fit the definition of categorical group eg they are aged disabled children or members of families but who do not meet applicable income andor resource standards states may establish higher income and resource standards for the medically needy12 also such persons may spend down to the medically needy income standard by incurring medical expenses that is net income after subtracting medical expenses is used to determine eligibilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32362crs5 13 centers for medicare and medicaid services medicaid ataglance 2002 publication cms1102402 date 14 an imd is hospital nursing facility or other

prescribed furnishe d or supervised by physician or other licensed practitioner or state or localgovernment operated health care facility and any other health care services or items under schip states do not simply select among these benefits in establishing what is and is not covered rather stat choose from three options when designing their schip programs they may expand their current medicaid program create new separate state program or devise combination of both approaches these program level choices determine the package of benefits offered all 50 states the district of columbia and five territories have schip programs in operation as of august 2003 19 had medicaid expansions 19 had separate stat programs and 18 used combination approach18 states that choose to expand medicaid to new

separate state program may choose any of three other benefit options 1 benchmark benefit package 2 benchmark equivalent coverage or 3 any other benefits plan that the secretary of health and human services determines will provide appropriate coverage to beneficiaries th option chosen determines the set of covered benefits under separate schip programs benchmark benefit package is one of the following three plans 1 the standard blue crossblue shield preferred provider op tion offered under the federal employees health benefits program fehbp 2 the health coverage that is

organization hmo with the largest commercial nonmedicaid enro llment in the state involved benchmark equivalent coverage is defined as pack age of benefits that has the same actuarial value as one of the benchm ark benefit packages state choosing to provide benchmark equivalent coverage must cover each of the benefits in the basic benefits category the benefits in the basic benefits category are inpatient and outpatient hospital services physicians surg ical and medical services lab and xray services and wellbaby and wellchild care including ageappropriate immunizations benchmark equi valent coverage must also include at least 75 of the actuarial value of coverage under the be nchmark plan for each of the benefits in the additional service category these additional services include prescription drugs mental health services vi sion services and hearing services finally as with medicaid states may apply for waivers of program rules to establish demonstration projects to accommodate unique needs currently only few states have such waivers under schip while none of these waivers specifically focus on mental health or substance abuse benefits they may provide access to such services scope of mental health and substance abuse benefits for children snapshot of selected medicaid and schip coverage policies in fy2000 in this section description of the stat survey data collection instruments and implementation issues is provided followe d by important data caveats that affect interpretation of the survey findings presented in the subsequent section survey design and implementation in 2000 the congressional research service crs contracted with the national academy for state health policy nashp to collect data from medicaid and schip state agencies on limits placed on selected benefits fo r children under each program two parallel survey instruments19 were developed with extensive input from state officials one for medicaid programs and one for separate st ate schip programs the benefits data collected from these surveys represent general program policies as of june 2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32362crs10 20 prior authorization also referred to as pr ecertification or preadmission screening means that an entity other than provider eg state medicaid agency fiscal agent or other contractor must approve the delivery of specif ic service to specific beneficiary or the medicaid agency will not reimburse the provider for that service examples of other common utilization controls include 1 concurrent review which means an authorized entity eg state medicaid agency or ctor reviews services while they are being provided to given beneficiary for example hospital stays may be subject to concurrent review when they exceed specified length of stay and 2 utilization review which is generic term encompassing all reviews of service provision whether they happen prospectively concurrently or retrospectivelyfor each benefit category listed on the survey respondents indicated the amount of each service children could receive without special permission that is before prior authorization20 was required if there was point at which prior authorization for continued services was necessary the benefit was identified as unlimited state officials could also indicate that limits for specific benefit were absolute meaning that children could not receive more than the specified amounts even with prior authorization for medicaid survey results were reporte d for all 50 states and the district of columbia for schip survey results were reported for 41 separa programs in 33 states representing the universe of such states and programs in june 2000 two states california and new jersey had tw schip programs with different benefit plans and three states connecticut fl orida and massachusetts each had three schip programs with di fferent benefit plans because there was limited space available on the two survey instruments for questions on coverage of nd limitations placed on benefits only five general mental health and substance abuse service categor ies were included these were inpatient mental health services outpa tient mental health services inpatient detoxification services outpatient substance abuse servi ces and residential treatment center rtc services there is direct onetoone corresponde nce between each of the five service categories included on the surveys and sing coverable benef it listed in medicaid statute this is in part due to the fact that many of the benefit categories listed in medicaid statute identify type of provide r rather than type of service for example wide variety of providers can deliver outpa tient mental health and substance abuse services under medicaid the benefit cat egories listed in statute under which such care is most likely cove red include outpatient hospital services rural health and federally qualified health center services providers that deliver primary medical services and mental health care physician services eg psychiatrists other practitioner services eg psychologists social workers and other clinic services eg community ntal health centers and other specialty mental health or substance abuse clinics inpatient mental health services and inpatient detoxification are most likely covered as inpatient hospital services or inpatient psychiatric serv ices for persons under age 21 such care is typically delivered in general acute care hospitals with distinct psychiatric care wings or designated psychiatric beds or in psychiatric hospitals residential treatment centershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32362crs11 are typically covered as i npatient psychiatric services for persons under 21 or under the rehabilitative services option in general the coverable benefits listed in schip statute are more closely aligned to the service categories included on the surveys however there is not an obvious single benefit category listed in schip statute that would encompass residential treatment centers several coul d apply here eg i npatient mental health services inpatient substance abuse services rehabilitative services in sum each of the five categories of service used in the surveys likely corresponds to multiple benef its listed in both medicaid and schip statute this is an important problem for the survey desi gn because very different limits may apply to outpatient mental health services as used on the surveys when delivered as physician service versus an other clinic service for ex ample for this reason the survey data are imprecise therefore the results from the two surveys represent general statewide benefit limit policies for broad classifications of mental health and substance abuse services fo r children under each program overall the value of the survey data presented here is not in the specific detailed responses that each state agency provided on benefit limits for each service category to further complicate the pict ure both medicaid and schip programs rely on managed care organizations mcos to liver services to most beneficiaries described further below detailed data on variations in benefit limits specific to individual managed care contracts under each state program which can differ from the general criteria delineated in state plans as reported here were not captured also states may have changed coverage policies since june 2000 the point in time represented by the survey data especially during the past few years as they began to face growing state budget constraints and rapi dly rising medicaid costs instead the importance of these survey results lies in the identification of the different methods states use in their medicaid versus schip programs to define the breadth of these services for children also these surv ey data serve as baseline documenting general coverage polic ies in place during strong economic period when many states were expanding their medi caid and schip programs general coverage policies for each of the five mental health and substance abuse benefit categories included in the crssponsored surveys tables 1 through 5 provide summary of whether the service is

general coverage between medicaid and schip programs was for rtcs among schip pr ograms 44 did not make rtc services available in contrast only onefourth of medicaid programs indicated that rtc

appendix f provides definition of abbreviations used in the other appendices 22 for example the limit may be defined as total of 21 days per year for all inpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment for which 2 partial hospitalization program days may be substituted exchanged for one inpatient day methods for limiting benefits for each of the five mental health and substance abuse benefit categories appendices through provide information on the specific limits and monitoring activities identified by states for their medicaid and schip programs when applicable as of june 2000 the methods for limiting benefits are summarized below inpatient mental health services with respect to limits on inpatient mental health services under dicaid many states 23 of 5121 reported using prior authorization or other types of review onl few states sp ecified other kinds of limits in addition to or in lieu of prior au thorization or other review usually in the form of quantity limit on the number of inpatient mental health days per year or per admission in contrast few separa schip programs relied exclusively on prior authorization or other review only for inpatie nt mental health services nearly one half of these programs 17 of 39 indicated that specific quantity limits applied to inpatient mental health services some of these programs 9 of 17 set single overall quantity limit usually expressed in terms of days per year on inpatient mental health services in combination with other related benefits such as inpatient substance abuse treatment or other resi dential care and in some cas outpatient mental health andor substance abuse services or partial hospitalization programs22 this practice of applying single quantity limit to combination of related services may facilitate the tailoring of benefits to ever changing individual needs especially for persons with both mental health and substance abuse problems while at the same time controlling utilization and hence costs for servi ces that tend to be expensive for several programs 8 of 39 state respondents highlighted that quantity limits for inpatient mental health care varied by managed care organization while others established thresholds that varied by type of provider eg general acute care versus psychiatric hospitals 3 of 39 or beneficiary diagnosis or condition eg unlimited care only for children with severe emotiona l disturbances enrolled in behavioral health plan 1 of 39 outpatient mental health services other types of thresholds were used by states to define the breadth of outpatie nt mental health serv ices under medicaid few states 4 of 51 reported that dollarbased limits were used more often other nondollar quantity limits applied ex pressed in units or hours of service or in visits typically per year 14 of 51 in few cases limits varied by type of outpatient mental health service eg individual ve rsus group versus family therapy 2 of 51httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32362crs19 23

rule 66 federal register 7148 jan 22 2001or by whether the provider was physician versus other practitioner 4 of 51 few states 4 of 51 required an initial evaluation and development of treatment plan for each beneficiary which would determine what the medicaid agency would pay for on behalf of such individuals in general the types of limits placed on outpatient mental h ealth services under schip were similiar to those under medicaid nondollar quantity limits were applied in over onehalf of parate schip programs 22 of 40 in several cases 6 of 40 single overall quantity limit for outpatient mental health services in combination with related benefits was use d few programs 2 of 40 used dollar based limits and handful of programs had providerspecific type of service specific or conditionspecific re strictions on outpatient ment health services 4 of 40 outpatient substance abuse services in general under both medicaid and schip the methods used to limit out patient substance buse services were similar to those used to define restrictions on outpatient mental health care see above inpatient detoxification the immediate purpose of hospitalizations for detoxification is to rid the body of the to xic substance under medicaid onehalf of the states 22 of 43 used prior authorizati on or other types of review to monitor such care in few cases 3 of 43 day limits for inpatient detoxification tended to be short eg three to five days probably reflecting per admissionepisode limits otherwise such stays were treated in the same way as any other acute care hospitalization and thus ove rall quantity limits typica lly expressed as total admissions andor total inpa tient days per year on ge neral inpatient acute care applied limits placed on inpatient detoxificati on services under schip were somewhat different from those reported for medicaid for example only three programs relied solely on prior authorization or other review for this benefit onefourth of these programs 9 of 37 used day limits per year or benefit period for such care some set single quantity limit for inpatient detoxification services in combination with other related benefits 4 of 37 few 3 of 37 also specified lifetime limits eg expressed as total dollars or admissions per lifetime on inpatient detoxification services residential treatment center services rtcs are rapidly replacing hospitals in treating children with psychiatric disorders23 in many state medicaid programs 19 of 38 prior authorizati on or other types of reviews accompany admissions to rtcs for children when quantity limits were specified they tended to be day limits per admission or episode 4 of 38httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32362crs20 as reported above under schip most programs did not cover rtc services at all among those which did most 9 of 23 reported day limits per admission episode year or benefit peri od as with many of the other services included in the crssponsored surveys some schip prog rams 5 of 23 established single quantity limit applicable to rtc services in combination with other related institutional and outpatient treatments for mental illness andor substance abuse the nature of coverage and benefit limits for children under medicaid and schip comparing benefit limits under medicaid and schip mu st be done with care because the term limits does not have the same meaning across these two programs this difference in the meaning of limits has implications for both the relative breadth or scope of care availabl under each program as well as efforts to collect uniform comparable da ta on benefit restrictions in addition to defining the amount dura tion and scope of ll covered services states also elect the servi ce delivery systems under which be nefits are made available to medicaid and schip beneficiaries there are two primary service delivery systems under each program feeforservice ffs and managed care generally under ffs state medicaid and schip agencies monitor and control all service delivery in contrast under managed care mcos under contract to states monitor and control all service delivery these two systems of care are not entirely independent of each other there are hybrid models across states that combine various features of ffs and managed care fo r given population or set of interrelated services at any given point in time beneficiaries may obtain all their services under single system or different sets of services under both systems simultaneously under medicaid specific limits on benefits have grown out of the feefor service environment in which medicaid began state medicaid agencies determine which optional services will be covered and set limits on both mandatory and optional services such agencies also establish other utilization controls eg prior authorization to ensure that beneficiaries do not receive services they do not need or in amounts greater than that needed to serve their medical purpose providers receive payments from the state based on rates established by the state for given benefit or type of provider under ffs health care providers must obtain special permission or approval from the state to continue delivery of dically necessary services beyond the pre defined standard upper limit set by the state fo r given benefit for example state medicaid plan may limit coverage of outpatient mental health services to 24 visits per year but children who need more than 24 such visits in year can obtain additional visits as long as the provider of care demonstrates the medical necessity for more visits stated limits on benefits reflect what providers can generally expect to be paid for in the absence of official clearance for more services rather than definitive limits on what beneficiaries ma receive the feeforservice delivery system is generally used by individuals whose medicaid eligibility group eg the aged and individuals with disabilities or geographic location eg rural areas is nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32362crs21 served through managed care or for pe rsons who opt out when managed care is voluntary most medicaid children without disabilitie s receive services in the managed care setting under this system of care state medicaid agencies negotiate different benefit plans with one or more contracted managed care organizations mcos mcos may be commercial plans eg kaiser permanente that serve private sector beneficiaries as well as medi caid andor schip enrollees in some cases states also contract with medicaidonly plans state medicaid agencies generally pay each mco fixed prospectively determined monthly fee for each beneficiary enrolled in turn the mcos establish networks of pa rticipating providers to deliver the agreed upon covered services and pay those providers negotiated ra tes benefit plans may be comprehensive or limited in scope eg behavioral health services only also referred to as carve out plans there are lik ely to be variations in coverage of and limits placed on specific benefits across medi caid managed care plans within given state managed care plans also employ utilization controls to monitor service delivery and to insure that benefits provided are medically necessary similar to the point at which prior authorization begins in the feeforservice delivery system in medicaid even though most medicaid programs pr ovide services through managed care plans especially for children without di sabilities and fa milies most states continue to operate significant parallel feefors ervice programs under medicaid managed care plan if benefit limits are met by medicaid child and additional services are medically necessary beyond the contract ual agreement between the mco and the medicaid agency additional funding may be provided to the mco for extended services or that child may continue to r eceive such services in the feeforservice setting coverage policies and benefit limits described in state medicaid plans are seldom absolute especially for children due to the medical necessity criterion but also because of epsdt under both feeforservice and managed care for nearly all medicaid children states are required to provide all federallyallowed treatment to correct identified problems even if the specific treatment needed is not otherwise covered under states medicaid plan as result when medicaid agency reports that specific benefit is not covered for children that means the service is only available when delivery of that service meets the epsdt requirement in these circumstances providers typically go throug h prior authorization process to receive payment for what are sometimes called epsdt extended benefits unlike medicaid but consistent with fede ral statute separa schip programs are modeled after private sector commerc ial insurance products the requirement to use benchmark plans or act uarial equivalents of those plans most of which are state employee health plans or commercial hmo plans provides the framework for defining benefit limits under schip managed care is the predominant service delivery system at the time of the crssponsored survey june 2000 all but five schip programs alabama north carolina north dakota west virginia and wyoming contracted with one or more managed care or indemnity plans to deliver care to schip childrenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32362crs22 24 national association of state budget officers medicaid and other state healthcare issues current trends june 2003california contracted with 23 comprehensive health plans some states also use ffs delivery system under commercial insurance products benefits are always limited by medical necessity but other limits when applicable vary by insurance product as do the points at which each insu rer monitors service delivery for medical need and appropriatene ss payments to providers participating in these plans may be altered based on the outcome of such service utilization reviews which can in turn affect access to care in the crssponsored survey some of th benefits for whic h data on limits were collected ie residential treatment cen ters are commonly covered under medicaid but not routinely included in commercia l insurance products and hence schip there is federal epsdt requirement under schip that would guarantee the availability of uncommon but coverable benefits in sum small but significant pr oportion of children have mental health problems some also suffer from the cons equences of substance abuse medicaid and schip provide access to an array of i npatient and outpatient services that can help such children in low to moderate income families overcome these difficulties however the breadth of be nefits available under these two programs likely differs within and across states limits on benef its for the lowest income children under medicaid are seldom absolute while rest rictions on services for higher income children under schip may be schip child ren have access to the same types of benefit packages available in the pr ivate sector as intended by congress changes in benefits under medicaid and schip today given the recent economic downturn some members of congress and advocates for children have raised concerns about th elimination or reduction in benefits under state health care programs on average medicaid expenditures account for approximately 12 of the stat funded portion of state budgets much of the recent increases in costs have been attributed to pharmaceuticals nursing home communitybased longterm care services and payments to managed care plans however enrollment increases have also contributed to significant growth in medicaid costs in the past few years faced with declining re venues and increasing expenses states proposed or implemented number of medicaid cost cont ainment strategies for fiscal years 2003 and 200424 the majority of changes have focused on prescription drug costs followed by reductions in provider reimbursement rates and the elimination or reduction in optional services and populations examples of such actions include eliminating coverage for certa in adults and noncustodial parents and eliminating dental chiropractic optometry and podiatry services in addition many states are delaying or rescinding plans for expansions of services some states are also facing problematic enrollment growth and limited revenues in their schip programs about onethird of states have eith er implemented costhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32362crs23 25 for detailed discussion of this issue see

such as reducing pharmacy reimbursement rates and increasing prior authorization for pharmaceuticals carry over to schip detailed statelevel information on explicit plans to reduce benefits for children under either program is not available while the cost containment strategies summarized above appear to leave mental health and substance abuse benefits for children largely intact these actions may still effectively reduce access to such care in the near term mental health parity finally what about ntal health parity25 while the crssponsored surveys described in this report do not address this question mental health parity is leading policy issue for the mental health commun ity and providers as well as lawmakers in 1996 congress enacted the mental health parity act mhpa which established new federa l standards for mental health coverage offered by group health plans the mhpa however is limited in scope and does not compel group plans to offer fullparity mental health coverage it requires group plans that choose to provide mental health bene fits to adopt the same nnual and lifetime dollar limits on their coverage of mental and physical illnesses group plans may still impose more restrictive treatment limitations and cost sharing requirements on their mental health coverage mhpa specifically excludes treatment of substance abuse and chemical dependency from the definition of mental health benefits both medicaid managed care plans and sc hip programs must comply with the mhpa specifically all prepaid medicaid managed care contracts that cover medicalsurgical benefits nd mental health benefits must comply with mhpa without exemptions the mhpa does not apply to feeforservice arrangements because state medicaid agencies do not meet the defi nition of group health plan26 in separate schip programs to the extent that health insurance issuer offers group health insurance coverage which can include but is not limited to managed care the mhpa applies congress has reauthorized the mhpa through december 31 2004 lawmakers introduced fullparity legislation in the 107th congress but it failed to pass the legislation which has been reintroduced in the 108th congress s 486hr 953 would expand the mhpa by requiring group health plans to impose the same treatment limitations and financial requirements on their mental health coverage ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32362crs24 they do on their medical and surgical cove rage the bills are strongly supported by advocates for the mentally ill and have broad bipartisan support in congress employers and health insurance organiza tions oppose fullparity legislation because of concerns that it will drive up costs as with the mhpa both medicaid managed care plans and schip programs would have to comply with the fullparity provisions in s 486hr 953httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32362 crs25 appendix specified limits andor monitoring of inpatient mental health services for children under
