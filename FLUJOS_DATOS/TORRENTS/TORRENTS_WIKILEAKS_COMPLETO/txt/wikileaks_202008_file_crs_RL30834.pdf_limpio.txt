increasingly recognized as critical element in impr oving education policymakers seeking to address teacher quality face many serious ch allenges among these challenges are the lack of consensus on what makes teacher effective the vast size and decentralized organization of k12 educa tion and problems with teacher supply and demand the federal government is not responsib for the preparation hiring and work life of teachers these responsibilities rest with states and localities nevertheless the federal government primar ily through the us depar tment of education ed provides substantial resources to strengthen the k12 teaching force recently the focus of federal support has expanded beyond inservice training to include greater emphasis on teacher prep aration recruitment and hiring further the federal government is attempting to strengthen accountability for teacher quality there is continuing interest in providi ng broad flexible assistance coupled with accountability the child left behind act of 2001 pl 107110 reauthorized the elementary and secondary education act esea replacing the eisenhower professional developm ent program and the class si ze reduction program with single formula grant program supporting an array of activitie s to improve the elementary and secondary t eaching force in addition among other provisions the reauthorized esea includes separate program of math and science partnerships to improve teaching in those fields in amending the esea the child left behind act also established requirements that k12 teachers be highly qualified and set deadlines for when those requirements had to be met thes highly qualified teacher requirements have generated questions about th eir implementation some of which ed has sought to address through regulations and nonregulatory guidance the higher education act hea author izes funding to improve k12 teacher preparation programs in higher educa tion institutions it includes accountability provisions for the quality of the graduates from these programs it also supports efforts to increase teacher recruitment both the esea and hea may be considered for reauthorization by the 110th

public k12 education despite th efforts many remain concerned about the performance of today s schools and students throughout this process recurrent objective has been improvement of the public k12 teaching force the attention being paid to teacher quality has ri sen dramatically in recent years this was particularly true as the congress reauthorized the elementary and secondary education act esea in 2002 it remains true today and may be part of the process of reauthorizing the higher education act hea the hea authorizes several programs to imp rove k12 teacher prepar ation and recruitment this report provides brie f overview of some of the most salient issues regarding the k12 teaching force describes the current federal role in this area describes major federal programs and tracks major legislative action by the congress it will be update d as major action occurs teachers at the center many education reformers have long recognized the importance of improving the k12 teaching force while concurren tly marshaling teachers support for the process of reform the increasing focus on teacher quality has been fueled by several recent analyses concluding that among all schoolbased factors teacher quality is the most important that some teachers are much more effective than others with similar students and that teacher quality may specially affect the achievement of disadvantaged students challenges policymakers face many serious challenges in their efforts to improve teacher quality some of these challenges are considered briefly below identifying what makes teacher effective although some research has found certain teacher attributes positively related to student achievement such as verbal ability subject matter knowledge pedagogical knowledge years of experience and certif ication status there is consensus on what makes teacher effective nevertheless policymakers are focusing on improving certain of these attributes particularly subject matter knowledge andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30834crs2 certification status in an effort to increase the likelihood that teachers will be effective with their students k12 organization and size the organization and size of the public k12 educational enterprise poses significant challenge to teacher quality improvement some 3 million teachers are employed in more than 89000 schools located in some 14800 school districts this is decentralized system states and localities have legal and administrative responsibility for k12 education the recruitment hiring compensation and retention of teachers are matte rs typically controlled by di stricts and in part schools and states teacher preparation generally takes place in higher education institutions teacher assignments and evaluations ar often the domain of schools teacher certification and tenure are the province of states teacher supply and demand it may be difficult in the coming decade to raise k12 teacher quality when concerns about teacher quantity are growin g warnings of potential shortage of teachers abound precipitated by projected increases in student enrollment and an anticipated surge in retirements this has prompted states and localities to initiate many recruitment efforts some analysts question whether rising demand for teachers necessarily portends shortage they point out that teaching can draw from large reserve pool those who might be newly drawn into teaching and those who have taught but are longer teaching and that teacher preparation programs prepare more individuals for teaching than go into teaching also many teachers leave the profession early in their careers efforts to stem this attriti on may help address s upply issues and raise teacher quality reportedly leav ers may be higher academic performers than stayers certification standards state certification standards governing who can teach clearly contribute to the quality of the teaching force as well as to the number of individuals available for teaching some critics of current certifica tion practices call for very substantial raising of standards call which some states have heeded other critics of current certification complain that raising the certification hurdles can impose unreasonable barriers to the entry of potentially high quality teachers particularly midcareer changers or may prompt dist ricts to circumvent these re quirements many observers assert that teacher quality and quantity may be serv ed under welldesigned alternatives to traditiona l certification though some analysts warn that poorly designed alternative certification may create backdoor into teaching for unprepared individuals outoffield assignments another major challenge for policymakers is reducing the extent to which teachers are currently teaching outoffield that is teaching classes for which theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30834crs3 1 quality counts 2003 ensuring highly qualified teacher for every classroom education week january 9 2003have inadequate content knowledge in 19992000 over fifth of secondary school students took at least one class from t eacher who neither majored nor minored in that subject in college over third received instruction in at least one class from teacher who was not certified in the subject taught and did not have major in that subject1 outoffield teaching assignments are function of many local primarily schoolbased factors how to change these practices and policies is an open question as is the impact of such ac tion on the supply of qualified teachers teacher preparat ion and pr ofessional development efforts to address the quality of the t eaching force often look to the preservice training process and to prof essional development ie in service training for current teachers there is concern that gradua tes of teacher education institutions are inadequately prepared to teach to high standards some states are holding these institutions accountable for the quality of thei r graduates these institutions are taking steps to strengthen their programs traditionally professional velopment has been delivered to current teachers in sporadic and uncoordi nated fashion efforts to improve professional development are being undertaken with the goal of remedying the academic and pedagogic deficiencies of current teachers daunting task given the magnitude of the teaching force compensation reform of teacher compensation is fre quent element in initiatives to improve k12 teacher quality see crs report rl30217 performancebased pay for teachers it is argued that highly qualifie d individuals are dissuaded from entering or staying in teaching because current compensation is not competitive and does not reward quality past compensation reforms have generally been shortlived partly because it has proven difficult to address concerns about whether different pay schedules particularly mer it based pay systems can be implemented objectively fairly and consistently some compensati on reform may be par ticularly expensive as well tenure some educators and policymakers see state tenure laws as substantial challenge to teacher quality improvement to its critics tenure protects incompetent teachers creating dismissal process that is too costly and time consuming to its defenders tenure protects k12 teachers from arbitrary biased and unfair dismissal and may provide for stable workforce states have been reforming tenure by for example extending the period in which beginning teachers can be evaluated and dismissed expanding the reasons for dismissal and creating time limits for the dismissal processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30834crs4 unionization the vast majority of teachers are mbers of teachers unions critics have posited that the major teachers unions have been substantially more interested in job protection and higher salaries than in improving the quality of the teaching force union proponents point to examples of c ooperation with different reform efforts including steps to assist underperforming teachers and to remove teachers who do not make necessary improveme nts nevertheless as reform efforts increasingly focus on teacher quality the challenges to union policies and practices are likely to increase federal role the federal government is not responsible for preparing recruiting certifying compensating testing tenuring and structuring the working conditions of k12 teachers these responsibilities rest with st ates and localities traditionally these areas have been viewed as largely outside the reach of the federal government nevertheless over the past several year s the federal government has become increasing involved in issues of teacher quality and quantity the federal government funds many pr ograms supporting k12 teaching some of these are explicitly targeted to teachers others with broa der focus nevertheless support such activities as teacher training over the past several years the congress has been redefining the federal role re lative to targeted support of k12 teachers funding although federal aid in this area come s from multiple federal agencies ed is the primary source some 34 billion of the departments fy2008 appropriation was spent on activities directed specifically to k12 teachers this funding includes among other programs 294 billion for the principal and teacher training and recruiting fund 144 million for the troopstoteachers and 437 million for the transition to teaching programs and 337 million for the higher education acts teacher quality enhancement program all of these programs are described below significant levels of funding also suppor t teachers under other programs that are not targeted to teachers eg the esea title i program changing federal role the child left behind act marked significant shift in the federal role with regard to k12 teachers and teaching but in some ways it is the most recent in series of congressional actions modifying th at federal role these changes in the federal role are described below immediately prior to the 105th congress federal aid for k12 teaching was largely focused on inservice training w ith limited funding for preservice training and recruitment the 105th congress began change in this focus by enacting amendments in 1998 to the higher educa tion act hea that included the teacherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30834crs5 2 pl 10665 national defense authoriza tion act for fy2000 signed on october 5 1999 transferred the troops to teachers program from the defense and transportation departments to the education departmentquality enhancement program significantly these amendments also had broad based accountability requirements for teacher education programs see crs report rl31254 pass rates as an accountability asure for teacher education programs by james b seedman and bonnie f mangan funded states and their higher education institutions are now required to report publicly on teacher preparation including the pa ss rates of graduate s on certification assessments states must identify lowperforming teacher prep aration programs if lowperforming programs lose state approval or fina ncing their institutions cannot receive professional development funding from ed and cannot accept or enroll any hea aided student in the teacher education program in an effort to improve student performance the 105th congress also appropriated funding for the ge neral hiring of new qualif ied teachers to reduce class size the program was appr opriated funding for three fiscal years 12 billion for fy1999 13 b illion for fy 2000 and 1623 billion for fy2001 this program broke new ground with its exp licit and primary focus on fe deral support for the hiring of teachers further until enactment of th child left behind act this program and the eisenhower professi onal development program t itle ii of the esea under prior law had been the two largest fe deral initiatives targeting support to k12 teachers and teaching the teacher and principal training and recruiting fund in the reauthorized esea replaced those two programs and is the largest single source of federal support directed to k12 teaching the 106th congress continued this redefinition of the federal role in this area for fy2001 the congress specified that appropriated amounts for the eisenhower program above the fy2000 leve l 335 million were to be spent on such activities as reducing the percentage of teachers w ithout certification or with emergency or provisional certification the percentage teaching out of field or the percentage lacking requisite content knowledge thes excess funds could also be directed to such other activities as mentoring for ne w teachers multiweek institutes providing professional development and retention efforts for teachers with record of increasing lowincome students academic achievement among other new money for teachers approved in the fy2001 appr opriations for ed was 3 million for the troopstot eachers program supporting entry of former military personnel into teaching available for transfer from ed to the department of defense2 and 31 million for new teacher recruitment activitie s targeting midcareer professionals in other occupations and highly qualified recent college graduates with bas in fields other than education the 107th congress further expanded the federa l role in issues of teacher quality and quantity on january 8 2002 the child left behind act of 2001 was signed into law pl 107110 in amending and reauthorizing the esea this legislation authorized federal support for broad rray of activities to improve k12 teaching ranging from recruitment to hiring to rete ntion it more firmly focused federal interest on teacher quality by for exampl requiring all co re academic subjecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30834crs6 teacher to be highly qualified the pr ograms and provisions added to the esea by the

to ensure that the 20052006 dead line is met and an annual increase in the percentage of teachers receiving high quality profe ssional development each lea receiving title i part funding must have plan to ensure that all of its teachers are highly qualified by the 20052006 deadline in addition beginning with the first day of the 20022003 school year any lea receiving title i funding must ensure

objectives questions have been raised about th scope of the application of these requirements the meaning of some of the requirements and the ability of different kinds of districts to meet them ed has sought to address some of these concerns through regulation nonregulatory guidan ce and other means early in the implementation of these provisions it was asked whether they apply to all teachers including vocational education teachers special education teachers or others not teaching core academic subject s final regulations for the title i program published december 2 2002 in the federal register apply these requirements only to core academic subject teachers ed noted that these requirements would apply to vocational education teacher or special education teacher providing instruction in core academic subject the final regulations also clarify that teacher in an alternative certification program will have maximum of three years in which to become fully certified without being in violation of the highly qualified requirements regarding certification this allowance is made only fo r teacher in an alternative certification program who is receiving high quality professional devel
