authorized by the small business job protection act of 1996 is meant to induce employers to hire members of families receiving benefits under the temporary assistance to needy families tanf program and other groups thought to experience employment problems regardless of general economic conditions eg food stamp recipients and exfelons shortly thereafter congress passed the welfaretowork wtw tax credit in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 to focus specifically on more disadvantaged tanf recipients about ten years later the 109 th congress folded the wtw credit into revised wotc as part of the tax relief and health care act of 2006 provisions to increase the minimum wage and to provide tax relief to small businesses were included in emergency supplemental appropriations during the 110th congress the us troop readiness veterans care katrina recovery and iraq accountability act of 2007 was signed into law on may 25 2007 pl 11028 extends the wotc for threeandonehalf years through august

discharged or released from active duty in the armed forces or b having been unemployed for at least six months during the oneyear period ending on the hiring date and doubled to 12000 the maximum wage against which the subsidy rate could be applied for this component of the veterans group additionally the law expands the age range of highrisk youth from 18 to 24yearolds to include 25 to 39yearolds and renamed the wotceligible group designated community residents it also clarifies the definition of vocational rehabilitation referrals adds rural renewal county to the places of residence for designated community residents and allows the wotc and tip credit against the amt subsequently during the 110 th congress legislation concerning the wotc was introduced to among other

employing individuals two temporary income tax creditsthe work opportunity tax credit wotc and the welfaretowork wtw tax creditwere initiated in the mid1990s to encourage for profit employers to hire from groups thought to experience difficulties in the labor market both in good and bad economic times about decade later the 109th congress incorporated the wtw credit into the wotc and the 110th

that is it attempts to steer employers toward hiring members of prescribed groups from whom they would otherwise have shied away by its very nature selective subsidy favors individuals from the designated population over other jobseekers and more generally as an employment subsidy it favors laborintensive over capitalintensive enterprises selective employment programs often focus on workers believed to have relatively low skill levels because low productivity makes them less attractive to employers than other labor force participants the groups have comparatively high unemployment rates and low wages regardless of aggregate economic conditions subsidyin the instant case tax expenditure rather than direct appropriated expenditurelessens the productivity gap between target group members and other workers it thus is intended to make businesses more willing than they otherwise would have been to hire from the designated populations the wotc is not an incremental subsidy because employers do not have to create new jobs ie increase the size of their workforces in order to get the credit the programs design does not benefit faster over slowergrowing firms it does however favor companies that normally experience rapid labor turnover or companies that are willing to fire ineligible employees and replace them with eligible workers 1 at the time the wtw credit was being considered some members expressed concern about the chance for displacement of the working poor in light of contemporaneous efforts to move large numbers of welfare recipients into jobs2 the results of report the general accounting office issued in 2001 suggested that the likelihood of employers engaging in churning3 or displacement to maximize receipt of the wotc is low4 1 the willingness of companies to fire ineligible employees nd replace them with eligible j ob applicants is likely to be influenced by labor market conditions or by hiring and training costs 2 robert pear clinton will

public policy community also were mindful of the experience with similar program in effect from 1978 to 1994 the targeted jobs tax credit tjtc the tjtc was criticized for the extent of windfall gains the credit was not factor in the hiring decisions of most employers who claimed it in part because they normally hired persons like those in the eligible groups ie lowskilled lowwage workers thus taxpayers appear to have largely subsidized firms for doing what they would have done in the absence of the program tjtc also was criticized for the degree of assistance it provided individuals for whom the credit was claimed the hope was that through work experience and onthejob training received while in subsidized positions the workers would be better able to subsequently obtain unsubsidized higherpaying jobs however the short tenure of many tjtc hires made it unlikely that subsidized employment much improved their future job prospects 5 the wotc was designed to try to mitigate these criticisms some target groups were reformulated with the intention of focusing more narrowly on those who truly need credit for firms to risk hiring them the certification process was modified toward the same end that is to minimize windfall profits in addition the mini mum period target group member must remain on the payroll in order for an employer to claim credit was lengthened from 120 hours or 90 days under the tjtc to enable eligible hires to get the kind of work experience that would improve their longterm job opportunities however some analysts were skeptical that these program changes would prove effective at remedying the problems 6 since the wotcs inception changes have been made that make it more closely resemble the tjtc eg the retention period was reduced to 120 hours from 400 hours or 180 days g3g561g6g142g156g140g155g146g153g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g156g561 g25g17g22g5g561 through august 31 2011 forprofit employers are

certifications issued to employers disaggregated by state hourly wage and broad occupational group the number of certifications could well be more than the number of employees for whom em ployers claim credits because not all eligible hires fulfill the retention requirement the government does not collect statistics on the number of individuals for whom the credits actually are claimed it would be difficult to reconcile the number of certifications and the number of credits claimed in given year because companies that receive certification for an eligible individual hired late in one year may not claim credit for them until the following year when the retention requirement has been met in addition credits claimed for persons certified in one year may be applied against income tax

certifications for tanf eligibles or 74713 less the marked improvement in employers willingness to hire longterm family assistance recipients is particularly notable in light of their initially expressed reluctance toward utilizing the wtw credit versus the wotc because of the formers longer retention requirement and more disadvantaged eligible group the tightening labor market through 2000 likely was contributory factor the number of wtw certifications subsequently declined as the economy experienced recession and jobless recovery through summer 2003 in fy2001 wtw certifications were

tax credits have been limited in purpose or scale shortly after the state employment security agencies sesa began implementing the wotc in late 1996 the united states department of labor dol contracted for an evaluation of its administrative process which as noted above is the same as the wtw credits among other things brought out in the august 1997 study state wotc coordina tors recommended that the paperwork burden on employers be reduced and form 8850 be made less confusing so that small employers particularly and all forprofit employers generally would be more inclined to participate26 in march 2001 the general accounting office gao surveyed sample of employers who utilized the wotc program in two states with high certification levels namely california and texas the studys chief goal was to ascertain whether employers fire workers who never were eligible for the wotc or who longer are eligible for the wotc in order to maximize credit receipt the gao concluded thatwhile it coul d not definitely determine the extent of displacement and churning respectively across all employers who participate in the program the sample data suggest that employers do not view the practices as costeffective and therefore presumably would not engage in them much if at all gaos estimate that the wotc offsets less than onehalf of the cost of recruiting hiring and training crediteligible workers on average supports the employers belief that the practices are not costeffective regarding churning specifically certified workers in the two states were found to be more frequently terminated when their earnings totaled about 6000 the creditmaximizing level 27 study of the wotcwtw credit that was undertaken for the dol also was released in march 2001 interviews of 16 establishments that had used the credits were conducted in five states california georgia maryland missouri and wi sconsin as in the case of the gao study the authors emphasized that their findings cannot be extrapolated to all other user firms among the reports results the tax credits play little or role in the 16 employers recruitment policies suggesting that employers would have hired members of the target groups even if the programs were not available as crediteligible hires job performance work readiness attendance and punctuality were like those of ineligible employees in similar positions most of the interviewed employers thought there was need for special training or counseling programs the targetgroup members who were hired exhibited the high rates of turnover typical of lowwage workers 28 which meant that the interviewed employers were able to claim the maximum credit for relatively few eligible hires the 16 employers gave the programs positive assessment although they offered some suggestions for improvement having to do with program administration 26 westat process evaluation of the wotc program dol employment and training administration office of strategic

target group eligibility criteria29 and promotion of the program eg increase use of conditional certifications30 the reports authors recommended among other things that study with larger representative sample of employers be conducted as these observations do raise question about the extent to which the tax credit is serving the purpose for which it is intendedto serve as an economic incentive to encourage employers to hire individuals from specified target groups whom they would not have hired in the absence of the credit 31 an october 2002 analysis of participation rates for the wotcs two largest eligible groups tanf recipients and food stamp youthestimated that relatively few eligible new hires have the credit claimed for them in 1999 employers were estimated to have claimed the wotc for less than onethird of newly employed persons from the tanf group and for less than onefifth of newly employed persons from the food stamp youth group participation rates did increase considerably between 1997 and 1999 however this was due not just to an increase in credit claiming but also to substantial decrease in the size of the eligible populations during implementation of welfare reform the author suggested various reasons for the low participation rates including that the fairly short job tenure of the crediteligible population like that of other lowwage individuals translates into small tax credit value per wotceligible hire in other words employers may be discouraged by the low returns to wotcwtw participation for those workers whose employment ends before the 40 percent credit is reached ie before the individual has worked 400 hours or more32 in december 2002 report the gao attempted to examine specifically the few tax incentives available for hiring retaining and accommodating workers with disabilities persons with disabilities are the focus of two wotceligible groups namely vocational rehabilitation referrals and supplemental security income ssi recipients based upon an analysis of 1999 tax year data from the internal revenue service irs the gao found that relatively few employers utilize the wotc data on employer usage by wotceligible group are not available from irs data however according to the agencys interviews with government officials and academic experts fairly few persons with disabilities may have the credit claimed for them because wotc eligibility is limited to disabled individuals receiving publicly funded vocational rehabilitation or ssi benefits perhaps not surprisingly then interviewees supported expanding the wotcs coverage of disabled persons the agency also identified two national surveys related to disability employment issues which determined that very small share of supervisors of employees with disabilities were aware of employment tax incentives and that human resource managers regarded business tax incentives as less effective than any of the following measures in reducing obstacles 29 these two recommendations echo those made in the 1997 process evaluation 30 see the section on program administration supra for the definition of conditional certification and why it may be little
