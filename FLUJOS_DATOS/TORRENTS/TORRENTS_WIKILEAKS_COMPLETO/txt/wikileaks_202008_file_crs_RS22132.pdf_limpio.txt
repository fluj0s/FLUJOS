egislative veto an oversight mechanism used by congress for half century to monitor and control the executive branch without having to pass law c ongress could approve or disapprove executive decisions through legislative actions that we re short of public law onehouse vetoes twohouse vetoes and committee vetoes thos legislative actions were not submitted to the president for his signature or veto writing for the majority chief justice warren burger invalidated the legislative veto the court ruled that whenever cong ressional action has the purpose and effect of altering the legal rights duties and relations of persons outside the legislative branch congress must act through both houses in b ill or resolution submitted to the president 462 us 919 at 952 congress therefore had to comply with two elements of the constitution bicameralism passage by both houses and the presentation clause presenting bill to the president for his signature or veto all legislative vetoes violated the latter principle because they were not presented to the president some legislative vetoes violated bicameralis m because only one house or committee had to exercise the congressional approval or disapproval under chadha congress could longer exercise executive control merely by passing simple resolutions adopted by either chamberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22132crs2 concurrent resolutions passed by both chambe rs but not sent to the president or by committee action in response to chadha congress eliminated the legislative veto from number of statutes the legislative veto continues however as practical accommodation between executive agencies and congressional committees crs review of statutes enacted since 1983 reveals that more than 400 new legislativ vetoes usually of the committee variety have been enacted since chadha in addition legislative vetoes of an informal and nonstatutory nature continue to affect executiv elegislative relations practice in this area has been determined more by pragmatic agreements hammered out between the elected branches than by doctrines fashione d and announced by the supreme court compliance with chadha following the supreme courts rulin g in 1983 congress amended number of statutes by deleting legislative vetoes and replacing them with joint resolutions which must pass each house and be submitted to the president congress replaced the onehouse veto in the executive reorganization statute w ith joint resolution of approval 98 stat 3192 1984 although this satisfied the twin requirements of chadha bicameralism and presentment the position of the president was weakened the president now had to obtain the approval of both houses within specified number of days in order to reorganize executive agencies under the procedure that operated before chadha reorganization plan automatically became effective within fixed number of days unless one house acted to disapprove the shift to joint resolution of approval meant that congress had in effect onehouse veto the refusal of one house to support joint resolution of approval would defeat pres idents reorganization proposal the new procedure was apparently c onsidered so burdensome that the reagan administration decided not to request renewal of re organization authority after it expired congress also replaced several legislative vetoes in the district of columbia home rule act with joint resolution of disa pproval 98 stat 1974 131 1984 this form of legislative action puts the burden on congress to stop district of columbia initiative three statutes in 1985 removed legislativ vetoes from statutory procedures the concurrent resolution governing national emer gencies was replaced by joint resolution of disapproval 99 stat 448 801 1985 th same approach was used on legislation concerning export administration 99 stat 160 301b 1985 num ber of legislative vetoes had been used in the past to deal with federal pay increases congress eliminated those legislative vetoes and again relied on joint resolution of disapproval 99 stat 1322 135e 1985 after chadha some members of congress introduced legislation to change the war powers resolution which contains provision that allows congress to pass concurrent resolution to order the president to withdr aw troops engaged in combat 87 stat 55657 5c 1973 these lawmakers suggested that the concurrent resolution be replaced by joint resolution of disapproval 129 cong rec 2840608 2867374 2868384 28686 89 1983 as finally enacted however th procedure for joint resolution was not added to the war powers resolution it b ecame freestanding legislative procedure that is available to force vote to order the withdrawal of troops 97 stat 1062 1013 1983 50 usc 1546a 2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22132crs3 the impoundment control act of 1974 gave congress onehouse veto to disapprove presidential proposals to defer the spending of appropria ted funds 88 stat 335 1013b 1974 even before chadha congress began to di sapprove deferrals by inserting language in bills passed through the regular legislative process and continued to rely on that procedure after chadha was decided in 1986 however when the reagan administration turned to deferrals to meet the deficit targets in the grammrudman hollings act affected parties went to court to contest the legality of presidential deferrals they argued that if the one house veto was invalid under chadha the presidents deferral authority was inextricably tied to the unconstitutional legislative veto according to the argument of the plaintiffs congress would not have delegated the deferral authority to the president unless it knew it had one house veto to maintain control if one part of the statute fell they argued so should the other the federal courts accepted that reasoning holding that the deferral authority and the onehouse legislative veto were inseparable city of new haven conn v united states 809 f2d 900 dc cir 1987 city of new haven conn v united states 634 fsupp 1449 ddc 1986 congress promptly converted this judicial position into statut ory law 101 stat 785 206 1987 the effect was to limit the president to routine managerial deferrals and prohibit the use of deferral authority to delay the spending of funds simp ly because the president disagreed with the budgetary priorities enacted into law informal vetoes after chadha one effect of chadha has been to drive some legi slative vetoes underground where they operate on the basis of informal nd nonstatutory understandings this impact became clear when presiden t reagan signed an appropriation bill in 1984 for the department of housing and urban development and indepe ndent agencies he objected to the presence of seven provisions that required executive agencies to seek the prior approval of the appropriations committees in stating that he would implement legislation in manner consistent with the chadha decision he implied that committee veto provisions would be regarded by the administration as having legal effect public papers of the presidents 1984 ii at 1057 under this understanding agencies would notify committees and then pursue activitie s without obtaining committee approval the house appropriations committee decided to confront the administration on this issue it reviewed procedure that had worked well with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa for number of years statutory ceilings caps were placed on various nasa programs usually at the level requested in the presidents budget nasa could exceed those caps if it received permission fro m the appropriations committees because the administration now threatened to ignore committee controls the house appropriations committee said it would repeal both the committee veto and nasas authority to exceed the caps hrept 98916 48 1984 if nasa wanted to spend more than the caps allowed it would have to comply with the courts mandate in chadha by securing passage of bill in each house assuring that it emerges from conference committee and is submitted to the president nasa did not want to obtain new public law whenever it needed to exceed spending caps to avoid that heavy burde n nasa administrator james m beggs wrote to the appropriations committees on august 9 1984 suggesting compromise instead of putting caps in public law he recommended that they be placed in the joint explanatory statement accompanying conference report the nonstatutory document thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22132crs4 1 john felton bush hill agree to

public law to be carried out he then pledged that nasa would not exceed any ceiling identified in the conference report without first obtaining the prior approval of the appropriations committees without some procedure for adjustment othe r than subsequent separate legislative enactment these ceilings could seriously impact the ability of nasa to meet unforeseen technical changes or problems that are inherent in challenging rd programs we believe that the present legislative procedure could be converted by this letter into an inform agreement by nasa not to exceed amounts for committee designated programs without the approval of the committees on appropriations this agreement would assume that both the st atutory funding ceilings and the committee approval mechanisms would be deleted from the fy 1985 legislation and that it would not be the normal practice to include either mechanism in future appropriations bills further the agreement would assu that the future program ceiling amounts would be identified by the committees in the conference report accompanying nasas annual appropriations act and confir med by nasa in its submission of the annual operating plan nasa would not expend any funds over the ceilings identified in the conference report for these progra ms without the prior approval of the committees letter from nasa administ rator beggs to house appropriations committee august 9 1984 this type of informal ag reement poses problem under chadha which focused solely on legislative vetoes placed in statutes another type of informal arrangement is reflected in the baker accord of 1989 in the early months of the george h w bush administration secretary of state james baker iii decided to give four co mmittees of congress and certain party leaders veto pow er over the divisive issue of funding the nicaraguan contras in return for recei ving 50 million in humanitarian aid for the contras baker agreed that portion of the f unds could be released only with the approval of certain committees and party leaders1 white house counsel c boyden gray reportedly objected to this level of congressi onal involvement in fore ign policy especially through what appeared to be an unconstitutional legislative veto2 former federal judge robert bork regarded the bake r accord as even more objectionable than the legislative veto struck down in chadha because it permitted control by mere committees instead of onehouse veto 135 cong rec 6528 1989 however the informal nature of th baker accord was not prohibited by chadha baker was willing to accept the compromise as the only feasible means of obtaining funds from congress for controversial purpose in letter to congress on april 28 1989 he agreed that the contras w ould not receive financial ssistance after november 30 1989 unless he received letters from the bipartisan leadership of congress and the relevant house and senate authorization and appropriations committees four members of congress sued the president and the secretary of state for entering into this side agreement with congress claiming that it represented forbidden legislative veto federal district court dismisse d the suit on the grounds that th plaintiffs lacked standinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22132crs5 and that the case constituted question of national defense and foreign policy committed to the elected branches burton v baker 723 fsupp 1550 ddc 1989 statutory committee vetoes congress continues to add legislative vetoes to bills and presidents continue to sign them into law although often in their signin g statements they object to these legislative vetoes and regard them as unconstitutional unde r the supreme courts ruling from the date of the courts decision in chadha to 2005 congress has enacted more than 400 of these legislative vetoes most of them requiring the executive branch to obtain the approval of specified committees in these signing statements presidents often indicate that the new legislative vetoes will be treated as having legal force or effect although presidents have treated committee vetoes after chadha as having legally binding value agencies often adopt different attitude they have to work closely with their review committees year after year and have much greater need to vise practical accommodations and honor them the treasurypostal service and general government appropriations act for fiscal 1992 105 stat 834 1991 is an example of co mmitteeveto provisions placed in statute the internal revenue service could not transfer funds in excess of 4 of an

presented to designated committees for their advance approval an example is the defense department financ ial management regu lation issued august 2000 chapter 6 of volume 3 focuses on the procedures for reprogramming of dod appropriated fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22132crs6 reprogramming involves shift of funds within an appr opriations account at times the word reprogramming is applied ge nerally to transfer of funds from one appropriations account to anothe r shift that requires stat utory authority elaborate procedures are established to assure that the executive branch does not violate understandings entered into with the appropr iations committees and at times with the authorization committees that have jurisdicti on the defense department has form dd 1414 that establishes the base for reprog ramming actions and dd 1415 used to request the prior approval dd 14151 of the congressional committees approval for reprogramming action is obtained by letter from the congressional committees prior to implementation of the proposed action the pentagon takes each separate committee response into account w ith final implementa tion reflecting the lowest of the approvals received for proposed sources and increases only when the final committee approval has been received does the pentagon prepare an implementation memorandum depending on the reprogra mming request approval may be required from the appropriations committees the armed services committees or the intelligence committees procedures are established to permit the defense department to return to committee to appeal its decision on reprogramming action federal courts recognize the need fo r informal clearance procedures between executive agencies and congressional committees case decided after chadha involved statute that required the general services administration gsa to notify appropriate committees of congress in advance of negotiated sale of surplus government property in excess of 10000 gsa regulations further provided that in the absence of adverse comment by the review committees the disposal agency may sell the property on or after 35 days 40 usc 484e6 41 cfr 1014730412f the us claims court found the procedure to be tantamount to committee disapproval and therefore unconstitutional under chadha city of alexandria v united states 3 ct cl 667 67578 1983 the us court of appeals for th federal circuit reve rsed finding nothing unconstitutional about the decision of agenci to defer to committee objections there is nothing unconstitutional about this ind eed our separation of powers makes such informal cooperation much more necessary than it would be in pure system of parliamentary g overnment city of alexandria v united states 737 f2d 1022 1026 cafc 1984 conclusions chadha put an end to onehouse and twohouse legislative vetoes but it has had little effect on the legislative vetoes that operate at the committee and subcommittee level executive agencies and congressional committees have developed variety of voluntary accommodation procedures over the years th at result in standard quid pro quo congress agrees to delegate substantial discretion to executive agencies if they accept system of review and control by the committ ees of jurisdiction these provisions remain an important mechanism for reconciling legislative and executive interests
