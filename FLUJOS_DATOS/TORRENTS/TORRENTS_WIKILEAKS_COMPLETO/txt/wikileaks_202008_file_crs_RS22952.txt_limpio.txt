not permit committees to order measure or matter reported to the senate by poll proxy voting proxy voting is practice by which an absent senator authorizes second present senator to cast his or her vote in addition to their own during committee markup meeting1 the standing rules of the senate give each senate committee the discretion to permit or ban proxy voting by its members in the 110th congress 20072008 every senate standing committee and all but one senate select or special committee has adopted rules permitting proxy voting in at least some circumstances2 some but not all senate committees require proxy votes to be authorized in writing often by letter figure 1 voting by proxy is not permitted on the senate floor the house of representative bans proxy voting both in its committees and on the floor 2 the senate special committee on aging has not adopted proxy voting rule it does not have legislative jurisdiction and thus may have less need for the practice crs2 1 or proxy voting form other panels permit proxy votes to be authorized not only in writing but also orally or by personal instruction although senate rules give committees wide latitude in structuring the use of proxies the senate places specific limits on the practice as it relates to the motion to report measure or matter to the senate these limitations are established in the precedents of the senate and by senate rule xxvi3 it is fundamental principle of senate parliamentary procedure that reporting quorum numerical majority of the members of committee must be physically present when the committee votes to order measure or matter reported to the parent chamber under paragraph 7a1 of rule xxvi should less than numerical majority be present for this vote the measure or matter would not be considered properly before the senate and point of order might be raised against its consideration4 as such under chamber precedents proxies may not be used to constitute such reporting quorum5 if quorum is physically present and proxies are used on the motion to report they cannot make the difference in successfully ordering measure or matter reported to the senate if with reporting quorum present majority of committee members present httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22952 vote to order measure reported proxy votes to the contrary could prevent reporting if however majority of the reporting quorum votes against ordering measure or matter reported proxies could not count towards majority vote to successfully report the measure or matter under rule xxvi if committee permits proxy voting on the motion to report senator must be informed of the matter he or she is being recorded on by proxy in addition senator must have actively requested to vote by proxy on that question so called blind or general proxies are not permitted on this question within the limits of rule xxvi each individual senate committee has tailored different types of proxy rules to meet the needs of its members some panels permit the use of proxies on all questions with few restrictions still other panels limit their use or duration or dictate the form or the manner in which the proxy must be executed or preserved in the committees official records6 because of this variation questions about specific committees use of proxies might best be answered by examining the committees official rules of procedure or consulting with the committees chief clerk7 3 the language of senate rule xxvi relating to proxy voting incorporates the provisions of section 106a of the legislative reorganization act

certain decisions to be made or actions to be authorized by poll of committee members unlike proxy voting polling takes place without formal committee or subcommittee markup or business meeting in poll each senator on committee or subcommittee is asked by the chairman or staff member designated by the chairman to declare his or her position or grant his or her consent to taking particular action relating to legislation or internal committee business polls may be conducted by telephone or by asking senators to return written polling document figure 2 often within specified period of time most senate committees that permit questions to be polled require all senators to agree to decide the matter in question by poll and some committees require polling results to be unanimous as well to this extent polling might be viewed as an indirect form of obtaining the unanimous consent of committee members it might also be viewed as analogous to other institutional mechanisms by which senators indirectly grant their consent to actions such as the hotlining of legislation for floor consideration or passage httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22952 or the blue slip procedure used in the consideration of some presidential nominations8 at certain points in its history the senate permitted committee reports to be authorized by poll but that is longer the case because as has been noted rule xxvi requires numerical majority of committee to be physically present to authorize report it is not in order for committee to order measure or matter reported to the chamber by poll9 common practice that avoids this prohibition however is for committee to poll its members on whether they will consent to having the committee discharged from the further consideration of bill or nomination by unanimous consent request made on the senate floor polls are also often used by senate subcommittees to transmit bills or nominations to their full committee without formal markup session some senate committees also permit members to be polled as way of publicly recording their position on question they were unable to vote on in person or by proxy in the 110th congress seven senate standing select or special committees have adopted written rules authorizing polling under at least some circumstances agriculture nutrition and forestry budget health education labor and pensions homeland security and governmental affairs judiciary finance and special aging10 even if committee has not adopted formal committee rule regulating polls however it does not necessarily mean that the committee may not utilize the practice for example although the senate committee on appropriations lacks written committee rule 8 for more information see crs report rl32013 the history of the blue slip in the

and the senate cleanup rule paragraph 7a3 of senate rule xxvi contains provisions that under certain circumstances might bear on proxy votes or polls conducted by senate committee or subcommittee under this rule which is sometimes colloquially called the cleanup rule should panel violate senate procedures during its consideration of measure or matter these missteps will not be the subject of floor point of order so long as the committee has properly conducted the vote to report paragraph 7 a3 states action by any committee in reporting any measure or matter in accordance with the requirements of this subparagraph shall constitute the ratification by the committee of all action theretofore taken by the committee with respect to that measure or matter including votes taken upon the measure or matter or any amendment thereto and point of order shall lie with respect to that measure or matter httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22952 the senate included this provision in its rule book to prevent the obstruction of legislation on the senate floor based upon the internal operations of committee by making the record vote of committee on reporting measure the final test of the legality of such action12 in short properly conducted vote to order measure or matter reported to the senate cleans up or absolves any potentially defective committee procedures that may have occurred including those related to proxy vote or committee poll taken earlier 11 emily pierce use of appropriations polling troubles critics roll call september 20 2004 p 1 chuck conlon there are markups then theres
