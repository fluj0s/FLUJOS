the reunification of families the admission of immigrants with needed skills the protection of refugees and the dive rsity of admissions by country of origin these principles ar embodied in federal law th immigration and nationality act ina first codified in 1952 the immig ration amendments of 1965 replaced the national origins quota system enacted afte r world war i with percountry ceilings and the statutory provisions regulating permanent immigration to the united states were last revised significantly by the immigration act of 19903 the two basic types of legal aliens are immigrants and nonimmigrants as defined in the ina immigrants are synony mous with legal permanent residents lprs and refer to foreign nationals who come to live lawfully and permanently inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32235crs2 4 nonimmigrants are often referred to by the letter that denotes their specific provision in the statute such as h2a agricultural workers f1 foreign students or j1 cultural exchange visitors crs report rl31381 us immigration policy on temporary admissions by ruth ellen wasem and chad c haddal 5 these include criminal national security health and indigence grounds as well as past violations of immigrati on law 212a of ina 6 for background and analysis of visa issu ance and admissions policy see crs report rl31512 visa issuances policy issues and legislation by ruth ellen wasemthe united states the other major class of legal aliens are nonimmigrants such as tourists foreign students diplomats temporary agricultural workers exchange visitors or intracompany business pe rsonnel who are admitted for specific purpose and temporary period of time nonimmigrants are required to leave the country when their visas expire though certain classes of nonimmigrants may adjust to lpr status if they otherwise qualify4 the conditions for the admission of immigrants are much more stringent than nonimmigrants and many fewer immigrants than nonimmigrants are admitted once admitted however immigrants are subject to few restrictions for example they may accept and change employment and may pply for us citizenship through the naturalization process ge nerally after five years petitions for immigrant ie lpr status are first filed with us citizenship and immigration services uscis in the department of homeland security dhs by the sponsoring relative or employer in the united states if the prospective immigrant is already residing in the united states the uscis handles the entire process which is called adjustment of status because the alien is moving from temporary category to lpr status if the prospective lpr does not have legal residence in the united states the petition is forwarded to the department of states dos bureau of consular affairs in th eir home country after uscis has reviewed it the consular affairs officer when the alien is coming from abroad and uscis adjudicator when the alien is adjusting status in the united states must be satisfied that the alien is entitled to the immigrant status these reviews are intended to ensure that they are not ineligible for visas or admission under the gr ounds for inadmissibility spelled out in ina5 many lprs are adjusting status from within the united states rather than receiving visas issued abroad by consular affairs6 as discussed more fully below 647 of all lprs adjusted to lpr status in the united states while only 353 arrived from abroad in fy2006 the ina specifies that each year countries are held to numerical limit of 7 of the worldwide level of us immigra nt admissions known as percountry limits the actual number of immigrants that ma be approved from given country however is not simple percentage calculation immigrant admissions and adjustments to lpr status are subject to complex set of numerical limits andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32235crs3 7 immigrants are aliens who are admitted as lprs or who adjust to lpr status within the

is term in immigration law which means that the alien has been granted temporary permission to be present in the united states parole does not constitute formal admission to the united states and

family relationships needed skills and geographic diversity as discussed below7 current law and policy worldwide immigration levels the ina provides for permanent nnual worldwide level of 675000 legal permanent residents lprs but this level is flexible and certain categories of lprs are permitted to exceed the limits as described below8 the permanent worldwide immigrant level consists of the following com ponents fa milysponsored immigrants including immediate relatives of us citizens and familysponsored preference immigrants 480000 plus certain unused employmentbased preference numbers from the prior year employmentbased preference immigrants 140000 plus certain unused family preference numbers from the prior year and diversity immigrants 550009 immediate relatives10 of us citizens as well as refugees and asylees who are adjusting status are exempt from direct numerical limits11 the annual level of family sponsored preference immigra nts is determined by subtracting the number of immediate relative visas issued in the previous year and the number of aliens paroled12 into the united states for at least year from 480000 the total familysponsored level and when availa ble adding employment preference immigrant numbers unused during th previous year by law the family sponsored preference level may not fa ll below 226000 in recent years the 480000 level has been exceeded to maintain the 226000 floor on familysponsored preference visas after subtraction of the immediate relative visas within each family and employment pref erence the ina further allocates the number of lprs issued visas each year as table 1 summarizes the legal immigration preference system the complexity of the allocations becomes apparenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32235crs4 13 employmentbased allocations are further affected by 203e of the nicaraguan and central american relief act nacara as amended by 1e of pl 105139 this provision states that when the employment 3rd preference other worker ow cutoff date reached the priority date of the latest ow petition approved prior to november 19 1997 the 10000 ow numbers available for fiscal year are to be reduced by up to 5000 annually beginning in the following fiscal year this re duction is to be made for as long as necessary to offset adjustments under nacara since the ow cutoff date reached november 19 1997 during fy2001 the reduction in the ow limit to 5000 began in fy2002note that in most instances unused visa numbers are allowed to roll down to the next preference category13 table 1 legal immigration preference system

petition pro cessing backlogs distinct from the visa priority dates that result from the various numerical limits in the law there are significant backlogs due to the sheer volume of aliens eligible to immigrate to the united states over 3 million immigration and naturalization petitions were filed with the uscis during the threemonth period of june july and august 2007 the uscis acknowledged the agency was overwhelmed by the volume of petitions and were unable to record the receipt of all of these petitions upon arrival in october 2 007 the agency secu red many of the i130 petitions for alien relatives in lockbox and indicated that they hoped to record all of those lockbox petitions by the end of february 200826 this recent spike in immigrant petitions has occurred amidst controversies over processing backlogs dating back to the establishment of uscis in march 2003 in december 2003 uscis reported 53 milli on immigrant petitions pending27 uscis decreased the number of immigrant

presented in appendix b for each of the four uscis regional service centers but may retrogress as the surge in petitions from 2007 are recorded as received even though there are numerical limits on the admission of aliens who are immediate relatives of us citizens such citizens petitioning for their relatives are waiting at least year and in some parts of the country more than two years for the paperwork to be processed citizens nd lprs petitioning for relatives under the family preferences are often waiting several years for the petitions to be processed appendix b is illustrative but not compre hensive because some immigration petitions may be filed at uscis district offices and at the national benefits center aliens with lpr petitions pending cannot visit the united states since the ina presumes that all aliens seeking admission to the united states are coming to live permanently nonimmigrants must demonstrate that they are coming for temporary period or they will be denied visa aliens with lpr petitions pending are clearly intending to live in the united states permanently and thus are denied nonimmigrant visas to come temporarily30 legislation in the 110th congress key issues balancing the priorities the challenge inherent in reforming legal immigration is balancing employ ers hopes to increase the supply of legally present foreign workers families longing to reunite and live together and widelyshared wish among the various stakeholders to improve the policies governing legal immigration into the country president bush emphasized the importance he places on comprehensive immigration reform in his recent tour of latin american countries31 and there is commonlyheld expectation that the 110th congress will consider immigration reform

accountability act of 2007 s 1225 broader issues of debate as congress debates immigration control ie border security and interior enforcement and legal reform ie temporary and permanent admissions the proposals that re main contentious include expanding the number of guest worker and other temporary foreign worker visas available each year and concurrent easing of opportunities fo r these temporary workers to ultimately adjust to lpr status32 whether the lpr adjustments of guest workers and other temporary foreign workers are channeled through the numerically limited employmentbased preferences or are exempt from numerical limits will affect the future flow of lprs whether the legi slation also contains the controversial provisions that would permit aliens currently residing in the united states without legal status to adjust to lpr status to acquire earned legaliza tion or to obtain guest worker visa also has affects on future legal permanent admissions33 although guest workers and other temporary foreign workers options as well as legalization proposals are not topics of this report th issues have become inextricably linked to the debate on legal permanent admissions preference system versus point system34 replacing or supplementing the current preference system discussed earlier in this report with point system is garnering considerable interest for the fi rst time in over decade briefly point systems such as those of australia cana da great britain and new zealand assign prospective immigrants with credits if they have specified attributes most often based upon educational ttainment shortage occupations extent of work experience language proficiency nd desirable age range proponents of point systems maintain that such mer itbased approaches are clearly defined and base d upon the nations economic needs and labor market objectives point system supporters argu would be more acceptable to the public because the government rather than empl oyers or families woul d be selecting new immigrants and this selection would be based upon national economic priorities opponents of point systems state that the judgement of individual employers are the best indicator of labor market needs and an immigrants success opponents warn that the number of peopl who wish to immigrate to the united states would overwhelm point system comparable to

unlikely that uscis would completely eliminate the backlog of pending adjudications by the 2006 deadline37 despite progress in cutting the backlog of pending cases from 38 million in january 2004 to 12 million in june 2005 gao speculated that uscis may have difficulty eliminating its backlog for the more complex application types that constitute nearly threequarters of the backlog38 the agencys redefinition of what constitutes backlog has emerged as an issue the june 2006 report of the uscis om budsman stated in july 2004 uscis reported 15 million backlogged cases which was an apparent reduction from the 35 million backlogged cases in march 2003 howeve r the agency also reclassified 11 million of the 2 million cases eliminated the ombudsman went on to disclose that uscis had again

congress legislation reforming permanent immigration came from variety of divergent perspectives in the 108th congress the sheer complexity of the current set of provisions makes revising the law on

on january 21 2004 senators chuck gel and thomas daschle introduced legislation s 2010 that would if enacte d potentially yield significant increases in legal permanent admissions the immigra tion reform act of 2004 s 2010 would have among other provisions longer deduct immediate relatives from the overall familysponsored numerical limits treat spous and minor children of lprs the same as immediate relatives of us citizens exempt from numerical limits and reallocate the 226000 family preference numbers to the remaining family preference categories in addition many aliens who would have benefited from s 2010s proposed temporary worker provisions would be able to adjust to lpr status outside the numerical limits of the per country ceiling and the worldwide levels several bills that would offer more targeted revisions to permanent immigration were offered in the house represen tative robert andrews introduced hr 539 which would have exempted spouses of lprs from the family preference limits and thus treated them similar to immediate rela tives of us citizens representative richard gephardt likewise included provisi on that would have treated spouses of lprs outside of the numerical limits in his earned legalization and family unity act hr 3271 representative jerrold nadler introduced legislation hr 832 that would have amended the ina to add permanent partners after spouses and thus would have enabled liens defined as permanent partners to become lprs through the familybased immigration categories as well as to become derivative relatives of qualifying immigrants legislation that would have reduced legal permanent immigration was introduced early in the 108th congress by representativ thomas tancredo the mass immigration reducti on act hr 946 would have zeroed out family sponsored immigrants except children and s pouses of us citizens employment based immigrants except certain priority workers and diversity lottery immigrants through fy2008 it also would

increased details on the level of increases the administration is seek ing also have not been provided the president featured his immigration re form proposal in the 2004 state of the union address
