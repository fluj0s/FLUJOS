defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34246tuberculosis international efforts and issues for congress summary infectious diseases are estimated to cau more than 25 of all deaths around the world number of infectious diseas outbreaks over the past decade such as h5n1 avian influenza and severe acu respiratory syndrome sars have heightened concerns about how infectious diseases might threaten global security international air travel and trade have complicated efforts to detect and contain infectious diseases people could cross borde rs carrying highly contagious disease before an infectious agent causes symptoms nonhealth officials are becoming increasingly aware of the threat that infectious diseases pose an event th at illuminated the issue occurred in may 2007 when man known to be carrying drugresist ant form of tuberculosis tb crossed number of international borders unabated the world health organization who estimates that someone contr acts tb every second and that about onethird of all people in the world carry tb most of these cases however are latent in 2006 an estimated 144 million people were living w ith tb globally in cluding 92 million who contracted the disease that year about 17 million people carrying tb died in 2006 including 200000 people coinfected w ith hivaids about 80 of all estimated new tb cases arising in the world each year occur in 22 highburden countries hbcs who indicates that the global incide nce of tb per capita peaked around 2003 and since then incidence per 100000 populati on stabilized in europe and declined in all five who regions although the absolute number of new cases increased between 2005 and 2006 in africa the middle east europe and southeast asia in subsaharan africa weak health syst ems minimal access to health facilities insufficient staffing and little human resource development illequipped and substandard laboratories and human immunodeficiency virusacquired immunodeficiency syndrome hivaids coinfection have limited countri ability to contain tb in fy2008 congress funded us global tb operations at unprecedented levels through fy2008 consolidated appropr iations congress provided 1622 million to international tb programs and an additional 8403 million for us contribution to the global fund to fight hivaids tb and malaria global fund the house passed and the senate foreign relations committees reported out companion tb bills stop tb now act hr 1567 and s 968 to support global tb efforts and authorize 330 million in fy2008 and 450 milli on in fy2009 they also authorized 70 million and 100 million for antitb programs at the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc in fy2008 and fy2009 respectively although congress voted to increase support for globa l tb efforts some members expressed concern that the additional funds might be provided at the expense of other global health programs the administrati on requested 971 million for fy2009 global tb efforts

united states has significant interests1 nic cited number of factors that heighten the infectious diseases threat including in creasing drug resistance slow development of new antibiotics urban sp rawl environmental degrad ation and the growing ease and frequency of cro ssborder movements over the past decade there has been considerable debate about countries abilities to contain and prevent infec tious disease outbreaks in 2002 the international community struggled to id entify an unknown infectious disease that rapidly spread across 31 countries infect ed more than 8400 people and killed 813 of those who contracted it in 2003 when the disease was ultimately contained scientists called the agent severe acute respiratory syndrome sars2 that same year influenza ah5n1 bird flu

spreads through the air when infectious people c ough sneeze talk or spit people with tb are only infectious when the bacteria is active those with active tb who do not receive treatment and are not properly quarantined infect on average between 10 and 15 people every year5 tb can lie dormant in an inf ected person for years and may not cause any symptoms or illness the tb bacteria most often becomes active and causes sickness when ones immune system is weakened such as with human immunodeficiency virusacquired immunode ficiency syndrome hivaids global tb statistics6 although tb is curable who estimates that in 2006 the year for which the most current data are available there were 144 million prevalent cases of tb including some 92 million people who contracted the disease that year7 about 80 of annual tb cases ccur in 22 highburden countries see figure 1 in the appendix 8 all but two of those high burden countries were in africa or asia9 more than 50 of all new tb cas occurred in five countries in descending order of tb cases india ch ina indonesia south africa and nigeria the disease killed an estimated 17 million people in 2006 including 230857 who were also infected with hivaids see table 1 in the appendix although southeast asia had the highest number of new tb cases incidence and mortality per capita rates were considerably higher in subsaharan africa among the 15 countries with the highest timated tb incidence rates 13 were in africa due in part to relatively high rates of hiv coinfection see table 2 in the appendix 10 in 2006 about 310 million people in southeast asia were newly infected with tb 109 per 100000 people and about 281 million in subsaharan africa 363 per 100000 the actual number of tbrelated deat hs and the mortality per capita rates

asia 30 per 100000 infected while some 639089 people died of tb in subsaharan africa 83 per 100000 infected who asserts that number of factors contribute to africas relatively high per capita rate key factors include weak health systems low quality health care poor access to health facilities insufficient staffing and other human resource constraints illequipped and substandard laboratory services and little collaboration between tb and hiv programs hivaids and tb in areas with significant hivaids prevalence the virus is contributing to rising tb prevalence11 people living with hivaids are at greater risk of contracting tb because of thei r weakened immunity ach diseas accelerates the advancement of the other tb consider ably shortens the survival of people with hivaids and quickens the progression of hiv into aids meanwhile hivaids is the most potent risk factor for conver ting latent tb into active tb many people infected with hivaids in developing countries develop tb as the first manifestation of aids the two diseases represent d eadly combination since they are more destructive together than ither disease alone other key facts about hivaidstb coinfection include in hivpositive people tb is harder to diagnose progresses faster is almost always fatal if undiagnos ed or left untreated and kills up to half of all aids patients worldwide people with hivaids are up to 50 times more likely to develop tb in given year than hivnegative people and about 90 of people living with hivaids die within four totwelve months of contracting tb if they are not treated for tb in subsaharan africa hivaids and tb coinfection is becoming growing problem in 2006 about 85 of all hi vpositive people with tb were found in africa 12 that year an estimated 709000 people were coinfected with hivaids and tb some 606000 of whom were african about 205000 of the 231000 co infected patients who died from tb were african representing 89 of those deaths in countries with high hivaids prevalence hivtb coinfection poses significant health challenge in swazila nd for example 75 of tb patients were hivpositive13 south africa with 07 of the worlds population and the most number

2008drs_report4_26feb08pdf general tb sta tistics included throughout this report were mostly taken from whos 2007 global tuberculosis control report data in this paragraph may vary slightly from those as they were taken from whos 2008 report anti tuberculosis in the world which included more recent statistics on drug resistance but did not provide analysis on tb generally tb14 hiv testing for tb patients has increased however between 2002 and 2006 in 2002 nine countries reported testing 21806 tb cases for hiv representing less than 1 of notified tb cases by 2006 112 countries had reported testing 687174 patients for hiv equivalent to about 12 of notified tb cases in africa 287945 patients were tested for hiv some 22 of all notified tb cases in africa hiv testing of tb patients increased from 75 to 35 from 2004 to 2006 the testing increase was driven primarily by kenya and south africa in spite of improvements in hiv testing in africa the region still lagged behind other countries on average 56 of tb patients were tested for hiv outside of africa drug resistance to tb treatments multidrug resistant tb mdrtb mdrtb are tb organisms that do not re spond to at least two firstline drugs15 drug resistance mostly arises from poor trea tment adherence or incorrect drug usage adherence means taking accurately prescr ibed drugs in the right amounts at the correct time if the wrong drugs or the wr ong combinations of drugs are prescribed providers fail to ensure that they are ta ken correctly on schedul or patients do not take their medicine for the full term tb may become resistant to the drugs the development of mdrtb is partic ularly troubling to scientists because mdrtb carriers can transmit resistant forms of tb to others mdrtb is transmissible even among those who have never had tb research has indicated that patients are less likely to complete regimens for treatmentresistant forms of tb in part because resistant forms take longer to cure nonresistant forms of tb take between six and nine months to cure while mdrtb takes about two years to cure mdrtb treatments are also more toxic more expensive often of limited availability in resourcelimited settings and generally less effective especially among hivpositive people if patients adhere to treatment regimens cure rates for nonresistant tb range between 80 nd 95 cure rates for mdrtb range between 50 and 60 who advises that health care providers treat mdrtb patients in separate facilities than those with hivaids separating mdrtb patients from hivaidshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34246crs5 16 unless otherwise indicated data include d in this section was taken from who anti tuberculosis in the world 2008 pp 73 and 82 17 who 2008 global tuberculos is control report p51patients can be particularly challenging in resourcelimited settings where hospitals are frequently overcrowded illequipped nd unable to house individuals for the entire treatment term in areas with high hivprevalence efforts to care for mdr tb patients separately from hivaids patients are often complicated by the high proportion of hospital beds f illed with hivaids patients in february 2008 who released report on tb drug resistance that summarized findings from surveys c onducted between 2002 and 2006 in 81 countries16 based on those surveys who estimates that almost 490000 mdrtb cases emerged in 2006 representing about 5 of all new tb cases though mdr tb rates varied widely from 0 in some western european countries to over 35 in some former soviet states among the 490000 mdrtb cases 285718 were new cases and 203230 had been previously treated who estimated that of the countries fo r which adequate data exist china india and russia are estimated to have the highest number of mdrtb cases china and india hold about 50 of all mdrtb cases and russia comprises another 7 russia has the greatest proportion of md rtb cases among new ones however about 13 of all new tb cases were mdr tb 19 of all tb cases were mdrtb and almost 50 of previously treated tb cases were identified as mdrtb17 although other hbc reporte d equally high mdrtb ra tes number of eastern european countries are estimated to have greater proportion of mdrttb prevalent rates who has identified 27 countries wh ich together account for about 86 of all global mdrtb cases 15 of them are in eastern europe see figure 1 and table 3 in the appendix although whos report provided greater insight into the prevalence of drug resistant forms of tb little is known about resistance in africa the findings included in the report were estimated to have measured about onehalf of all drug resistant tb cases because the surveys we re conducted only in those countries with the capacity to conduct drug resistance rveys such capacity remains limited in africa findings from six countries in subsaharan africa were included in the analysis cote divoire et hiopia madagascar rwanda senegal and tanzania data from south africa were included in th illustrations and tables throughout the report but not in the analysis because w ho used different methodology to analyze data previously collect ed from south africa based on available data w ho estimates that in 2006 some 2 of all tb cases were mdrtb in africa 7 in the we stern pacific region and 19 in eastern europe see table 4 in the appendix who asserts that although it can use available data to approxima the global burden of mdr tb it cannot detect global changes in mdrtb prevalence because da ta in many highburden countries are unavailable incomplete andor have onl recently begun to be compiled the organization can however extrapolate tre nds in key areas who found that mdr tb cases declined in china and the united states

regions in the russian federation are showing increases in the proportion of mdrtb among new cases at very rapid rate while the tb notification rate in those regions is falling slowly who has indicated that similar outbreaks of drug resistance with associated high mortality are likely occurring in othe r african countries but are going undetected because of insufficient laboratory capacity18 mdrtb patients are not yet routinely checked for hivaids in frica though they are extremely susceptible to the disease botswana mozambique and s outh africa are reporte dly the only countries in subsaharan africa that routinely test drugresistant tb cases for hiv19 according to the latest available data in 2006 almost 90 of new mdrtb cases that occurred in the three countries we

facilities xdrtb treatment is successful in 30 of the cases in lowresource settings xdrtb is almost always fatal who is uncertain about the extent of xdrtb prevalence in large part because drug resistance testing to secondline drugs is not available in most highburden countries20 the majority of countries that reported xdrtb cases to who were lowburden countries and do not reflect the global magnitude of the phenomenon who estimates that xdrtb is widespread with 45 countries having reported at least one case survey conducted by who and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc on

patients had been treated in dots programs worldwide and more than 16 million of them had been cured mortality due to tb has been declining and incidence diminishing or stabilizing in all regions except subsaharan africa and eastern europe the global treatment success rate among new smearpositive tb cases had reached 83 by 2003 just short of the wha target of 85 by 2005 and in 2004 the case detection rate which has accelerated globally since 2001 was 53 against the target of 70 by 2005 in 2005 who member states passed resolution that advocated member states provide sustainable financing

for global tb efforts so members expresse d concern that the additional funds might be pr ovided at the expense of ot her global health programs the section below presents some issues congress might consider as it debates the appropriate level of funding for global tb initiatives strengthen health systems who asserts that weak health systems play key role in the continued spread of tb across africa many health practitione rs argue that inadequate access to rapid and accurate diagnostic tests significantly contribute to the rise in new tb cases on the continent more than century after its development in most developing countries tb is primarily identified th rough microscopic examination of sputum this tool however only detects from 40 to 60 of tb cases and as little as 20 of hiv coinfected cases44 although sputum testing has limited reliability this procedure is the most widely used in veloping countries and is usually performed only after tb treatment has failed after which the patient could have transmitted the disease to others about 85 of all countries who reported tb testing practices to who indicated that all suspected pu lmonary tb cases undergo sputum testing of the 22 hbcs 7 did not meet the minimu m requirement of at least one sputum testing laboratory per 100000 persons see table 7 in the appendix health experts also advocate for improved access to dvanced testing technology because sputum tests do not reliably detect smearnegative tb cases particularly among hivpositive patients45 culturing process requiring laboratory diagnosis is the most definitive method of detecting tb particularly in smear negative cases who recommends that countri have at least one laboratory per 5 million people that is capable of culturing samples seven of the 22 highburden countries meet this minimum requirement brazil 51 cambodia 11 china 14 russia 340 south africa 13 thaila nd 51 and vietnam 10 meet thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34246crs15 46 who 2006 world

about onethird of highburden countries nd nine meet the minimum of one per 10 million people brazil cambodia china i ndonesia russia south africa thailand uganda and vietnam in many countries patients might experi ence lapses in tb treatments because clinics might not have the medicines in stock irregular drug deliveries are often caused by poor data collection deficien t road and transport conditions and poor quality distribution systems inconsistent use of medication can reduce the potency of tb treatments extend the term of us and result in drug resistence health advocates argue that in order to boost the impact of tb programs congressional support for tb efforts must be accompanied by funding of health systems including laboratory systems the african health capacity inves tment act of 2007 hr 3812s 805 aims to address some of these issues the b ills authorize funds to improve health care capacity on the continent related activities include training african health care workers providing incentive to retain health worker and establishing offsite hivaids testing and treatment facilities for health care providers the bill also requires the president to develop strate gy that would coordi nate healthrelated strategies with other donors address health worker and health center shortages shortages of properly trai ned health care workers and sufficiently equipped health centers in highburden countries pa rticularly in africa complicate efforts to properly contain and treat tb cases mo st of the 22 highburden countries do not have enough health workers to meet the most basic health care needs including identifying and treating tb cases and monitoring drug usage see table 8 in the appendix 46 in addition many health cente rs are unable to contain airborne infections like tb47 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34246crs16 48 ibid 49 who 2007 world health report safer future global public health security in the 21st century httpwwwwhointwhr2007whr07_enpdfhigh hiv prevalence in some parts of africa further complicates shortage issues because hiv and tb patients are usually housed within close proximity of each other in poorly equipped facilities who maintains th at in order for countries to effectively control tb and prevent increases in mdrtb and xdrtb cases hivaids and tb patients should be housed separately and teams of health workers should be trained specifically to manage drug resistance and work in hospitals or isolation units dedicated to tb patients another challenge is that in some countries with high hiv prevalence significant number of health workers are hivpositive posing risk to themselves and their patients who contends that all of these issues converge to cause the extremely hi gh mortality in kwazulunatal48 it is widely understood that mdrtb is caused in large part by poor treatment adherence health worker shortages ssen the likelihood that the dispensing of medication will be properly supervised who fears that the inability to manage sufficiently first and secondline treatment s will lead to rise in xdrtb cases49 global health advocates urge congress to in crease support for health worker training fund initiatives that supplement the salari and provide incentives for indigenous health workers and stop recruiting health practitioners from countri with shortages to fill us health positions integrate hivaids and tb programs global health experts are concerne d about how hivaids and tb are converging to worsen mortality rates par ticularly in africa early diagnosis and treatment of both diseases can extend life ex pectancy and in the case of tb decrease transmission rates greater aw areness about the intersection of these diseases has led many health practitioners to routinely test tb patients for hiv while who applauds those efforts it has expresse d concern that hiv patients are not yet routinely tested for tb in most high burden countries who asserts that countries could significantly improve tb case identif ication if health professionals would routinely test all those newly diagnosed with hiv for tb proponents of this idea contend that the practice could ameliorate outcomes of hiv and tb programs reduce overall program costs and make tb and hivaids efforts more efficient in fy2006 ogac reportedly spent nearly 50 million on tb efforts in the 15 focus countries

individuals being forcefully isolated in south african health centers reportedly held protests and walked out of facilities complaining of poor trea tment and prisonlike cond itions one patient was reportedly shot while attempting to leave the premises53 several provinces in south africa have reportedly taken gal action to force drug resistant tb patients to stay in hospitals in isolation units surrounded by wire fences and protected by guards54 the south african medical research council mrc asserts that forcibly quarantining individuals is complicated issue because mdr and xdrtb patients might never be cured mdr and xdrtb are difficult to cure in lowresource settings forcing the patients to be c onfined until death mrc does not support coerced treatment because of the lower ccess rate of resistant forms of tb and the reduced life expectancy of mdrtb patients55 some observers point out that forced isolation is also complicated by socio economic factors56 about 10 million south africans about 25 of the population receive some form of social welfare south african policy mandates that those who are hospitalized at the countrys ex pense lose their government assistance many
