potential impact on agriculture summary unusually cool wet spring weather followed by widespread june flooding across much of the corn belt cast consider able uncertainty over 2008 us corn and soybean production prospects as much as 5 million acres of crop production were initially thought to be either lost entirely or subject to significant yield reductions estimates of floodrela ted crop damage varied widely due in part to lack of reliable information about the extent of pl ant recovery or replanting in the flooded areas these circumstances generated considerable market angst and us agricultural prices for corn and soybeans as reported on the major commodity exchanges hit record highs in late june and early july since then most of the corn belt has experienced nearly ideal growing conditions suggesting the potential for substantial crop recovery and market prices have weakened accordingly on august 12 2008 usda released the first crop production estimates for corn and soybeans that have incorporated surv ey data from the floodaffected regions according to usda us farmers will produce the second largest corn crop on record 123 billion bushels in 2008 up about 5 from the previous months forecast but down over 6 from last years record crop usdas soybean crop forecast of nearly 3 billion bushels is unchanged from july but up 15 from 2007 these production forecasts refl ect three factors first floodrelated acreage losses appear to be substantially less than initially projected second nearly ideal growing conditions that have persiste d across the corn belt since late june have contributed to sharp increases in usdas yield outlo ok for corn thus offsetting floodrelated area losses third despite 176 increase in planted acreage in 2008 soybean production is flat

agriculture background the united states plays critical role in global markets for both feed grains and oilseeds the united states is the world s leading producer and exporter of both corn and soybeans in 2007 the united states had 42 and 63 shares respectively of world corn production and trade and 32 and 41 shares of world soybean production and trade as result of this dominant role unexpected changes in us production for either corn or soybeans ch as those stemming from the midwest floods of 2008 can have major impact on both us and global commodity markets during the first half of 2008 us and world agricultural markets for most grains and oilseeds experienced tight supplies and record high prices1 the high prices provided tantalizing incentive for us farmers as they prepared to plant their crops this past spring in contrast th dramatic unexpectedly sharp price increases of the past year have raised costs for liv estock feeders and agricultural processors evoked considerable concern about consumer foodprice in flation and international food aid availability and spar ked global debate refe rred to as the food versus fuel debate about the increasing policy trend of dedicating commercial agricultural crops to biofuels production particularly corn used for ethanol against this backdrop of producer anticip ation and consumer angst substantial new concerns

through th remainder of the growing season estimating crop losses for 2008 floodrelated crop damage ssessments generally are ma by county and state officials in the affected regions however rough approximation of flooddamaged acres can be obtained by comparing the implied statelevel ab andonment rates from usdas august forecasts with the recent ei ghtyear average abandonment rates if one attributes any change from the 8year average entirely to the flood then the data suggest that about 889000 acres planted to corn and intended for harvest were lost in iowa 453000 illinois 236000 i ndiana 102000 and missouri 99000 see table 1 this lost area estimate repres ents about 1 of the 870 million acres planted to corn in 2008 however pr ojected belowaverage abandonment rates throughout the remainder of the corn belt particularly in nebr aska kansas south dakota ohio and in loweryielding noncorn belt states more than offset the lost acres applying usda august yield forecasts to the arealoss calculations suggests that the four major floodaffected stat of iowa 775 million bushels illinois 406 indiana 158 and missouri 144 cumulatively account for 1482 million bushels of potentially lost production11 this lost produc tion estimate represents 12 of the 123 billion bushel cr op estimate announced by usda applying the same abandonment rate methodology to soybeans suggests that projected area loss related to bad weat her and flooding amounts to nearly 400000 acres in the corn belt partially offset by 184000 acres of belownormal abandonment in noncorn belt states table 2 this

problems the late planting start slow crop development and severe june flooding were precipitate d in 2007 by bovenormal ra infall and cold wet winter that saturated soils in iowa 2007 was the fourthwettest year on record13 the unusually cool wet conditions persisted through spring 2008 again citing iowa which was s ubsequently hit the hardest by june floods figure 2 as an example the first six months of 2008 repr esented the wettest januarytojune period on record cool weather inhibited evapora tion rates thus slowing the soils rate of drying as result many regions of th corn belt were satu rated and vulnerable to erosion ponding standing water and flooding when heavy storms in late may and early june dropped dditional rainfall planting date is criti cal for optimal yields traditionally farmers plant corn as early as possible because early planting provides the greatest potential to achieve maximum yields14 corn is usually planted ahead of soybeans early corn planting is discouraged by wet or cold soils below 50o f s r s u l t m r southerly regions tend to have earlier optimal planting dates in iowa the optimal corn planting dates are between april 20 and may 5 yields begin to drop off as the planting date is delayed significant yield reduction occurs when the planting date is extended to late may or june similarly the optimal soybean planting date in iowa is the last week of april for the southern tw othirds of the state and the first week of may for the northern third optimal planting dates in more northerly latitudes such as in minnesota or wisconsin occur slig htly later and have smaller window for delayed planting this years excessive rainfall coupled with unusually persistent cold ground temperatures delayed both corn plantings and subsequent plant emergence across much of the prime growing region of the corn belt by may 11 only 51 of intended corn area in the corn belt had been planted compared with the previous 5 year average 200207 of 7715 similarly only 11 of intended soybean area had been planted compared with the 5year average of 29 the late start pushed keyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34583crs6 plant development stages of the corn growth cycle into the hotter weeks of july and august when it is susceptible to heat stress and dryness and later into the fall when the possibility of an early freeze can premat urely end ear or pod filling in addition late start to corn generally implies late start to soybean production whose planting generally follows corn with similar growth concerns by may 27 88 of intended corn acres had been planted versus the 5year average of 94 and 52 of intended soybean acres versus 5year average of 67 however equally if not more critical were the ongoing delays in plant emergence for both crops only 52 of planted co rn had emerged compared with 5year average of 76 emergence and only 12 of planted soybeans had emerged versus the 5year average of 34 as result crop yield concerns were already developing by late may june flooding ravages key growing areas with soils already saturated and yield concerns mounting wi despread heavy rains across the corn belt in late may and early june washed out substantial areas recently planted to crops in addition they produced severe erosion and gullying and left saturated soils and standing water in many fields but most damagingly the rains triggered widespread flooding across the heart of the corn belt thousands of acres of prime cropland in iowa nebraska illinois indiana wisc onsin and missouri were flooded by rivers that swelled their banks and

crs report rl32470 upper mississippi illinois waterway navigation expansi on an agricultural transportation and environmental context coordinated by randy schnepffloods had likely caused the worst agriculture disaster in the states history damaging nearly 10 of corn and soybean crops16 the flooding likely led to the abandonmen t of substantial planted crop acreage and to yield losses in those crops that survived the flooding but were subject to extended periods of standing water or waterlogged soil17 further concern of saturated soils persisting during the early stages of plant development particularly for lateplanted crops is that corn plants are more likely to develop shallow root systems which in turn increase their vulnerability to heat and dryness later in the growing cycle initial attempts to ascertain the extent of the crop damage were difficult because the eventual yield and production outcome s for the affected areas depends on how quickly flood waters recede and whether plant growth resumes or new seed is planted for many farmers by late june the replanting window for corn had already closed or was approaching faster than th soils were drying in many cases the indemnities offered under fede rally subsidized crop insu rance represented greater potential remuneration than incurring the costs of replanting subject to substantial reduction in yield coverage due to the late planting date replanting to soybeans was an option for some but many farmers who initially planted corn had already applied round of herbicide which would likely damage or kill the soybean

as those crops that compete for area with feed grains and oilseeds to remain at significantly higher levels than experienced during the recent 19982006 period36 the main factors behind higher longterm pri ces are projections for st eady rise in global population accompanied by steady income growth in the worlds developing economies which combine to sustain growth in demand for liv estock products and the feedstuffs eg coarse grains and protein m eals needed to produce those products in addition the outlook for increased demand for agricultural feedstocks to meet large increases in government biofuelusage policies particul arly in the united states and the european union eu suggest that demand will incr ease strongly over the coming decade for corn the primary feedstock for us ethanol production and vegetable oils the primary feedstock for biodiesel production in the united states and the eu these longrun forecasts assume norma l crop growing conditions and successful harvests as result any deviation fro m normal growing conditions can be expected to have negative market re percussions and drive prices higher the potential weather and floodrelated pr oduction losses to this years us corn and soybean crops were unwelcome news to the mark et and likely to contribute to higher commodity prices in june because the united states plays dominant role in global corn and soybean markets us price changes transmit directly to the international marketplace in summary good growing conditions during july and early august of 2008 appear to have moderated initial concerns over potentia l floodrelated crop losses however large portion of the 2008 corn nd soybean crops were planted late and as of early august remain substantially behind historical development rates as result market analysts suggest that weather problems such as an early freeze could still emerge to lower yield and production prospects such concerns are likely contribute to volatile commodity prices
