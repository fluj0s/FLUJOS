underground press the leelanau underground press is free speech tool for students in leelanau it is meant to facilitate anonymous communication between students allow students to air grievances about the school raise awareness about student rights and create safehaven for student speech while the lup is 100 legal organization we publish anonymously to protect ourselves from persecution we believe that free speech is student right and we are here to exercise it and help you exercise it as well while there are rules explicitly denying such publications the ambiguity about the rules creates system ripe for censorship as we have seen with the blocking of our site however this is not an us vs them situation we want to work together with the administration to find solutions but that doesnt mean we are afraid to take direct action you may redistribute this paper in any form you like and you may charge for it however free copies will always be available online for you lawyers we have released this into the public domain if you are done with your copy please pass it on and spread the truth we have public forum at leelanauundergroundorg available as well as mailing list editors update lot has happened since our first release and are really impressed and flattered by the amount of support we have received theres lots of catching up to do in this issue and we have already made lots of progress with your help theres lots of reflection to do and lots of more action to take but in this issue you probably will not find anything inspirational we will not be giving you lengthy speeches or talking about the great heroes that came before our time the inspiration motivation and resistance is inside you and it is something that you must pull out nobody can make you believe in the resistance movement what we need for you to do is search inside yourself and find the voice that has been long oppressed by the school administration and let it speak ask questions think critically and do not take anything the administration says at face value in this situation it is important that we work together to create change and that we do so through democratic process the lup serves as forum for student speech but if nobody speaks then nobody is heard we have seen the resistance building in the school community in the way that students are starting to question the words of authority we saw at the pda forum as well as the speech given to the students about snowball fights that students are finished with being fed the same crap over and over again we are now starting to question those who tell us what to do and question our own actions our actions have an impact on everybody else in this school when you are complacent and do not speak up for what you believe in not only do you suffer but the other students in the school suffer even if you yourself do not feel oppressed you can be sure that other students do and your silence only increases that reality if nobody exercises their rights then they disappear so what im asking you to do is to exercise one of your rights the administration can fight newspaper and they can fight union but they cant fight an ideology this ideology is freedom winston smith senior editor of lup empowerment through reading there are many public and private records available for viewing about the leelanau school we have located the tax filings from 1998 to 2005 in possible effort to conceal the schools financial situation the school has requested extensions on their tax forms this means that we do not have the archives after 2005 we encourage the school to let the public know about their financial situation as they are legally and obligated to do you can get these archives at httpwwwmytempdircom1282807 we would appreciate any more information you can dig up on the organization or its corporate members once we have compiled enough information we will issue report on the fiscal status of the school from initial views it appears as if the school is drowning in debt proxy update you may be expecting huge list of proxies here but were sorry to tell you we dont have one well actually we do have one but we arent going to publish it last time we published proxies mr begg went through and blocked them all within few days so we have found better way to do this if you want proxy please email us and we will give you one this way there is centralized list and everybody is using different proxies if your proxy dies contact us and you will receive another letters from name removed hey i totally respect what you are doing i think its nothing but disrespectful when we pay upwards of 40000 to come here and they block our free speech hassle us for next to nothing and treat us like 2nd rate citizens i mean come on we pay their salary for the most part the dorm parents are cool sometimes but there are few of them that are ridiculous these people just flat out demand respect even where it shouldnt be given in my opinion respect is something that is earned defiantly not implied i for one dont really appreciate the school waking up at ungodly hours in the morning just for being under suspicion i personally also have problem urinating in front of other people especially when they are waiting for you to go it normally takes at least an hour to squeeze some out for the nurse and i dont want to deal with that im not dumb enough to smoke pot or do drugs on campus and slowly the school has realized that they still do however pester all of my friends weather it be because theyve had troubled past or they just look little off one student in particular has been drug tested twice in the past week and i know that shes going though lot of stuff in her life right now and she really doesnt need the added stress i think that mr odell is tool i dont believe he deserves capital on his name and that he is doing absolutely nothing but running this beautiful brand new hope for lot of people straight into the ground when he came in the school had few million dollars stashed away for surplus but now they are few million in debt i saw the irs reports myself ive been interested in this school for my entire time here and i would love to help you in any way shape or form student here started website like yours devoted completely to free speech about anyone at the school an open forum and the school asked him to pull it down after grand total of 2 days of uptime he didnt think it was right but also didnt want to get into world of trouble for something like this that is how the school does it thats how they keep us quiet they threaten us with trouble even for the slightest free thought i will do anything in my power to help you because i am also passionate about your cause thanks for your email our web hosting right now is bulletproof hosting in florida and theres nothing they can do about the site were actually getting hosted by leelanau graduate well keep you informed about what you can do to help us for now just spread the gospel about the zine and if you can please print out copies do not use your student account to print them and be careful about fingerprints also do not access our site with your student account and try to access it using some type of encrypted tunnel dont get too paranoid if anybody gets busted for associating with us you can be sure we will be right there to defend them well have to take your word on mr odells financial situation could you provide us copies of the report or tell us where to find them in solidarity lup the nurse rumor or fact most students and staff at tls have mixed views about the school nurses we want to help collect this data and publish report about how well they are administering medications and excusing students from classes we want your story and your information will of course be kept in the strictest confidentiality please contact us if you have had positivenegative experiences with the nurses or if you have heard about such incidents dear mr begg soon after the release of the first issue we received this letter from mr begg the network administrator and business manager at tls he also registered at our forums and made similar posts dear mr pornographer i assume you are pornographer as you are trying to help minors endrun around our content filter here at leelanau which is in place to protect the students from psychologically damaging material your style of pornography is even worse than exploitive picturesit is blatant hate i wonder if you have violated the federal internet child protection acts as it relates to schools we are going to find out anyways sincerely patrick begg technology manager dear mr begg this is the last email we will send you until you agree to enter rational discussion with the leelanau underground press and the student body we are not pornographers and the email you sent us is simple libel the leelanau underground press does not distribute hate pornography or any other content that could be legally deemed harmful to minors we havent violated the laws you stated in case you havent read them we have produced small summary for you 1 schools must filter internet access and block content harmful to minors if they want to receive erate funding harmful to minors is legally defined as 1 the average person applying contemporary community standards would find taken as whole and with respect to minors appeals to prurient interest in nudity sex or excretion and 2 the average person applying contemporary community standards would find depicts describes or represents in patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors ultimate sexual acts normal or perverted actual or simulated sadomasochistic sexual acts or abuse or lewd exhibitions of the genitals pubic area buttocks or postpubertal female breast and 3 reasonable person would find taken as whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value for minors therefore the cipa does not apply to the leelanau underground press in addition the school has chosen to apply for taxbreaks and funding instead of making the ethical choice to abstain from using blocking software similar acts to cipa such as copa have been ruled unconstitutional blockingfiltering software is inherently flawed as numerous reports from it professionals and congressional testimony have shown because 1 blocking software is restriction on free speech and access to it 2 blocking software cant block access to such speech if proxies are used 3 blacklisting is not the solution because new sites will always be on the internet before they are blacklisted 4 blocking software has been shown multiple times to blacklist thousands of legitimate sites since you have taken this opportunity to attack our credibility we will do the same for you the difference between your letter and ours is that ours is backed up by fact and logic whereas yours is not you do not properly administer the school networks website filtering is inconsistent between dorms and areas of the school it took you week to fix the daylight savings bug on the wireless networks and you make false reminder about the lists there are two lists availab to stay connected with the lup the anno uncements li st and t he discu ssion list only lup boa rd mbers can post to the announcements l ist and it cont ains in formatio n such as new releases and action aler ts the discuss ion list is open to anybody and an ybody can post com muni ty decisions are made here and ou can freely discuss what ever is on our mindstatements about how networks function during quiet period you responded to student complaints about internet speed by saying they were using too much bandwidth and they should lay off the youtube in addition you said blocking sites would be counterproductive so at least you got that right as network administrator you should know how networks function but you obviously dont because of the incompetency you demonstrate in administering the networks and the false statements you make about them in 80211bg wireless ethernet network like the ones at school each users requests are given the same priority for example lets say we have 500kbs of bandwidth if one user requests youtube video and one user requests their email then 250kbs of bandwidth will be given to each user we can take this example and apply it to somewhere like the netgear routers you have situated throughout the school and show that bunch of people downloading videos wont stop internet access to users who are not the issue here is that when an entire dorm is on the internet each users receives about 2kbs of bandwidth on the leelanau website and informational pamphlets the school advertises high speed however this is obviously not the case as users are receiving speeds below the speed of 288k or 56k modem so perhaps you instead of us are violating the laws see false advertising laws perhaps you should consider your words carefully before sending them to us next time and use logic instead of primitive emotional responses to attack us we are willing to engage you and the leelanau school in logical open and rational forum about this issue however you have not given us the opportunity which is why we had to start the lup in the first place sincerely winston smith senior editor the need to unionize although the leelanau underground press has only been publishing for few months it is already becoming apparent through communications with and the actions of the school administration what their intentions are while the lup serves as powerful forum for student communication more action needs to be taken the lup can organize solidarity with likeminded groups and serve as mediator for disputes with the school administration but we need union to make change at this point the school administration is scared by the prospect of new ideas spreading through the student body they are scared of free speech and they are afraid of student rights that is all great but they probably will not change without putting up fight students can write as many letters as they want but the fact of the matter is that is only protest it is time for us to move from protest to resistance in order to extradite the changes that the student body and nonadministration staff wish to see as students we not only demand change but in that change we demand basic human dignity basic human rights and an independent voice what the administration now needs to decide is whether they are going to accept change or fight it and delay the inevitable the studentteacher body needs to decide if they are willing to risk their security in order to unionize and fight for their inalienable rights discussion on the forming of student or teacher union is just starting and anybody may participate on the mailing list union is the next logical step available to the leelanau community so it is important that people participate in its forming we demand dignity and basic human rights riseupnet needs your help riseupnet the host of our discussion and announcement lists needs financial help to continue to operate every dollar you give

school has recently said that students are not allowed to have profiles on myspacecom even if they do not access them during school hours they also stated that special group of staff members would be looking on myspace for student profiles and taking appropriate discipline measures when they were found schools should not be allowed to punish students for legal off campus activities workers and students in public school have this right but there is such guarantee for students at private schools in solidarity with the struggle for student rights at this school the lup sent this letter to the school attn st hugo of the hills school i am appalled at your new policy to punish students for using myspacecom off school grounds it is interesting because you have not implemented the same policy for teachers because it is illegal to punish workers for legal offjob activities in this case you have chosen the read the law as if it were the moral code by banning myspacecom profiles you are infringing on the constitutionally protected rights of your students which would be illegal if you were public school there are several misconceptions about myspacecom and other social networking sites that may have lead to this draconian measure one of the main concerns parents have about myspacecom is that it makes it easy for pedophiles to find children myspacecom does not make it easier than it would be on any other social networking site email web forum chat rooms or the us postal service if you are serious about protecting children from pedophiles then the best course of action would be to either ban students from talking to people outside of school and we have seen that even these measures do not work or to educate students on how to safely use the internet if children use sites like myspacecom and chatrooms properly then their risk of getting chosen by pedophile is completely removed all students have to do is 1 not give our their address telephone number name or other personal information 2 treat all online users as if they have malicious intent these rules have kept millions of children around the world safe and there is reason it wouldnt work for students attending your school children who get targeted by pedophiles are the same children who freely give this information out to online friends and as result one can only look back and realize what bad decision that was i urge you to immediately repeal this new policy and remove punishments any students received as result of it from their records i expect reply to this message and will continue to lead efforts to reverse this rule until i hear that this rule has been removed sincerely winston smith leelanau underground press leelanauundergroundorg our letter alone is not enough please send your

updated on everything if youre willing to help with other stuff say so what can we do to improve the situation for students at leelanau let us know solidarity needed for uofm students yesterday 12 students at the university of michigan occupied their presidents office to demand that the university adopt the designated suppliers program at the end of the business day these 12 students were arrested for engaging in peaceful act of civil disobedience to protest their universitys refusal to support the rights of workers producing its sports apparel call and email president coleman and demand that the university drop all charges against the students and adopt the dsp dial president coleman at 734 7646270 hello my name is and i am from i am shocked that instead of listening to the concerns of students you have chosen to have them arrested if the university of michigan cares at all about the rights of its students as well as the workers producing its apparel then you must drop all charges against the students and adopt the dsp today thank you for those of you who do not know the history of these actions or what the dsp is please keep reading whats at stake despite supposed commitments by universities and brands university apparel is still made in sweatshops this will continue to be the case until brands are forced to make fundamental changes in the way they do business until brands truly commit to sourcing from factories in which the rights of workers are respected commitment that includes paying slightly higher price for their goods university clothes will continue to be made in sweatshops it is for this reason that students have demanded and on thirty campuses won the adoption of the designated suppliers program dsp the dsp will require the brands producing university apparel to source from factories in which workers have the freedom to form union and earn enough to support family in addition it will require these brands to pay enough for their goods to make this possible if you would like to find out more about the dsp as well as how to get more involved then please go to wwwstudentsagainstsweatshopsorg send letter to uofm decision makers at httpwwwunionvoiceorgcampaignmichiganarrested earth day is coming up many of the students at tls are concerned about the environment and the school boasts about its environmental commitment tls is already leader in environmental responsibility but there is still lot more progress that could be made where do you see the school cutting corners on the environment how should we celebrate earth day send ideas jailed journalistblogger josh wolf released on april 3rd independ ent repo rter josh w olf was freed from f ederal custody fter spending 7 12 m onths in pr ison f or failing t tur n over

record amount of time for an journalist in u s his tory another fallen comrade in the war on psychological freedom by winston smith i originally wrote this article when i heard about ollie getting kicked out for failing her drug test recently she has been readmitted to the school under circumstances and requirements which are unknown to this is developing story so i encourage you to investigate on your own to find out what the most recent news it or join the discussion list i have maintained the original article for your viewing pleasure here because i still believe it conveys powerful message that may be repeated several more times in the future what is interesting here is that this demonstrates severe inconsistency in how the administration doles out punishments from what i understand ollie was already on final before this incident occurred and most kids would have gotten kicked out had this happened to them this could represent loosening of the school drug policy but i believe it most likely is just another inconsistency in every war there are casualties in some wars these casualties are needless and many lives could have been saved if the right decisions had been made but in most wars fought for freedom these casualties are all needed the lup and the student body are amidst many struggles for equality human rights dignity and freedom and every so often we receive news that leaves us extremely disenchanted today is one of those such days as we have learned that ollie was kicked out for failing drug test there are many arguments that could be put forth about why the prohibition should be ended and it will be assumed for simplicitys sake that those are all well known the government and schools have very similar motives for banning drugs the government bans drugs because they are mindaltering and present threat to power of its authority the prohibition creates an economy ripe for exploitation by the cia to strengthen their power and pressure put on them by special interest groups is very strong the school bans drugs because they are threat to student complacence parents dont want students using drugs and drug tests serve as blackmail material by giving random drug tests the school maintains culture of fear these techniques have been used in fascist countries for all of history fear is very effective way to control people for short amounts of time but in the end the desire for freedom and the increasing equality gap render it useless the roman empire conquered land through threat of invasion leaders such as mao have used the threat of execution to silence political radicals and the united states government has mercilessly prosecuted groups like like the black panthers to drive fear into the hearts of wouldbe revolutionaries the school also has used fear in the past to censor students as they have false claims of legal action and forced previous student newspapers to shut down the drug tests used by the leelanau school are accurate however the way the school assesses and uses the information presented by them is completely wrong drug tests show that student has consumed specific illegal substance in specific time frame they do not show as the school would like students and parents to believe that the drugs were used on campus voluntarily taken or not as result of close contact with other drug users as result it is restriction on students right to due process and crossexamination of evidence because drug tests are scientifically accurate the option of contesting the evidence is not given even though the schools application of information gleamed from the drug test is suspect at best evidence from these drug tests would never be admitted to court civil or criminal so it seems ridiculous to expect it to pass among the student body random drug tests have long been used to repress students and it is time that students stand up to their use while all students upon entry to the leelanau school signed away all their rights if you refuse to urinate for the school administration there is nothing the school can do they can threaten all they want but the reality of the situation is that the school could not obtain ruling from judge forcing you to urinate or to hand over monetary damages the waiver is simply so that you do not file civil suit for penalties against the school or dispute evidence from them later and does not require you to take the drug tests so next time they ask for your cooperation resist they can stop one but they cannot stop us all and power in numbers is what we have know the facts and know your rights dont donate your bodily fluids to oppression and dont perpetuate the school fear culture because you are hurting everybody were not gonna take it by an anonymous observer on friday the school had planned to make attendance to dorm outings mandatory this plan was severely flawed and it was canceled without the help of several students from kindel this may not have been possible despite the schools commitment to free speech as outlined in the student handbook they jumped to the opportunity to block the lup website which shows that their idea of free speech really isnt free despite risking punishment these brave and for now anonymous students marched into mr frileys room to complain about the mandatory plans to go on outings some of them had the act test the next day and coming back from dorm outing at 1130 would be serious threat to their test scores studies have shown time and time again that students should be well rested and fed before tests yet the school found it reasonable to send kids to bed late in addition events like this shouldnt be mandatory as it was revealed during the kindel dorm meeting the school used its last opportunity where everybody was gone right before spring break to check all the smoke alarms in dorms while we dont know if they had any plans this last time there are guarantees and its better to be safe than sorry the sat is designed as all other standardized tests to put all students at the same level and evaluate how much they know which cant be achieved if they are under physical stress caused by sleep deprivation according to maslows hierarchy of needs needs at the bottom of the pyramid must be fulfilled before needs above them on the bottom of the pyramid are needs such as breathing food sleep and excretion whereas the top has things like morality and creativity it should also be noted that sex is on the bottom and schools strict pda policy deprives students of this on and off campus because school rules apply off campus too regardless the school cant expect students to do well on the act if they havent been sleeping since achievement is three levels above sleep the students organized themselves spontaneously and this is perfect example of the power we can achieve by standing together planning needs to be done because revolution is an act not process so heres toast to those students who risked their safety and reputation to protect those of us who wanted fair shot at the act student rights declaration draft this is draft of the student right declaration please submit comments so we can improve it once we have received comments we will publish another edition and continue until all the issues have been resolved after the draft is finalized this paper
