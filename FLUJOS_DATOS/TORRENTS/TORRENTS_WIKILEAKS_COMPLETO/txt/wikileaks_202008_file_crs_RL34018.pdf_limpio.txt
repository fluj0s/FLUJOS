multipollutant legislation in the 110th congress summary with the prospect of new layers of complexity being added to air pollution controls and with electricity restructur ing putting premium on economic efficiency interest is being expressed in finding mechanisms to achieve health and environmental goals in simpler more costeffective ways the electric utility industry is major source of air pollu tion particularly sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and mercury hg as well as unregulated greenhouse gases particularly carbon dioxide co2 at issue is whether new approach to environmental protection could achieve the nations air quality goals more cost effectively than the current system one approach being proposed is m ultipollutant strategy framework based on consistent set of emissions caps implemented through emissions trading just how the proposed approach would f it with the current and proposed diverse regulatory regimes remains to be worked out they might be replaced to the greatest extent feasible or they might be overl aid by the framework of emissions caps in february 2002 the bush administration announced two air qua lity initiatives the first clear skies would amend the clean air act to place emission caps on electric utility emissions of so2 nox and hg implemented through tradeable allowance program the emissions caps w ould generally be im posed in two phases 2008 and 2018 clear skies wa s reintroduced in the 109th congress as s 131 the second initiative begins voluntary greenhous gas reduction program this plan rather than capping co2 emissions focuses on improving the carbon efficiency of the economy reducing 2002 emissions of 183 metric tons pe r million dollars of gdp to 151 metric tons per million dollars of gdp in 2012 in the 110th

quality multipollutant legislation in the 110th congress introduction electric utility generating facilities are major source of air pollution the combustion of fossil fuels petroleum na tural gas and coal which accounts for about twothirds of us electricity genera tion results in the emission of stream of gases these gases include several pollutants that directly pose risks to human health and welfare including particulate matter pm1 sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and mercury hg particulate matter so2 and nox are currently regulated under the clean air act caa and the envi ronmental protection agency epa has promulgated rules to regu late mercury beginning in 2010 other gases may pose indirect risks notably carbon dioxide co2 which contributes to global warming2 table 1 provides estimates of so2 nox and co2 emissions from electric generating facilities annual missions of hg from utility fac ilities are more uncertain current estimates indicate about 48 tons utilities are subject to an array of environmental regulations which affect in different ways both the cost of operating existing generating facilities and the cost of constructing new ones table 1 emissions from

227 adopted the so2 and nox emission caps of the administrations clear skies proposal it did not include many other provisions including regulatory changesmultilayered and interlocking patchwork of controls moreover additional controls are in the process of development particularly with respect to nox as precursor to ozone to both nox and so2 as contributors to pm25 and to hg as toxic air pollutant also under the united na tions framework convention on climate change unfccc the united states agreed to voluntary limits on co2 emissions the current bush administration has rej ected the kyoto protocol which would impose mandatory limits in favor of voluntary reduction program in contrast to the administrations position in june 2005 th senate passed nse of the senate calling for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases that would be designed not to impose significant harm on the economy3 for many years the complexity of the air quality control regime has caused some observers to call for simplified approach now with the potential both for additional control programs on so2 and nox and for new contro ls directed at hg and co2 intersecting with the technological nd policy changes affecting the electric utility industry such calls for simplific ation have become more numerous and insistent one focus of this effort is the multipollutant or fourpollutant approach this approach involves mix of regulatory and economic mechanisms that would apply to utility emissions of up to four pollutants in various proposals so2 nox hg and co2 the objective would be to balance the environmental goal of effective controls across the pollutants covered with the industry goal of stable regulatory regime for period of years the bush administrations proposals in february 2002 the bush administra tion announced two air quality proposals to address the contro l of emissions of so2 nox hg and co24 the first proposal called clear skies would amend the clean air act to place emission caps on electric utility emissions of so2 nox and hg implemented through tradeable allowance program the emissions caps w ould be imposed in two phases 2010 2008 in the case of nox and 2018 as part of complete rewrite of title iv of the clean air act the administrations pr oposal was introduced in the 108th congress as hr 999 and s 485 revised versi ons of clear skies legisla tion were introduced in the 109th congress as hr 227 and s 1315 the proposal has not been reintroduced in the 110th congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34018crs3 6 for discussion of those prev ious plans see crs

contains separate titles on transportation fuel efficiency renewable fuels elimination of certain tax provisions for the oil industry and research on abrupt climate change the second administration proposal in itiates new voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program similar to ones introduced by the earlier george h w bush and clinton administrations6 developed in response to th us ratification of the 1992 unfccc these previous plans projected us compliance or near compliance with the unfccc goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at their 1990 levels by the year 2000 through voluntary measures th bush administration proposal does not make that claim projecting only 100 milli on metric ton reducti on in emissions from what would occur otherwise in the year 2012 total emissions would continue to rise instead the plan focuses on improvi ng the carbon efficiency of the economy reducing 2002 emissions of 183 metric tons per million dolla rs of gdp to 151 metric tons per million dollars of gdp in 2012 it pr oposes several voluntary initiatives along with increased spending and tax incentives to achieve this goal the administration notes that the new initiatives would achieve about onequarter of the objective while threequarters of the project ed reduction is seen as occurring through existing efforts proposed legislation and legislative action in the 110th congress in the 110th congress five bills have been introduced that would impose multi pollutant controls on utilities they are all fourpollutant proposals that include carbon dioxide s 1168 introduced by nator

generally more stringent than the comparable provisions of s 131 of the 109th congress it is difficult to compare the co2 caps contained in these bills with the administrations proposal concerning co2 both because the administrations proposal is voluntary rather than mandatory and because it is broader covering all greenhouse gas emissions rather than just utility co2 emissions the five bills are summarized in the appendix each of these bills generally builds on the so2 allowance trading scheme contai ned in title iv of the 1990 cleanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34018crs4 8 pl 101549air act amendments caaa8 under this program utilities are given specific allocation of permitted missions allowances and may choose to use those allowances at their own fac ilities or if they do not use their full quota to bank them for future use or to sell them to other utilities needing additional allowances allowance allocations for so2 nox and co2 all five bills introduced in the 110th congress provide for tradeable allowance scheme to implement their emission caps on so2 nox and co2 however allowance allocation sc hemes in the bills differ w ith s 1201 and s 1554 containing detailed provisions for allocating so2 nox and co2 allowances to various economic sectors and interests in most cases these interests or their trustees in the case of households and dislo cated workers and communities would auction off or otherwise sell their allowances to the affected utilities and us the collected funds for their own purposes in addition s 1201 requires the increasing use of auctions mandating 100 of the annual allowance allocation be au ctioned within 15 years of enactment in contrast s 1168 bases its allowan ce formulas on fuel usage adjusted by factors specified in the bill along with requirement that 25 of the allowances be auctioned s 1177 specifies co2 and nox limitations based on electricity output and so2 limitations based on the current title iv program the bill sets schedule for increasing the percentage of the annual allowance allocation that is to be auctioned with 100 required in 2036 and thereafter finally hr 3989 auctions 100 of its co2 allowances while providing discretion to epa to allocate so2 and nox allowances hg controls on mercury all five bills focus on achieving 90 reduction by 2011 s 1554 and hr 3989 2013 s 1201 or 2015 s 1168 and s 1177 in c ontrast the emissions goal of s 131 of the 109th congress would have llowed about three times more emissions and three to five more year s for compliance in addition all but hr 3989 restrict hg credit trading to plantwide averaging of emissions in contrast with the capandtrade program of s 131 hr 3989 is even more stringent imposing the emissions rate limitation on unitbyunit basis co2 reduction requirements the bills currently introduced in the 110th congress specify co2 reductions in contrast the administrations co2 proposal relies on various voluntary programs and incentives to encourage reductions in greenhouse gases from diverse sources including co2 emissions from electric generation these voluntary reductions should not be taken as given as neither the ge orge h w bush administrations nor thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34018crs5 clinton administrations voluntary programs achieved their stated goals thus in one sense comparing mandatory reduction program such as that proposed by s 1168 s 1177 s 1201 and s 1554 with the administrations voluntary program is comparing apples to oranges the first is legally binding the second has been criticized as merely an exhortation the co2 reduction requirement s of s 1168 s 1201 and s 1554 are similar except that s 1201 and s 1554 requires affected sources also offset co2 emissions from small electric generating units in cont rast s 1177 imposes cap that starts out slightly higher than the other two bills and declines on slower schedule finally hr 3989 has the most deta iled reduction scheme with substantial reductions from coalfired facilities sc heduled through 2050 all but hr 3989 have provisions to cr eate offsets and fac ilitate sequestration efforts among its titles s 1168 has ex tensive provisions providing for greenhouse gas offsets from landfill methane ch4 sulfur hexafluoride sf6 projects afforestation or reforestation energy fficiency agricultura l practices manure management and biomass the provisions in s 1177 include allowance allocations for incremental nuclear capacity clean coal technology and renewable energy along with programs to encourage sequestrati on likewise s 1554 includes allowance allocations to encourage renewable ener gy energy efficiency and sequestration finally s 1201 requires the epa to develop standards for providing allowances for geologic and biological sequestration related regulatory provisions in addition to emissions caps s 131 of the 109th congress would have substantially modified or eliminated several provisions in the clean air act with respect to electric generating facilities the bill would have eliminated new source performance standards nsps section 111 and replaced them with statutory standards for so2 nox particulate matter and hg for new sources modified sources could have also opted to comply with these new statutory standards and be exempted from the applicable best available control technology bact

existing sources could have also received these exemptions if they agreed to meet particulate matter standard specified in the bill along with good combustion practices to minimize car bon monoxide emissions within three years of enactment in addition s 131 would have provided these exemp tions for industrial sources that choose to opt into the clear skies progra m s 131 also would have included an exemption for steam electric generating facilities fro m hg regulation under section 112 of the caa including the residual risk provisions and relief from enforcement of any section 126 petition with respect to reducing interstate transportation of pollution before december 31 2014httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34018crs6 the five bills in the 110th congress generally omit the regulatory changes of s 131 while introducing new provisions all fi ve bills would revise the current new source review nsr program to require affected electric generating units 40 years or older 30 years old in the case
