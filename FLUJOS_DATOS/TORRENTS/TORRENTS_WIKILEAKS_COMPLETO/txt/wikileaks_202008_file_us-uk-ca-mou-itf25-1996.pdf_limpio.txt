distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractors i unclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractorsexecutive summary itf25 concluded that there is hazard from the release of industrial chemicals in military situation toxic industrial chemicals are legitimate articles of commerce are widely produced and traded and are available worldwide it is highly likely that canukus forces will encounter toxic industrial chemicals in their military missions throughout the world the use of industrial chemicals could impact on the following missions warconflict peacemaking enforcing peacekeeping humanitarian aid disaster relief counterterrorism and counter proliferation several scenarios focusing on production storage and transport facilities in which industrial chemicals could be either inadvertently or deliberately released have been identified the major hazard is from massive releases from storagetransport containers of liquified pressurized gases itf25 defined toxic industrial chemicals as those chemicals which are produced in quantities exceeding 30 tonnes per year at single facility and have lct 50 value by inhalation in any mammalian species of less than 100000 mgminm3 eleven hundred sixtyfour chemicals were identified which met the toxicity criterion this number was reduced by considering only those chemicals that were gases or liquids or solids with an appreciable vapour pressure at 20oc or were listed in the us department of transportation emergency response guide by applying the producibility criterion the number was further reduced to 98 hazard index was developed to rank these 98 toxic industrial chemicals according to their significance in military situation twentyone chemicals were ranked high 41 medium and 36 low data sheets for the chemicals ranked high and medium have been developed and are included in the report the chemical industry and national regulatory agencies have developed databases and regulations regarding the safe handling and transport of industrial chemicals itf25 has interfaced with these communities and developed list of available resources for assistance and additional information formal memorandum of understanding with the united states chemical manufacturers association has been established to provide oncall aroundtheclock assistance for emergency response information guide to understanding the hazard from toxic industrial chemicals has been produced and provides an introduction to these hazards it further provides advice on pre and post deployment

usukca government agencie s contractorsthe model slab was selected as the most appropriate interim heavy gas model for use in the prediction of challenge levels ca modified slab to make it more appropriate for use by itf25 and the modified version canslab has been provided to all members of the itf the model has been applied to numerous typical situations to provide estimations of expected challenge levels and areas of effect lethal hazard zones have been estimated for typical chemical storage sites and hazard distances recommended within which encampments should be established inservice protection equipment has been assessed for effectiveness at the expected challenge levels inservice respirators should only be used to evacuate the immediate hazard zone resulting from the release of industrial chemicals selfcontained breathing apparatus must be used in the immediate hazard zone because of the potential lack of oxygen and the very high challenge levels like to be encountered commercially available detection equipment has been identified there is threat from toxic industrial chemicals but the hazard is manageable provided commanders are educated about and informed as to the extent and nature of the threat t h potential impact of deliberate or accidental releases of industrial chemicals on canukus forces may be lessened but to do so it is imperative

unclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractorsintroduction 1 international task force 25 itf25 hazard from industrial chemicals was formed at the march 1994 meeting of the program officers and requirements officers poro of the usukca memorandum of understanding on chemical and biological defense terms of reference march 1994 2 the terms of reference tor of itf25 approved by the posros in march 1994 are given below terms of reference for itf25 hazard from industrial chemicals background the statements by combatants in the bosnian civil war that chlorine might be used weapon of opportunity has focused the need for an evaluation of the potential battlefield hazard to canukus forces from the use of industrial chemicals or non cwc listed industrial chemicals that could be readily modified for military applications in peacemaking roles canukus force may operate in countries with well developed chemical industries which are capable of producing large quantities of toxic industrial chemicals these chemicals or modification thereof could be deliberately used by the combatants against each other or against canukus forces or inadvertently released when production storage or transport facilities are subjected to attack industrial chemicals are legitimate articles of commerce which are traded in very large volumes and are not subjected to the same regulations or export controls as are chemical warfare agents objective the objective is to determine whether there is hazard from the release of industrial chemicals in military situation terms of reference to develop criteria for assessing the hazard from industrial chemicals and such industrial chemicals that can be readily modified for military applications and to draw up list of chemicals of concern b to review existing toxicological data on the chemicals of concern and to develop an agreed set of values c to review available models required for the simulation of the release of industrial chemicals models for the transport and dispersion of neutrally buoyant and heavy gases should be reviewed their deficiencies noted and the best currently available models selected for interim useunclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractors 2 unclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractorsd to review the adequacy of current protective equipment against expected challenge levels of the chemicals of concern and to recommend commercially available equipment to remedy any deficiencies to review commercially available detection methods and equipment for the chemicals of concern and f to develop database of industrial groups eg chemical producers which could provide information in emergency situations guidance the itf is expected to utilize information available including that in the 1989 nato ltss the uk po letter ptnit120288294 dated 23 march 1994 and from civilian emergency planning organizations chemical producer groups regulatory agencies etc time frame report will be presented at the september 1994 poro meeting giving preliminary appreciation of whether there is indeed hazard including some illustrative examples b if there is indeed hazard program to complete the terms of reference should be presented to the posros at the september 1994 poro meeting composition since the itf requires information from very diverse disciplines ie toxicology modelling detection and protection it is envisioned that the members will supply expertise in their own particular area and act in coordinating

from 1618 may 1994 the principal objective of the meeting was to review available information to determine whether there was indeed hazard from the use of industrial chemicals in military situation since the members concluded after their review that hazard existed they proceeded to structure the tor into doablepieces and to develop way forward to present to the posros at the september 1994 meeting 7 second meeting was held at the erdec from 1114 october 1994 to assess progress and to share data and information the members greatly benefited from presentations and discussions with dr robert romano of the chemical manufacturers association that took place at this meeting 8 third meeting of itf25 was held at the chemical and biological defence establishment cbde united kingdom from 2428 april 1995 to draft finalized set of data tables to initiate preparation of the final report and to draft the commanders guide 9 final meeting of itf25 was held at the defence research establishment suffield dres canada from 25 28 july 1995 to complete the data tables the commanders guide and the final report 10 agendas for the four meetings are given in appendix u definitions and criteria 11 the first tor instructed itf25 to develop criteria for assessing the hazard from industrial chemicals the required definitions unanimously agreed to by itf25 follow these definitions provided the basic criteria on which existing databases were searched and were used to construct appropriate databases for the findingsunclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractors 4 unclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractorsthreat the ability of an enemy or potential enemy to limit neutralize or destroy the effectiveness of current or projected mission organization or item of equipment 12 the threat definition was extracted from the glossary section of the 12 march 1986 update to army regulation ar 38111 threat support to us army force combat and materiel development the itf noted that the threat from industrial chemicals could involve people and associated materiel or cause an adverse impact on the mission or the organization through delay or diversion further dissemination of hazardous industrial chemicals and the consequential probable deleterious effects on civilian and military populations have potential to alter national policies in region related example is the lebanon incident where an explosives laden truck crashed into us marine corps troop housing unit resulting in the death of many soldiers this terrorist action resulted in the withdrawal of the us forces from the region and worldwide changes in security measures at us facilities coincident use of industrial chemicals could have similar impact industrial chemical material capable of being produced in quantities exceeding 30 tonnes per year at one production facility otherwise it is considered speciality chemical 13 the itf reviewed the september 1992 version of the chemical weapons convention cwc rolling text which deals with the classes of chemicals proposed for control schedule 3 chemical activities pertain to chemicals that have been used as or considered as warfare agents but that are manufactured in sufficiently large quantities for legitimate industrial purposes all facilities that produce more than 30 tonnes of schedule 3 chemicals per year must be declared under the provisions of the cwc list of the schedule 3 toxic chemicals and precursor compounds is given in appendix b the chemical manufacturers association cma centred in washington dc estimates that over 25000 commercial facilities worldwide produce process or stockpile chemicals that fall within the purview of the cwc each year more than 70000 different chemicals amounting to billions of tonnes of material are produced processed or consumed by the global chemical industry large portion of these chemicals are excluded from the cwc but may exhibit characteristics or be sufficiently hazardous to be threat in military situation 14 toxic industrial chemicals will be found in practically every region of the world in which canukus forces will operate figure 11 illustrates the number of manufacturers by country that produce chemicals for commercial distribution and sale figure 22 shows that only three countries have declared stockpiles of chemical warfare agents although few other countries are suspected of having cw capabilities practically all countries have the ability to manufacture hazardous chemicals and any industrialized nation will have chemicals that could pose threat to military forces in their region 1 data compiled from listings in the 199596 directory of world chemical producers chemical info rmation services

usukca government agencie s contractors 5 unclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractors15 industrial chemicals are available in bulk quantities during production in storage prior to use or shipment or during their transport from one location to another depending on the available routes of movement and quantity of chemical to be moved transport can occur by truck or railroad tank cars over water by barge or boat over land through above or belowground pipelines and sometimes by air 16 the criteria used to draw up the initial list of chemicals of concern are toxicity and producibility producibility producible as an industrial chemical in quantities exceeding 30 tonnes per year at one production facility toxicity lct 50 value3 of less than 100000 mgminm3 approximately the same as that of ammonia in the vapour or aerosol phase in any mammalian species toxic industrial chemical tic an industrial chemical has lct 50 value less than 100000 mgminm3 in any mammalian species and is produced in quantities exceeding 30 tonnes per year at one production facility 17 the number of compounds of potential importance is enormous the present study considered only those compounds that produced an acute inhalation effect effects from chronic exposures eg small long term releases from valves or seal leaks in pipes or storage tanks or from inhalation of combustion products from fires eg breakdown products of burning plastics or of carriers of compounds eg asbestos laden smokes from building insulations were noted but not considered 18 an initial screening of the registry of toxic effects of chemical substances rtecs 1 identified 1164 chemicals which met the toxicity criteria this list of chemicals was reduced by including only those that were gases or liquids or solids with an appreciable vapour pressure at 20oc or those that were listed in the us department of transportation dot emergency response guide available producibility data were used to further reduce the list 19 itf25 recognized that the release of large volumes of hazardous chemicals could produce environmental damage that could result in long term ecological catastrophe to flora fauna and water resources it also recognized that antimateriel effects could be caused by cor rosive and flammable industrial chemicals consideration of both of these effects has been excluded from this study 3 lct 50 is the inhalation dosage vapour concentration of the compound multiplied by the time of exposure that is lethal to 50 percent of the population of exposed unprotected experimental

deployed in traditional role of waging war in highly industrialized area the deliberate or accidental release of industrial chemicals is practically assured with limited conflicts and highly sophisticated weapons such as smart bombs major industrial sites can be targeted selectively to ensure that collateral damage is minimized however with the postcold war world the traditional role of the military is being superseded by involvements in operations other than war ootw the itf analyzed various military missions and noted the ootw activities in which military presence has been frequently engaged these missions shown in figure 3 include wararmed conflict peacekeeping4 peacemaking enforcement5 humanitarian and civic assistance disaster relief counterproliferation counterterrorism 21 as shown in figure 3 variety of actions can result in industrial chemicals being deliberately or accidentally released in military situation for example during peacemaking operations the warring factions may deliberately release hazardous chemical against the opponent or possibly intentionally disseminate the chemical against the peacemakers the deliberate actions by terrorists agitators or opportunists in the field of operations are most difficult to predict or to defend against because the acts can be performed by small groups or nonaligned persons with illdefined objectives 22 if the peacemakers determine that the chemicals in question would best be made inaccessible for use or destroyed then deliberate release could occur during preventive or preemptive counterstrike of the facilitiescontainers by friendly forces 4 peacekeeping is defined in general as noncombat military operations undertaken by outside forces with the consent of all major belligerent parties and designed to monitor and facilitate implementation of an existing truce agreement in support of diplomatic efforts to reach settlement of the dispute peacekeeping actions are usually conducted under the provisions of chapter vi of the united nations charter 5 peacemaking enforcement constitutes form of combat or armed intervention involving all necessary measures to compel compliance with international sanctions or resolutions the primary purpose of which is the maintenance or restoration of peace under conditions broadly accepted by the international communityunclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractors 9 unclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractorsfigure 3 use of industrial chemicals

unclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractors23 during peacemaking situations quantity of ordnance expended by the warring factions could go off target and impact an industrial site or container of hazardous chemicals although not intended the consequences of misdirected ordnance may include atmospheric release of chemicals or create chemicalfires that produce discharges and residues that deleteriously impact the c ivilian community and peacemaking forces 24 industrial chemicals may be released by accident in the lesserdeveloped countries the safety environmental maintenance and transportation standards for manufacturing facilities industrial sites and shipping containers are usually substantially less stringent than in canukus thus in these areas of the world it is more likely that an industrial accident will result from human error poorlymaintained equipment and deteriorating facilities natural causes such as earthquakes and atmospheric phenomena lightning etc can be the cause of accidental releases especially where substandard construction codes were followed 25 in future military situations greater emphasis will be placed on ensuring the safety of the indigenous population and assuming more responsibility for maintaining remediable environment identifying who is in charge of the civilian population police civil emergency military etc and determining paths of communication with local officials will be important actions regarding operations in an area methods and processes to alert the civilian population of the need to evacuate affected areas must be prepared in advance so as to minimize the impact on the mission caused by blockage and overcrowding of roadways 26 to lessen the impact of deliberate or accidental releases of industrial chemicals on canukus forces it is imperative that all elements of training preparation prediction detection protection and countermeasures be considered before deployment

hazard classes of materials each compound listed is first described in general terms and action orientated guidance relating to first aid personnel protection remediation in the event of fires and environmental considerations is offered 32 the residue monitoring program of the us food and drug administration provides list of 325 pesticides in widespread agricultural use 14 these compounds are listed in appendix h many of the pesticides are organophosphates carbamates or other compounds with potential or known high toxicity for mammals however pesticides have not been included in this study mainly because most typically have low vapour pressures such toxic compounds with low vapour pressures tend to be principally hazardous by skin contact and by ingestion but fine mists of small droplets could also present hazard by inhalation many of the banned chemicals eg ddt which are longer found in the canukus commercial markets may still be extensively found and used in developing counties 33 thus pesticides warrant further investigation and should form the basis of separate study not only to determine whether the chemicals can present an immediate hazard in military situations but also to determine any potential chronic hazard an entire regulatory and information network exists for these compounds the extension toxicology network extoxnet accessible through the internet 15

initial emergency response guide 16 supplies similar information to that contained in us dot emergency response guidebook 35 in the uk the health and safety executive hse publishes information and regulations on hazardous industrial compounds these include the control of industrial major accident hazards regulations 1984 cimah 17 which forms the basis of the control of major chemical hazards and major toxic hazards in the uk cimah also sets criteria for grouping chemicals into three levels of toxicity depending on the lct 50 value in rats over four hour period of exposure 36 for this study data on the toxicity of industrial chemicals was obtained primarily from registry of toxic effects of chemical substances rtecs 1 and from publications of the united kingdom health and safety executive hse itf25 accepted toxicological data as given in rtecs and did not attempt to look up original references human toxicity estimates are given in reports by the hse hse studies have traced data to the original literature and carefully evaluated all data used since hse data is used for regulatory purposes and therefore must consider the entire population estimates are toward the conservative side selection of chemicals 37 at the first meeting of itf25 preliminary list of 17 hazardous chemicals of concern was drawn up table 1 at least six of the chemicals on this list arsine chlorine cyanogen chloride hydrogen cyanide phosgene and hydrogen sulfide were used as war gases during world war i andor were weaponized by the us or the uk the other 11 chemicals have been involved in major industrial accidents or were ranked high on the lists of concern by the uk hse or the us dot 38 each country agreed to search available databases to select additional industrial chemicals which met the toxicity and producibility criteria the lct 50 was the toxicity parameter used in the initial screening toxicity values were obtained from rtecs and the species considered were rats and mice these species were selected as they were the most frequently used experimental animals although acute toxicity data eg exposure time of 10 minutes or less were more appropriate the scarcity of data required that data determined for longer exposure times eg 4 hours or longer be considered in estimating value of the lct 50 it was assumed that habers rule was obeyed eg the lc 50 value was multiplied by the exposure time the initial screening identified 1164 candidate industrial chemicals that met the toxicology selection criterion ie had lct 50 value of less than 100000 mgminm3 in either the rat or mouse 39 since itf25 considered that the principal hazard from industrial chemicals was an inhalation hazard chemicals which were solids at 20oc were dropped from further consideration unless the chemical was known to have an appreciable vapour pressure at this temperature eg sulfur trioxide the number was further reduced by focusing on those chemicals designated as hazardous in dot emergency response guidebook or by the uk hse in making this selection itf25 reasoned that the us dot and the uk hse would have identified those hazardousunclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractors 13 unclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractorschemicals which were produced in quantity and routinely transported in either country this allowed itf25 to reduce the number to the 156 chemicals listed in appendix c table 1 preliminary list of chemicals of concern arsine chlorine cyanogen chloride hydrogen cyanide hydrogen sulfide phosgene allyl alcohol ammonia acrolein bromine formaldehyde hydrogen chloride hydrogen fluoride hydrogen selenide methyl isocyanate oxygen difluoride phosphine 40 because actual production figures were difficult to obtain except for the top 50 to 60 chemicals produced in the us itf25 used the number of companies offering given chemical for sale as an indication of production this data was obtained primarily 199293 edition of the directory of world chemical producers late in the study the chemical manufacturers association provided list of chemical produced in excess of 30 tonnesyear at least one production site the continents and countries in which manufacturing takes place were also collated see appendix v this additional information reduced the number of chemicals of concern to 98 hazard index 41 itf25 was asked by the posros at the september 1994 meeting to develop hazard index which would rank the chemicals identified in the secondary screening see appendix c itf25 considered that for given chemical to present hazard in military situation the chemical must be present in sufficient quantity in the area of concern must exhibit sufficient toxicity by inhalation and must normally exist in state which could give rise to an inhalation hazard 42 the probability that given chemical would be present in an area of concern can be estimated by considering the geographical distribution of countries producing the chemical as well as the number of countries producing it itf25 reasoned that chemicals which have world wideunclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractors 14 unclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractorsproduction as indicated by production on all six continents have higher probability of being found in specific area of concern than those chemicals that are produced on only one continent it similarly reasoned that the larger the number of producers the higher the probability that the chemical would be found in specific area of concern 43 the higher the vapour pressure the greater the potential inhalation hazard therefore those chemicals which normally exist as gases present higher potential inhalation hazards than those which exist as low vapour pressure liquids 44 itf25 considered the idlh value as the most appropriate toxicity value for the hazard index this value indicates the concentration at which chemical is deemed to be immediately dangerous to the life and heath of humans it is also available for wide range of chemicals 45 using the above reasoning itf25 defined the hazard index hi as the product of four factors where number between 1 and 5 is assigned to each factor according to the ranking scheme given in table 2 thus hi ftoxicityxstatexdistributionxproducers 46 the maximum value of the hazard index is 54 625 the toxic industrial chemicals tic were ranked into three categories as an indicator of relative importance and to assist in hazard assessment high hazard indicates widely produced stored or transported tic which has high toxicity and is easily vaporized medium hazard indicates tic which may rank high in some categories but lower in others such as number of producers physical state or toxicity low hazard overall ranking indicates that this tic is not likely to be hazard unless specific operational factors indicate otherwise 47 chemicals which had hi of 81 or greater were ranked high those with hi between 36 and 80 medium and those with hi less than 36 low of the 98 chemicals which met the initial toxicity and producibility criteria 21 ranked high 41 medium and 36 low see table 3 48 the hazard index ranking provides general guidance to planners in given operational situation it is essential that the planners determine exactly what chemicals are in the area of concern and assess the hazard from any chemical found in quantity that is listed in appendix c if chemical is known to be available or its use is threatened toxicity by any route should be evaluatedunclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractors 15 unclassified distribution limited to

hazard from the release of an industrial chemical it is necessary to calculate the challenge levels for potential release scenarios tor 3 stated that itf25 should review available models used to simulate the release of industrial chemicals note their deficiencies and select the best currently available model for interim use to complete this tor itf25 asked the technical cooperation program ttcp technical panel9 on hazard assessment tp9 for guidance tp9 formed an ad hoc working group on heavy gas modelling hgmwg led by mr j bowers of dugway proving ground to quickly review available models itf25 stated that the interim model must be able to calculate total dosage distance contours and concentrationtime profiles at selected positions run on pc 486 based and be available to all participants correspondence between the chairs of itf25 and tp9 are contained in appendix l 52 in september 1994 the hgmwg conducted review of commonly used public domain models and limited number of proprietary models and concluded that slab sept 1990 version 18 developed by lawrence livermore laboratories was the best of the public domain models see appendix l for the evaluation of the proprietary models the hgmwg relied on an independent review of heavy gas models by hanna et 19 as it was not practical to purchase the models the one proprietary model that was evaluated phast version 42 20 was not deemed to be significantly more appropriate for the work of itf25 and was dropped from further consideration because of its high purchase priceunclassified distribution limited

dres extended slab to include calculation of the flashing fraction and the probability of lethality contours and made the program more user friendly this recoded version of slab entitled canslab 22 was made available to itf25 in january 1995 the uk modification done by mr john medhurst of cbde which produced output in format suitable for use in variety of graphics packages was made available to itf25 in may 1995 examples of challenge levels for selected scenarios calculated using slabcanslab are given in appendix 55 tp9 recognised that itf25 required model which would consider the effects of complex terrain since currently available heavy gas model which runs on pc considers this effect it would be necessary to select complex terrain model and modify it to consider heavy gas effects this was not possible within the time constraints of itf25 delivery of model by later than january 1995 tp9 has recommended that the us defense nuclear agencys complex terrain model scipuff be enhanced to consider heavy gas releases itf25 supports this recommendation to develop scipuff as the next generation heavy gas model 56 the us surveyed commercial software for environmental applications trinity

engineering 24 and cep software directory 25 are provided at appendix p for convenience hazard management protection 57 nuclear biological and chemical nbc filtration systems for individual protective equipment ipe involve use of particulate filter for removal of liquid and solid phase aerosols followed by vapour filter to remove gas phase toxic materials the particulate filter is of high efficiency particulate air hepa media offering 9997 filtration efficiency of 03 micron diameter aerosol particles approximating the most penetrating sized particle through hepa media the vapour filter consists of activated carbon which has been impregnated with reactive materials the capture of harmful vapours makes use of two mechanisms physical adsorption in the pores of the activated carbon and chemical reactions with the impregnants low vapourunclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractors 18 unclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractorspressure chemicals such as cw nerve and mustard agents are removed from the airstream by physical adsorption in the microporous structure of the carbon higher vapour pressure compounds such as cyanogen chloride and hydrogen cyanide are not strongly physically adsorbed and rapidly penetrate nonreactive activated carbon bed specific reactive chemicals are impregnated on the activated carbon to chemically decompose high vapour pressure chemical warfare agents and to provide effective filtration of these gases 58 although military standard impregnated carbons were developed to specifically filter chemical warfare agents numerous industrial chemical vapours will be filtered by the sorbents the filtration performance against chemical vapours are dependent on the vapour pressure and the reaction chemistry of the chemicals in general chemicals with vapour pressure below 10 mm hg at 25oc are effectively removed by physical adsorption in the pores of the activated carbon between 10 and 100 mm hg some short time protection filtration will occur before breakthrough of the filter by the chemical occurs depending on the challenge concentrations chemicals with vapour pressures above 100 mm hg are ineffectively filtered by the physical adsorption process the chemical reaction properties of the chemical and the impregnants thereby become very important 59 many of the important industrial chemicals considered as potential hazard in this study eg chlorine ammonia phosgene possess high vapour pressures 100 mm hg and undergo poor physical adsorption in the activated carbon beds of military filters the filtration effectiveness thus depends on the ability of the impregnants to react with these chemicals either to decompose them into nonhazardous gases or to convert them into chemical compounds which are retained on the carbon surface military filters have only been tested for their effectiveness against few of the industrial chemicals of importance and most tests are performed at challenge levels well below that expected following catastrophic release of bulk supplies 60 when chemical vapours are removed by chemical reaction with the impregnants greater protection in terms of concentration time ct product protection levels are observed when the challenge levels to the filter are low this relationship apparently results because the rate of mass of chemical being fed at high concentrations is often greater than the rate at which the impregn ants can react with the chemical lower challenge levels provide increased times for reaction resulting in reactions proceeding more nearly to completion 61 analysis of typical situations involving release of bulk quantities of toxic industrial chemicals shows that very high concentrations of vapour are expected within the immediate vicinity of the source in particular most immediate deaths will take place from exposures or fragmentation effects within 400 m of the release and lethal concentrations will occur up to 5 km from the source depending on time of daynight and meteorological conditions and the quantities of chemical involved the dosage levels of chemicals will generally exceed the 100000 mgminm3 range and there could also be severe lack of oxygen in the cloud 62 with these very high concentration feed levels there is the risk that the heat of reaction in impregnated carbon filtration beds could be sufficiently high so as to cause ignition of the sorbent bed this effect can become problem with challenge concentrations that exceed five percent byunclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractors 19 unclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractorsvolume military filters therefore should not be relied upon for protection against reactive vapours at extremely high concentration levels further with high concentration levels the environment can be devoid of oxygen or have oxygen levels too low to sustain life even if effective filtration should occur only selfcontained breathing apparatus is effective in these circumstances 63 more thorough discussion and assessment of the performance of cw agent filters for filtering five industrial toxic chemicals from air is found at appendix i 64 for firefighting entering any enclosed space where there has been chemical spill or spill cleanup work selfcontained breathing apparatus must be used the military respirator does not afford sufficient protection within the immediate hazard zone where extremely high concentrations of industrial chemicals may occur and where the lack of oxygen requires the use of selfcontained breathing apparatus the military respirator should only be used for emergency protection against the immediate effects of toxic release and while evacuating from the immediate hazard zone military protective suits are not designed for handling toxic industrial chemicals 65 insufficient data are available from tests conducted on inservice respirator filtration of toxic industrial chemicals to reliably indicate safe exposure ct value if exposed outside the lethal hazard zone similarly commercial industrial respirators are designed to filter low level concentrations of laboratoryplant emissions and usually for particular compounds and are not for use at high and extended concentration levels resulting from massive releases of toxic industrial chemicals only selfcontained breathing apparatus will suffice in these circumstances detection 66 some chemical plants facilities storage containers or transport containers may be identified by international hazchem markers appendix g these take the form of diamond and contain information which can be used to identify the exact industrial chemical when encountering suspect industrial chemical the commander should attempt to identify the exact chemical and all possible information before planning any action 67 detection of toxic industrial chemicals can in some circumstances be made by inservice military chemical detection systems some chemical agent monitors cam were modified for use in the gulf war to have the capability to detect both hydrogen cyanide and phosgene with cam additional chemicals can in principle be added through software modifications and changes in dopant however there is limit to the number of chemicals that cam can be programmed to detect 68 commercial modifications of the cam are available for environmental vapour monitoring femtoscan salt lake city utah in joint venture with graseby ionics offers the

volatile organic chemicals at present it can identify over 100 compounds including the classic chemical warfare agents see appendix j the systems described above could be used as point detection systems to provide an alarm of toxic industrial chemical presence 70 toxic industrial chemicals can be present in very high concentrations such that all respirable oxygen has effectively been displaced this occurs in confined spaces lowlying areas or in storage containers which have not been properly evacuated should there be requirement for entry into or operation in such areas respirable air alarm should be used several models are available and are commonly found in engineering and maintenance units 71 industrial detection systems are available for the rapid detection of specific chemicals such as chlorine ammonia or hydrogen sulfide detection systems such as the draeger detector system can be used for detecting and determining the concentration of large number of dangerous chemicals this system comes in the form of simple kit which uses individual tubes to detect variety of specific industrial chemicals such systems can be supplied to units operating in areas where there is known hazard from industrial chemicals because of the operation of the detection tubes they can only provide confirmationidentification of the presence of toxic industrial chemical and cannot be used for monitoring dangerous concentration levels representative list of available detection systems for toxic industrial chemicals is provided in the appendix k 72 comprehensive listing of air sampling instruments for analyzing airborne gases and vapours has been collated by the american conference of government industrial hygienists inc 26 this edition describes the various direct reading instruments and provides underlying theories of sampling vapours and particulates operations around toxic industrial chemicals 73 most toxic industrial chemicals will be released as vapours these vapours will tend to remain concentrated downwind from the release point and in lowlying areas such as valleys ravines or cellars high concentrations could be found in buildings woods or where there is little air circulation subject to overriding operational considerations the preferred positions for locating static military positions are at maximum elevation on open ground upwind or away from the sources of industrial chemicals 74 military protection and decontamination equipment were not designed for handling toxic industrial chemicals for proper handling protection and hazard management

us department of transportation emergency response guidebook and seek assistance from the chemtrec hotline see appendix commanders should identify prior to any operations the local civilian authorities who may have additional emergency response procedures and resources which can be used 75 personnel or equipment that may have been contaminated with toxic industrial chemicals can be decontaminated by washing with large amounts of cold soapy water contaminated clothing should be immediately removed and disposed of in safe manner hazard distances 76 table 4 shows hazard distances to be observed from chemical production or storage sites these are distances within which dangerous or lethal exposure levels could be reached if massive release occurs and were determined by exercising the slab program for typical situations the first figure is for use during the day the second figure is for use at night and may be more applicable over snow during the day the distances include safety allowance to cover variations in terrain effects meteorological conditions nature of release and vagaries of the human response toxic load values typically lcnt10 where these were available or had been estimated from the results of experiments with animals were used to determine the distances deliberately erring on the side of caution however it should be noted that the distances do not correspond precisely to toxic load values even lcnt5 or lcnt1 and that the distances are only intended for guidance during military operations and planning and are not predictive values furthermore the distances may need to be increased where consideration of the dangers to the civilian populace with wider range of response and including more hypersensitive individuals than military force arises and to ensure that there are injurious effects of any degree or type to unprotected personnel 77 releases of toxic industrial chemicals are most dangerous at night the downwind hazard distance from nighttime release is much longer than that for daytime release additionally escape is much more difficult at night the victims are likely to be asleep and even if awake will have difficult seeing the approaching gas cloud large nighttime release is the scenario most likely to cause heavy casualties 78 respirators should always be carried within these hazard distances and troops should be briefed on the hazard and on the actions to be taken in the case of release encampments should be sited within the nighttime hazard distance of chemical plant storage site rail depot etc 79 the most important action in the case of massive release of an industrial chemical is immediate evacuation for example anyone who sees storage vessel blow up or clouds of vapour evolving from chemical site should immediately don his mask and evacuate the area as soon as possible the greatest risk from large scale toxic chemical release occurs when the vic tims of the release are unable to escape and are overcome by fumes or blast effects this may occur because they are unaware of the release are trapped are required to remain at their post or are unable to evacuate in time it is vitally important that commanders and troops be made aware that theunclassified distribution limited to usukca government agencie s contractors 22 unclassified distribution limited to usukca

impact on the mission can be devastating unless extensive preparation planning and training is accomplished ahead of time important elements of consideration are highlighted in the guide there is indeed threat from industrial chemicals in military situations but with proper planning intelligence information and preparation the hazard is manageable conclusions 88 there is threat from the release of industrial chemicals in military situation the hazard is manageable provided commanders are educated about and informed to the extent and nature of the threat to lessen the impact of deliberate or accidental releases of industrial chemicals on canukus forces it is imperative that all elements of training preparation prediction detection protection and countermeasures be considered before deployment to an area 89 toxic industrial chemicals are legitimate articles of commerce are widely produced and traded and are available worldwide it is highly likely that canukus forces will encounter toxic industrial chemicals in their military missions throughout the world 90 the use of industrial chemicals could impact on the following missions warconflict peacemaking enforcing
