permitted by law in investigations involving the abuse of the myspace service in connection with unlawful activity this law enforcement guide is designed to serve that purpose by providing information to facilitate law enforcement requests for user data held by myspace the guide specifies what information is collected by myspace how long that information is retained how to tailor requests to ensure myspace produces the specific information sought and the legal process necessary to permit myspace to disclose different types of information the guide also addresses the most frequently asked questions from law enforcement about seeking information from myspace finally the guide provides contact information for myspace personnel dedicated specifically to responding to law enforcement requests including emergency requests introduction the myspace service empowers millions of users to communicate with worldwide online network of friends myspace recognizes however that some users may abuse the myspace service to engage in unlawful activity and that myspace also may hold information in some instances that would otherwise assist law enforcement for example in locating child in danger myspace supports the vision of providing safer and more secure environment for all myspace users accordingly myspace is committed to high level of cooperation with law enforcement to assist in investigating and identifying those involved in activity that undermines this vision myspace firmly believes that educating law enforcement about the user information it retains and myspaces ability to lawfully disclose such information to law enforcement will permit law enforcement to gain access to the information it needs to fulfill its mission more efficiently and effectively accordingly myspace created this law enforcement guide which attempts to provide transparency about myspaces ability to serve law enforcements needs given the size and scope of the myspace service myspace receives voluminous requests for information many of which are initiated by parties engaged in civil disputes because myspace wishes to prioritize law enforcement requests it has established dedicated lines of communication reserved solely for law enforcement requests furthermore this guide is intended solely for use by bona fide law enforcement agencies and may not be distributed to any other person or organization without the express written authorization of myspace myspace will require verification that the person requesting this guide is bona fide law enforcement officer or acting on behalf of law enforcement agency or prosecutors office this guide is the property of myspace and myspace reserves the right to change any of the policies stated in this guide at any time without notice myspace will make reasonable efforts to inform law enforcement of any significant changes in policies or procedures through updates to this guide the information in this guide is not intended to create any enforceable rights against myspace 4 b general information about myspace and law enforcement requests myspace is free online social networking service that allows users to create their own profile pages which can include lists of their favorite musicians books and movies photos of themselves and friends and links to pages within and outside the myspace environment the service also per mits users to send and receive private messages with other myspace users and to restrict the disclosure of certain information blogs profile information exclusively to their myspace friends there are also many third party features that can be used with myspace profile but which are not controlled by myspace myspace does not charge its users to set up their profiles or establish an account it does not require or accept credit card or other payments and does not independently verify the identity of its users therefore it is possible for user to establish false identity or name users also have the ability to retain or delete certain information stored in their accounts for these reasons myspaces ability to produce information sought by law enforcement will in many cases be determined partially by the actions taken by the user myspace is committed to assisting with law enforcement investigations to the fullest extent consistent with applicable law the primary set of laws governing myspaces ability to disclose user information is found in the electronic communications privacy act 18 usc 2701 et seq ecpa because myspace functions as both an electronic communications and remote computing service as defined under ecpa ecpa mandates that myspace disclose certain user information only in response to specific types of government process including subpoenas court orders and search warrants generally speaking ecpa permits the disclosure of basic user identity login information and stored files in response to subpoena but requires court order under 2703d to disclose additional user records or search warrant to authorize disclosure of private user messages the rules may differ also depending on whether law enforcement seeks stored historical information or to capture information prospectively for example if law enforcement seeks ongoing information about users ip address each time they login to their account the law would require pen registertrap and trace order should you seek further clarification about ecpas restrictions on providers like myspace we suggest you contact the department of justices computer crime and intellectual property section ccips at 2025141026 in myspaces experience most law enfor cement requests seek information about the user identity or specific materials in connection with particular aspect of the myspace service therefore myspace attempts in this guide to provide sufficient information to permit law enforcement to serve narrowly tailored requests issued under the appropriate criminal process in order to facilitate myspaces ability to lawfully disclose the exact information sought in timely manner finally myspace receives number of reques ts for information that is publicly available and can be obtained without the need for legal process or assistance from myspace myspace profiles can be searched directly from the myspacecom home page myspace also has extensive help pages that may assist law enforcement in determining if the information is publicly available and may further assist law enforcement in understanding the particular features offered the myspace help pages can be found via link at the top right hand corner of the myspacecom home page 5 c the categories of information myspace collects and retains 1 public information myspace users may choose whether to make their profile information publicly viewable and available or to keep it private and limited only to the friends of their choosing for public profiles the publicly available information includes journal entries unless the profile owner has elected to make the specific entry private images user comments friend lists and public profile information such as first name headline music movies books and all other public sections on myspace profile there is need to issue legal process to myspace to obtain this information rather myspace suggests that the law enforcement investigator make an electronic copy of the public components of the profile in question by saving the web pages and files on her computer to do so while viewing the profile in question simply click your browsers f ile menu tab in the upper lefthand corner then drop down to and click save as make sure to do the same for all journal entries and the image gallery should you want records of those items 2 nonpublic information generally for private profiles the information noted above will only be available to the user her friends and to myspace and will require legal process for myspace to disclose in addition to the user information

myspace private messages or only to the user those friends the user has permitted to view the information and myspace blogs or journals marked private some of the information is provided by the users t hemselves upon registration or when updating profiles other items are collected by t he site automatically or involve private communications exchanged between myspace users depending on the type of information sought ecpa may require the use of different form of legal process the period myspace retains the information may differ and the user may have the ability to determine whether the information remains available the specific categories of nonpublic information available are identified below for each myspace provides general description of the available information to enable law enforcement to tailor requests to ensure the specific information is retrieved and able to be disclosed lawfully under ecpa please be mindful that myspace has more than 80 million users with access to variety of different features on the myspace service accordingly when drafting subpoenas court orders or search warrant please be as specific as possible about the account at issue and the nature of
