public policy issues summary ethanol plays key role in policy disc ussions about energy agriculture taxes and the environment in the united states it is mostly made from corn in other countries it is often made from cane sugar fuel ethanol is generally blended in gasoline to reduce emissions increase octane and extend gasoline stocks recent high oil and gasoline prices have led to increased interest in alternatives to petroleum fuels for transportation further concerns over climate change have raised interest in developing fuels with lower fuelc ycle greenhousegas missions supporters of ethanol argue that its use can lead to lower emissions of toxic and ozoneforming pollutants and greenhouse gases especially if higherlevel blends are used they further argue that ethanol use displaces petroleum imports thus promoting energy security ethanols detractors argue that various federal and st ate policies supporting ethanol distort the market and amount to corporate welfare for corn growers and ethanol producers further they argue th at the energy and ch emical inputs needed to turn corn into ethanol actually in crease emissions and energy consumption although most recent studies have found mode st energy and emissions benefits from ethanol use relative to gasoline depe nding on how the ethanol is produced the market for fuel ethanol is heavily dependent on federal incentives and regulations ethanol production is encouraged by federa l tax credit of 51 cents per gallon this incentive allows ethanol whic h has historically been more expensive than conventional gasoline to compete with gasoline and other blending components in addition to the above ta x credit small ethanol producers qualify for an additional production credit it has been argued that the fuel ethanol industry could scarcely survive w ithout these incentives in addition to the above tax incentives the energy policy act of 2005 pl 109 58 established renewable fuel standard rfs this rfs was expanded by the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 and requires the use of 90 billion gallons of renewable fuels in 2008 increasing each year to 36 billion gallons in 2022 much of this requirement will likely be met with ethanol in addition the bill requires that an increas ing share of the mandate be met with advanced biofuels biofuels produced fro m feedstocks other than corn starch potential advanced biofuels include domestic ethanol from cellulosic material such as perennial grasses and municipal solid waste ethanol from sugar cane and diesel fuel substitutes produced from va riety of feedstocks the united states consumed approximately 68 billion gallons of ethanol in 2007 mostly from corn sigificant supply of cellulosic ethanol is likely several years off some analysts believe the rfs could have serious effects on motor fu suppliers leading to higher fuel prices other issues of congressional interest in clude support for purer blends of ethanol as an

been an ongoing goal of us energy policy this promotion has led to the establishment of significant federal policies beneficial to the ethanol industry including tax incentives import tariffs and mandates for ethanol use the costs and benefits of ethanol and the policies that support it have been questioned areas of concern include whether ethanol yields more or less ener gy than the fossil fuel inputs needed to produce it whether ethanol decreases reliance on petroleum in the transportation sector whether its use incr eases or decreases greenhouse gas emissions and whether various federal policies should be maintained this report provides background and discu ssion of policy issues relating to us ethanol production especially et hanol made from corn it discusses us fuel ethanol consumption both as gasoline blending com ponent and as an alternative to gasoline the report discusses various costs and bene fits of ethanol including fuel costs pollutant emissions and energy consum ption it also outlines key areas of congressional debate on policies beneficial to the ethanol industry ethanol basics fuel ethanol ethyl alcohol is made by fermenting and distilling simple sugars it is the same compound found in alcoholic beverages the biggest use of fuel ethanol in the united states is as an additive in gasoline it serves as an oxygenate to prevent air pollution from carbon monoxid and ozone as an octane boos ter to prevent early ignition or engine knock nd as an extender of gasoline stocks in purer forms it can also be used as an lternative to gasoline in automobiles specially designed for its use it is produced and consumed mostly in the midwest where corn the main feedstock for domestic ethanol production is grown the initia l stimulus for ethanol pr oduction in the mid1970s was the drive to develop alternative and re newable supplies of energy in response to the oil embargoes of 1973 and 1979 since the 1970s production of fuel ethanol has been encouraged through federal tax incentives for ethanolblended gasoline the use of fuel ethanol was further stimulated by the clean air act amendments of 1990 which required the use of oxygenated or reformulated gasoline rfg the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 establishe d renewable fuels standard rfs which mandates the use of ethanol and other trans portation renewable

blends of gasoline with up to 10 et hanol about 1 is consumed as e85 85 ethanol and 15 gasoline and alternative to gasoline2 fuel ethanol is usually produced in the united states from the distillation of fermented simple sugars eg glucose derived primarily from corn but also from wheat potatoes or other vegetables3 however ethanol can also be produced from cellulosic material such as switchgrass rice straw and sugar cane waste known as bagasse the alcohol in fuel ethanol is id entical chemically to ethanol used for other purposes such as distilled spirit beverages and i ndustrial products4 ethanol and the agricultural economy5 corn constitutes about 95 of the feed stock for ethanol production in the united states the other 5 is largely grain sorghum along with some barley wheat cheese whey and potatoes corn is used because it is relatively low cost source of starch that can be relatively eas ily converted to simple sugars and then fermented and distilled the us department of agriculture usda estimates that about 32 billion bushels of corn will be used to produce about 6 billion gallons of fuel ethanol during the 20072008 corn ma rketing year september 2007 through august 20086 this is roughly 25 of the projected 13 billion bushels of total corn utilization for all purposes7 however it should be noted that ethanol production capacity is expanding rapidly and co rn demand for ethanol production may exceed usdas projection8 in the absence of the ethanol market lower corn prices probably would stimulate increased corn utilization in other markets but sales revenue would not be as high the lower prices and sales reve nue would likely result in higher federal spending on corn subsidy payments to farmer s as long as corn prices were to stay below the price

renewable fuels association9 about 80 of the corn used for ethanol is processed by dry milling plants which use grinding process and the other 20 is processed by wet milling plants which use chemical extraction process the basic steps of both processes are similar first the corn is processed with various enzymes added to separate fermentable gars from other components such as protein and fiber some of these other components are used to make coproducts such as animal feed next yeas t is added to the mixture for fermentation to make alcohol the alcohol is then dis tilled to fuelgrade ethanol that is 8595 pure then the ethanol is partially dehydr ated to remove excess water finally for fuel and industrial purposes the ethanol is denatured with small amount of displeasing or noxious chemical to make it unfit for human consumption10 in the united states the denaturant for fuel ethanol is gasoline ethanol is produced largely in the midwes t corn belt with roughly 70 of the national

association ethanol industry outlook 2005 homegrown for the homeland february 2005historically ethanol produc tion was concentrated among few large producers however that concentration has dec lined over the past several years table 2 shows that currently the top five companies account for approximate ly 42 of production capacity and the top ten companies account for approximately 48 of production capacity critics of the ethanol industry in general and specifically of the ethanol tax incentives have argued that the tax incentives for ethanol production equate to corporate welfare for few large producers13 however the share of production capacity controlled by the largest produ cers has been dropping as more producers have entered the market section 1501a2 of the energy policy act of 2005 required the federal trade commission ftc to study whether there is sufficient competition in the us ethanol industry the ftc concluded that the level of concentration in ethanol production would not justify presumption that single firm or small group of firms could wield sufficient market power to set prices or c oordinate on prices or output14 further they concluded that the vel of concentration has been decreasing in recent years overall at the beginning of 2008 dom estic ethanol production capacity was approximately 8 billion gallons per year and is expected to grow to 13 billion gallons per year counting existing plants and plants under construction15 under various federal and state laws and incentives consumption has increased from 18 billion gallons per year in 2001 to 68 billion gall ons per year in 2007 domestic production capacity will continue increasing to meet the growing demand including increased demand resulting from implementation of the renewable fuels standard established by the energy policy act of 2005 fuel is not the only output of an etha nol facility however coproducts play an important role in the profitability of plant in addition to the primary ethanol output the corn wet milling process generates corn gluten feed corn gluten meal and corn oil and dry milling process creates distillers grains corn oil is used as vegetable oil and is priced higher than soybean oil the other coproducts are used as livestock feed in 2004 us ethanol mills produced 73 million metric tons of distillers grains 24 million metric tons of corn gluten feed 04 million metric tons of corn gluten meal and 560 million pounds of corn oil16 revenue from the ethanol bypr oducts help offset the cost of corn used in ethanol production the net cost of corn relative to the price of ethanol and the difference between ethanol and wholesale gasoline prices are the major economic determinantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33290crs6 17 doe eia alternatives to traditi onal transportation fuels 2005 table c1 18 ibid 19 however gasoline prices have been high recently making ethanol more attractive as blending component 20 in fact there is some evidence that the com bustion efficiency of an engine improves with the use of ethanol relative to gasoline in this way greater percentage of energy in the fuel is transferred to the wheels however this improved efficiency does not completely negate the fact that there is less energy in gall on of ethanol than in gallon of gasoline 21 section 211 subsection k 42 usc 7545 22 co vocs and nitrogen oxides are the main precursors to groundlevel ozoneof the level of ethanol produc tion higher the corn prices lead to lower profits for ethanol producers higher gasoline prices lead to higher profits recently high corn prices have cut into corn ethanol producers profits fuel consumption approximately 7 billion gallons of ethanol fuel were consumed in the united states in 2007 mainly blended into e10 gasohol blend of 10 ethanol and 90 gasoline this figure represents only 5 of the approxima tely 140 billion gallons of gasoline consumption in the same year17 under the renewable fuels standard motor fuel will be required to contain 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel annually by 2022 it is expected that much of th is requirement will be met with ethanol ethanol consumption in 2007 accounted for approximately 4 of combined gasoline and diesel fuel consumption18 because of its physical properties ethanol can be more easily substituted for or blended into gasoline which powers most passenger cars and light truc ks however heavyduty vehi cles are generally diesel fueled for this reason research is ongoing into ethanoldiesel blends key barrier to wider use of fuel ethanol is its cost relative to gasoline even with tax incentives for ethanol use see th section on economic effects the fuel is often more expensive than gasoline per gallon19 further since fuel ethanol has somewhat lower energy content per gallon mo re fuel is required to travel the same distance this energy loss leads to 23 decrease in milespergallon vehicle fuel economy with 10 gasohol this is due to the fact that there is simply less energy in one gallon of ethanol than in one gall on of gasoline as opposed to any detrimental effect on the efficiency of the engine20 however ethanols chemical proper ties make it very useful for some applications especially as an additive in gasoline the oxygenate requirement of the clean air act reformulated gasoline rfg program provided major boost to the use of ethanol21 oxygenates are used to promote more complete combustion of gasoline which reduces carbon monoxide co emissions and may reduce volatile organic compound voc emissions22 in addition oxygenates can replace other chemicals in gasoline such as benzene toxic air pollutant conversely the higherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33290crs7 23 gasoline contains many different chemical compounds including toxic substances such as benzene in the case of leaking gaso line storage tank various compounds within the gasoline based on their physical properties will travel different distances through the ground the concern with ethanol is that th ere is very limited evidence that plumes of benzene and other toxic substances travel fa rther if ethanol is blended into gasoline however this property has not been firmly tablished as it has not been studied in depth susan powers david rice brendan dooher and pedro j j alvarez will ethanol blended gasoline affect groundwater quality environmental science and technology january 1 2001 p 24a 24 lead was commonly used as an octane enhancer until it was phasedout through the mid 1980s lead in gasoline was completely banned in 1995 due to the fact that it disables emissions control devices and because it is toxic to humansvolatility of ethanolblended gasoline can in some cases lead to higher voc emissions see air quality below the two most common oxygenates are etha nol and methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe until recently mtbe made primarily from natural gas or petroleum products was preferred to etha nol in most regions because it was generally much less expensive easier to transport and distribute and available in greater supply because of different distribution systems and gasoline blending processes substituting one oxygenate for another can lead to significant transitional costs in addition to the cost differential between the two additives despite the cost differential there ar several possible advantages of using ethanol over mtbe since ethanol is pr oduced from agricultural products it has the potential to be sustainable fuel while mtbe is produced from fossil fuels either natural gas or petroleum in addition et hanol is readily biode gradable eliminating some of the potential c oncerns about gr oundwater contamination that have surrounded mtbe see the section on mtbe however there is concern that ethanol use can increase the risk of groundw ater contamination by benzene and other toxic compounds23 both ethanol and mtbe also can be blended into otherwise nonoxygenated gasoline to raise the octane rating of the fuel highperformance engines and older engines often require higher octane fuel to prevent ear ly ignition or engine knock other chemical additives may be used for the same purpose but some of these alternatives are highly toxic and some ar regulated as pollutants under the clean air act24 furthermore since these other additives do not contain oxygen their use may not lead to the same emissions reductions as oxygenated gasoline e85 consumption in purer forms such as e85 ethanol can also be used as an alternative to gasoline in vehicles specifically designed to use it currently this use represents only approximately 1 of ethanol consumption in the ited states to promote the development of e85 and other alterna tive fuels congress has enacted various legislative requirements and incentives the energy policy act of 1992 requires the federal government and state governments along with businesses in the alternativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33290crs8 25 pl 102486 for example

gasoline consumption includes ethanol in gasohol approximately 22 million gasolineequivalent gallons geg27 of e85 were consumed in 2004 mostly in midwestern states28 see table 3 key reason for the

fueled by e8531 proponents of e85 and ffvs argue that even though few ffvs are operated on e85 the large number of these vehicles already on the road means that incentives to expand e85 infrastructure are more likely to be successful one obstacle to the use of alternative fuel vehicles is that they generally have higher purchase price than conventiona l vehicles although this margin has decreased in recent years with newer technol ogy another obstacl is that as stated above fuel ethanol is often more expensive than gasoline or diesel fuel in addition there are very few fueling sites for e85 pecially outside of the midwest as of february 2006 there were 556 fuel stations with e85 as comp ared to roughly 120000 gasoline stations across the country further 362 65 of these stations were located in the five hi ghest ethanolproducing states minnesota illinois iowa south dakota and nebraska in february 2006 there were only 60 stations in 10 states along the east and west coasts where population and thus fuel demand is higher however e85 capacity is ex panding rapidly and the number of e85 stations nearly tripled to 1365 betw een february 2006 and march 2008 and the number along the coasts had increased to 146 stations in 13 states although roughly half of all stations ar still in the top five ethanolproducing states development of cellulosic feedstocks key barrier to ethanols expanded role in us fuel consumption is its price differential with gasoline since major pa rt of the total production cost is the cost of feedstock reducing feedst ock costs could lead to wer wholesale ethanol costs for this reason there is great deal of interest in producing ethanol from cellulosic feedstocks cellulosic materials include lowvalue waste products such as recycled paper and rice hulls or dedicated fuel crops such as switchgrass32 and fastgrowing trees dedicated fuel crop would be gr own and harvested solely for the purpose of fuel production however as the name

gallons in 2022 there is specific carveout for cellulosic biofuels reaching 16 billion gallons in 2022 economic effects ethanols relatively high price is major constraint on its use as an alternative fuel and as gasoline additive as result ethanol has not been competitive with gasoline except with incentives wholesale ethanol prices excl uding incentives from the federal government and state governments are significantly higher than wholesale gasoline prices with federal and state incentives however the effective price of ethanol is reduced furthermore gasoline prices have risen recently making ethanol more attractive as both blending component and as an alternative fuel before 2004 the primary federal incentiv supporting the ethanol industry was 52 cents per gallon exemption that ble nders of gasohol e10 received from the 184 federal excise tax on motor fuels b ecause the exemption applied to blended fuel of which ethanol comprises only 10 the exemption provided for an effective subsidy of 52 cents per gallon of pure ethanol the 108th congress replaced this exemption with an income tax credit of 51 cents per gallon of pure ethanol used in blending pl 10835743 table 4 shows that ethanol and gasoline prices are competitive on per gallon basis when the ethanol tax credit is factored in however the energy content of gallon of ethanol is about one third lower than gallon of gasoline as table 4 shows on an equivalent energy basis ethanol can be significantly more expensive than gasoline even with the tax credit the comparative cost figures in table 4 are for ethanol as blending component in gasoline however the use of e85 in flexible fuel vehicles has been associated with improved combustion effi ciency the national ethanol vehicle coalition estimates that ffvs run

quality one oftencited benefit of ethanol use is improvement in air quality the clean air act amendments of 1990 pl 101549 created the reformulated gasoline rfg program which was major impetus to the

some refiners claimed that the envir onmental goals of the rfg program could be achieved through cleaner although poten tially more costly gasoline that does not contain any oxygenates56 these claims added to the push to remove the oxygenate requirement and allow refine rs to produce rfg in the most costeffective manner whether or not that includes the use of oxygenates however since oxygenates also displace other harmful che micals in gasoline some environmental groups were concerned that eliminating the oxygenat requirements would compromise air quality gains resulting from the current standards this potential for backsliding is result of the fact that the current performance of rfg is substantially better than the clean air act requires if the oxygenate sta ndard were eliminate d

as motor fuel is that it reduces us reliance on oil impor ts making the us less vulnerable to fuel embargo of the sort that occurred in the 1970s to analyze the net energy consumption of ethanol the entire fuel cycle must be considered the fuel cycle consists of all inputs and pr ocesses involved in the deve lopment delivery and final use of the fuel for cornbased ethanol these inputs include the energy needed to produce fertilizers operate farm equipment transport cor n convert corn to ethanol and distribute the final product according to fuelcycle study by argonne national laboratory with current technology the use of cornbased e10 leads to 3 reduction in fossil energy use per vehicle mile relative to gasoline while use of e85 leads to roughly 40 reduction in fossil energy use61 however other studies question the ar gonne study suggesting that the amount of energy needed to produce ethanol is roughly equal to the amount of energy obtained from its combustion since large amounts of fossil fuels are used to make fertilizer for corn production and to run etha nol plants ethanol use could lead to little or net reduction in fossil energy use nevertheless recent metastudy

produce ethanol comes from natural gas or electricity most studies conclude that overall petroleum dependence as opposed to energy dependence can be significantly diminished through expanded use of ethanol despite the fact that ethanol displaces gasoline the benefits to energy security from cornbased ethanol are not certain as stated bove fuel ethanol only accounts for approximately 25 of ga soline consumption in the united states by volume in terms of energy content ethanol account s for approximately 15 this small market share led the government acc ountability office formerly the general accounting office to conclude that the ethanol tax incentive has done little to promote energy security63 further as long as etha nol remains dependent on the us corn supply any threats to this supply eg drought or increases in corn prices would negatively affect the supply andor co st of ethanol in fact that happened when high corn prices caused by str ong export demand in 1995 contributed to an 18 decline in ethanol production between 1995 and 1996 cellulosic ethanol energy balance because cellulosic feedstocks require far less fertilizer for thei r production the energy bala nce and other benefits of cellulosic ethanol could be significant the argonne study concluded that with advances in technology the use of cellu losebased e10 could reduce fossil energy consumption per mile by 8 while cellulosebased e85 could reduce fossil energy consumption by roughly 7064 greenhouse gas emissions directly related to fossil energy consumption is the question of greenhouse gas emissions proponents of ethanol argue that over the entire fuel cycle it has the potentia l to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles relative to gasoline therefore reducing the risk of possible global warming fuel cycle analysis because ethanol contains carbon65 combustion of the fuel necessarily results in emissions of carbon dioxide co2 the primary greenhouse gas further greenhouse gases are emitted through the production and use of nitrogenbased fertilizers as well as the operation of farm equipment and vehicles to transport feedstocks and finished produ cts however since photosynthesis the process by which plants convert light in to chemical energy requires absorption of co2 the growth cycle of the feedstock crop can serve to some extent as sink to absorb some fu elcycle greenhouse emissions according to the argonne study overall fuelcycle greenhouse gas emissions from cornbased e10 measured in grams per mile are approximately 1 lower

concluded that pure ethanol results in 13 lower greenhouse gas emissi ons with approximate ly 10 reduction using e8567 fuel cycle emissons from cellulosic ethanol because of the limited use of fertilizers fossil energy consum ption and thus greenhouse gas emissions is significantly reduced with ethanol production from cellulosic feedstocks the argonne study concludes that with advances in technology cellulosic e10 could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7 to 10 relative to gasoline while cellulosic e85 could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 67 to 8968 the metastudy of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions found similar potential for greenhouse gas reductions69 lifecycle analysis key criticism of fuelcycle analyses is that they generally do not take changes in land use into account for example if previously uncultivated piece of land is tilled to plan t biofuel crops some of the carbon stored in the field could be releas ed in that case the overall ghg benefit of biofuels could be compromised one study estimates that taking land use into account lifecycle analysis as opposed to fuelcycle an alysis the ghg reduction from corn ethanol is less than 3 per mile relative to gasoline70 while cellulosic biofuels have lifecycle reduction of 5071 other recent studies indicate even smaller ghg reductions this is of key interest because under the rfs as

was pending91 conclusion although the use of fuel ethanol has b een limited to date only about 3 to 5 of gasoline consumption it has the potential to significantly displace petroleum demand however the overa ll benefits in terms of energy consumption and greenhouse gases are limited especially in the case of cornbased ethanol with only slight net energy benefit from the use of cornbased ethanol transportation energy demand is essentially transferred from one fossil fuel petroleum to another natural gas andor coal there may be strategic benefits from this transfer especially if the replacement fuel comes from domestic s ources or from foreign sources in more stable areas however the benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reductions is limited cellulosic feedstocks have the potential to dramatically improve the benefits of fuel ethanol their use c ould significantly decrease the energy from all sources required to produce the fuel as well as decreasing associated greenhouse gaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33290crs24 however technologies to convert cellulose to ethanol at competitive costs seem distant for this reason there is wide support for increased federal rd federal incentives for ethanol use including tax incentives the rfg oxygenate standard and the renewable fuel s standard have promoted significant growth in the ethanol market annual us ethanol production increased from 175 million gallons in 1980 to 68 billion gallons in 2007 largely as result of these incentives federal incentives drive demand for the fuel as well as making its price competitive with gasoline enacted as part of the energy polic act of 2005 and expanded by the energy independence and security act of 2007 the renewable fuels sta ndard will continue to drive growth in the ethanol mark et as it mandates minimum annual amount increasing yearly of renewable fuel in gasoline while other fuels will be used to some extent to meet the standard the large share of the mandate will be met with ethanol the increasing demand for ethanol may lead to price pressures on motor fuel these price pressures and etha nol supply concerns in general could increase interest in eliminating the tariff on imported ethanol congress will likely continue to show interest in ethanols energy and environmental costs and benefits as well as its effects on us fuel markets any discussion of us energy policy includes promotion of alternatives to petroleum with limited petroleum supplies high prices and instab ility in some oilproducing regions these discussions are unlikely
