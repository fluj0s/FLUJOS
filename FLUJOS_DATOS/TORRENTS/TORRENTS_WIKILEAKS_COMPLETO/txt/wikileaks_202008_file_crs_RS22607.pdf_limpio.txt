or 3 to assault kidnap or murd er former federal judge or member of his or her family on acc ount of the performance of judges duties or 4 to threaten attempt or conspire to do so moreover the proscriptions are not limited to federal judges they protect federal w enforcement officers as well as prosecutors and in fact protect any federal officer or empl oyee or anyone assisting them as long as the threat assault kidnaping or killing has the necessary conn ection during or on account of to the performances of federal duties the penalties are calibrated according to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22607crs2 seriousness of the obstructing offense section 207 of pl 110177 increases the maximum penalties for voluntary manslaughter in such cases from not more than 10 years to not more than 15 years and for involuntar manslaughter from not more than 6 years to not more than 8 years several other fe deral statutes adopt the penalty structure by crossreference so that the amendment extends not only to the killing of federal judges officers and employees and those assisting them but also to manslaughter committed under several other fede ral jurisdictional circumstances as well federal witnesses witnesses and potential witnesses for federal judicial congressional and administrative proceedings enjoy somewhat comparable protection under the federal obstruction of justice statutes which outlaw murder assaults and threats intended to prevent or influence witness testimony or to retaliate for past testimony the penalties for murder manslaughter and attempted murder of federal witnesses are the same as when those crimes are committed against federal officials but those for assault and conspiracy are bit more severe s ections 205 and 206 of pl 110177 increase the maximum penalty for witness ta mpering or retaliation involving the use of physical force from 20 years to 30 years those involving the threat of the use of physical force from 10 years to 20 years and for harassment from 1 year to 3 years section 204 adds venue provision to the witness re taliation offenses in 18 u sc 1513 purporting to permit prosecution of offenses under the section eith er in the place where the violation occurred or in place where the proceeding occurred the constitution may confine section 204s reach the supreme court has indicated that the prosecution of offens other than where one of its conduct elements occurs poses serious constitutional problems means of obstruction beyond the proscriptions addressed to the use of violence against federal officials w itnesses and proceedings there are federal crimin prohibitions directed at the misuse of firearms explosives and other dangerous instrumentalities for example one federal statute 18 usc 930 outlaws the use of firearm or other dangerous weapon in fatal attack in fede ral facility it adopts by cross reference the penalties assigned elsewhere for murder manslaughter attempted murder or manslaughter and conspiracy to murder of manslaughter the same statute punishes with imprisonment for not more than 5 ears possession or atte mpted possession of firearm or dangerous weapon with in federal facility with the intent to use it there simple possession of firearm or dangerous weapon w ithin federal facility with imprisonment for not more than 1 year and simple posse ssion or attempted po ssession of firearm within federal courthouse with imprisonment for not more than 2 years section 203 of pl 110177 amends the proscription for s imple courthouse fir earm possession found in section 930e to include posse ssion of other dangerous wea pons as well the possession with intent proscription alread includes coverage of both the statute defines dangerous weapon very broadly it has been understood to cover shoes belts rings chairs desks teeth screwdrivers and host of other ordi narily innocent objects that could be misused to inflict serious injury when the definition makes it crime to possess such items in federal courthouse crime regardless of how innocently they are possessed practical problems may arise on the other hand if the courts read the definition out of the statute for purposes of simple courthouse possession prosecutions they may take the small knife exception with it and be left to their own devices to define what constitutes dangerous weapon the same incongruity however appear s to have escaped notice in the case of simple possession of dangerous weapon in federal facility ot her than federal courthousehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22607crs3 harassing federal officials with false liens retaliation against federal officials in the past has sometimes taken the form of filing false liens and other legal nuisance actions these obstructions have b een

grand or petit jurors in order to impede or influence their rvice moreover anyone who aids or abets the commission of these or of any other federal crime is criminally liable to the same extent as the individual who actually commits them liability for aiding or abetting however can only be incurred upon the commi ssion of the underlying offense section 202 of pl 110177 makes it federal crime to make publicly available certain identifying information such as home addre sses telephone numbers and social security numbers of federal officials employees witnesses and jurors grand and petite

located within the judicial branch its purpose is to promulgate sentencing guidelines for use by federal courts in criminal cases those guidelines once binding upon the courts are now simply adviso ry although the courts must continue to consider them and the guidelines continue to carry considerable persuasive force the commission may enter into contracts in fulf illment of its responsib ilities as general rule appropriated funds are available for obligation under contract or otherwise only during the fiscal year for which they were appropriated there are several exceptions to the general rule for example the heads of executive agencies may contract for services that begin in one fiscal year and end in the next they may also enter into multiyear contracts and with sufficient security

of senior judges the chief judges of the various united states courts of appeal or the various circuit judi cial councils may design ate and assign senior judges to perform judicial duties within the

district court judges who so appoint their clerks and court reporters individual judges appoint their own bailiffs law clerks and secretaries beyond the explicit exceptions and the general rule not withstanding there are several powers that only judge in regular active service and not senior judge may exercise thus the decision to present an appeal to all of the judg of particular circuit to grant hearing or rehearing banc is made by majority vote of the judges of that circuit who are in regular active service senior judge may par ticipate in an banc appeal only if he or she was member of the panel that initially decided the case being heard banc senior judges may serve as well as members of the judicial conference of the united states the rule propounding body for the federal courts

regular active service under section 371b of this title when designed and assigned to the court to which such judge was appointed the amendment may pr esent an interpretative challenge the problem is that only united states district court judges retire under section 371b the judges in the virgin islands guam and the northern mariana islands retire under section 373 the amendment should probably be unders tood to do more than to add senior united states district court judges those who may retire unde r section 371b to the core of judges who may participate in the decisi on to appoint magistrate judges for their districts judgeships in the ninth circuit section 509 of pl 110177 increases the number of judgeships on the ninth circuit court of appeals from 28 to 29 and reduces the number on the
