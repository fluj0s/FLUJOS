ii audit of unctad division on investment technology and enterprise development ae200634101 executive summary from february to april 2006 oios conducted an audi t of the unctad division on investment technology and enterprise development dite the udit focused on dites strategy structure funding arrangements programme and project managem ent and various administrative arrangements oios interviewed heads of branches c hief of sections various stakeholders including government representatives oios also rev iewed documentation annual reports publications and personnel files oios found dites structure consistent with its man date government representatives expressed general satisfaction with the dites work and regar ded dite as professional organization that remained focused uptodate and provided good expe rtise the government representatives cited the world investment report as crosscutting referenc and one of unctads best flagship reports unctad agreed to implement oios recommendations ai med to further improve the effectiveness efficiency and sustainability of their programmes nd projects and to review their fundraising strategy and technical cooperation procedures mission strategy and structure the science and technology section which services its own commission and has activities not clearly related to the rest of dite appears standalone component the secretary general has taken the decision to consolidate scien ce and technology and all information and communication and technologyrelated activities into one branch government representatives stated that dite needed to prioritise and revisit its activities although high level priorities budget and indicato rs exist through the general strategic framework and programme budget the division should further clarify its priorities at the working level and adapt its structure to adequately reflect its strategy dite needs to further develop workload indicators t support current allocation of resources and use them to justify reallocation reduction or increase of resources the secretary generals bulletin linked to the orga nization of the unctad secretariat needs to be updated to reflect the current activiti of the various branches of dite unctad indicated that an updated version would be p repared before the end of 2006 coordination and promoting capacity dites technical cooperation activities call for be tter coordination with other international organizations involved in investment donors expres sed concerns on aid effectiveness and conflicting prescriptions to the beneficiaries unctad confirmed that its coordination with other international organizations will be improved by the end of 2006 donors also had concerns over the overlap of some f dites products namely investment policy reviews iprs and investment guides as not ed in recent evaluation report to help promote its capacity oios recommended and unctad agreed that consolidating similar products be considered united nations nations unies support to commissions and intersessional work government representatives raised questions on the effectiveness of the intergovernmental machinery as well as on ad hoc expert groups alth ough there had been an effort to improve expert meetings efficiency the cost for ad hoc ex pert groups more than doubled over one biennium with their numbers remaining stable oios believes that there is further room for improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of the intergovernmental machinery and that unctad should initiate critical review unctad indicated that the recommendation should be addressed to member states since the effe ctiveness of intergovernmental machinery is beyond its direct authority technical cooperation despite initiatives to coordinate fundraising ther was still lack of clarity as to who was ultimately responsible for it to guide dite and ot her divisions in their fundraising unctad agreed to review fundraising processes and s tructures so that responsibilities are clear and activities are coordinated formal or documented process exists for prioriti sing the various technical cooperation requests unctad should develop criteria to assess its projects and clarify the project review process unctad agreed to formalize its process and develop criteria to assess projects by mid2007 the lack of an adequate project management system w as noted impacting on the planning monitoring and reporting of technical cooperation ctivities unctad indicated that the implementation of the itc portal substantive and financial management system by the end of 2006 will address the issue the separate reporting of substantive and financial issues to donors makes it difficult to assess the progress and efficiency of technical coo peration projects oios was of the opinion that too much emphasis was put on activities and ou tputs rather than results and impact the unctad report on technical cooperation activities s hould be restructured to disclose useful analytical and transparent information unctad agreed and confirmed such changes will be reflected in the 2007 report following the decentralization of project managemen t functions there was an absence of training and procedures to guide staff consequentl the quality of project management was left to the individual unctad should strengthen it s project design planning monitoring and evaluation unctad agreed to develop guidelines ensuring minim um quality standards by mid2007 performance assessment government representatives beneficiaries or extern evaluators generally assessed dites activities as relevant and effective dites system atic approach to evaluating its performance is noteworthy further efforts are necessary to ass ess the results impacts as well as the efficiency of its activities unctad indicated that resultsbased management pproach will be progressively extended to unctads extrabud getary activities throughout the 2006 2007 biennium oios noted that for dite extra budgetary activitie s insufficient consideration was given for their sustainability and exit strategy in th case of iprs several beneficiaries lacked the funds to implement the recommendations and re cent evaluation suggested that 30 per cent of the ipr budget be allocated for implementin g them unctad accepted oios recommendation to strengthen requirements with rega rd to sustainability of projects and activities by mid2007 administration oios noted numerous instances of noncompliance wit h the applicable instruction on consultants and individual contractors dite should introduce improvements to ensure that the selection process is competitive and documented and that consultants selected are the most competent meet the criteria set in the term s of reference and are issued contracts prior to commencement of work unctad indicated that the recommendation would be implemented with immediate effect the world association of investment promotion agenc waipa starting 2006 waipa an ngo which used to have its secretariat on unctad premises was relocated outside the premises waipas secr etariat staff at one time employed under contracts was separated from unctad in reviewing the procedures in place to run the wai pa secretariat from unctad oios noted that operations were run without adequat internal controls oios also noted instances

enterprise development dite the audit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 the united nations conference on trade and devel opment was established by general assembly resolution 1995 of 30 december 196 4 as permanent intergovernmental body and principal organ of the general assembly on trade and development with permanent secretariat in geneva with view to accelerating economic growth and development particularly that of developing countries the role of unctad based on ga resolution 51167 of 16 decembe r 1996 is to be the focal point for the integrated treatment of development nd interrelated issues in the areas of trade finance technology investment and sustaina ble development 3 dite is one of unctads four substantive divisio ns quoting the 2004 dite activities report dite has three objectives to increase the understanding of the role of foreign direct investment technology and enterpris activities in development to help devise adequate frameworks to attract investment an d benefit from it and to stimulate technology transfer and technical innovation and t build consensus on matters related to foreign direct investment technology and enterpris competitiveness 4 regular budget expenditures for the 20042005 b iennium totaled us 221 million while extra budgetary expenditures amounted to us7 6 million total of us 211 million which represents 95 per cent of the regular budget was allocated for staff costs currently 53 of the 85 posts at dite are professio nal posts 5 the findings and recommendations contained in th is report have been discussed during the exit conference held on 19 april 2006 with the officerincharge dite draft of this report was shared with the deputy secretaryge neral of unctad on 22 may 2006 whose comments have been reflected in the report in italics unctad has accepted all recommendations and is in the process of implementi ng them ii audit objectives 6 the main objectives of the audit were to assess the relevance of the structure of dite in vi ew of its mandate and objectives review the current financial and funding situation of dite evaluate the effectiveness of management practices to achieve dites programmes projects objectives and determine the effectiveness of internal controls to ensure economic and efficient use of financial and human resources and their compliance to regulations and rules especially relating to technical cooperation trust funds 2 iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit reviewed dites strategy structure f unding arrangements programme and project management and various administrative arran gements as well as its relationship with the world association of investment promotion agency waipa the audit covered activities for the biennium 2004 to 2005 t obtain an understanding of dites functions oios interviewed all heads of branches chiefs of sections senior management staff support services and government r epresentatives who are either donors or beneficiaries of dite oios also conducted an in depth review of sample of technical cooperation projects the audit reviewed annual rep orts publications financial reports funding arrangements and personnel files including those for consultants oios also attended the meetings held during the commission on investment in march 2006 iv audit findings and recommendations dites missions strategy and structure dites missions and structure 8 dites broad mandate derives from general assemb ly resolution 1995 of 30 december 1964 and resolution 51167 of 16 december 1996 dites activities fall under the three pillars of unctad consensus building re search and analysis and technical assistance dites structure adequately reflects it s missions and activities 9 the policies and capacity building branch of dit covers science and technology related activities although the name of the branch does not mention science or technology one section out of the four is entire ly dedicated to such topic the rationale for having merged science and technology activities into dite in 1996 was to consolidate various technology activities creating critical mass ten years later the section still appears standalone component serv icing its own commission undertaking activities that have clear link to the rest of d ite the recent emphasis the bangkok plan of action put on technology confirmed by the sao paulo consensus advocates more visibility on science and technology in the structu re of dite and unctad the secretarygeneral of unctad circulated memorandum on 23 march 2006 advising that science and technology and information and com munication technology ict related activities be consolidated into one branch oios believes that such an initiative would not only enhance the effectiveness and coordi nation of unctads activities in this field but also improve the homogeneity of dites s tructure b dites strategy and activities 10 both the unctad quadrennial conferences and the ecosoc commissions on investment and science and technology further detai l the priorities of dite these directions remain very broad and high level allowi ng the secretariat significant latitude for its own strategy nonetheless oios did not fin d documented comprehensive strategy for dite the decisionmaking process to initiate ctivities from the regular budget or extra budgetary sources allocate resources arbitr ate if necessary and monitor the progress 3 remains unclear dite explained that the decisionmaking process to initiate activities allocate resources arbitrate if necessary and mon itor the progress follows the procedures and methodology of the programme plannin g and budget division at headquarters oios is of the opinion however that the weaknesses identified in the decisionmaking and prioritizing process relates to managerial procedures rather than the formal process of allocating and authorizing funds 11 certain government representatives interviewed by oios also mentioned that dite lacked the capacity to prioritize build on effecti ve activities and revisit or discard those which were not effective this lack of prioritizing the large number of topics that require regular budget resources might result in less effic iency or gaps in dites coverage dite has already initiated comprehensive review of its mandates oios believes such exercise should become more systematic be it at th programme project or activity level 12 oios also noted an imbalance between dites res ources and country requests for capacity building for example in march 2006 tot of 23 country requests for investment policy reviews iprs were in the pipeli ne although dite mentioned that high number of request is an indication of the qual ity and usefulness of dites products the feasibility of all requested project should be considered and alternative solutions suggested when necessary for example with the imp lementation of an average of four iprs year dite would need more than five years t complete all pipeline reviews let alone any new request 13 furthermore the implementation of technical co operation projects has largely been decentralized in unctad technical cooperation proj ects appear in all of dites job descriptions from the p1p2 to the p5 level in 2006 depending on the figures used p 3 p4 regular budget post in dite managed an avera ge of 16 to 24 projects following recommendation from the advisory committee on admin istrative and budgetary questions a507 endorsed by the general assembl that regular budget activities do not subsidize extrabudgetary budget activities oio s is of the opinion that extra budgetary activities should not considerably weigh in on regu lar budget resources 14 dite would first need to go through an exercise to formulate clearly its mediumterm strategy and identify its priorities second the r esulting strategy and priorities would need to be compared to available resources assessing di tes capacity within existing resources the structure would need to show the nec essary flexibility reallocating resources to adapt to changing priorities 15 oios tried to identify possible workload indica tors in recent dite activities reports for 2004 and 2005 management accountability not on ly means monitoring and reporting outputs and impacts but also being held accountable ie monitor and report on the management of resources thus oios believes that k ey workload indicators should be developed to monitor the use of resources and facil itate decisionmaking in identifying potential reallocation recommendations head2right dite should develop formal mediumterm strategy as well as clarify and disclose related priorities for its regular budget and extra budgetary activities rec 01 4 head2right dite should determine threshold for its support t extra budgetary activities from regular budget resources and closely monitor the weight one has on the other suring it remains at reasonable level rec 02 head2right based on its strategy and priorities dite should d evelop workload indicators to document its current allocat ion of resources and justify its needs to reallocate or i ncrease or reduce existing resources rec 03 16 unctad accepted recommendation 01 and 03 and indica ted that the mediumterm strategy alignment and allocation of resources as well as indicators of achievement were already in place in the secretarygenerals strategic framework report and the proposed programme budget documents oios believes however that there is need for working strategy and allocation of resources more d etailed than exists presently indicators for achievement could also be developed to help ass ess overall efficiency oios will close these recommendations upon receipt of copy of f urther detailed mediumterm strategy with clearly articulated policies and workload indi cators 17 unctad accepted to ensure the appropriate use of re gular and extrabudgetary resources although without determining threshold for its support to extrabudgetary activities from regular budget resources unctad wi ll also refer the policy matter of support to extra budgetary activities to the progra mme planning and budget division at headquarters oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of results of its query to the programme planning and budget division and decision on the threshold for its use of regular budget resources for extrabudget ary activities 18 oios also noted that the distribution of functi ons among dite branches as provided in stsgb19981 on the organization of the secreta riat of unctad does not reflect the actual breakdown of functions especially for t rade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips and investment guides recommendation head2right unctad should review and suggest an update of the secretarygenerals bulletin on the organization of the secretariat of unctad to reflect recent changes in the functions of the various dite branches rec 04 19 unctad accepted the recommendation and confirmed new secretarygenerals bulletin on the organization of unctad secretariat would be prepared before the end of 2006 oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of copy of the approved stsgb b coordination and promoting capacity coordinating with other organizations 20 several international organizations such as th foreign investment advisory service the multilateral investment guarantee agency from t he world bank group the 5 organization for economic cooperation and developme nt in europe oecd and the united nations industrial development organization unido have developed their own products for investment while overlap with oecd is limited for geographical reasons the coverage as well as the activities of the above mentioned organizations appear very similar to those of dite dite explained that the mandates and focus of the different organizations were specific and that there was an xchange of information to avoid duplication dite tried to identify areas of techni cal assistance where it could carry out activities which are unique dite emphasized that special session of the commi ssion on investment technology and related financial issues provided forum for all these organizations and for interactive debate between th em attending the 2006 session oios noted however that the debates were limited and lit tle was discussed in the session on coordination 21 government representatives interviewed by oios whether on the donor or beneficiary side raised the issue of coordination with other i nternational organizations on several occasions some mentioning their tiredness of cons ultants although donors acknowledged that the situation was simpler in the area of investment the issue of aid effectiveness and negative impact of conflicting re views and recommendations remains concern 22 coordination did not appear sufficient enough for example some beneficiary countries would still shop for technical assistan ce having similar exercise carried out by several organizations avoiding duplication not only with enhanced coordination but also further differentiating products or working on niches would promote stakeholder capacity to promote investment and development recommendation head2right dite should further coordinate with other internati onal organizations involved in the area of investment t avoid overlap and duplication of efforts rec 05 23 unctad accepted the recommendation to improve coord ination during the 2006 2007 biennium oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of specific actions taken to improve coordination with other internatio nal organizations b integrating products 24 in 2005 the german development institute condu cted study on how to strengthen the development impact of unctads ipr it pointed out thaton the whole it therefore seems that the two products of iprs and investment guides have significant overlap and that this overlap should be considered not as pro blem but as result of efforts to make iprs more relevant for investment practice oios c ame across project descriptions of the blue book another product from dite which aimed to address the same issues as in the ipr another suggestion of the german developme nt institute was to develop the benchmarking component of iprs using the complemen tary investment compass tool of dite all of the above indicate potential for syn ergy between dites different products and approaches 25 dite should also liaise with other divisions in unctad to develop more 6 systematic joint programming exercise at the countr level in that context adequate monitoring tools providing consolidated view of activities at the country level should be developed recommendation head2right dite should consider integrating its approach and complementary products as well as coordinating act ivities at the country level with other divisions to gain rel evance develop synergies and increase its capacity rec 0 6 26 unctad accepted the recommendation and further inte gration and coordination internally will be considered by the end of 2006 oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of results of its initiative to integr ate andor further coordinate activities c support to commissions and intersessional work 27 the contribution of dite to the planning of mee tings and servicing during the commissions was perceived as satisfactory governme nt representatives stated that attendance to meetings and to the commission on inv estment although one of the best attended was still concern the question of the efficiency of the intergovernmental machinery was also generally mentioned suggestions for improvement were to include more prospective thinking as opposed to retrospect ive introspective into the commission or to shorten the duration of commissio ns 28 the budget of dite provides for experts travel costs oios noted that they more than doubled over one biennium although the number of m eetings remained stable unctad indicated that this was the result of an effort to improve the effectiveness of expert meetings which much depends on the quality of the participants and experts 29 oios believes that the mixed assessment obtaine d from government representatives reflects another facet of the intergovernmental mac hinery and calls for further critical review to further improve the effectiveness and eff iciency d technical cooperation projects funding analysis 30 dites extra budgetary funding fluctuated with us 15 million in 1995 peak at us 69 million in 2002 and us 33 million in 200 5 31 the source of income was balanced and stable w ith member states providing 60 to 70 per cent and igongos 30 to 40 per cent while nor dic countries are stable contributors to dite representing at least 20 per cent of techn ical cooperation income since 2001 the source of income has diversified in 1995 seven co untries were contributing in 2005 they were seventeen the share of undp funds dropped fro m 40 per cent of extra budgetary income in 1995 to 20 percent in 2005 32 an amount of us 71 million extrabudgetary res ources were anticipated in the proposed programme budget for 20042005 later reco sted at us 97 million total received contributions over the period amounted to us 76 million 7 b fundraising process 33 fundraising efforts at unctad have been largely decentralized to the divisions and to the project managers oios noted general lack of coordination of fundraising efforts by dite project managers project managers used th eir own networks to raise funds for projects falling under their responsibility despit initiatives to coordinate funds there was lack of clarity as to who was responsible for coo rdinating and raising funds for the various projects and activities 34 government representatives were very critical nd strongly advocated for structured and coordinated fundraising strategy some of them setting it as condition for future contributions oios also noted that the current dec entralized approach not only undermined attempts for divisional strategy but lso did not allow for sufficient oversight unctad needs to review its fund raising processes and could exchange experiences with other organizations with small size technical funds for best practices in the area of fundraising recommendations head2right unctad should review its fundraising processes co nsider coordinating or centralizing its fundraising activi ties for more rational and coherent strategy as well as inc reased oversight rec 07 35 unctad accepted the recommendation and will review its fundraising process by mid2007 oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of the results of the review of the fundraising process c reporting to donors 36 in reviewing funding agreements and how dite co mplied with specific donors requirements oios observed general compliance how ever financial and substantive issues being reported upon separately made it diffi cult to assess the overall progress and efficiency of projects 37 since the inception trust funds and until 2005 financial reporting was done with cumulative figures oios felt this was not transpar ent enough especially when successive phases to project were merged together effective 2006 for the 2005 financial year unctads financial statements have been brought in line with those of the united nations 38 in oios opinion often shared by donors the s ubstantive reporting on the project also put too much emphasis on the activities of the pro ject rather than on results and impact 39 information provided in unctads annual report on technical cooperation activities is very general and the various tables and annexes would need to be further improved for transparent and useful disclosure to the member sta tes recommendation head2right unctad should review its reporting on projects and 8 consider merging substantive and financial reportin g in order to relate expenditure and operational output uncta d should revisit the reports content to focus on the overall status of project implementation as compared to th work plan its results or impacts rec 08 40 unctad accepted the recommendation and will combine substantive and financial reports also improving the content of reports for the 2006 financial year oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of copy of combined substantive and financial reports as well as the unctad report on technical cooperation activities for 2007 d management of technical cooperation projects 41 oios could not gain clear understanding on ho w new activities or projects were initiated under whose authority and following wha t integrated strategy at dite the general understanding of technical assistance is th at it is demanddriven and relies on specific requests by governments those requests ar however made within the framework of existing products developed by the var ious divisions and project managers activities and projects are monitored at the sectio nbranch level through meetings or on more informal basis 42 in the absence of project committee at the di visional level formal or documented process existed for prioritizing the var ious technical cooperation activities or allocating unearmarked or softearmarked voluntary contributions in the case of iprs the necessity to address pipeline projects and allo cate the adequate level of resources was raised during the commission on investment held in march 2006 recommendations head2right unctad should formalize its decisionmaking process for initiating reviewing and prioritising projects i t should develop criteria to assess projects as well as oth er research and analysis activity rec 09 43 unctad accepted the recommendation and would formal ize its decisionmaking process for initiating reviewing and prioritizing projects as well as develop criteria to assess projects by mid2007 oios will close this recommendation upon receipt f unctads new procedures for initiating reviewing nd prioritizing projects and the set of criteria developed for assessing projects 44 training and guidance are generally accepted ccess factors for decentralization and delegation of authority in dite specific train ing was associated to the responsibility of project management specific guidelines were available either on how to initiate manageadminister monitor report on and close p roject as result oios noted that project files were of varying quality project documents were also not standard and some l acked provisions for indicators and evaluation information available on the recruitment of consult ants 70 per cent of the expenditure on our sample of projects was not sufficient to sure that selection was on 9 competitive basis monitoring tools existed in the different branches or sections but were not consolidated at the divisional level to report on the status of technical cooperation activities unctad made efforts to close inactive projects clo sing 192 inactive projects in 2005 compared to 56 in 2004yet out of total of 73 ope n projectstrust funds at the end of 2005 19 were still open although they showed ex penditure for the biennium 2004 2005 in one instance the authorization to use the balan ce of funds on other activities was not valid the use of one trust fund for several consecutive p rojects or phases did not allow for sufficient transparency on budgets and expenditures in one instance oios could not reconcile the budget in the initial project documen t with expenditures reported to the donors due to reporting on cumulative basis whi ch included activities prior to the project such cumulative reporting was discontinued in 2006 gaps in the evaluation coverage were observed larg escale projects or programmes were well covered while smaller ones were not for smaller projects introducing quantitative targets would allow for costeffecti ve evaluation not only on their effectiveness but also on their efficiency 45 oios notes the need for senior management of ctad to take immediate steps to strengthen project planning and management ensure compliance with existing rules and regulations and enhance the resources dedicated to evaluation recommendation head2right unctad should develop guidelines desk procedures for project managers to ensure rules related to project management are widely communicated and complied wit h as well as to provide guidance and ensure minimum qual ity standards rec 10 head2right unctad should develop project system that allows monitoring of both inputs and outputs at the projec t level and consolidated at the division and organizational lev els rec 11 46 unctad agreed with both recommendations which shou ld be implemented by mid 2007 oios will close these recommendations upon receipt of copy of the guidelines and documentation of the project system 10 dite activities relevance effectiveness

asar 48 oios found that government representatives were generally satisfied with dites work which they found useful very professional and of high quality the expertise provided by dite was perceived as very good invest ment was topic high on several donors agenda especially related to international investment agreements iia iprs or science and technology relevance and effectiveness 49 unctad dite has developed strong culture of valuation to report on its performance through various channels publications systematically included reader surveys press reviews were conducted and peer reviews consolidated downloads of reports were analysed and more detail would allow for more anticipation and planning needs in the various lan guages monthly downloads etc workshops and trainings also were evaluated by part icipants and the results analysed by third person reports were prepared by dite staff members for exp erts meetings and workshops 11 evaluation reports were available for the multiyear multidonors trust funds 50 the review of available data confirmed dites ffectiveness in its various activities 51 publications were well perceived iprs or the pink series on ii were especially mentioned the world investment report was very oft quoted as crosscutting reference or the best of unctads flagship reports government representatives showed more reservation when it came to the accuracy of fi gures and mentioned that sometimes member states should be consulted to ensure that th local context is properly captured 52 for certain government representatives met by ios dites preparation for the world trade organisations negotiations was useful to understand what was expected participants to training sessions for negotiators generally found them very relevant and useful to very useful the distancelearning module was well perceived although participants would have preferred more facetoface interaction 53 oios reviewed two evaluations reports of the ii programme training courses respondents evaluated the unctad programme in quest ionnaires with high ratings concerning usefulness and training efficiency as w ell as competence and effectiveness of the resource persons and training material they ap preciated learning about the complexity of bargaining and tradeoffs for mutual benefit th respondents also mentioned that they had already used the acquired knowledge in negotiat ions and investment treaties at the bilateral and regional level all respondents consi dered national seminars to have had positive impact on their countrys negotiation team s relating to iias the programme was also evaluated as costeffective 54 funding instability was mentioned to have impac ted on the programme and it was recommended that regular budget personnel resources be expanded as well as inhouse knowledge of the programme be improved with both r ecommendations having been addressed by the division weaknesses in outreach translating the iia series updating the website wide dissemination of the material we re also mentioned 55 government representatives identified the ipr as one of dites most valuable contribution it was very appreciated both by the b eneficiaries and donors especially for the seminars and the sense of partnership gained th roughout the exercise in the commission on investment the peer review and excha nge of experiences were seen as unique valueadding exercise useful suggestions we re made to expand the scope of the reviews to include local investors as well as wide r policy coherence reviews the follow up reviews were seen as useful way to ensure fast er implementation and increase accountability 56 midterm evaluation report on good governance in investment promotion programme ggip issued in december 2003 was also very pos itive on the effectiveness of the programme however the sustainability and th commitment of participating least developed countries and investment promotion agenci was the prime area for possible concern 57 dites systematic approach to evaluating its pe rformance is commendable and highly valuable and calls for complementary approach to be developed to evaluate the results and impact of activities 12 58 another recommendation from the midterm evalu ation of the good governance in investment promotion programme ggip could be int eresting in this regard and applied widely to dites projects it suggested that progr amme performance measurement and evaluation be built into the individual country activities and requirements recommendations head2right dite should develop representative indicators to as sess the result and impact of its activities at the design stage and ensure that they are systematically monitored rec 12 59 unctad accepted the recommendation and indicated th at resultsbased management approach would be progressively extended to unctads extrabudgetary activities throughout the 20062007 biennium oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of copy of representative indicators and documentation of their systematic monitoring by dite b efficiency 60 two evaluation reports one on iias and one on ggip address efficiency of dites activities in both instances the assessment is po sitive however dites performance with regard to efficiency appears to be more of mixed one in the eyes of donors and oios found problems in project management such as unrea listic timeframes or delays in implementation and capacity constraints in terms f finance or staffing which could directly have had an impact on activities 61 data management in unctad with regard to projec ts went so far in disconnecting the input or expenditure from the output such that efficiency proved difficult to assess the project accounting using trust funds for vario us projects or phases the separate reporting for finance and substantive issues as we ll as the lack of structured approach comparing planned and actual inputoutput should b reviewed to simplify the monitoring of efficiency recommendations head2right unctad should amend its project monitoring introdu cing comparative tables of planned and actual expenditur on specific project rec 13 62 unctad accepted the recommendation and indicated th at the implementation of the itc portal substantive and financial management system by the end of 2006 will address the issue oios will close this recommendation upon receipt f documentation on the implementation of the system c sustainability 63 oios noted that the sustainability of some of d ites project was weak many beneficiaries of iprs mentioned the difficulty to s ecure funds for the implementation of recommendations others still mentioned the need to develop an action plan parallel to the proposal of the german development institute to allocate 30 per cent of the iprs budget to implementing measures oios believes that countries would benefit from 13 formalized action plan drawing on iprs recommenda tions developed at the outset of the review unctad stated that there needs to be flexibility to respond to needs which often differ by country both from the ipr perspective an d in having some omnibus to respond to requests 64 oios also noted that activities were initiated for very limited period of time due to funding constraints with consideration for the sustainability of the results should further funding not materialize dite should review such projects to identify standalone activities which can be launched without running t he risk of longerterm objectives not being fully realized or to limit the scope of its projects until further funds allow expanding it again 65 last dite should consider an exit strategy t the design phase of the project time binding its commitment of resources and planning th necessary steps for the activities to deliver results and be selfsustaining and the pha sing out of unctads support recommendation head2right dite should strengthen its requirements to ensure sustainability of projects and activities before unching them rec 14 66 unctad accepted the recommendation which will be i mplemented progressively throughout the 20062007 biennium oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of documentation on measures to ensure sustainabili ty of its projects and activities f administration budget monitoring 67 limited financial authority has been delegated to dite certifying authority rests with the unctad administrative services and three budget lines are monitored in dite amounting to us 09 million of which onethird ar consultants fees 68 dite monitors its budget and expenditure with n excel spreadsheet based on data collected through its limited readonly access to t he information management integrated system imis and reports provided on regular bas is by the budget and project finance section of unctad oios noted that dite did not hav access to some of the standard financial reports on budget performance and believe s such information should be available in the substantive offices regardless of the deleg ation of authority recommendation head2right unctad should grant dite with access to standard financial reports on the divisions budget and expe nditure rec 15 69 unctad indicated that the recommendation would be i mplemented to the extent that it is within its power since imis access is contro lled by unog the itc portal would also address these requirements oios will close this recommendation upon receipt f confirmation that dite has been granted access to s tandard financial reports 14 b consultancy 70 for the biennium 20042005 consultants costs represented 41 per cent of dites nonposts regular budget expenditure for the sampl of the technical cooperation projects reviewed by oios the share of consultants costs r eached 70 per cent of total expenditure 71 in reviewing dites consultant files focusing on the steps under the responsibility of the division oios noted numerous shortfalls in the request for consultants the list of candida tes was left blank with few exceptions not allowing sufficient control over the selection process upon our request dite did provide background information for oios sample of consultants the background notes were prepared expost and on an ad hoc basis for most cases confirming that the process is not systematically documented oios coul d not ensure that the best candidate was selected through competitive recruitm ent consultant rosters provided were mere list of tacts only two sections did provide tables with indications of the education background and language skills the investment issues analysis branch on potential cand idates and the policy review section in all cases information on the performan ce of the consultant in previous contracts was not available in the rosters some requests were made late or even after work of the consultantcontractor had started the terms of references tors were often not detai led enough with indication of measurable output andor inaccurate oios noted two cases in which the selected candidate did not meet the criteria of the tors in view of the numerous requests to extend consultants without fee delivery dates were not always realistic there were instances when tors were amended to fit the candidates profile ra ther than the reverse in several cases the same was n oted for the selection of project staff the recruitment of interns to provide expertise s kills or knowledge as provided for under stai19997 was also questionable in view f their lack of professional experience the increase in consultant fees over short period of time appears to be quite high in certain cases yet higher than any salary increase for staff members the evaluations rarely included useful comments or details recommendation head2right dite should comply with stai19997 on consultants and individual contractors especially ensuring that the selection process is competitive and documented b requests and contracts are issued prior to commencement of w ork c terms of reference are detailed enough to provide c lear and detailed indications on the profile of the consulta nt and the outputs d consultants selected are the most comp etent for 15 the work and meet the criteria set in the initial tors increase in the fees is reasonable and f evaluati ons provide useful information for future reference rec 16 72 unctad accepted the recommendation and will impleme nt it by the end of 2006 oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of documentation that adequately addresses the issues on consultants and the individ ual contractor selection process tor and references c performance appraisal 73 for 20042005 24 per cent of the 100 series st aff was appraised the rate for professional staff was even lower with less than 20 per cent oios was told that the pas was only systematic for staff members having th eir contract renewed or applying for promotion with this practice parts of the epas bjectives as per stai20023 were defeated starting 2006 oios was told that unctad would implement other procedures to ensure compliance and consistency throughout unc tad recommendation head2right dite should comply with applicable instruction on s taff performance appraisal to provide systematic regula r guidance and direction to staff rec 17 74 unctad accepted the recommendation and would implem ent it by the end of 2006 oios will close this recommendation upon receipt of pas compliance statistics for the period april 2006 march 2007 g the world association of international promotion agencies 75 the world association of investment promotion gencies waipa established in 1996 was located in unctad and benefited from the support of unctad staff until the end of 2005 starting 2006 the ngo moved to its ow n premises and its staff after separating from unctad was rehired directly by wai pa 76 oios looked at the way the operations were run and the controls that were put in place as management responsibility background d ocuments on the decision that unctad support waipa or practical arrangements set up to run the ngo could not be provided 77 oios noted that proposals were made by some cou ntries members of waipa to host the ngo but was informed that members voted agains t moving the secretariat since everyone agreed that housing it on premises in g eneva was the most practical arrangement oios would stress that decision on the use of unctad premises should not rest outside the united nations 78 unctad extended its support to waipa based on t he understanding that the ngo was not selfsustaining in 1998 an amendment to t he waipa statute was adopted introducing membership fee of us 2000 per year in light of this in 1999 waipa was 16 in principle in position to cover rental costs fo r an office in geneva it is also not sure why advocating limited resources waipa opted for international project officer post with all entitlements swiss private tract would have been more economical upgraded from l2 to l3 in 2004 in v iew of the recruits curriculum vitae 79 unctad established trust fund to support waip funded exclusively with contributions from the ngo while staff costs for t he waipa secretariat represented 85 per cent of the trust funds expenditure from 2001 to 2005 official documents never clearly mentioned the daily secretariat duties egated to unctad 80 various shortfalls were observed in the managem ent of waipa as performed by the dite staff members involved which resulted in an bsence of internal controls although oios did not come across any clear indication of fr aud waipa was run with clear rules or regulations governing the budgetary and fi nancial decisions of its secretariat as well as accounting system other than additions f transactions on piece of paper at the end of the year financial statements were prepa red and disclosed before 2001 81 in the absence of proper accounting system w could not ensure that the revenue accounted for was complete also on the expenditure side certain expenditures were not sufficiently documented the use of the same ct to support two payments was noted and the accounting regarding the use of cash was in two cases incomplete amounting to us 17000 82 two staff members were at times paid by unctad or waipa and the 6month break in contract rule was once circumvented by re verting to contracts directly issued by waipa for the same services in the same location 83 last but not least oios noted instances where the line between waipa and unctad became blurred resulting in an unsound conte xt for operations in 2000 the waipa coordinator under an unctad consultancy cont ract authorized that unctad use interests earned on the trust fund 84 oios suggested and unctad agreed that lessons be drawn from the waipa incident and sufficient control is in place over op erations and transactions carried out by staff v further actions required on recommendations 85 oios monitors the
