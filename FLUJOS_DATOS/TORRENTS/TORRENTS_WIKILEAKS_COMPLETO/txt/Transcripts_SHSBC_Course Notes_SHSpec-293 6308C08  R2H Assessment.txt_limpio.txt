6308c08 shspec293 r2h assessment the original meaning of the symbol 8 has to do with money it represents two money bags one on top of the other how can you evolve list 1 for r2h this has really taken some doing r2h is process with new rationale it is the case level 2 process see p 414 above for description of level 2 it is not just headed at ot but it would give you free needles as clear waystop in many cases you would get keyout phenomena that would give you the straightenedout track that would look very like case level 2 it is really only keyout but it would have the attributes of clear if you combined it with r3n when necessary to get gpms out of the way it would take you to case level 1 recent policy letter 30jul63 current planning gave series of scientology levels see also p 479 re scn1 and scn 2 scn 1 pe level scientology scn 2 healing care of the body contains hpahca scn 3 advanced auditing and academy courses leading up to the phenomenon of clear scn 4 research towards ot this contains the present material r2h r3r r3n scn 5 social political and organizational scientology or what an ot does about it the various levels compare with the classifications of auditors which is convenient it puts more order into the subject and its materials class 1 he can listen class 2 he can do cchs run repetitive processes or cure something class 3 he can make better human being class 4 he can make an ot class 5 he can make sane universe r2h can be used at scientology levels 2 3 and 4 it is phenomenal to have process that can be used at so many levels it would be putting lot of stress on the theory of arc to ask of r2h that it reach into level 4 and some holes in what we knew of arc showed up r2h turns out to be inadequate for certain kinds of work the only frailty of r2h given an auditor who listens and meter that reacts is in the list used if one specific type of charge was missing from list and you used that list on all arc breaks that specific type of charge would tend to charge up on the case it would be restimulated and encysted eventually it would gum up the track and overwhelm the pc so the weak point of r2h is the embraciveness of the list used lrh cooked up all sorts of fancy systems and finally hit on the formula that would give an embracive list it is very simple like the itsa line see fig 17 the full derivation formula is as follows the cdei scale has an upper and lower band which were previously missing known and unknown go above cdei you never get curious about something you know about so knowingness must have disintegrated down to unknownesses therefore things must be unknown before you enter cdei at all in the logics we have had the datum an unknown can cause confusion so that is how it fits in actually this is not in the logics dianetic axioms 105 an unknown datum can produce data of plus or minus randomity and 107 data of plus or minus randomity depends for its confusion on former plus or minus randomity or absent data may be relevant here the know at the top of this expanded cdei scale is below notknow the first postulatesee p 14 above the know on this expanded cdei scale is evidently equivalent to know about the second postulate unknow on this scale then is evidently equivalent to forget the third postulate unknow is not the same as notknow you never get curious about something you know about so unknow would have to intervene between know and curious about on this scale below cdei there is lower band nothing an absence nothing to inhibit that is the black panther mechanism of ignore it man routinely does nothing about things figure 17 the expanded cdei assessment scale graphics inserted below that there is one more level falsify falsifying puts something else there so that now you can get the whole scale again on an inversion the false at the bottom of one scale becomes the known at the top of the lower inversion scale so there is known falseness then unknown falseness then curious about the falseness etc all the way down so you get perversions of perversions falsifications of falsifications as you descend into lower and lower inversions of the scale so in this universe one probably never sees know but always form of false finally you get modern science based on the false premise that man is mud the pure cdei scale wouldnt handle engrams because it was incomplete and didnt invert the way the full scale does the pure cdei scale still shows only one band say 2010 of the tone scale whereas every time you go through one cycle of this expanded cdei scale you drop 70 on the tone scale now you can look at arc for an incident and arc for an earlier incident to each level of the expanded cdei scale we also add missed withhold and all this dives you the list 1 see fig 17 p 463 above containing the totality of all possible combinations of charge on an arc break all possible levels that will have all possible reactions for everybody so combining them youve got attitude reality communication and missed withhold on each of the eight questions plus all these on earlier incidents giving you total list 1 with 64 questions that is how you would evolve list 1 if you were off in the boondocks you could use this schema by assessing the cdei scale on the incident first then assessing the level with r c and missed withhold the current list 1 is really the inhibit scale you wouldnt have to put in kucdeiof on missed withhold on lower level cases some on the levels of the expanded cdei scale are null anyway you can eliminate k u c d and 0 leaving you with i and f as the most potent sources of arc breaks because of the low case level with which you are dealing so for beginning cases this would leave 16 question list as you go upscale you find after awhile that your list falls short so that you have to add as too much someone at case level 2 see p 414 above would need still more expanded list dont have anything missing on list 1 the dale carnegie course is course in the creation of and maintenance of false realities psychiatry isnt even up to this lower case levels probably need emotion on the scale as well as attitude representing affinity in order for it to communicate to the pc after all the whole knowtomystery scale can go under affinity you might wonder why we dont expand this schema to include overt the answer is that ow mushes engrams and ruins pictures overts and prepcheck buttons ruin the energy structure of an engram because of gpms etc the buttons are too powerful and fundamental it takes certain amount of aberration to hold the picture together ao that you can run it but the buttons of arc and cdei only strip charge out of the engrams and make pictures better big midruds are ok for use on the physical universe as in ruds because the physical universe wont unmock easily at lower case levels however perhaps when the pc gets up the line into case level 1 using big midruds on the physical universe would be dangerous too we dont want the list to be too beefed up so that it mushes things up too much that would defeat the purposes of r2h the heaviest button on the list turns out to be falsity that is what the thetan objects to most and it is also what he feels guiltiest about falsity aberrates because it destroys trust it is part of every theta trap and it accounts for lots of arc breaks with mest the way to get the most ta out of list would be to go down the list preassessing it then take the biggest read and have the pc explain and itsa about it method 5 sometimes when you use this method some pcs will drag the bpc that got restimulated on an earlier part of the assessment on through the rest of the list with him such pcs would do better being cleaned up level by level as you go along method 3 but if you do it that way the major charge that would give you bd has been bled of charge to the point that this major charge wont read much on the list you should therefore take any change of characteristic as read you get that difficulty in exchange for dirty needle the best solution might be preassessment that narrows the search too abbreviated list leaves you with bpc and high ta charge moves the time wrong in an incident the incident is charged say because of something that happened in 1912 but the incident is in 1920 you could miss this leaving bpc and eventually getting stuck high ta from the wrong date process that would be ta pump would be recall worry what was it about from this you get ta pump consisting of an alternating whatsit and itsa this is not particularly therapeutic one other point what if you had pc who got ta but got better his failure to get better would be an apparency eventually he would go ot but it could take thousands of years however you also have to run the right significances you also have to complete cycles case change may result from shifting processes on the pc that you were getting ta on with this happening the case could still get better but uncomfortably also you can restimulate things on case that dont get handled for some time for instance you could early on get screenrestimulated engrams that could not be run out right away this would be an unnecessary restimulation of charge getting better is not how the pc feels but whether he is getting more knowingness and more ability also current state is not measure of getting better for instance person may have had good memory and awareness level and had it knocked out in the last betweenlives this then would be temporary condition you have to review case over at least thirty days to know what the true state of affairs is
