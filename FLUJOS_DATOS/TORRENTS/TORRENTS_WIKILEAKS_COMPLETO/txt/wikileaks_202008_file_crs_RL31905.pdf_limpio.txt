union registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals all by lindajo schierow overview the toxic substances control act 15 usc 2601 et seq authorizes the epa to screen existing and new chemicals used in manufacturing and commerce to identify potentially dangerous products or uses that should be subject to federal control epa may require manufacturers and processors of chemicals to conduct and report the results of tests to determine the effects of potentially dangerous chemicals on living things based on test results and other information epa must regulate the manufacture importati on processing distribution use andor disposal of any chemical that presents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment variety of regulatory t ools is available to epa under tsca ranging in severity from total ba n on production import and use to requirement that product bears warning label at the point of sale tsca directs epa to use the least burdensome option

proposed in 1971 by the presidents council on environmental quality its report toxic substances defined need for comprehensive legislati on to identify and control chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution use andor disposal was potentially dangerous and not adequately regulate d under other environmental statutes the house and senate each passed bills in both the 92nd and 93rd congresses in 1972 and 1973 respectively but controversies over the scope of chemical screening prior to commercial production and distri bution level of costs and the relationship to other regulatory laws stalled fi nal action episodes of envi ronmental contamination including contamination of the hudson ri ver and other waterways by pcbs the threat of stratospheric ozone depleti on from chlorofluorocarbon cfc emissions and contamination of agri cultural produce by polybrominated biphenyls pbbs in the state of michigan together with more exact estimates of the costs of imposing toxic substances controls opened the wa for final passage of the legislation president ford signed the tsca into law on october 11 1976 the original legislation included single title which has since been designated title i tsca title i directs epa to require manufacturers and processo rs to conduct tests for existing chemicals if 1 their manufacture distribution processing use or disposal may present an unreasonable ri sk of injury to health or the environment or they are to be produced in substantial quantities and the potential for environmental release or human exposure is substantial or significant 2 existing data are insufficient to predict the effects of human exposure and environmental releases and 3 testing is necessary to deve lop such data section 4 prevent future risks through premanufacture screening and regulatory tracking of new ch emical products section 5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31905crs3 control unreasonable risks alr eady known including risks from polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs as well as risks for existing chemicals that may be discovered in the future section 6 and gather and disseminate informati on about chemical production use and possible adverse effects to hum an health and the environment section 8 authorization for appropriations for these activities and state grant program for control of toxic substances in the environment expired on september 30 1983 although appropriations for thes programs have continued in october 2008 congress amended tsca title i when it enacted the mercury export ban act of 2008 pl 110414 it prohibits certain activities with respect to elemental mercury subsequently four titles have been added to tsca to address specific concerns asbestos in 1986 title ii pl 99519 radon in 1988 title iii pl 100551 lead in 1992 title iv pl 102550 nd schools in 2007 title v pl 110140 title ii directs epa to set standards for asbestos mitigation in schools and requires asbestos contractors to be trained and certified title iii directs epa to provide technical assistance to states that choos to support ra don monito ring and control title iv provides similar assistance with respect to abatement of leadbased paint hazards finally title v ddresses environmental issues at schools including energy efficiency title i testing of chemicals many chemicals even some in widespread use are not well characterized in terms of their potential health and environmental effects one of the major goals of tsca was to induce the development of test data by producers ie manufacturers importers and processors of chemicals in commerce section 4 of tsca directs ep to require the developmen t of test data on existing chemicals when certain conditions prevail 1 the manufacture processing distri bution use or disposal of the chemical may present an unreasonable risk or 2 the chemical is produced in very large volume and there is potential for substantial quantity to be released into the environment or for substantial or significant human exposure under either condition epa must issue rule requiring tests if existing data are insufficient to resolve the question of safety and b testing is necessary to develop the data because there were more than 55000 ch emicals in us commerce at the time epa was to begin developing test rules congress established special interagency committee to help epa determine which che micals should be considered first and to coordinate testing needs and efforts among government agencies at least every six months the interagency testing committee itc must consider candidate chemicals for inclusion on list of substances that the itc recommends to epa for development and promulgation of test rules tsca directs the itc to designate subset of chemicals on the list for epa action within 12 months the list can contain more than 50 designated chemicals at any time when chemical ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31905crs4 designated epa has one year to respond by issuing proposed test rule or notice explaining why testing is needed tsca requires the itc to consider the following factors when it makes listing decisions 1 quantity of the substance to be manufactured 2 quantity of the chemical in environmental releases 3 number of people who will be exposed occupationally and the dura tion of exposure 4 extent of nonoccupational human exposure 5 similarity of the chemical to any other chemical known to present an unreasonable risk 6 existence of data cerning environmental or health effects of the chemical 7 the quantity of information to be gained by testing and 8 the availability of fac ilities and personnel for performing testing chemicals known or suspected to cause or contribute to cancer gene mutations or birth defects are to be assigned higher priority in response to information that i ndicates there may be reasonable basis to conclude that chemi cal presents or will present significant risk of serious or widespread harm to human beings from cancer gene mutations or birth defects tsca requires epa acti on to prevent or reduce that risk or publication of finding that th risk is not unreasonable premanufacture notification for new chemicals or uses tsca section 5 requires manufactur ers importers and processo rs to notify epa at least 90 days prior to producing or otherwise in troducing new chemical product into the united states any information or test data that is known to reasonably ascertainable by or in possession of the notifier and that might be useful to epa in evaluating the chemicals potential adverse effects on human health or the environment must be submitted to epa at the same time tsca also requires epa to be notified when there are plans to produce process or use an existing chemical in way that differs from previously permitted uses if the adminis trator has determined by rule that new uses of the chemical may produce significant changes in human and environmental exposures and therefore require notifica tion the 90day notice provides epa with the opportunity to evaluate the chemical use and if necessary to prohibit or limit such activity before it occurs to prevent unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment epa has 45 days after notification or up to 90 days if it extends the period for good cause to evaluate the potential risk pos ed by the chemical if epa determines that there is reasonable basis to conclude that the substance presents or will present an unreasonable risk the administrator mu st promulgate requirements to protect adequately against such risk alterna tively epa may determine that the proposed activity related to chemical does not present an unreasonable risk this decision may be based on the available da ta or when data exist to document the effects of exposure on what is known about the effect s of chemicals in commerce with similar chemical structures and used in similar ways the purpose of epas screening procedure is to identify potential hazards and control them before use of chemical b ecomes widespread if data are inadequate to make an informed judgment and 1 manufacture processing distribution in commerce use or disposal may present an unreasonable risk or 2 chemical is to be produced in substantial quantities and the potential for environmental release or human exposure is substantial or signif icant epa may issue proposed order to prohibit or limit such activities until sufficient data are submittedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31905crs5 although the legislative history of tsca includes presumption that testing of new products would take place before they we re widely used either as the chemical was developed or as its ma rkets grew tsca also forbids promulgation of blanket testing requirements for all new chemicals this reflects concern that uniform testing requirements might stifle innovation in the chemical industry thus epa must decide which chemicals or which categories of chemicals warrant the costs of pre market testing epa reviews more th an 1000 new chemical manufacturing notices annually regulatory controls fo r hazardous chemicals tsca requires epa to regulate manufacturing pr ocessing distribution in comme rce use or disposal of chemical if it will present an unreasonabl risk of injury to health or the environment and the risk cannot be re duced to sufficien t degree unde r another federal law administered by epa the alternative means available to epa for controlling chemical hazards that present unreasonable risks are specified in section 6 of tsca epa has the authority to prohibit or limit the am ount of pr oduction or distribution of substance in commerce prohibit or limit the production or distribution of substance for aparticular use limit the volume or concentration of the chemical produced prohibit or regulate the manne r or method of commercial use require warning labels andor instructions on containers or products require notification of the risk of injury to distributors and to the extent possible consumers require recordkeeping by producers specify disposal methods and require replacement or repurchase of products already distributed epa also may impose any of these requirements in combination or for specific geographical region however epa is requi red by tsca to regulate only to the extent necessary to protect adequately against risk and to use the least burdensome regulatory approach even in controlling unreasonable risks two chemical substances are directly addressed in title i pcbs and elemental mercury tsca directs epa to regulate pcbs and to ban most uses in addition tsca prohibits the sale distribution or tr ansfer of elemental mercury by federal agencies information gathering section 8 of tsca requires epa to develop and maintain an inventory of all chemicals or categories of chemicals manufactured or processed in the united states the first version of this inventory identified approximately 55000 chemical s in commerce in 1979 all chemicals not on the inventory are by definition new and subject to the notification provisions of section 5 these chemicals must be adde d to the inventory if they enter us commerce chemicals need not be listed if they are only produced in very small quantities for purposes of experimentation or research httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31905crs6 to aid epa in its duties under tsca the agency was granted considerable authority to collect information from indus tries epa may re quire maintenance of records and reporting of chemical identities names and molecular structures categories of use amounts manufactured and processed for each category of use descriptions of byproducts resu lting from manufacture processing use and disposal environmental and health effects num ber of individuals exposed number of employees exposed and the duration of ex posure and manner or method of chemical disposal manufacturers processors and distri butors of chemicals are required to maintain records of significant adverse reac tions to health or the environment alleged to have been caused by substance or mix ture records of adverse effects on the health of employees must be retained for 30 years from the date of reporting industry also must submit lists and copies of health and safety studies studies showing adverse effects previously unknow n must be submitted to epa as soon as they are completed or discovered imminent hazards section 7 provides epa aut hority to take emergency action through the district courts to cont rol chemical substance or mixture which presents an imminent and unreasonable risk of serious widespread injury to health or the environment relation to other laws section 9 allows epa to refer cases of chemical risk to other federal agencies with the au thority to prevent or reduce the risk for statutes under epas jurisdiction tsca give s the administrator discretion to decide if risk can best be handled under the authority of tsca enforcement and judicial review section 11 authorizes epa to inspect any facilities subject to tsca require ments and to issue subpoenas requiring attendance and testimony of witnesses production of reports and documents answers to questions and other necessary information section 13 mandates tsca enforcement at the national borde rs by the treasury department section 15 identifies acts prohibited unde r tsca while section 16 describes penalties for acts violating these prohibitions as well as recourse available to anyone accused of such violations section 16 authorizes civil penalties not to exceed 25000 per violation per day and affords th defendant an opportunity to request hearing before an order is issued and to petition for judicial review of an order after it is issued criminal penalties also are authorized for willful violations section 17 provides jurisdiction to us district courts in civil actions to enforce tsca section 15 by restraining or compelling actions that violate or comply with it respectively chemicals may be seized and condemned if their ma nufacture processing or distribution violated the act section 19 authorizes any person to f ile petition for judicial review of specified rules within 60 days of issuance under tsca the court is directed to set aside specified rules if they are not supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record taken as wholehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31905crs7 section 20 authorizes civil suits by an person against any person in violation of the act it also authorizes suits against epa to compel performance of nondiscretionary actions under tsca section 21 provides the public with the right to petition for the issuance amendment or repeal of rule requiring toxicity testing of chemical regulation of the chemical or reporting confidential business information section 14 provide s broad protection of proprietary confid ential information about chemical s in commerce disclosure by epa employees of such information generally is not permitted except to other federal employees or when necessary to pr otect health or the environment data from health and safety studies of chemi cals is not protected unless its disclosure would reveal chemical process or ch emical proportion in mixture wrongful disclosure of confidential da ta by federal employees is prohibited and may result in criminal penalties chemical categories section 26 allows epa to impose regulatory controls on categories of chemicals rather than on casebycase basis however epa cannot regulate group merely because it is composed of new chemical substances state preemption tsca section 18 preempts st ate actions that establish or continue in effect requirements applicable to chemical substance or mixture that is regulated under tsca section 5 or 6 unless the state require ment is identical to the federal requirement impleme nts another federal law or prohibits use of the substance or mixture within the state however state may ask epa to allow state requirement that provides significantly higher degree of protection from risk than does the federa l requirement other provisions tsca section 10 directs epa to conduct and coordinate among federal agencies research developmen t and monitoring that is necessary to the purposes of the act section 12 excludes chemical products manufactured for export from tsca requirements except for reporting and record keeping requirements in section 8 in 2008 congress excluded elemental mercury fro m this exemption banning its export beginning in 2013 with the exception of mercury contained in coal other exemptions for essential uses may be granted by rule section 22 waives compliance when in the interest of na tional defense section 23 provides protection of employ ees who assist in carrying out the provisions of the act ie whistleblowers the potential effects of tsca rules on em ployment must be monitored by epa according to section 24 section 25 mandates study of the need for indemnification of people affected by federal laws administered by epa and of the feasibility of establishing standard classification system for chemical subs tances and of stor ing and retrieving information about them httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31905crs8 section 26 authorizes data sharing nd cooperative action to facilitate tsca implementation between epa and other fe deral agencies it also authorizes collection of fees for epa processing of data submitted in res ponse to an order under section 4 or 5 epa is directed to establish an office to assist the regulated community the agency also must establish procedure to ensure disclosure of financial interests in the regulated community by epa employees final orders issued under tsca must cont ain statement of basis and purpose finally section 26 established within epa new assistant administrator for toxic substances tsca section 27 authorizes research and development of test methods for chemicals by the public health rvice in cooperation with epa grants to states are authorized by s ection 28 to establish and operate programs to prevent or eliminate unreasonable risks to health or the environment section 29 authorized ppropriations through 1983 an annual report is ma ndated by section 30 title ii asbestos in buildings growing public concern about the pres ence of potentially hazardous asbestos in buildings especially in schools led to congressional effo rts to address this problem title ii of tsca the asbest hazard emergency response act ahera was enacted in 1986 pl 99 519 and amended in july 1988 pl 100368 it required epa to set standards by octobe r 1987 for responding to the presence of asbestos in schools the sta ndards set at levels adequate to protect public health and the environment identif appropriate response actions that depend on the physical condition of asbestos schools in turn were required to inspect for asbestoscontaining material and to develop and implement plan for managing any such material plans for managing asbest were to be sub mitted by schools before may 1989 and implementation was to begin by july 1989 the law contains deadlines for schools to complete implementation title ii requires asbestos contractors and analytical laboratories to be certified and schools to use certified persons for ab atement work training and accreditation requirements also apply to inspectors c ontractors and workers performing asbestos abatement work in all public and commercial buildings epa may award training grants to nonprofit organizations for asbestos health and safety programs however authorization of appropria tions for this grant program expired september 30 1995 other title ii requirements such as mandates that buildings be inspected for asbestos have not been ex tended to nonschool buildings to enforce requirements tsca authorizes epa to take emergency action with respect to schools if school officials do not act to protect children the act also authorizes citizen action with respect to asbestoscontaini ng material in school and to compel action by epa either through administrative petition or judicial action civil penalties not to exceed 5000 are author ized for violations such as failing to conduct an inspection or to deve lop school management planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31905crs9 concern about how schools would pay fo r required actions was addressed in separate legislation the asbestos school hazard abatement act of 1984 or ashaa pl 98377 it established pr ogram offering grants and interestfree loans to schools with serious asbestos pr oblems and demonstrated financial need although epa for several years did not reque st funding for this program congress appropriated funds author ization of appropriations for this program expired september 30 1995 and congress has not ppropriated funds since fy1993 total of 382 million in grant and loan funds were appropriated from fy1984 through fy1993 repaid ashaa loans are returned to an asbestos trust fund established in tsca title ii to become dedicated source of revenues for future asbestos control projects title iii radon programs in october 1988 congress amende d tsca by adding title iii i ndoor radon abatement 15 usc 2661 et seq pl 100551 the basic purpose of title iii is to provide financial and tec hnical assistance to the states that choose to support radon monitoring and control neither monitoring nor abatement of radon is required by the act title iii required epa to update its pamphlet citiz ens guide to radon to develop model constr uction standards and technique s for controlling radon levels within new buildings and to provide technical assistance to states epa is to provide technical assistance by establishing an information clearinghouse publishing public information materials establishing na tional database of ra don levels detected organized by state providing informati on to professional orga nizations representing private firms involved in building design and construction submitting to congress plan for providing financia l and technical assistance to states operating cooperative projects with states conducting research to develop test and evaluate radon measurement methods and protocols veloping and demons trating ne w methods of radon measurement and mitigation including methods that are suitable for use in nonresidentia l child care facilities operating voluntary program to rate radon measurement and mitigation vices and methods and the effectiveness of private firms and individuals offering radon related services and designing and implementing training seminars the proficiency rating program and certification for training programs collect fees for service and therefore are meant to be self supporting but congress authorized 1500000 to be appropriated to establish these programs congress authorized 3000000 to be appropriated for each of three years beginning in 1989 for the other provi sions of sections 303 304 and 305 matching grant program was establishe d for the purpose of assisting states in developing and implementing pr ograms for radon assessment and mitigati on for this program 30 million was authorized to be appropriated ove r three years with funds targeted to states or projects that made efforts to ensure adoption of epas model construction standard s and techniques for new bu ildings gave preference to lowincome persons or ddressed serious and exte nsive radon contamination problems or had the potential to reduce ri sk or to develop innovative assessment techniques mitigation measures or management approaches httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31905crs10 other sections of title iii require epa to c onduct study to determine the extent of radon contamination in schools identify and list areas of the us with high probability of having high levels of indoor radon make gr ants or cooperative agreements to establish and operate at l east three regional radon training centers and provide guidance to federal agencies on radon measurement risk assessment and remedial measures all authorizations for appropriations specific to this title expired september 30 1991 although appropriati ons have continued title iv lead exposure reduction the 102nd congress added title iv to tsca when it enacted the residential leadbased paint hazard reduction act of 1992 as title x in the housing and community development act of 1992 pl 102550 tsca title iv aims to accelerate federal efforts to reduce risks to young children who daily are exposed to leadbased paint in their homes in additi on it was intended to stimulate development of lead inspection and hazard abatement serv ices in the private sector while ensuring that the services provided and any products employed are reliable and effective in reducing risk to these ends title iv directs epa to promulgate definitions of leadcontaminated dust lead contaminated soil and leadbased paint hazards to ensure that people engaged in detection and control of lead hazards are properly trained and that contractors are certified to publish requirements for the accreditation of training programs for workers to develop criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of commercial products used to detect or reduce risks associated with leadbased paint to establish protocols criteria and minimum performance standards for laboratory analysis of lead in paint films soil and dust to establish program to certify laboratories as qualified to test substances for lead content and to publish and distribute to the public list of certified or accredited environmental sampling laboratories title iv explicitly applies these requirements to federal facilities and activities that may create lead hazard in addition congress directed epa to conduct study of lead hazards due to renovation and remodelin g activities that may incidenta lly disturb leadbased paint epa is required to promulgate guide lines for the renovation and remodeling of buildings or other structures when these activities might create hazard httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31905crs11 title iv directs epa to establish clearinghouse and hotline to distribute information about the hazards of leadbased paint how to avoid exposure and reduce risk and new technologies for removing or immobilizing leadbased paint in addition congress manda ted development of lead hazard information pamphlet public education and outreach activities for health profe ssionals the general public homeowners landlords tenants consum ers of home improvement products the residential real estate i ndustry and the home renovation industry and information to be distributed by retailers of home improvement products to provide consumers with practical information related to the hazards of renovation where leadbased paint may be present title iv authorizes states to propose pr ograms to train and certify inspectors and contractors engaged in the detection or cont rol of leadbased paint hazards states also may develop the required informati onal pamphlets tsca requires epa to promulgate model state program that may be adopted by any state congress gave epa the authority to approve or disapprove authorization for state proposals and to provide grants for states to develop and implement authorized programs federal program must be established administered and enforced by epa in each state without an authorized program the department of health and human services so has responsibilities under title iv of tsca it mandates study by the centers for disease prevention and control cdc and the national institute for environmental health sciences to determine the sources of lead exposure to children who have elevated lead levels in their bodies the national institute for ccupational safety and health is directed to study ways of reducing occupational exposure to lead during abatement activities the act established rulemaking docket to ensure the availability to the general public of all documents submitted to agencies that are relevant to regulatory decisions pursuant to this legislation the docket is required to include the drafts of all proposed rules submitted by epa to th presidents office of management and budget omb written comments on the dr afts and written responses to comments in addition the agency must provide an explanation for any major change to proposed rule that appears in the final rule and such changes ma not be made based on information not filed in the docket dockets are required to be established in each epa regional office congress authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for tsca title iv in addition to amending tsca title x of the housing and community development act of 1992 authorized grants to states for risk assessments and lead based paint removal and immobilization in private housing for lowincome residents establishing state training certification or accreditation programs for inspectors and abatement contractors and research at the department of housing and urban development hud authorization for ppropriations for these grants expired september 30 1994 but appropria tions have continued t itle x directed hud to establish guidelines for federally suppor ted work involving risk assessments inspections interim controls and abatement of leadbased paint hazards in additionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31905crs12 the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh was provided 10 million for training people who remove or immobilize paint title v reducing risks in schools at the end of 2007 the 110th congress added fifth title to tsca subtitled healthy highperformance sc hools enacted as subtitle section 461 of public law 110140 the energy independence and security act of 2007 tsca t itle v authorizes epa to establish state grant program to provide technical assistance for epa programs to schools nd develop and implement st ate school environmental health programs state programs must in clude standards for school building design construction and renovation and identify ongoing school building environmental problems and recommended solutions environmental problems specifically mentioned in the law include contaminan ts hazardous substances and pollutant emissions epas authority to provide gran ts expires five years after the date of enactment title v requires the epa administrator in consultation with the secretary of education and the secretary of health and human services to issue voluntary guidelines within 18 months of title v enactment for selecting sites for schools presumably new schools the guidelin are to account for the special vulnerability of children to hazardous substances or pollution exposures in any case in which the potential for contamination at potential school site exists modes of transportation available to st udents and staff efficient use of energy and potential use of school at the site as an emergency shelter title v also requires the epa administrator in consultation with the secretary of education and the secretary of health and human services to issue voluntary guidelines within two years of enactment for developing and implementing state environmental health programs for schools these guidelines must take into account the findings of federal initia tives established under relev ant federal law with respect to school fac ilities including initiatives related to water and energy conservation authorized by sections 431 through 441 nd work related to highperformance green buildings authorized by section 492 of p l 110140 in particular the guidelines must take into account environmenta l problems contaminants hazardous substances and pollutant emissions natural day lighting ventilation heating and cooling moisture control and mold maintenance cleaning and pest control acoustics and other issues relating to the health comfort productivity and performance of occupants of the school f acilities in addition title v requires that the guidelines provide technical assistance on siting design management and operation of school f acilities collaborate with child rens environmental health centers in school environmenta l investigations assist st ates and the public to better understand and improve the envi ronmental health of child ren and take into account the special vulnerability of children in lowincome and minority communities to exposures from contaminants hazardous substances and pollutant
