d to operate marine terminals at some us ports raises the issue of whether foreign marine terminal operators pose threat to us homeland security notwithstanding the sale of us terminal operations by dp world to us entity the underlying issue remains because many us marine terminals are operated by foreignbased companies and similar transaction could occur in the future given the global nature of the shipping industry evaluating the potential security ramifications of foreignbased terminal operators requires first understanding how ports work and who is in charge of their security most major us ports are publicly owned by port authority which is public organization associated with city county regional or state government port typically contains many terminals that are each designed to handle different types of cargo some port authorities operate all or some of their marine terminals but most ports lease their facilities to several different terminal operating companies all of the cargo handling that takes place on marine terminal is performed by members of longshoremens union the coast guard is in charge of the security of port facilities and vessels and customs and border protection cbp is in charge of the security of cargo coast guard regulations and cbp security guidelines require terminal operators to provide basic security infrastructure such as fences gates and surveillance cameras and follow certain security practices when handling cargo the transportation security administration tsa is developing credentialing process for screening port workers however port security involves much more than the measures put in place within the immediate vicinity of us port complex not finding terroristplaced weapon until after it reaches us port could be too late to prevent potentially catastrophic event thus securing the cargo and ships in transit to us ports is critical and consequently the bulk of federal security activity takes place before cargo is unloaded at us ports key layers of security are cbps scrutiny of usbound cargo at the overseas port of loading and the coast guards scrutiny of ships before they enter us harbors the necessity of pushing the border out to counter the terrorist threat requires the cooperation of shippers carriers ports and border agencies in th country of origin to take security precautions with usbound cargo global terminal operators like dp world may handle us cargo at the overseas loading port even if they do not handle it at us port thus key issue for policymakers is deciding under what conditions the united states should trust foreign cargo handling entities and whether they should be treated as partners in securing us supply lines the dp world controversy refueled debate about whether the nation is doing enough with sufficient urgency to secure us ports in its oversight role congress is assessing the effectiveness of coast guard and cbp maritime security initiatives and faces pressing questions about the overall security of ports and maritime commerce

terminals at some us ports raises the issue of whether foreign marine terminal operators pose threat to us homeland security dp world is terminal operating company that operates as commercial entity but is owned by the govern ment of dubai in the united arab emirates1 in march 2006 dp world purchased competitor the britishowned peninsular oriental steam navigation company po po leased marine terminals around the world including at five us ports new york and new jersey philadel phia baltimore miami and new orleans and was involved in other cargo handling operations at other east and gulf coast ports as well as cruise terminal in new york city as part of dp worlds purchase of po dp world acquired pos terminal leases or concessions at these us ports2 however as result of congressional opposition dp world announced on march 9 2006 that it would sell its stake in the us portion of pos operations to us entity and on march 16 2007 dp world sold its stake to aig global investment group 3 notwithstanding the sale of us terminal operations by dp world to us entity the underlying issues remain is the ownership of terminal operating company relevant to the security of us port does foreign takeover of terminal operating leases potentially pose threat to us security should companies owned by foreign governments be precluded from operating us port terminals these policy questions remain an issue because 1 many us marine terminals are operated by foreignbased companies and 2 given the global nature of the shipping business similar transactions may occur in the future the purpose of this report is to provide information relevant in answering these questions it begins by explaining how ports work and what marine terminal operators do it then reviews the extent of foreign involvement that already exists in us ports the next section describes the responsibility of terminal operators in providing security at us ports and how their role fits in with the larger task of securing the entire maritime supply chain the report concludes by examining port security issues for congress

port port authority and terminal most major us ports are publicly owned by port authority which is public or quasipublic organization associated with city county regional or state government port authority is responsible for the overall administration of the property terminals and other facilities on the port complex marine terminal is an assigned area with equipment for loading and unloading ships and space for staging cargo until it is loaded on the ship or transferred to overland modes of transport some port authorities operate all or some of their marine terminals themselves but most ports are landlord ports because they lease their facilities to terminal operating companies the tenants these leases are typically longterm in the range of 10 to 30 years either the port authority or the terminal operator will supply the cranes and other cargo 1 for further information on the united arab emirates see crs report rs21852 the united arab emirates uae issues for us policy by kenneth

authority and each terminal operator as one port authority suggests one can think of public port like shopping mall4 the port authority owns the entire mall property while the stores are leased to individual retail companies large port could contain 15 to 20 marine terminals of various types some of the terminals could handle containers which are trucktrailers without the wheels others may handle dry bulk cargo such as coal grain or sugar liquid bulk cargo such as petroleum or chemicals breakbulk cargo such as steel coils pipes or large machinery or automobiles and trucks typical container terminal may be 100 to 300 acres in size while the entire port complex of major port may be 2000 to over 3000 acres in size while the above model applies to the marine term inals involved in the dp world transaction it does not apply to all marine terminals public port authorities only own approximately onethird of the deepdraft marine terminal facilities in the united states 5 many of the privately owned marine terminals are associated with the oil gas and chemical industries in these cases the waterside terminal may be component of larger industrial complex on land for instance at the port of houston the port of houston author ity only owns or leases 12 marine terminals while there are 138 private terminals that are owned by either usbased foreignbased or multi national corporations that handle approximately 85 of the cargo that moves through the port of houston 6 terminal operators aka stevedores contract with longshoremen unions to provide cargo handling services on the docks7 longshoremen are hired by and report directly to union hiring hall terminal operators also employ management team who are hired by and report directly to the terminal operating company longshoremen called dockworkers operate cranes that physically move the cargo from ship to dock and vice versa longshoremen called checkers perform clerk functions in an office in or near the port at container terminal the checkers are responsible for directing the container traffic within the terminal area they tell the dockworkers where containers need to be moved the ocean carrier provides stowage plan which tells the terminal operator where the containers need to be loaded on the ship in the case of inbound shipments the terminal operator separates those containers to be picked up by truck from those that will move by rail if there is an ondock railroad at the terminal longshoremen also staff the gates where trucks enter to pickup and dropoff containers longshoremen do not know the contents of contai ners except for containers carrying hazardous material which require special handling and storage requirements the terminal operator is not concerned with the origin and final destination of the shipment 8 the only cargo information relevant to the terminal operator in performing its function is the weight of the container for ship 4 an analogy used by the port of tacoma

company to operate container terminals in us ports most container terminals are operated by other foreignbased companies survey by the us maritime administration found that at the seventeen largest us container ports 45 terminals 66 were operated by foreign based company 5 terminals 7 were operated by joint venture between domestic and foreign based company and 18 terminals 26 were operated by purely domestic terminal operating company the survey found that several of the ports have usbased container terminal operators baltimore jacksonville new orleans houston angeles and tacoma at the combined ports of angeles and long beach the largest container port complex in the united states only three of the fifteen container terminals are operated by usbased companies at the port of new york and new jersey the second largest container port only two of the six container terminals are operated by usbased companies at the port of norfol k and the port of savannah the port authority operates the terminals rather than leasing them to private terminal operators9 the port of portland oregon leases its container terminal to us based operator most of the foreign terminal operators are based in hong kong japan south korea taiwan singapore china the united kingdom and denmark handful of terminal operators are partially owned by the governments of singapore taiwan and china most us container terminals are managed by foreign companies because almost all of the container shipping lines are owned by foreign companies typically foreign container shipping line creates us subsidiary or us affiliate to operate the terminals at its busiest us ports to better ensure service quality and control costs two large usbased container lines and their terminal operations were sold to foreign interests in the late 1990s in 1997 american president lines was sold to neptune orient lines which is partially owned by the government of singapore in 1999 sealand service the us company that pioneered container shipping in the late 1950s was sold to maersk lines danish carrier the president of the world shipping council wsc who is also former executive of sealand believes that us investors have avoided the container shipping industry because of its high capital investment requirements boom and bust cycles intense competition and because foreign tax laws are more favorable to shipping 10 while many terminal operators are affiliated with steamship line independent terminal operating companies also exist dp world and po are two of several global terminal operating companies other global stevedores are hutchison port holdings based in hong kong psa based in singapore and ssa marine based in seattle one estimate is that the four largest global terminal operators handle about 80 of the containers being shipped worldwide11 some us 9 except that foreign company has 50 stake in the operations of one of the terminals at the port of norfolk 10 testimony of christopher

as maher terminals and american stevedores in new york and transbay and marine terminals corporation in oakland foreign involvement in us port terminal operations is an extension of an industry driven by globalization the largest container shipping lines have extended their services around the globe because their biggest customers such as big box retailers and auto electronics and clothing manufactures have extended their supply lines and distribution networks around the globe in turn global independent terminal operators such as dp world or po seek to follow their customers the shipping lines the shipping business is capable of scanning the globe for lowcost inputs for instance it is not improbable that ship calling at us port could have been built in south korea registered in panama owned by greek company operated by japanese ocean carrier captained by german and crewed by filipinos

write security plan and submit it to the coast guard for review and approval14 the coast guard does not mandate specific security equipment or procedures that the terminal operators must adopt but rather calls for performancebased criteria to be used to ensure the security of the facility the security plan provides some leeway for the terminal operators to tailor their security measures to their particular type of cargo terminal in the facility security plan the terminal owne r or operator must specify how it will address the security vulnerabilities identified in its security assessment for instance it must restrict access to its facility with fences and system to identify unauthorized personnel the operator must specify how it will monitor activity at the facility through the use of some combination of security guards waterborne patrols alarm systems surveillance equipment and lighting in the case of 12 mtsa regulations are codified at 33 cfr 101 et seq 13 the coast

fso is also required to keep records for two years and make them available to the coast guard regarding security training sessions drills and exercises security incidents and breaches changes in security threat levels maintenance of security equipment and other records regarding security procedures at the terminal the coast guard inspects terminals for compliance with security requirements july 1 2004 was the deadline for port facilities to begin operating under their security plans between then and january 1 2005 the coast guard conducted initial onsite inspections at approximately 3150 port facilities in more than 300 us ports to check on compliance with the security plans the coast guard plans to conduct annual compliance inspections at port facilities but the coast guard captain of the port which is the lead federal official in charge of port area can also verify continued compliance at the facilities in his or her area at any time to ensure that inspections reflect the normal course of business at terminal the coast guard has indicated that it is using unscheduled or unannounced spot checks to check on compliance 15 the coast guard reports that since july 2004 it has required corrective action on more than 700 violations of the mtsa security regulations and that of those 700 plus violations 44 resulted in major control actions such as closure of the terminal until corrective action was taken16 similar to terminal operators vessel owners must also submit for coast guard approval security assessment and security plan for their ships because of the close interface between vessels and facilities when the vessel is in port vessel and facility owners are required to coordinate their security measures and procedures and submit evidence of this coordination in document called declaration of security facility and vessel ow ners are required to update and resubmit their security plans to the coast guard every five years or whenever substantial change is made to their facility or vessel g5g4g18g514g156g561g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g156g561 cbp is in charge of cargo security when cbp inspects cargo shipments arriving from

against terrorism ctpa t was initiated in april 2002 as voluntary program offering importers expedited pr ocessing of cargo and other benefits if they comply with cbp requirements for securing their entire supply chain currently ctpat is open to importers carriers freight forwarders customs brokers us port authorities terminal operators and mexican and other cbpinvited foreign manufacturers in order to participate in the ctpa t applicants must sign an agreement that commits them to assessing the security of their supply chains submit security questionnaire to cbp implement security program in accordance with ctpat guidelines and extend their security program to other companies involved in their supply chain once the applicant company has conducted the security selfassessment and submitted the security profile cbp reviews the security profile to develop an understanding of the companys security practices cbp also reviews information regarding the companys trade compliance history and any past criminal investigations based upon the results of these reviews cbp will work with the applicant to address any security concerns discovered during the review or will certify the applicant as ctpa t certified member cbp also conducts what is called validation of ctpa t certified members security arrangements the validation process is an onsite review of the supply chain security measures outlined by the ctpat participant in the security profile it submitted to cbp cbp has created supply chain security specialists scss who conduct the validation during the validation process the scss will meet with company representatives and potentially visit selected domestic and foreign sites in the ctpat participants supply chain 18 ctpat security guidelines differ depending on the type of business the applicant is engaged in for instance importers have different set of security guidelines than carriers or port or terminal operators and ctpa t guidelines recognize that terminals for example vary according to the type of cargo they handle as with other ctpat participants us marine or port terminal operators mpto must conduct comprehensive assessment of their international supply chain conveyances foreign facilities domestic warehouses etc and work with their business partners to ensure that the appropriate security measures are adhered to throughout their supply chain the security guidelines that mpto must commit to implementing and maintaining throughout their supply chains in order to become member of ctpat include the following categories conveyance security to prevent unauthorized access or tampering business partner requirements and security procedures to ensure that partners commit to ctpat guidelines container security procedures for ensuring proper sealing and container integrity along with procedures to report any problems to cbp physical access controls identification badges visitor and vendor controls mail screening etc procedural

infrastructure such as perimeter fencing security gates lighting monitoring equipment or alarm systems is likely to be addressed in the terms and conditions of the lease agreement between the port authority and the terminal operator the geography of port complex is one factor that could determine infrastructure security arrangements fo r instance if there are group of terminals that abut one another then the port authority may be the party that provides perimeter fencing and perimeter security gate for access to all the grouped terminals on the other hand if particular terminal is isolated from other terminals in port complex then the terminal operator may be responsible for providing security infrastructure the federal government has provided funding directly to ports for security infrastructure since september 11 2001 the federal government has provided about 876 million in six rounds of grants to port authorities and individual terminal operators for security infrastructure 20 g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g18g142g155g156g152g151g151g142g149g561 either the port authority or the terminal operato r hires security guards within the grounds of terminal there may be security guard and port watchmen positions defined in the contract between the longshoremens union and the terminal operator few of the largest port authorities have their own police force the port authority police force could include both waterside and landside patrols and police assigned to port gates other port authorities rely on the police force of the government with which they are associated such as city county or state police g21g140g155g142g142g151g146g151g144g561g18g152g155g157g561g25g152g155g148g142g155g156g561 key issue in port security is the trustworthiness of

security administration tsa in developing worker identification card transportation worker identification credential twic that will be used to limit access to secure areas of port or vessel mtsa requires that the card use biometric technology and that the card be issued to only those port workers who are not deemed terrorism security risk as determined by the secretary of dhs 21 tsas initial deadline for issuing twic cards was august 2004 the gao investigated why tsa missed its initial deadline and found that delays were due to difficulty in obtaining dhs approval to proceed with the

tested prototype worker card at various ports in 2005 and implementation of the card is to begin in 2007 contentious issue among several is deciding what criminal offenses might disqualify worker from obtaining card most port authorities are awaiting the deployment of the twic card to provide an id system for port workers however couple of port authoritie s have an id card system already in place the port authority of new york and new jersey s had an id system for dockworkers since 1953 the waterfront commission of new york harbor performs background checks on all longshoremen at the port who must be registered and licensed the commission was created in 1953 to fight corruption at the port the port of miami introduced an id system few years ago23 three port authorities in florida have begun implementing statewide id system to fulfill requirements of florida state law on port security24 the florida law requires fingerprintbased criminal history check of port workers as long and difficult as it has been to develop background check and id system for us port workers this effort concerns only one node in the maritime transportation system the united states has jurisdiction over transportation workers in overseas ports as well as the truck drivers rail workers and others who directly handle the cargo on its way to the overseas port one of the criteria for ctpat participants is to conduct background checks on their employees however it is not known how or if cbp validates these checks while background checks can provide some level of assurance as to the trustworthiness of worker experience has shown that individuals who have undergone much greater scrutiny such as high level security clearances have occasionally proven untrustworthy

the immediate vicinity of us port complex securing the cargo and ships in transit to us ports is arguably more critical and consequently the bulk of security activity takes place before cargo is unloaded at us ports while us ports are an acceptable place to interdict illegal drugs and enforce trade laws not finding terrorist weapon until after it reaches us port could be too late to prevent potentially catastrophic event in response to this reality the coast guard and cbp have adopted strategy of pushing the borders out with layered system of security measures key elements in this layered strategy are cbps scrutiny of us bound cargo at the overseas port of loading and the coast guards scrutiny of ships before they enter us harbors thus with respect to anti terrorism measures us ports are viewed as the last line of defense rather than the first 22 gao report gao05106 port security better planning needed to develop and operate maritime worker identification card program

international ship and port facility security code isps which went into effect on july 1 2004 the isps contains securityrelated requirements for governments port authorities and ship owners the host government is responsible for enforcing the code the isps largely parallels mtsa with respect to the security requirements of ports and ships the coast guard also actively assesses the security of

submitted to them by vessels so that they can better evaluate the terrorism risk posed by ships crews and cargo bound for us ports after september 11 2001 the coast guard instituted new reporting requirements for ships entering or leaving us harbors the former 24hour advance notice of arrival noa was extended to 96hour noa the noa includes detailed information on the crew cargo and the vessel itself the coast guard evaluates this information and other intelligence to determine what action it may take if any regarding the vessel it could board and inspect the ship in the open ocean at an anchorage near shore at the dock and it may escort the ship into and out of the port to enforce security zone around the ship the coast guard is also deploying vessel tracking system the automatic identification system that has range of 2030 miles to monitor ship traffic in us harbors this capability currently exists at 12 us ports and the agency plans to extend this capability nationwide the coast guard is also pursuing longrange vessel tracking system that will have range of about 2000 nautical miles g5g4g18g561 the container security initiative csi one of series of initiatives aimed at improving the security of cargo destined for the united states was initiated by the us customs service now cbp in january of 2002 to prevent terrorists from exploiting containers entering into the united states csi is based on four core elements 1 identifying highrisk containers 2 prescreening highrisk containers at the earliest possible point in the supply chain 3 using technology to pre screen high risk containers quickly and 4 developing and using smart and secure containers under the csi program cbp officers are sent to participating ports where they collaborate with host country customs officers to identify and prescreen highrisk containers using nonintrusive inspection technology before the containers are loaded on usbound ships csi ports provide cbp an opportunity in

initiative atdi as the prototype for the acquisition of this data cbp uses the automated targeting system ats in order to identify highrisk containers requiring additional inspection ts uses electronically filed entry information to automatically flag highrisk shipments ts standardizes manifest bill of lading entry and entry summary data and creates integrated records called shipments these shipments are then evaluated and scored by ats using weighted rules derived from the targeting methods of experienced personnel the higher the score the more attention the shipment requires and the greater the chance it will be targeted for additional enforcement actions nonintrusive scans or physical inspection when cbp asserts that it screens 100 of usbound cargo it is referring to the use

to comply with federal security measures regardless of ownership the coast guard checks for compliance with physical security requirements at the terminal cbp through its ctpat program requires terminal operators to adhere to similar security measures cbp is also in charge of deciding which cargo to physically inspect with the terminal operators role merely to set that cargo aside as cbp directs tsa will be in charge of screening terminal workers when the twic card is implemented one could argue that these measures apply equally to all terminal operators and that therefore the ownership of the terminal operating company is irrelevant to the security of port however the credibility of these federal security requirements also depends on how much of an actual presence port businesses perceive federal authorities have in the port in exercising its oversight role congress is likely to consider whether the coast guard and cbp have enough inspectors to verify compliance with agreed upon security measures g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g22g142g155g150g146g151g138g149g561g17g153g142g155g138g157g152g155g156g561g138g151g141g561g17g160g151g142g155g156g561 if one believes that stevedore ownership is relevant to security then subsequent question is whether foreign ownership poses more of security risk than domestic ownership in evaluating whether foreign terminal operators should be excluded from us ports more information as to how many us marine facilities are actually operated or owned by foreignbased companies would be useful as indicated above most container terminals in the united states are operated by foreign companies but container terminals account for only one type of marine facility it is probable that in some cases other types of marine terminals are not only operated but also owned by foreign interests while the maritime administration has compiled information on the ownership of container terminals at the largest us container ports similar information regarding other types of marine terminals is not readily available it is important to pinpoint exactly what advantage terrorist group would have if it had some kind of connection with terminal operator foreign terminal operators would gain intimate knowledge of the daytoday security procedures at the us terminals they operate and theoretically could pass this knowledge on to terrorist group however usbased terminal operators would have the same knowledge and terrorist group could infiltrate them also because foreign terminal operators hire mostly am ericans to work in their terminals they may pose more security risk than usbased company one could view foreign companies like dp world as mostly the financiers behind the terminal operation with little or involvement in the daytoday running of the terminals httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33383g22g142g155g150g146g151g138g149g561g17g153g142g155g138g157g152g155g156g561g138g151g141g561g22g145g142g146g155g561

is important because there are also drawbacks to banning them from us ports cargo security policy is about striking an appropriate balance between security and commerce it also involves balancing security and capital investment port facilities depend on large capital investments the piers wharfs cranes and elevators needed to load and unload ships the storage yards warehouses or tank farms needed to store cargo the dredging of shipping channels and berths and landside connections to interstate highways and transcontinental railroads are all expensive infrastructure thus the issue of foreign terminal operators involves guaranteeing security while remaining attractive to sources of capital

could be too late if terrorist weapon is discovered after it arrives at us port the security of us ports necessarily relies on the cooperation of shippers carriers ports terminal operators and border agencies in the country of origin to begin the screening process key policy questions are should the united states trust these foreign entities should they be treated as partners and allies in securing maritime commerce because there are two ends to americas supply line the answer to both may be qualified yes for instance although dp world will not be handling any us cargo in us ports it will be handling us cargo at ports of origin in china hong kong europe southeast asia the middle east and elsewhere 30 in evaluating the dp world transaction or others like it it is appropriate to consider the extent to which the united states depends on foreign entities to secure its supply chain csi depends on the cooperation of the host government of the overseas port of loading to inspect us bound cargo ctpat depends on the cooperation of overseas manufacturers and overland carriers to protect us bound shipments from terrorist infiltration isps relies on the cooperation of foreign governments and foreignflag carriers to enforce port and vessel security codes as one maritime industry spokesperson stated this is an international business with an international problem the only way its going to be addressed effectively is through international efforts which means the us isnt going to do it all nor can it do it all 31

spotlighted the role of terminal operators in port security the initial debate about who should be operating us ports quickly broadened into debate about whether us ports are secure the dp world controversy refueled debate about whether the nation is doing enough doing it with enough urgency and spending enough on us port and maritime security32 members of congress have referred to ports as

gao has issued number of reports addressing post911 security initiatives gao has reported several factors limiting csi including staffing imbalances and lack of technical requirements for nii equipment used at foreign ports 36 number of concerns have also been raised by gao regarding the ctpat program including the scope of effort and level of rigor applied to the validation process how many and the types of validations that are necessary to manage security risk and various staffing issues37 the ats system and cbps targeting strategy more generally have been scrutinized by gao in reports that criticize the strategy for not incorporating all the key elements of risk management framework nd not being entirely consistent with recognized modeling practices38 also the dhs inspector general publishe d the results of an audit of cbps targeting procedures and concluded that improvements were needed regarding the data used by ats examination results should be used to refine ts

packing process at the overseas factory or warehouse 2 the integrity of the subsequent truck movement from the factory or warehouse to the overseas port of loading and 3 the integrity of the manifest information that cbp uses in part to target high risk shipments for inspection43 because there is foolproof way to address these vulnerabilities some security experts call for greatly increasing the percentage of containers that are physically inspected others question whether determined terrorist would not be able to find an inexpensive solution to circumvent screening technology while the threat of shipping container being used as trojan horse by terrorists has received much attention debate persists about the likelihood that terrorists would use them for such purpose the gao reports that while shipping containers are vulnerable an extensive body of work by the fbi academic think tank and business organizations concluded that the likelihood of such use to smuggle weapon is considered low 44 some contend that more likely tactic is that terrorists would attempt to smuggle weapon using private watercraft and land at public marina because they could remain in control of the weapon and avoid the scrutiny that occurs at official ports of entry terrorists could also smuggle weapon in other types of cargo such as motor vehicles or breakbulk cargo they could repeat the attack method used against the uss cole or the limberg in which terrorists rammed small boat packed with explosives into the hulls of these ships they could employ this tactic against cruise ship ferry or ship carrying hazardous cargo45 the issue for congress is how to protect us ports and the supply chains on which the us economy depends congress faces pressing questions about the overall security of ports and maritime commerce the amount of funding that will be required to secure the maritime transportation system and the amount of federal presence in ports that is necessary to prevent or deter
