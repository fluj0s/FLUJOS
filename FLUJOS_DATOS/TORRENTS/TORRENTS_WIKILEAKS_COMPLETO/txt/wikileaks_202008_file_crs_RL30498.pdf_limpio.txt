drive to increase the levels of employmentbased immigration both the congress and the federal reserve board then expressed concern that scarcity of labor could curtail the pace of economic growth primary response was to increase the supply of foreign temporary professional workers through fy2003 when the h1b annual numerical limits reverted to 65000 in fy2005 that limit was reached on the first day the fy2006 limit was reached before the fiscal year began the us citizenship and immigration services announced that the fy2008 h1b cap was reached within the first two days it accepted petitionsapril 23 2007 the 106 th congress temporarily raised the number of h1b visas for three years the 107th congress enacted provisions that allow h1b workers to remain if their employers petitioned for them to become legal permanent residents provision in pl 108447 exempted up to 20000 aliens holding masters or higher degree from the cap on h1b visas it also established fraud preventionanddetection fee on petitioners provisions on h1b visas also were part of chile and singapore free trade agreements pl 10877 and pl 10878 the median annual compensation of the newly arriving h1b nonimmigrants dropped from 50000 in fy2001 to 44803 in fy2003 but climbe d back to 50000 in fy2005 most h1b new arrivals had earned bachelors degree or its equivalent 425 more than onethird 393 had masters degrees and 171 had either professional degrees or doctorates in fy2005 453 of h1b new arrivals were employed in computerrelated fields followed by educators 112 architects engineers and surveyors 111 and administrative specializations 95 india was the leading country of origin comprising 490 of all new arrivals in fy2005 china followed with 916 and canada was third 36 those opposing any further increases or easing of admissions requirements assert that there is compelling evidence of labor shortage in these professional areas that cannot be met by newly graduating students and retraining the existing us work force they argue further that the education of us students and training of us workers should be prioritized instead of fostering reliance on foreign workers proponents of current h1b levels assert that h1b workers are essential if the united states is to remain globally competitive some proponents argue that employers should be free to hire the best people for the jobs maintaining that market forces should regulate h1b visas not an arbitrary ceiling in the 110 th congress the comprehensive immigration reform legislation s 1639 stalled in the senate on june 28

legislative response was to increase the supply of foreign tempor ary professional workers through fy2003 although congress enacted legislation in 1998 to increase the number of visas for temporary foreign workers who have professional specialties commonly known as h1b visas that annual ceiling of 115000 visas was reached months before fy1999 and fy2000 ended many in the business community notably in the information technology area once more urged that the ceiling be raised congress again striving to balance the needs of us employers with employment opportunities for us residents enacted legislation to raise the annual ceiling to 195000 for three years and to expand education and training programs pl 106313 s 2045 and pl 106311 hr 5362 in the early 2000s the economic downturn in the information technology sector appeared to have diminished demand for h1b workers in that sector and raised new questions about the layoffs of h1bs nonimmigrants when the h1b annual numerical limits reverted to 65000 the 108 th congress weighed whether to extend the increases as the admissions once again surpass the statutory limit the fy2004 limit was reached in midfebruary 2004 and the fy2005 limit was reached on october 1 2004 the first day of the fiscal year the inclusion of h1b provisions in free trade agreements pl 10877 and pl 10878 as well as national security concerns sparked

announced that it has received enough h1b petitions to meet the cap for fy2006 concerns in the business community that scarcity of qualified professional and technical workers may slow economic growth

commonly referred to by the letter that denotes their section in the statute1 the major nonimmigrant category for tem porary workers is the h visa the largest classification of h visas is the h1b workers in specialty occupations2 any employer wishing to bring in an h1b nonimm igrant must attest in labor certification application lca to the department of bor dol that the employer will pay the nonimmigrant the greater of the actual wages paid other employees in the same job or the prevailing wages for that occupation the employer will provide working conditions for the nonimmigrant that do not cause the working conditions of the other employees to be adversely affected and there is strike or lockout the employer also must post at the workplace the application to hire nonimmigrants firms categorized as h1b dependent generally if at least 15 of the workforce are h1b workers must also attest that they have attempted to recruit us workers and that they have not laid off us workers 90 days prior to or after hiring any h1b nonimmigrants 3 dol reviews the lca for completeness and obvious inaccuracies only if complaint subsequently is raised challenging the employers application will dol investigate if dol finds the employer failed to comply the employer may be fined may be denied the right to apply for additional h1b workers and may be subject to other penalties the prospective h1b nonimmigrants must demonstrate to the us citizenship and immigration services bureau uscis in the department of homeland security that they have the requisite education and work experience for the

permanent immigration that is employment based6 if an employer wishes to hire an alien to work on permanent basis in the united states the alien may petition to immigrate to the united states through one of the employmentbased categories the employer sponsors the prospective immigrant and if the petition is successful the alien becomes legal permanent resident many h1b nonimmigrants may have education skills and experience that are similar to the requirements for three of the five preference categories for employmentbased immigration priority workersthat is persons of extraordinary ability in the arts sciences education business or athletics outstanding professors and researchers and certain multinational executives and managersfirst preference members of the professions holding advanced degrees or persons of exceptional ability second preference and skilled workers with at least two years training and professionals with baccalaureate degrees third preference 7 employmentbased immigrants applying through th second and third preferences must have job offers for positions in which the employers have obtained labor certification the labor certification is intended to demonstrate that the immigrant is not taking jobs away from qualified us workers and many consider the labor certification process far more arduous than the attestation process used for h1b nonimmigrants8 more specifically the employer who seeks to hire prospective immigrant worker petitions uscis and dol on behalf of the alien the prospective immigrant must demonstrate that he or

f1 visa to become legal permanent residence lpr19 many anecdotal accounts tell of foreign students who are hired by us firms as they are completing their programs the employers obtain h1b visas for the recent graduates and if the employees meet expectations the employers may also petition for the nonimmigrants to become lprs through one of the employmentbased immigration categories20 some policy makers consider this natural and positive chain of events arguing that it would be foolish to educate these talented young people only to make them leave to work for foreign competitors others consider this f1 to h1b to lpr pathway an abuse of the temporary element of nonimmigrant status and way to circumvent the laws and procedures that protect us workers from being displaced by immigrants21 recent research by b lindsay lowell of the institute for the study of international migration estimates that approximately 7 of foreign students adjust to lpr status directly and that additional 7 to 8 of students adjust to lpr status following stint as an h nonimmigrant worker22 in 2000 lowell also conducted analysis of all h1bs who ultimately become lprs and estimated that about half of them did so at that time23 in 1995 crs analysis of ins data on employmen tbased admissions found that 43 of those adjusting status were either h1bs or accompanying h4 immediate family members of the temporary worker another 144 of the employme ntbased adjustments were foreign students and the accompanying immediate family of foreign students that analysis also found that h worker adjustments to lpr status had increased from 7244 in fy1988 to 24223 in fy1994an increase of more than 225 in six yearswhich was likely due in part to the change in the immigration act of 1990 to permit dual intent for h1bs 24 19 for more discussion of legal permanent residence see crs report rl32235 us immigration policy on permanent admissions by ruth ellen wasem 20 dol reports that nearly

were leap frogging the laws that protect us workers from being displaced by immigrants prompted some to suggest that all foreign students and foreign temporary workers return home for two years to establish residency if they wish to return to the united states this proposal circulated in the senate but it met with strong and varied opposition from the educational community and business interests many argued it would just lead to abuses and increase incentives to manipulate the nonimmigrant visa process 22 b lindsay lowell foreign student adjustment to permanent status in the united

proponents of expanding h1b admissions argue th at h1b workers are essential if the united states is to remain globally competitive and that employers should be free to hire the best people for the jobs 27 they say that the education of students and retraining of the current workforce is longterm approach and they cannot wait to fi ll todays openings some point out that many mathematics computer science and engineering graduates of us colleges and universities are foreign students and that we risk reverse brain drain if that talent leaves the united states28 others assert that h1b workers help create jobs either by ultimately starting their own information technology firms or by providing wo rkforce sufficient for firms to remain in the united states proponents of the increase also cite media accounts of information technology workers from india who prefer to work for companies in india and warn that the work will move abroad if action to increase h1b visas is not taken 29

shortage in these professional areas that cannot be met by newly graduating students and by retraining the existing us work force they argue that the education of us students and training of us workers should be prioritized opponents also maintain that salaries and compensation would be rising if there is labor shortage and if employers wanted to attract qualified us workers critics draw on an investigation of lca applications in 2005 which reported that many employers were paying h1b visa holders below the median prevailing wage for the corresponding occupation and location30 some allege that employers prefer h1b workers because they are less demanding in terms of wages and working conditions others express concern that an industrys dependence on temporary foreign workers may inadvertently lead the brightest us students to seek positions in fields offering more stable and lucrative careers31 many opposed to an increase in h1b visas cite the gao reports that document abuses of h1b visas and recommend additional controls to protect us workers32 27 for example see us chamber of congress and information technology association of america joint letter to us senators from

aimed at protecting us workers as the most controversial in hr 3736 as it was reported by the house judiciary committee while s 1723 as passed by the senate did add provisions penalizing firms that lay off us work ers and replace them with h1b workers if the firms have violated other attestation requirements amendments that would have required prospective h1b employers to attest that they were not laying off us workers and that they tried to recruit us workers failed on the senate floor hr 3736 as reported included layoff protection and recruiting requirement provisions si milar to those that the senate rejected on the other hand s 1723 included language that would have expanded the education and training of us students and workers in the math science engineering and information
