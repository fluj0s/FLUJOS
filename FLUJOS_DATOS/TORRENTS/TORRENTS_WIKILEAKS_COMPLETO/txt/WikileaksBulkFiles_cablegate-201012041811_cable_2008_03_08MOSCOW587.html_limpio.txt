tymoshenko in moscow ref moscow 561 b moscow 265 c moscow 147 classified by ambassador william j burns reasons 14 bd 1 c summary after many lastminute changes and rescheduling involving tymoshenkos visit the february 1213 putinyushchenko intergovernmental commission igc convened without tymoshenkos participation gor officials expressed dismay at the complicated dynamics between yushchenko and tymoshenko which required delicate balancing on its part the igc session focused on an action plan for all areas of the bilateral relationship for 2008 while two sensitive issues nato and gas loomed large recent series of smallscale disagreements have also added to the friction compounded by the yushchenko tymoshenko feud the onagainoffagain gas deal between russia and ukraine is continuing with gazprom threatening another cutoff unless the debt is paid by march 3 moscow analysts view bilateral relations as hostage to ukrainian domestic political games where different forces vie for better position in next years presidential election through attempts to gain an upper hand over deals with russia end summary yushchenkotymoshenko farce 2 c yushchenko made two visits to moscow within two weeks this month for the february 1213 igc meeting where he met bilaterally with putin and the february 2122 cis informal summit where he did not ref yushchenkos travel was punctuated by pm tymoshenkos manytimesdelayed visitxxxxx told us february 26 that the uneasy dynamics between yushchenko and tymoshenko complicated the igc proceedings he termed the situation disappointing at best and bewildering otherwise tymoshenko whose february 11 visit one day before yushchenkos to avoid the overlap with him was delayed till february 21 at ukraines request and then was moved forward by one day for the same reason xxxxx said that gor officials simply could not understand how the president and prime minister of country could work effectively under such odd circumstancesxxxxx the gors goal was to conduct meaningful dialogue with the ukrainian counterparts in all six commissions without making the already delicate situation worse the gor which had prepared for tymoshenkos participation in the igc had to match the ukrainian decision not to include her in its team by pulling pm zubkov from the session putinyushchenko bilateral 3 c the two presidents during their threehour long good discussion covered wide range of bilateral issues notably the gas deal nato and the dispute over the two countries common history putin also urged yushchenko to take more active role in the resolution of the transnistria conflictxxxxx that putin and yushchenko clashed over nato and the gous initiatives on ukrainian national heroes putin was not convinced by yushchenkos insistence that ukraines request of nato map was not intended to be antirussian nato painful and all encompassing 4 c prior to the putinyushchenko igc meeting the gor repeatedly expressed its displeasure with ukraines nato bid in january 23 statement on ukraines pending request for nato map the mfa warned that further expansion of nato could produce serious politicalmilitary upheaval that would affect the interests of russia ref b citing the 1997 bilateral agreement laying out the russianukrainian strategic partnership the statement stressed that the potential integration of ukraine into nato would force russia to undertake appropriate measures during february 8 meeting with the ambassador dfm karasin said that the gor was disappointed with the gous move ref c positive decision in bucharest karasin said would force russia to take strategic countermeasures in his february 14 annual press conference putin lashed out against ukraines map request saying that the majority of ukrainian citizens were against their countrys nato membership but ukrainian leaders did not ask their opinion what kind of democracy is this he asked 5 c ukrainian xxxxx told us that ukraines interest in closer relations with nato for the first time as consensus decision by the three top leaders of the country had triggered dejavu reaction from the gor which had surprised one in ukraine and had provoked genuine and more mature public discourse on nato in ukraine although the topic was painful for russia and was discussed in every bilateral meeting on every level xxxxx argued that the gors response had been to date less emotional than in the early postorange years xxxxx acknowledged that during ukrainian national security and defense council secretary bohatyrevas january 29 visit to moscow all russian interlocutors including fm lavrov duma speaker gryzlov and other duma deputies had expressed hostility to the ukrainian move 6 c moscow analysts predict that ukraines domestic lack of consensus on membership and the lack of coordinated support among nato member states combined with slowmoving nato bureaucracy could make the issue longterm sore spot in the relationship some argued that an excessive push by the gou could catalyze radical counter measures from the gor including possible reexamination of the status of the black sea fleet and gorfunded activities in and around sevastopol gas scheming abounds on both sides 7 c many viewed the january 24 arrest of semyon mogilevich as only the tip of the iceberg of murky highstakes gas deals given his alleged involvement with rosukrenergo which became the key middleman in russian gas exports to ukraine after russia briefly cut off the gas supply to ukraine in january 2006 xxxxx noted that pm tymoshenko made the removal of the chain of intermediaries between gazprom and ukraine as well as raising the gas transit fee through the ukrainian territory the central theme of her february 2021 visit although yushchenko and tymoshenko shared the same goal of removing intermediary agents in the gas deal xxxxx said the latter insisted on the immediate removal of rosukrenergo from the deal gor officials found her xxxxx added inflexible and less trustworthy than yushchenko 8 c according xxxxx the gor was particularly not pleased with tymoshenkos idea of the white stream pipeline considering it another attempt to bypass russia in bringing central asian gas to europe russia values ukraine as the key link to europe which can work only if the two countries are united and consistent he added xxxxxtold us that putin and yushchenko talked over the phone on february 26 to discuss ukraines growing arrears and the absence of the 2008 contract in the meantime bickering between gazprom and naftogaz is continuing as of february 28 just another sign of the fragility of the energy deal between the two countries 9 c xxxxx said that yushchenko wanted more transparency but preferred to avoid measures which would further increase the price moscow carnegie center experts emphasized to us that the gors priority is to have ukraine as reliable economic partner which would guarantee that russian gas mostly turkmen and uzbek gas that transits russia would flow to europe without disruption all interlocutors agreed that until gazproms leadership reshuffle ended longterm deal could be made beyond gas 10 c in 2007 the increase in the volume of bilateral trade between russia and ukraine to usd 32 billion disguised decoupling of certain russianukrainian industries according to xxxxx russia is slowly consolidating the production cycle to do away with imported parts from ukraine in the areas where traditionally the two countries were interdependent such as aircraft and machine building with ukraines aspirations to nato membership russia has already begun to reduce its cooperation in military and technical fields as well xxxxx said the quiet process of economic disengagement in many important areas is under way 11 c some experts noted that gor officials are reluctant to talk about ukraines 13percent plus economic growth in 2007 which despite kyivs political turmoil easily surpassed russias 6 percent they also argued that wto entry could give ukraine leverage in its dealings with russia they predicted however that the new schengen regime could hurt ukraine particularly in its west as new members would replace ukrainian workers in western europe the rise of unemployment in western ukraine could create more disparity among ukrainian regions giving eastern ukraine which is better incorporated into the russian economy an advantage mazepa not only tchaikovskiy opera 12 c ivan mazepa has recently been added to the long list of historical figures about whom russian and ukraine quarrel since the gors pronounced dissatisfaction with the gous attempt to reclassify the holodomor as genocide and roman shukevich as ukrainian national hero other cases have emerged the gou agreed to award political asylum to st petersburg journalist andrushchenko two more russian journalists have requested asylum as well on february 1 ukrainian political analyst serhiy taran was barred from entering russia at st petersburgs pulkovo airport the february 5 mfa statement confirmed the incident without giving reason for the denial although it cited the december 2007 refusal of ukrainian authorities to grant entry to ukraine to two russian political analysts dugin and zarifulin ivan mazepa portrayed in pushkins tale and tchaikovskiys opera as boorish ukrainian soldier who joined swedish king karl xii against peter the great is at the center of the current dispute the gor termed the gous plan to build monument to mazepa antirussian while xxxxx scoffed at the ukraines planned commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the battle of poltava as absurd some experts thought that the need to create ukrainian national identity was understandable but choosing controversial figures as heroes would not resonate well with the russians more to come black sea fleet and the crimea 13 c the ukrainian embassy expressed frustration with the sluggish pace of black sea fleet negotiations with its current agreement set to expire in 2017 the transfer of the fleet to another location should be major issue on the bilateral agenda the gor however has consistently insisted that it is premature to discuss details xxxxx said that the bilateral black sea fleet subcommission with its 6th session completed on january 24 produced negligible results in the meantime the gor has intensified activities in sevastopol through prorussian and russianfunded ngos comment 14 c with the political process still in flux in ukraine and the presidential transition in russia underway the bilateral relationship is on hold with pivotal issues deferred until after may burns
