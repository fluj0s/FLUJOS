2004 newco capitalises it with 200k of additional ordinary share capital holdco invests 100k in portfolio of gilts 23 holdco acquires the nominal ordinary share capital of an offtheshelf cayman islands incorporated company realco originally formed in 2004 holdco pays 100k for an additional r500k ordinary share capital in realco realco invests 100k in rlinked assets 24 newco holdco and realco

realco prepare their statutory accounts under uk gaap newco and holdco have gbp functional currency and realco has brl functional currency 26 realco enters into an agreement the services agreement with bbsa agrees to manage the investments of realco including being responsible for the selection of suitable issuers within agreed investment parameters the application for credit approval and the postclose management of its portfolio the services agreement can be terminated at 5 days notice by realcos board of directors setup steps stage2 27 bbplc invests 300m in redeemable preference shares issued by newco the newco prefs the newco prefs are redeemable at both bbplcs and newcos option 28 newco borrows an additional 700m the bb sub loan from an existing uk tax resident member of the barclays group bb sub the bb sub loan pays interest at 3month gbp libor the bb sub loan can be terminated early at either bbsubs or newcos option 29 newco subscribes 1000m for r5000m redeemable preference shares the holdco prefs the holdco prefs are mandatorily redeemable in 5 years and earlier at both holdcos and newcos option either in cash or inspecie permitting the redemption in currency other than r the holdco prefs entitle the holder to cumulative priority dividend payable in gbp based on preuk tax quarterly brazilian interbank average deposit rates brldi 210 newco and holdco hedge their brl exposure by entering into 5year crosscurrency swap the xcs with the following cashflows initial exchange none regular flows newco pays gbp amounts linked to brldi on notional principal of r5000m and holdco pays 3month gbp libor on notional principal of 1000m final exchange newco pays the gbp equivalent of r5000m at the exchange rate in force at termination and holdco pays 1000m both holdco and newco can accelerate the xcs 211 holdco lends 700m the holdco loan to bb sub on exactly the same terms as the bb sub loan 212 holdco subscribes 300m for r1500m of irredeemable equity the realco equity the realco equity entitles holdco to dividend payable in gbp equal to the profits of realco payable quarterly 213 holdco hedges the expected rlinked dividends on the realco equity by entering into series of nondeliverable currency forward sale agreements with the markets floor the market forwards under which holdco agrees to pay fixed rlinked amounts in exchange for the gbp equivalents translated at the forward gbpr fx rates 214 realco invests 300m in rlinked bonds issued by thirdparty nonuk issuers the bonds the bonds will have 1year tenor and pay interest linked to the 1year fixed brazilian interest rate plus the applicable credit spread of the issuer the bonds will redeem for the gbp equivalent of r1500m at the exchange rate in force on the redemption date the bonds will be issued from mtn programmes 215 bbplc hedges the gbp interest rate risk by entering into 1year gbp fixed floating interest rate swap on notional of 300m 216 bbplc newco holdco and realco enter into group relief agreement whereby bbplc and newco agree to surrender group relief to holdco and realco for payment ongoing flows 217 realco receives the rlinked coupon on the bonds 218 realco declares and pays rlinked dividend to holdco real co is able to pay 100 of the rlinked dividend as opposed to 70 since it obtains group relief at cost from bbplc or newco 219 holdco uses the rlinked receipt from realco to make payments under the market forwards 220 holdco receives the gbp equivalent fixed at outset at the forward fx rate of the rlinked fixed amounts under the market forwards 221 holdco receives 3month gbp libor interest on the 700m holdco loan and pays 3month gbp libor interest on the 1000m xcs 222 holdco receives the brldi linked amounts in gbp under the xcs 223 holdco pays the dividends on the holdco prefs holdco is able to pay the pretax equivalent of the flows set out at 218 222 since it obtains group relief at cost from bbplc or newco therefore holdco has hedge of its rlinked interest rate risk b hedge of its brldi interest rate risk c an obligation to pay 3month gbp libor on 300m and d fixed stream of gbp cash flows based on r interest rates 224 bb sub receives 3month gbp libor interest on the bb sub loan and pays 3month gbp libor interest on the holdco loan therefore bb sub has hedge of the interest rate risk on the bb sub and holdco loans 225 newco receives 3month gbp libor interest on 1000m under the xcs 226 newco pays 3month gbp libor interest on the 700m bb sub loan 227 newco pays the brldi linked amounts under the xcs 228 newco receives dividend on the holdco prefs equal to the amounts set out at 225227 therefore newco has hedge of its brldi interest rate and exchange rate risk and b right to receive 3month gbp libor on 300m 229 the amounts in 223c and 228b are equal and opposite therefore the net position for the newco holdco realco group is fixed gbp receipt based on r interest rates on the bonds this amount will be taxed and ultimately paid as dividend to bbplc 230 bbplc therefore has fixed rate asset part profit part cost of funds and therefore bbplc pays fixed under an interest rate swap in order to hedge the gbp libor funding cost leaving fixed profit equal to the spread between i r rates translated in gbp at forward rates on notional of 300m and ii gbp fixed rates on notional of 300m unwind steps early termination or maturity 231 each of newco holdco and realco will close off an accounting period 232 the bonds redeem at maturity redeem early or are sold by realco realco uses the proceeds to make further appropriate investments 233 if appropriate realco terminates the services agreement with bbsa 234 holdco terminates the xcs holdco may or may not opt to redeem the holdco prefs at the same time 235 the bb sub loan the holdco loan the market forwards and the irs are terminated and repaid 3 economics and economic drivers 31 this transaction allows bbplc to earn rlinked returns c19 without taking the r fx exposure normally associated with r investment 32 each of bbplc newco bb sub and realco has an fx hedge on pretax and posttax basis the benefit from the transaction manifests itself at holdco 33 from holdco perspective the realco equity and the holdco prefs do not give rise to fx gains or losses for tax purposes whereas the xcs does give rise to fx gains or losses for tax purposes if the r depreciates against gbp the effect is shown below instrument pretax tax posttax realco equity 100 00 100 holdco prefs 333 00 333 xcs 333 100 233 total 100 100 00 in order for this hedge to be effective bbplc must value the tax deduction of 10 ie the transaction utilises tax capacity if the r depreciates against gbp the maximum amount of tax capacity that could be used is 1000m if r becomes worthless 34 if the r appreciates the effect is shown below instrument pretax tax posttax realco equity 100 00 100 holdco prefs 333 00 333 xcs 333 100 233 total 100 100 00 if r appreciates against gbp more tax is paid in addition to the profit from the transaction 35 therefore holdco has posttax hedged position regardless of whether r depreciates or appreciates against gbp but is in receipt of rlinked income holdco sells the rlinked income for gbp income this is the equivalent of earning rlinked income c19 on 300m investment 36 attached as appendix 2 is an analysis based on historical rgbp fx rates the overall conclusion of which is that tax capacity usage is unpredictable and had similar transactions been executed over the past few years tax capacity would have been generated 48 of the time and utilised 52 of the time 4 tax analysis newco 41 the holdco prefs will be treated as capital gains tax assets and therefore any accounting entries in respect of exchange differences will be ignored holdco will suffer capital gains tax on any exchange gains and losses only on disposal 42 the xcs should qualify as hedge of the holdco prefs for the purposes of 4 of the disregard regs this is because although the holdco prefs are treated as debt in newcos solus accounts the question of what is share for the purpose of 4 is legal and not an accounting test and b condition 3 of 43 should be satisfied as the xcs eliminates the exposure to exchange differences on the holdco prefs the consequences are that any exchange differences arising on the termination of the xcs will be brought into account as capital as and when the holdco prefs are sold or redeemed under si 20021970 these gains and losses will offset the exchange gains and losses on the holdco prefs holdco 43 the holdco prefs will not be taxed in holdcos hands as they are shares issued by holdco and not loan relationships notwithstanding their treatment as debt under frs 25 ias 32 44 4 of the disregard regs will not apply to the xcs in holdco and therefore the exchange differences will be brought into account in accordance with its solus accounts under the derivative contracts regime the xcs is hedging the holdco prefs therefore none of the 3 conditions in 4 of the disregard regs should be met 45 the realco equity will be treated as capital gains tax asset holdco will suffer capital gains tax on any exchange gain or loss only upon disposal 46 the market forwards will be hedge accounted with the dividends received on the realco equity under uk gaap accordingly holdco will not be taxed on the net gbp amounts received realco 47 realco is brl functional currency company the bonds are loan relationships and accordingly will be taxed under the fa 1996 regime realco will therefore be taxed on its profits for the year being the accrual of income on the bonds translated into gbp at the average exchange rate for the year 48 the overall benefit from the trade will be equal to the rlinked income from the bonds hedged into gbp at the forward fx rates under the market forwards consequently if the average fx rate for the year is not equal to the average of the forward fx rates for the year the effective tax rate will not equal 30 in this case the posttax profit and hence the management accounts benefit will be different to the pretax profit and there will be corresponding minor pug impact tax opinion 49 tax opinion from freshfields is attached as appendix 3 5 tax risk unallowable purposes 13 sch 9 fa 1996 51 debits will be recognised on the holdco loan the bb sub loan and bbplcs funding however given that the transaction will generate pretax profit and that for this profit to be earned it is not necessary for the xcs to generate deductible loss indeed it may involve additional tax being paid depending on exchange rate movements it will not be possible to show that the transaction as whole was entered into with the objective of securing tax advantage 23 sch 26 fa 2002 52 debits will be recognised on the xcs and the irs for the same reason as set out at 51 above 23 will not apply nontaxation of the xcs mandatory matching post 1105 53 holdcos economic gain or loss on the realco equity is hedged on posttax basis by the xcs in circumstances where there is loss on the xcs there is risk of 4 of the disregard regs applying to the xcs however 4 of the disregard regs should not apply to the xcs since it does not eliminate or substantially reduce the economic risk of holding the realco equity it is difficult to see how these provisions can be interpreted to apply otherwise than on pretax basis pretax basis gain or loss on the xcs will in fact increase holdcos economic exposure to r rather than reduce it 6 accounting 61 the accounting treatment set out below has been agreed with financial control realco solus accounts 62 realco will prepare solus accounts under uk gaap and will use r functional currency 63 realco will hold the bonds on balance sheet at amortised cost and accruals account for interest income which will be taken to pl 64 realco will account for the realco equity as equity holdco solus accounts 65 holdco will prepare solus accounts under uk gaap and will use gbp functional currency 66 holdco will hold the realco equity at cost and not retranslate it since it is nonmonetary item1 67 holdco will recognise the holdco prefs as nonequity shares in its first accounting period and as financial liability under frs 25 ias 32 thereafter it will contract rate account the xcs with the holdco prefs and therefore recognise exchange differences on either instrument on current basis2 68 if the xcs is terminated at point in time when the holdco prefs are also redeemed then amounts will be taken to the profit and loss account any cash movements will simply be treated as balance sheet movements 69 if the xcs is terminated at point in time when the holdco prefs remain outstanding then the xcs will be retranslated and the exchange difference will be taken to the profit and loss account and offset against the retranslation of the holdco prefs to their current gbp value 610 the market forwards will be hedge accounted against the dividends holdco receives on the realco equity newco solus accounts 611 newco will prepare solus accounts under uk gaap and will use gbp functional currency 612 newco will account for the holdco prefs and xcs on symmetrical basis to holdco bbplc solus accounts 613 bbplc will account for the newco prefs as loan and receivable under ias 39 and hold them at amortised cost 614 the irs will be cashflow hedged against the floating rate funding the accrual of the fixed cashflows under the irs will be recognised in the income statement with any fairvalue differences recognised in equity bbplc consolidated accounts 615 the bonds will be recognised as an afs financial asset and translated into gbp at closing spot rate for inclusion in the consolidated accounts fairvalue gains and losses will be recognised in the afs portion of equity by reference to r at closing rates 1 ssap 20 5 2 ssap 20 4 616 on consolidation exchange gains and losses on the realco equity will be recognised in separate component of equity this is because the realco equity forms part of holdcos net investment in realco foreign operation 617 the market forwards will be cashflow hedge accounted against the income on the bonds accordingly the market forwards will be fairvalued through equity when the income on the bonds impacts the consolidated income statement an appropriate amount of the changes in the fair value of the market forwards will be recycled to the income statement accordingly the net income on the bonds after hedging will be equal to the gbp legs of the market forwards received in the particular year 618 as preliminary step in the consolidation of holdco and newco it is first necessary to adjust their accounts to an ias basis from uk gaap the holdco prefs will be retranslated into gbp at closing spot rate and exchange differences recognised in each companys ias income statement similarly the xcs will be fair valued and the change in fair value recognised by both companies in their ias income statements as the xcs has floating interest rate payments on each leg the substantial majority of these fair value changes will be due to changes in fx rates 619 as set out above holdco will be subject to tax on exchange differences on the xcs but not on the holdco prefs for newco both the holdco prefs and the xcs will be subject to tax as capital gains tax items the xcs will only be tax effected by holdco at termination and accordingly there will be difference between the tax base of the xcs and its carrying amount this difference will be equal to the cumulative exchange differences that have arisen to date on the xcs accordingly prior to consolidation deferred tax asset or liability should be recognised by holdco in its preconsolidation ias accounts overall net deferred tax asset or liability will be recognised by newco as the tax treatment on the holdco prefs and the xcs are symmetrical 620 on consolidation the holdco prefs and the xcs will be eliminated from the consolidated income statement and balance sheet on the basis that they are intragroup assetsliability and income expense the deferred tax asset or liability recognised by holdco will not be eliminated the deferred tax asset or liability will be shown in equity as in consolidated terms it relates to the exchanges arising on retranslation of the net investment in realco 621 the funding and the irs will be accounted for in the consolidated accounts on the same basis as in bbplcs solus accounts recycling of fx reserve 622 at maturity of the r investment the consolidated accounts will include an fx reserve on account of holdcos net investment in realco foreign operation and tax reserve on account of the deferred tax asset or liability recognised by holdco on the xcs under ias 21 48 these reserves will be recycled to the income statement upon disposal of realco us gaap analysis 623 the us gaap analysis is expected to be broadly the same as the ias treatment 624 an opinion from pwc on the accounting treatment of the transaction will be obtained in advance of execution 7 credit and market risk 71 realco has credit exposure to the issuers of the bonds and bbplc markets has credit exposure on the market forwards 72 if r depreciates against gbp bbplc is hedged on posttax basis by virtue of having taxable profits if taxable profits are not available then bbplc does not have posttax hedge the downside from this eventuality is best illustrated by viewing the table from 33 without the tax deduction for the pretax loss on the xcs in addition to this downside the cost of creating the conventional pre and posttax hedge would need to be considered 73 assuming that bonds are not sold outside of the bbplc group but the specifics of the transaction are terminated the exposure to r is longer hedged on posttax basis the cost of creating the conventional pre and posttax hedge is dependent upon the interest rates at the time of termination table below shows the estimated costs s m of hedging the sterling principal value of the bonds on early termination for the given shifts in brl interest rates relative to gbp all necessary credit approvals for realco will be obtained by bbsa pursuant to services agreement through gfrm all other credit risks will be obtained by the appropriate business unit via normal routes table time since investment 1 2 3 4 5 3months

exposure and therefore utilisation of shortterm treasury concession limits 82 the newco prefs will not constitute lending of capital nature within the meaning of ipru ca102b since the ultimate investment of the bbplc group is in the bonds which are likely to be issued by highlyrated financial institutions have high credit quality and are redeemable ie it should not be hard to finance this activity from another source 83 the issuers of the bonds are likely to be 20 weighted hence wras of 60m will be consumed initially the actual annual usage of wras will vary in sterling terms given that the bonds are r linked 84 in order to equate solus and consolidated wras newco could be capitalised with 6m of equity 85 the market forwards will attract wras equal to the cee plus addon 86 the return on wras will average at around 55 9 operational issues 91 none 10 provision 101 given that from inception it is not possible to predict whether more or less tax will be paid zero provision is suggested 11 other 111 it is not considered that npso signoff is required for this transaction appendices 1 structure diagrams 2 tax capacity analysis and 3 uk tax opinion
