gulf the middle east as region and to the worlds energy markets pointing out that nuclear weapon with even shortrange delivery system puts all the critical infrastructure in the gulf at risk as well as the oil shipping lanes mbz asserted if iran can increase oil production to more than 15 million barrels of oil per day let them have nuclear power but until they can replace the gulfs oil production they cant be allowed to have nuclear program 3 s mbz told moseley that the us should not focus too much on ahmadinejad as the problem but should focus instead on the greater iranian threat calling ahmadinejad merely the driver of bus nuclear program that has been running for long time in iran mbz described irans nuclear program as one that is longer driven by personalities but which has become part of the iranian identity noting that even if ahmadinejad or other leaders were to change the nuclear program would still continue mbz stated even siege at this point will not change

interagency and with our mtcr partners mbz nodded in understanding we are patient he then added i hope the iranians give us time they are aggressive and are moving fast mbz also mentioned that there were several other countries offering uavs to the uae ambassador added that the us and the other 33 mtcr members would be meeting in march to review the mtcr control list growing demand worldwide for unmanned aerial vehicles had led to the need for general discussion of how the mtcr controls uavs and cruise missiles and the usg looked forward to further discussion of uae defense requirements and

affairs advisor to the crown princes court yousef alotaiba who is uae representative to the gsd 7 s comment although mbz is increasingly talking tough on iran ie stop iran by all means possible and deal with iran sooner rather than later ref his comments should also be taken in the context of strong uae interest in acquiring advanced military technology and specifically mbzs repeated requests for predator b ref b the uaeg is clearly nervous about any us actions that could upset their much larger and militarily superior neighbor the uaes significant trade relationship with iranapproximately 4 billionis another complicating factor in the relationship on more than one occasion the uae leadership has expressed trepidation over the prospect of being caught in the middle between the us and
