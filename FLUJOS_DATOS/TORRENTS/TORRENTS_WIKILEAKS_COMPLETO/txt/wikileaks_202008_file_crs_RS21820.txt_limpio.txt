iraq us regime change efforts and postsaddam governance background the bush administration had initially made the end of the us occupation contingent on the completion of new constitution and the holding of national elections for new government tasks to be completed by 2005 however political infighting among iraqs various ethnic and political factions coupled with persistent insurgency slowed progress on setting up an elected political structure the us administrator in iraq l paul bremer head of the usled occupation authority the coalition provisional authority or cpa in consultation with iraqis appointed to 25seat iraq governing council igc agreed to plan that would lead to sovereignty for iraq by june 30 2004 under the plan announced november 15 2003 transitional administrative law tal provisional constitution was to be signed by february 29 2004 followed by the holding of local caucuses in each province to select national assembly by may 31 2004 the assembly was to choose an executive leadership the agreement encountered opposition from the revered shiite muslim leader grand ayatollah ali sistani who called for early direct elections his views prompted the cpa to ask the united nations to assess the feasibility of holding elections for an interim government team led by envoy lakhdar brahimi concluded in february 2004 that national elections could not be held earlier than late 2004 or early 2005 sistani accepted that time frame the transition roadmap congressional research service the library of congress crs2 much of the brahimi findings were incorporated into the tal which the igc formally signed on march 8 20041 its key points are as follows transition government is to be formed chosen by 250seat national assembly elected in vote later than january 31 2005 the assembly is to choose presidency council president and two deputy presidents it is expected that the president would be shiite and the two deputies sunni arab and kurd the presidency council is to operate by consensus including in naming prime minister the election law for the transition government shall aim to achieve the goal of having women constitute less than onequarter of the members of the national assembly the kurds maintain their autonomous kurdistan regional government but they were not given control of the city of kirkuk and they received some powers to contradict or alter the application of iraqi httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21820 law in the kurdish provinces the kurdish militias peshmerga are allowed to continue to operate the transition government postjanuary 31 2005 is to draft constitution by august 15 2005 and put it to national vote by october 15 2005 provision which sistani and the shiite islamists oppose allows twothirds of the voters any three iraqi provinces to veto the constitution giving the kurds who control the three northern provinces of dohuk irbil and sulaymaniyah essentially veto if the constitution is approved in the national referendum elections to new government are to take place by december 15 2005 and the government is to take office by december 31 2005 if the constitution is not approved it is to be redrafted and submitted again for approval and if approved elections are to take place in 2006 the tal states that islam is the official religion of iraq and is to be considered source but not the only source or the primary source of legislation it adds that law can be passed that contradicts the agreed tenets of islam but neither can any law contradict the fundamental rights provided for in the tal those rights include peaceful assembly free expression equality of men and women before the law and the right to strike and demonstrate interim postjune 30 government the tal did not address how an interim government which will be in office from july 1 2004 until january 31 2005 would be chosen some options for selecting the interim government were considered including holding traditional assembly along the lines of afghanistans loya jirga holding 1 the text of the tal can be obtained from the cpa website httpcpairaqorg governmenttalhtml crs3 smaller roundtable of iraqi notables or transforming the existing or an expanded igc into the interim government continuing violence in iraq contributed to the us decision to give envoy brahimi substantial responsibility for selecting the interim government2 brahimi said he envisioned an interim government of technocrats who presumably would not seek to use their official positions to further their chances in january 2005 national elections however maneuvering by igc and cabinet members led to inclusion of many of them or their political allies in the interim government named on june 1 2004 few of the cabinet positions are held by relatively nonpolitical personalities the interim government began working immediately brahimi has said publicly that pressure by us and iraqi politicians to complete the interim government on time caused him to acquiesce to many of the appointments the composition and powers of the interim government are addressed in an addendum to the tal signed by the igc on june 1 2004 just before the igc dissolved itself the interim government has presidency composed of largely ceremonial president former igc member and shammar tribal elder ghazi alyawar and two deputy presidents ibrahim aljafari of the dawa party and kurdistan democratic party activist dr rowsch shaways there is prime minister iraq national accord leader httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21820 iyad alallawi deputy prime minister 26 ministers two ministers of state with portfolio and three ministers of state without portfolio the prime minister has executive power six members of the interim government are women some of the ministers were held over from the occupation period hoshyar zebari top kdp official remained foreign minister dr mehdi alhafidh an independent shiite remained minister of planning patriotic union of kurdistan puk official dr abdul latif rashid stayed minister of water resources and ms nasreen berwari kurd affiliated with the kdp stayed minister of public works resolution 1546 many of the powers and responsibilities of the interim government are spelled out in security council resolution 1546 adopted unanimously on june 8 2004 which endorsed the handover of sovereignty its major provisions are the following after the handover us officials longer have final authority on non security related issues the united states and united nations intend that the interim government not make any longterm laws or decisions its primary function is to run the ministries and prepare for national elections the kurds fear that the interim government will repeal aspects of the tal that the kurds view as protecting them from the arab majority3 fear that was heightened by the omission from resolution 1546 of any mention of the tal that omission was reportedly at the behest of pressure from sistani and his shiite allies who want to remove from the tal limitations on majority rule prime minister allawi has tried to defuse this dispute by promising that the interim government would not undo the relevant provisions of the tal 2 chandrasekaran rajiv envoy urges unchosen iraqi government washington post apr 15 2004 3 filkins dexter kurds threaten to walk away from iraqi state new york times june 9 2004 crs4 according to the resolution and the addendum to the tal later in july conference of over 1000 iraqis the 1000 will be chosen by 60 member commission of iraqis is to be held and it is to choose 100seat advisory council interim national council to the interim government this body will not have legislative authority but according to the addendum to the tal it will be able to veto decisions by the executive branch with twothirds majority members of the igc who are not in the interim government are to be included in the council one of the major debates in the adoption of resolution 1546 was on security issues particularly the relationship between coalition forces and the iraqi interim government the operational relationship to be one of coordination and partnership is outlined in an exchange of letters between secretary of state powell and prime minister allawi annexed to the resolution the resolution says that the coalitions mandate would be reviewed at the request of the government of iraq or twelve months from the date of this resolution that the mandate would expire when httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21820 permanent government is sworn in at the end of 2005 and that the mandate could be terminated at any time if the interim government so requests the iraqi government was not given veto over specific coalition operations and the coalition retains the ability to take prisoners resolution 1546 gives the interim government control over iraqs oil revenues and the development fund for iraq dfi subject to monitoring for at least one year by the unmandated international advisory and monitoring board the interim government also is given responsibility for final closeout of the unrun oilforfood program other preparations for handover the following additional decisions or events were part of the handover4 bremer departed iraq on june 28 2004 right after the handover and the cpa ceased to exist large us embassy opened on june 30 2004 headed by ambassador john negroponte and it is being staffed with about 1000 us personnel including about 160 us officials and representatives that will serve as advisers to the interim government some cpa functions such as the advising of local iraqi governments local iraqi governing councils and us military units were retained at the us embassy in the form of an iraq reconstruction and management office irmo about 150 us personnel will serve at several centers around iraq to advise local iraqi governments 4 information in this section was obtained from various press reports the text of may 11 2004 national security presidential

that largely because of ongoing violence us forces will number about 140000 into 2005 and possibly beyond us and coalition forces continue to build iraqs security institutions but us officials say the iraqi forces are not able to maintain security on their own the program management office pmo which reports to the department of defense and administers some us funds for iraq will be replaced by project and contracting office the upsurge of violence since early april 2004 has reportedly slowed obligation of reconstruction funds as of july 2004 about 8 billion of 23 billion in appropriated reconstruction funds had been obligated legal issues of the handover number of legal issues are likely to arise the actual extent of the interim httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21820 governments sovereignty or its lawful control over its own territory to the general exclusion of other states is unclear as are the continuing coalition responsibilities laws and agreements put in place during the occupation may be challenged placing the validity of legal contracts and property interests public or private in some doubt the status of coalition forces remaining in iraq has changed somewhat as discussed below interpreting resolutions 1483 1511 and 1546 two sources of international law have governed the occupation of iraq security council resolutions in particular resolution 1483 of may 22 and resolution 1511 of october 16 2003 and international treaties such as the hague regulations of 1907 and the fourth geneva convention of 1949 under these treaties and other sources forming the international law of belligerent occupation an occupying power must maintain existing laws and governmental structure unless absolutely prevented by the exigencies of occupation and any such changes are temporary on the other hand resolution 1483 appears to contemplate an overhaul of iraqi institutions even as it reiterates the applicability of international occupation law resolution 1483 may be read to provide certain carveouts from that law allowing initiatives that might otherwise exceed the authority of an occupying power resolution 1546 recognizes that the interim government has only temporary and limited power noting that even as the interim government assumes full responsibility for governing iraq it is to refrain from taking any actions affecting iraqs destiny beyond the limited interim period until an elected transitional government of iraq assumes office in effect resolution 1546 appears to substitute the iraqi interim government for the cpa as temporary governing authority until an internationally recognized representative government is established but it appears that some of the cpas obligations and authority do not pass to the interim government and will remain instead with the united states as head of the mnf obligations that were made under explicit approval such as the oilforfood program or the dfi are expressly made 5 hendren john and richard serrano pentagon intends to replace ground commander in iraq angeles times may 25 2004 crs6 binding on the interim government if iraq exercises full sovereignty as that concept is ordinarily understood the interim government could conceivably revoke or amend the tal notwithstanding provision in the tal that allows only limited amendment during the second phase of the transition despite language in resolution 1511 recognizing limited and temporary sovereignty in the cpa and the igc both entities arguably lacked the clear authority to bind iraq to any agreements outlasting the formal occupation of iraq cpa laws laws put in place by the cpa are to remain in force during the transitional period unless rescinded or amended during the second phase of the transition the united states does not however retain any authority to interpret and enforce those laws although resolution 1546 admonishes the interim government to refrain from any actions that would affect iraqs postinterim period destiny it is not clear whether temporary laws put in place by the cpa are automatically protected the interim government could conceivably choose to rescind such laws or agreements and decline to honor or enforce any obligations created pursuant to them for example if cpa orders authorizing foreign investment in iraq were to be rescinded or modified the interests of foreign investors could be adversely affected httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21820 status of military forces it appears that the mnf is operating under mandate with the consent of the iraqi government rather than as occupying forces resolution 1546 reaffirms at the request of the interim government the authorization for the mnf to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq including by preventing and deterring terrorism until elections can be held under the letter from secretary powell annexed to resolution 1546 these measures include combat operations against insurgents internment where necessary for imperative reasons of security and the continued search for weapons that threaten iraqs security notably the mandate is to be ended at the request of the iraqi government although res 1546 recognizes the end of the occupation of iraq it nonetheless notes that the mnf is committed to promoting security and stability in accordance with international law including obligations under international humanitarian law ordinarily international humanitarian law would longer apply at the end of military occupation the resolutions leave ambiguous which of the responsibilities of an occupying power under the laws of war were to apply both during the occupation and afterward some observers have suggested that iraq remains under facto occupation and that all relevant international continues to apply status of forces agreement will not be possible until the second phase of the transition because only the iraqi transitional government will have the authority to bind iraq to treaties at present coalition forces in iraq are immune from iraqi legal process under cpa order 17 which has been extended for the duration of the mnfs presence however sovereign iraq even under an interim government could assert the authority to revoke the immunity
