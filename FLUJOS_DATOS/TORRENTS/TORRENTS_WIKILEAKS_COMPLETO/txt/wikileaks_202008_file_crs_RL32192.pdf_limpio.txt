and inland waterways an overview of federal financing introduction to the us commercial navigation system harbors and waterways are significan t part of the nations transportation system more than 900 deep and shallo w draft harbor proj ects are estimated to handle foreign trade representing 25 of the nations economic activity the inland waterway system carries onesixth of the national volume of intercity cargo primarily via nearly 12000 miles of commerciallyac tive inland and intracoastal waterways in addition to its commercial role the u s navigation system also supports the mobilization of the military the us army corps of engineers develops and maintains much of the system for the federal government1 the navigation system in the united stat today evolved largely out of the federal governments interest in improving interstate and international commerce the maritime transportation syst em remains dynamic because of evolving uses of the system eg which cargoes are transporte d and to what final destinations and evolving national priorities and values eg rivers increasingly valued for recreational uses and eco system benefits the federal government continues to inve st in navigation because of its benefit to the national economy the distribution of cost between the federal government and the local project sponsor ie the co stshare for harbors and waterways was established in the water resources velopment act wrda of 1986 pl 99 662 nonetheless how the costs are allo cated between the federal government and private beneficiaries conti nues to be debated recen tly various proposals would change how some harbor and waterway ex penses are shared and funded also the federal investment in the construction and main tenance of specific projects has come under scrutiny by environmental and taxp ayer advocacy groups because of the continuing congressional role in authorizing and funding specific projects as well as establishing navigation policies it is useful to review the current funding sources of navigation infrastructure recent proposals to change federal funding and issues shaping the congressional debate about th future federal role in harbors and waterways controversial aspects of th harbor maintenance tax are discussed elsewhere see crs report rl31264 harbor maintenance funding by john f frittellihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32192crs2 inland waterway and harbor financing prior to 1986 harbor and in land waterway infrastructur was almost entirely federal expense congress through wrda 1986 fundamentally transformed the financing of corps water projects including its commercial navigation projects the act established costshare requirements for harbor and inland waterway projects that resulted in greater financial and decision making role for nonfe deral stakeholders such as port authorities the maximum federal share of costs for harbor and inland waterway projects are shown in table 1 the remaining expenses are paid by non federal project sponsors federal spendi ng on inland waterway construction averages 200 million annually on harbor construction it ranges from 150 million to 300 million annually with the variation largel due to activity on few large harbor deepening projects eg new york and new jersey harbor houstongalveston navigation channels and oakland harbor major rehabilitation is typically considered construction activity and the costs are shared according to construction costshare arrangements navigation channel dredging to maintain the channel at its congressionallyauthorized depth and width is considered maintenance cost in contrast the deepening of navigation cha nnels is costshared as construction project operation and maintenance m expenses for the inland waterway system average around

responsibility as shown in table 1 50 of the federal monies are from the iwtf and 50 from th federal general re venue fund the iwtf monies derive from fuel tax imposed on vessels engaged in commercial waterway transportation on signated waterways plus investment interest on the balance2 the fund was originally authoriz ed under the inland waterways revenue act of 1978 pl 95502 as currently authorized in 1404 of wrda 1986 the tax is 20 cents per gallon and is collected by the internal revenue service in contrast to the iwtf which is used for construction expenses the hmtf historically has been limited to financing 100 of expenditure for operation and maintenance of federallyauthorized channels for commercial navigation3 t h hmtf does not cover the om expenses for facilities that are part of the inland waterways fuel tax system scribed above that is the use of the hmtf has been largely limited to funding om expenses fo r access channels to deepdraft harbors and for shallowdraft wate rways and harbors not subject to the fuel tax4 historically the hmtf has been limited to expenditures for maintenance dredging and excludes channel deepening projects the hmtf was authorized by wrda 1986 to date the hmtf has provided for the om of more than 650 commercial navigation projects maintained by the federal government the hmtf monies derive from receipts of 0125 ad valorem ie percent of value tax imposed upon commerc ial users of specified ports5 the tax revenues are collected by us customs and transferred to the hmtf this tax has been highly contentious and is now applied only to imports domestic shipments and cruise line passengers at designated ports exports have been exempt from the tax since the us supreme court found that th tax on exports violated the export clause of the constitution6 the tax as currently applied continues to be contentious for example the european union sees the current application of the tax as discriminatory import tariff that violates us obligations under the world tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32192crs4 7 for more information on the hmtf and the tax supporting it see crs report rl31264 harbor maintenance funding by john f

milusersboardu bar2003finalpdforganization while the federal government represents it as user fee consequently many view the current tax as shortterm measure until longterm revenue source is devised7 dispersals from inland waterway and rbor maintenance trust funds require annual appropriation by congre ss spending from the trust funds is considered part of the corps budget and is subject to th congressional budget ceiling for energy and water development appropriations becau congress has appropriated less than collections have been the iwtf and hmtf have built up authorized unappropriated balances since the early 1990s the inland waterways users board an 11 member advisory committee made up of barge and towboat operators and shippers established by wrda 1986 to advise the corps on constructi on and rehabilitation priorities argues that the iwtfs growing balance is not due to lack of needed construction but results from what it believes are insuffici ent appropriations by the federal government for wate rway construction projects8 port industry groups similarly argue that the hmtfs growing balance is the result of insufficient appropriations for har bor maintenance other stake holders argue that congressional appropriations reflect the national interest and that the current balance in the trust funds should be put to use by expanding th scope of activities ligible for iwtf and hmtf monies recent financing proposals bush administrations proposal in its fy2004 budget request the administration set out proposal for expandi ng the types of activ ities covered by the hmtf and the iwtf with the intent of reducing the general re venues used to pay for the maritime transportation system under the administrations proposal for fy2004 the iwtf would have financed 25 of the om cost of eight waterways that have averaged annually more than fi ve billion tonmiles of traffic over the past five years and 50 of the om cost fo r the other 20 waterways in the inland and intracoastal waterway system the iwtf th erefore would have been used not only for construction but also for om the administrations proposal would have increased the amount spent from the trust fund from 104 million in fy2002 and an estimated 84 million in fy2003 to 256 million in fy2004 110 million for construction and 146 million for om according to the presidents fy2004 budget documents the increased withdrawal would have reduced the iwtf balance from an estimated 433 million at the end of fy2003 to 287 million at the end of fy2004 the inland waterways user boar d calculated that the administrations proposal would empty the fund in three years if current collections were maintained the board also expressed concerns that th is proposal would eventually lead to dramatic increase in the fuel taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32192crs5 9 green scissors 2003 by friends of the earth taxpayers for common sense and us continuedunder the administrations proposal for fy2004 the hmtf would have financed all federal costs associated with the construction of coastal ports and channels the administrations proposal w ould have increased the use of the trust fund from 653 million in fy2002 and an estimated 769 million in fy2003 to 826 million in fy2004 212 million for construction and 600 million for om port and river trade groups responded quickly to the fy2004 budget request with criticisms that the administration was ra iding these funds for an unprecedented use of the money that had not been endorsed by the users paying the fees they also expressed concern about the impact of th is expansion on om spending one of their primary arguments against the expanded use of the hmtf was that the federal government would be covering all of its fiscal respons ibilities for harbors through trust fund financed by user s even though har bors provide national benefits the increased withdrawal would not have caused the hmtf balance to drop since revenues are expected to be 880 million in fy2004 neither the house nor the senate included the pres idents proposal in appropriations bills for fy2004 proposed gislation the administrations proposal for the trust funds appears to be in the opposite direction of the language passed by the house in hr 2557 the water resources developmen t act of 2003 rela ted to harbors section 2003 of hr 2557 would increase th depth of projects eligible for the federal costshare of 65 for construction and 100 for om from 45 feet to 53 feet the harbor projects with dept hs between 45 and 53 feet would require additional federal gene ral revenue appropriations for construction from 40 to 65 and for om from 50 to 100 this would increase the demand for general revenue appropriations for construction and the dema nd for funds from the hmtf for om according to the bill language the change would be applied to projects for which contract for physical construc tion has not been awarded before the date of enactment of this act although both the proposed legislation and the ad ministrations proposal would likely put greater amount of the hmtf monies to use the impact on general revenues would likely be opposite the administrations proposal would likely decrease the draw on general revenues by substituting hmtf for general revenue appropriations while the proposed legisl ation would likely increase demand for general revenue funds by reducing the fi scal demands on nonfederal sponsors the proposed legislation however would likely l ead to greater investment in navigation infrastructure and the anticipated economic benefits of those investments the conflicting signals from the two proposals refl ect the larger debate about the future federal role in the maritime transportation system issues shaping the future financing of harbors and inland waterways the two proposals discussed above bring attention to the underlying question of what is the appropriate role for the federal government in maritime transportation investments9 navigation industry groups argue that the current system makes ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32192crs6 9 continued public interest research group provides an example of the arguments made to change current practices and investments in the navi gation system the document is available at httpwwwgreenscissorsorg publicationsgs2003pdf the arguments to maintain current investment levels or to increase investment levels are made by industry groups some examples of these groups and the informati on they provide are the midwest area river coalition 2000 at http wwwmarc2000or g and the american association of port authorities at http wwwaapapor tsorggovrelationsresourcesindexhtmlsignificant contribution to the national economy and that the aging infrastructure warrants increased investment by the federal government some taxpayer advocacy groups however oppose even current levels of federal investment and argue for greater share of the financial burden to be borne by the users of these facilities environmental groups also oppose many i ndividual projects because of possible environmental harm from the projects and fro m the disposal of the dredged material to maintain the harbor and waterway channels for example these groups question if segments of the inland waterway system with lower cargo movement such as the apalachicolachattahoochee flint river project should be managed for purposes other than navigation because current ope rations harm the environment limit other uses and are economically unjustified taxpayer advocacy and environmental groups have also criticized the project development and evaluation process that the corps uses for harbor and inland waterway projects specifically they have criticized the economic analyses justifying federal investments in navigation projects such as the delaware river deepening and the upper mississippi navigation study s upporters of these projects argue that the projects are economically justified that the economics of maritime transportation is complicated both to model and to understa nd and that the us consumer is the ultimate beneficiary of these investments there are also disputes over planning efforts on how best to allocate federal investments for example some observers are interested in optimizing federal spending through systemwide planning of harbor deepening projects that are necessary to accommodate the larger containe r ships being adopted planning efforts of this sort however are opposed by those arguing that the federal government should not be deciding which ports are go ing to be the winners and the losers in attracting these container ships overall the challenges that the navigation system is facing grow out of the current clima of fiscal responsibility and government accountability and the evolving perception of the nations harbor s and waterways as natural resources as well as transportation routes
