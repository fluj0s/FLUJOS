uranium and plutonium from irradiated nuclear fuel the world war iiera manhattan project developed reprocessing technology in the effort to build the first atomic bomb with the development of commercial nuclear power after the war reprocessing was considered necessary because of perceived scarcity of uranium breeder reactor technology which transmutes nonfissionable uranium into fissionable plutonium and thus prod uces more fuel than consumed was envisioned as promising solution to extending the nuclear fuel supply commercial reprocessing attempts however encountered technical economic and regulatory problems in response to concern that reprocessing contributed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons president carter terminated federal support for commercial reprocessing reprocessing for defense purposes continued however until the soviet unions collapse brought an end to the cold war and the production of nuclear weapons the department of energys latest initiative to promote new reactor technology using proliferationresistant reprocessed fuel raises significant funding and policy issues for congress us policies that have authorized and discouraged nuclear reprocessing are summarized below g343g351g346g348g561 the atomic energy act of 1946 pl 79585 defined fissionable materials to include plutonium uranium235 and other materials determined to be capable of releasing substantial quantities of energy through nuclear fission1 the act also created the atomic energy commission aec and transferred production and control of fissionable materials from the manhattan project as the exclusive producer of fissionable material the aec originally retained title to all such material for national security reasons g343g351g347g346g561 congress amended the atomic energy act authorized the aec to license commercial reactors and eased restrictions on private companies using special nuclear material fissionable material section 183 terms of licenses of

buffalo ny the plant operated from 1966 until 1972 reprocessing spent fuel from the defense weapons program 3 commercial spent fuel was never reprocessed stricter regulatory requirements forced the

ge applied for and received license to store spent fuel 7 g343g351g349g346g561 the aec determined that any decision to permit nuclear fuel reprocessing on large scale would require an environmental

decision that the reprocessing and recycling of plutonium should not proceed unless there is sound reason to conclude that the world community can ffectively overcome the associated risks of proliferation that the united states should longer regard reprocessing of used nuclear fuel to produce plutonium as necessary and inevitable step in the nuclear fuel cycle and that we should pursue reprocessing and recycling in the future only if they are found to be consistent with our international objectives 8 with that announcement agencies of the executive branch were directed to delay commercialization of reprocessing activities in the united states until uncertainties were resolved 7 comptroller general federal facilities for storing spent nuclear fuelare they needed june 27 1979

carter announced we will defer indefinitely the commercial reprocessing and recycling of pl utonium produced in the us nuclear power programs9 he went on to say the plant at barn well south carolina will receive neither federal encouragement nor funding for its completion as reprocessing facility it was actually carters veto of s 1811 the erda authorizat ion act of 1978 that prevented the legislative authorization necessary for constructing breeder reactor and reprocessing facility10 g343g351g349g349g561 the nrc issued an order terminating the proceedings on the generic environmental statement on mixed oxide fuel and most license proceedings relating to plutonium recycling11 it stated however that it would reexamine this decision after two studies of alternative fuel cycles were completed g343g351g349g350g561 the nuclear nonproliferation act pl 95242 march 10 1978 amended the atomic energy act of 1954 to establish export licensing criteria that govern peaceful nuclear exports by the united states including requirement of prior us approval for retransfers and reprocessing and guaranty that material retransferred will be reprocessed without prior us consent

atomic energy community euratom to continue to march 10 1981 despite the agreements lack of provision consistent with the intent of the nuclear nonproliferation act requiring prior us approval for

reprocessing of plutonium subject to us control as national security decision directive 39 june 4 1982 although specific details of the directive have not been declassified the policies approved pertain to the nonproliferation and statutory conditions for safeguards and physical security for continued commitment by japan to nonproliferation efforts g343g351g351g342g561 in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1991 pl 101510 sec 3142 congress declared under findings and declaration of policy that at the present time the united states is observing facto moratorium on the production of fissile materials with production of highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons since 1964 while the united states has ceased operation of all of its reactors used for the production of plutonium for nuclear weapons the soviet union currently operates as many as nine reactors for the production of pluton ium for nuclear weapons also under sec 3143bilateral moratorium on production of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons and disposal of nuclear st ockpiles the law urged an end by both the united states and the soviet union to the production of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons in its fullest sense plutonium production implies reprocessing g343g351g351g344g561 president g h w bush disapproved long island power authoritys attempt to

its existing commitments regarding the use of plutonium in civil nuclear programs in western europe and japan 16 g343g351g351g347g561 on november 29 1995 new nuclear cooperation agreement with euratom was submitted to congress although the clinton administration determined it met all the requirements of section 123 of the atomic energy act some members believed it did not meet the requirement of

announced that it will initiate work toward conducting an engineering scale demonstration of the urex separation process operation planned for 2011 and developing an advanced fuel cycle facility

develop proliferation resistant nuclear technologies in association with the global nuclear energy partnership gnep for expanding nuclear power in the united states and around the world the department
