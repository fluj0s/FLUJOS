of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets and compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subagreements iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on 2003 and 2004 programm activities under projects 03 04abcmrcm200 with expenditure of us 16 milli on our review concentrated on the activities implemented by croix rouge camerounaise crc local ngo implementing partner expenditure of us 06 million we also reviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of us 06 million 2 7 the audit reviewed the administration of th representation with administrative expenditure totalling us 04 million for the years 2003 and 2004 and assets with an acquisition value of us 08 million and current value of us 02 million the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in cameroon was 10 8 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of crc 9 for crc reasonable assurance could be take n that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements 10 an audit certificate covering the 2003 sub project was available with an unqualified opinion 11 oios found that crc had accounting syst em in place for the recording of and reporting on unhcr project expenditures cash paym ents were manually recorded in notebooks with analysis of the expenditure th spmrs were prepared on the basis of manual calculations of the various payment vouchers in addition budget monitoring system was in place which resulted in numerous budgetary overruns often in excess of 100 percent of the budget line the final spmrs were however rec onciled to the results of the manual calculations made for each budget line 12 oios assessed that the monitoring of payme nts was not always adequate for example in the area of medical referrals which accounted for over 25 percent of the 2003 project budget the expenditure was not verifiedcertified prior to pay ment consequently inaccuracies were noted in some invoices sometimes resulting in an overpa yment also proper segregation of duties was not achieved as key incompatible functions wer exercised by the accountant including record keeping bank reconciliation petty cash cus tody cash payments etc with supervisory verification and approval oios advised that stron g supervisory controls should be implemented including documented cash verification b other programme issues 13 oios assessed that project financial monit oring was generally well performed project visits were carried out and monitoring reports wer available oios assessed however that the representation was heavily involved in the daytod ay filing of crcs project supporting documentation and report preparation which in our view risks to blur the distinction between self implementation and implementation by partners in addition the lack of basic accounting system compounded with weak internal controls shoul d have been noted by the representation and corrective actions taken accordingly the representation explained that it does not invo lve itself in the daytoday management of crc but tha t given that crc was its only implementing 3 partner it ensured that funds were adequately mana ged through regular financial monitoring visits the representation also indicated that an accounting firm would install an automated accounting system at crc c supply management procurement 14 unhcr procurement procedures were generall adhered to though some improvement was required local committee on contracts lcc had not been established since the re opening of the unhcr office in 2003 though various instances of local procurement would have required approval by an lcc this was the case for instance for contract of some us 62000 awarded in december 2003 for the drilling of wells or for schools materials also procured in december 2003 for some us 22000 with evide nce of any competitive bidding 15 for those instances where competitive bidd ing was carried out the requests for quotations did not give clear specifications of the goods whi ch resulted in offers of dissimilar items for example generator was procured in november 2003 for some us 15000 the request for quotation did not specify the type make and power of the generator consequently the offers received were either for 9 11 or 13 kva depending on the supplier which did not allow their evaluation in consistent manner 16 the representation explained that while lcc had been established since the re opening of the unhcr office in 2003 the selected s uppliers came from the undps vendor database the representation further indicated tha t an lcc is now in place and that the unhcr procurement procedures would be adhered to in the future b asset management 17 the assettrak system was not up to date the current asset data pertained to assets existing prior to the closing of the unhcr office i n cameroon in 2002 which included assets in the custody of former implementing partners long er in the country further physical inventory was carried out in 2003 and in 2004 oio s found that the reported net book values of those assets recorded in the assettrak system were inaccurate as depreciation had been calculated though most of the assets were procured several years back 18 oios also found that the representation d not established local asset management board lamb in one instance the office took the decision to repair an accident vehicle at cost of over us 3000 such case normally falls under the authority of the headquarters asset management board hamb according to the rules and procedures governing the asset management boards in the case of accidents repair costs in excess of us 3000 are authorized by the hamb or the ramb the representation explained that it has now conduc ted physical inventory of its assets at the various sites and t hat the asset data is being consolidated regarding the repair cost over the vehicle authoris ed threshold of us 3000 the representation explained that authorisation was sought from hqs given that the initial cost estimate of the repair was less than the threshold it added that lamb has now been established 4 d security and safety 19 minimum operational security standards moss had been developed for cameroon though security assessment was carried out hence compliance with moss could not be assessed oios noted however that the physical s ecurity of the unhcr office needed some improvement there was only one common entrance to the office for both staff and refugees and access controls were lax despite serious recent curity threats by refugees which involved extensive damage to unhcr assets though the secu rity guards were equipped with metal detectors these were often not put to use 20 oios also noted that the current office pr emise had perimeter fence and that the walls were very low and could easily be jumped over oio s did not obtain evidence that security assessment had been carried out prior to moving to the new premises the representative explained that the fsa had orally approved the offi ce building further the office was not equipped with smokefire detectors there were vacuation drills and the only unhcr vehicle used for incountry travels was not equipped with codan radio despite frequent reported attacks the representation explained that plans have been m ade to enhance the security of the office premises and that this would be taken into account in the august 2005 budgetary revision the representation subsequently indicated that tho ugh it was declared moss compliant in the july 2005 dss report it is aware of the fact that unhcr security standards are not fully complied with it further indicated that funds have now been obtained to enhance security administration 21 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr representation in cameroon generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures there was need however to strengthen internal controls delegation of authority chart not available 22 the unhcr delegation of financial signing authority iom 672000 fom 692000 dated 9 september 2000 had not yet been implemented the representative authorizedapproved his own entitlements including travel claims clai ms for hospitality costs extended assignment grant etc similarly united nations volunteer managing the unhcr antennae in the field prepared authorized and approved his own travel au thorization and travel claims with involvement by the representation office oios reco mmended that proper administrative and financial procedures be implemented to strengthen i nternal controls 23 according to the representation prior to the closu re of the unhcr office in cameroon in 2001 the delegation of authority chart had been preparedsigned and submitted to then regional office in abidjan the representation ind icated that it would reprint those documents and submit them to treasury however oios wishes to point out that the said do cument does longer reflect the current incumbent positions and signatures and would need to be updated also the concept of the delegation of financial si gning authority should not be confused with that of bank signatories the representation should ref er to the specific provisions contained in iom 672000 fom 692000 dated 9 september 2000 for f urther clarifications oios is concerned that the staff of unhcr cameroon is operating witho ut proper delegation of financial authority and urges the representation to regularize the situ ation 5 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in cameroon should comply with the relevant provisions of iom 672000 fom 69200 0 dated 9 september 2000 on the unhcr delegation of financial signing authority and prepare the delega tion of authority chart which reflects the current positio ns titles and associated responsibilities rec 01 b extended assignment grant 24 in april 2003 an international staff memb er index 659354 received 30day assignment grant upon arrival at his new duty stati on in yaounde in may 2003 the staff member received dsa totalling some us 8200 for an additi onal 30days as extended assignment grant the payment was however calculated at the full ds rates instead of 60 percent of the applicable dsa rate restricted to the actual hotel cost in june 2003 the staff member again obtained an additional 20day dsa extended assignme nt grant totalling some us 3300 despite the fact that the extension had not been approved b undp according to samm section 3186 the amount of dsa payable during the extended peri od will be equivalent to the actual cost of hotel accommodation but not to exceed 60 of the ap plicable dsa rate payment of the extended dsa will be subject to presentation of rec eipted hotel bills while hotel receipts were available to justify the payment oios calcula ted that on the basis of the then applicable hotel fare the staff member was overpaid some us 5000 oios also calculated that in the absence of proper supporting documents the staff m ember would have to reimburse total of us 11500 25 the representation explained that undp approved the extension of stay of the staff member in hotel and that while the hotel invoice s could not be found certificate had been obtained from the hotel confirming the duration of the stay the representation further indicated that the staff member has reimbursed the overpayme nt of us 5000 evidence of the reimbursement and hotel certificate has been submit ted to oios c rental advances 26 the rules for granting rental advances to international staff were not always adhered to staff member obtained tenmonth rental advance ver us 9000 while the lease agreement only required threemonth advance payment some u s 2800 there was justification for the additional periods and evidence of payment to the landlord also rental advance was made for the payment of twomonth deposit us 1 900 according to iom4397 amendment 1 dated 17 september 1997 rental depos its are not considered rental advances if rental deposits exceed two months rent rental ad vance may be given only for the difference in excess of two months ie the total of the rental deposit less two months in addition oios noted that the representative approved his own rent advance some us 23000 although the approval of rental advances was delegated to the fi eld in oios view this did not imply that the representative could approve his own advances the representation stated that the advances were timely reimbursed by the concerned staff and indicated that the errors made in interpreting the rules on rental advances have been noted and t hat relevant rules would be complied with in the future 6 v acknowledgement
