included in egtrra so that the bill would comply with the senates byrd rule3 the byrd rule applies only to reconciliation legislation reconciliation is an optional procedure sometimes used by congress to implement budget resolution policies on reve nues and mandatory spending if so directed by the budget resolution house and senate committ ees must develop legislation changing laws within their jurisdiction sufficient to achieve the required budgetary changes the legislative recommendations of each committee usually are merged into an omnibus reconciliation bill wh ich is considered under expe dited procedures under the byrd rule point of order may be ra ised to strike extraneous matter from or prevent it from being offered to reconciliation gislation motion to waive the byrd rule requires the affirmative vote of th reefifths of the senate membership 60 votes the byrd rule provides six definitions of what constitutes extraneous matter for purposes of the rule one of thos definitions declares provision to be extraneous if it would decrease revenues in fiscal year after the fiscal years covered by the reconciliation legislati on and such decreases are greater than outlay reductions or revenue increases resulting from other provisions in such title in such year4 consequently point of order may be raised in the senate to strike or prevent the offering of any proposal for tax cut that is not offset by spending cut andor revenue increase of equal ma gnitude in each year beyond the budget window covered by the reconciliation bill the byrd rule could restrict efforts to extend the reducti on or repeal of the estate and gift taxes beyond 2010 through the budget reconciliation process the reconciliation instructions in the fy2006 budget resolution approved by the house and senate did not extend beyond fy2010 60vote waiver of the byrd rule would be required if the projected re venue losses in year s beyond 2010 were not adequately offset in order to avoid the byrd rule altogether bills to permanently reduce or repeal the estate and gift taxes or any other taxes for that matter could be considered under regular legislative

estates some would have forgiven the estate tax on familyowned businesses and farms but imposed carryover basis in calculating the capital gain if the heir later sold the business some would have repealed the modified carryover basis instituted by egtrra and returned to the stepup in basis rule for assets transferred at death one would have deposited revenues from the tate tax into the social

1 the relatively modest estimated re venue losses from fy2006 through fy2010 stem primarily from projected decline in gift tax revenues the estimates were based on the assumption that taxpayers would immediately begin to reduce taxable gifts during their lifetimes if they knew that the estate tax would be permanently repealed in 2010 in addition the treasur department and the jct projected that the enactment in 2006 of permanent repeal of the estate tax effective in 2010 would modestly affect revenues from the individua l income tax in two different ways first they assumed that lifetime ch aritable donations and accompanying tax deductions would fall thereby increasing income tax revenues second and larger in size they assumed that capital gains realizations by the elderly would fall the lockin effect would increase thereby decreasing income tax revenues the following discussion compares the treasurys february 2006 estimates with the jcts march 2006 estimates for the years prior

reconcilia tion act of 2001 and the jobs and growth ta x relief and rec onciliation act of 2003 third was whether the repeal of the estate tax was pa rt of fundamental tax reform effort to replace the income tax and possibly the payroll tax with some form of consumption based tax fourth was when perm anent repeal would take effect preserving other changes made by egtrra the taxation of gifts and

this would have had the effect of repealing other changes made by egtrra such as the modified carryover basis trea tment of assets transferre d at death and the modified taxation of gifts repealing

after the continuedmodified gift tax under the provisions of egtrra gift tax is retained even when the estate tax and generationsk ipping transfer tax are repealed in 2010 the main reason given for maintaining the gift tax when the estate tax is repealed is to protect income tax revenues the gift tax is intended to discourage people from giving incomegenerating or appreciated assets to someone in lower income tax bracket andor with offsetting losses in the case of appreciated property the donee could sell the assets and pa lower capital gains tax rate than the donor and then gift or bequeath the sales proceeds back to the original donor if subtitle b of the internal revenue code irc were repealed the gift tax would be repealed along with the estate tax and gst tax however if the sunset clause of egtrra were repealed the gift tax as modified by egtrra would remain in effect after 2010 the cumula tive lifetime exclusion amount for any one donor would be 1 million20 this amount is not inde xed for inflation beyond that gifts up to 500000 would be subject to the same marginal tax rate schedule that had previously applied to both gifts and bequests with marginal tax rates from 18 to 34 starting in 2010 when the tate tax is repealed and continuing thereafter the top gift tax rate would be capped at 35 on cumulative lifetime taxable gifts over 500000 this is in cont rast to maximum tax rate of 45 on gifts or bequests in excess of 15 millio n scheduled for 2007 through 2009 the 35 rate was equal to the maximum tax rate on individual income scheduled by egtrra for tax year 2006 and subsequent years21 the modified gift tax would have continued after 2010 under companion bills hr 8 hulshof and s 420 kyl and bill nelson hr 183 pitts and s 7 kyl in contrast s 988 sessions would have implemented these changes to the gift tax beginning in 2005 and samdt 849 frist to hr 6 beginning in 2006 if the provisions of egtrra are permitted to sunset and we return to prior law the unified estate and gift tax exclus ion would be 1 million the maximum estate and gift tax rate would return to 55 fo r gifts and bequests combined of over 3 million with 5 surtax over the 100 million to 17184 million range modified carryover basis at death for capital gains purposes under the law in place through 2009 nd scheduled to resume in 2011 stepup in basis rule applies to assets transferred at death22 under this rule the cost basis of an asset is set at the value of the asset on the decedents date of death23 if the heir sellshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32818crs11 23 continued date of death if that value is lower 24 for an asset that has decreased in value since the decedent purchased it such as an automobile or stocks or real estate after decline in the market the steppedup basis can be lower than the original cost as consequence of the stepup in basis rule the loss in value during the decedents period or ownershi p cannot be claimed as capital loss when an inherited asset is sold 25 for discussion of this tradeoff written prior to the enactment of egtrra see crs report rl30875 stepup vs carryover basis for cap ital gains implications for estate tax repeal by nonna noto 26 for property acquired from someone dying after december 31 2009 the basis for the person acquiring the property is to be the lesse r of the adjusted basis of the decedent or b the fair market value of the property at the date of the decedents death under both prior law and egtrra property transfe rred by gift has carryover basis 27 this limit may be increased by the amount of unused builtin losses and loss carryovers that the decedent may have had 28 the minimum increments are 100000 for the 13 million amount 6000 for the 60000 amount and 250000 for the 3 million amountthe asset his or her capital gain is calculated as the difference between the sales price and the steppedup basis not the decedents original purchase price called the carryover basis the effect of this practice is to permanently forgive the income tax liability on the increase in value of the sset the capital gain during the decedents period of ownership24 the estate tax is sometimes defended as substitute for the capital gains tax at death25 consistent with this argument an important tradeoff that egtrra made for the repeal of the estate tax in 2010 wa s the return to carryover basis for assets transferred at death26 however two important excep tions were made in what is called modified carryover basis stepup of 13 million in the aggregate per decedent27 is permitted in the original adjusted basis of assets transferred at death 60000 for nonresident aliens an dditional stepup of up to 3 million is permitted for assets transfe rred to surviving spouse these dollar amounts are indexed for inflation28 the executor of the estate is left with the task of allocating the stepup allowance to specific assets note that these figures apply to the net increase in value of the assets not the gross value of the assets thus the 13 milli on stepup might cover all the gains in gross estate valued at 2 million or 3 milli on or more the spousal stepup of 3 million alone could cover the gains in an estate with gross value of 4 million or 5 million or more the practical effect of these two exceptions to carryover basis is to maintain stepup in basis for smaller estates if the sunset provision were repealed with respect to title v of egtrra then the modified carryover basis rules introduced by egtrra would continue in effect after 2010 when the estate tax is permanen tly repealed this would have occurred under companion bills hr 8 hulshof nd s 420 kyl and bill nelson hr 183 pitts and s 7 kyl in contrast s 988 sessions would ve implemented
