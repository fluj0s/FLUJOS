americans with disabilities act 42 usc 12101 et seq provides broa d nondiscrimination protection for individuals with disabilities in employment publi c services public ccommodations and services operated by public entities transportation and telecommunications more specifically at 42 usc 12132 the ada prohibit s discrimination again st persons with disabilities in the provision of public services by state and local governments the department of justice has promulgated regulations whic h state that public entity shall administer services programs and activities in the mos t integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities in1 april 1998 the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit held that the ada and it s regulations prohibited state from confining disabled individuals in state run institutions when those individuals could be appropriately treated in more integrated communit setting the supreme court granted certiorari on december 14 1998 2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20029crs2 court of appeals decision lc by z imring v olmstead supra was an action brought by two patients housed in state psychiatric hospital challenging their continued confinement as failure t provide care in the most integrated setting appropriate and thus violating the ada the plaintiff s prevailed on summary judgment in the district court and the case was the n appealed to the eleventh circuit which affirmed the district courts decision the state argued that the district courts application of the statutory and regulatory language was contrary to the requirement of the ada that the discrimination against an individual with disability be by re ason of such disability the state contended that the plaintiffs did not show that they were denied community placements available t individuals without disabilities because of disability since such placements were t provided for individuals without disabilities the court of appeals observed that reduced to its essence the states argument is that title ii of the ada affords protection t individuals with disabilities who receive public services designed only for individuals with disabilities the court of appeals examined the statutory language and the regulations set forth above and found that by definition where as here the state confines an individual with disability in an institutionalized setting wh community placement is appropriate the state has violated the core principle underlying the adas integration mandate at 897 in addition the legislative history of the ada and the history of section 504 of the rehabil itation act of 1973 29 usc 794 were examined and found to support th holding of the district court the court of appeals also rejected the states claim that the denial of communit placement was due to the states lack of funds not the plaintiffs disabilities the cour t observed that the ada does not require the state to provide services if these service s would require fundamental alteration in its programs however in the situatio n presented the court found th at there was not sufficient evidence to make determination of whether the services sought would require fundamental alteration and so remanded this issue to the district court for further proceedings the limited nature of its ruling was als emphasized by the court olmstead was not class ac tion suit and applied only to the two individuals who had shown that they were qualified for community based program in addition the court of appeals specificall stated we emphasize that our holding does not mandate the deinstitutionalization f individuals with disabilities instead we hold that where as here disabled individuals treating professionals find that communitybased placement is appropriate for tha t individual the ada imposes duty to provide treatment i n community settingthe most integrated setting appropriate to that patients needs where there is such finding on the other hand nothing in the ada re quires the deinstitutionalization of that patient at 902 implications despite the court of appeals lim iting language the decision of the eleventh circuit in olmstead has led to significant controversy twenty two states and the territory of guam filed an amic us brief with the supreme court asking the court to review the elevent h circuits decisi on and stating that

vision is an individual with disability under the adacircuits holding cannot be underestimated this brief contended that the elevent h3 circuits opinion had been rel ied upon in several lawsuits designed to reshape the manner in which services not provided to nondisabled persons are provided by the states to individuals with disabilities in addition the brief argued that the eleventh circuit s4 decision has profound impact on the provision of services in various contexts an d would impose significant cost burden disability advocates have agreed that the decision by the supreme court could b significant but differ on the possible meaning of the decision an attorney who wa s involved in similar lawsuit in pennsylvania was quoted as stating this will be th e5 defining moment for the ada he went on to state that if the supreme court rules in favor of georgia the ada will become mere shell of what it is intended to be stripping away its major civil rights provision integration 6 the supreme courts decision will be only the fourth ada case decided by th court although the court currently has granted certiorari in four other ada cases i n7 addition to olmstead the decision in olmstead could be major ada decision if the8 supreme court decides the case on the issues relating to the requirement of integration although t he court could emphasize the limited nature of the eleventh circuits decision it is probably unlikely that it will avoid the issues in this manner it is somewhat unusual for the supreme court to grant certiorari in case like olms tead where there is conflict between various judic ial circuits and when this occurs the supreme court often reverses the lower courts decision whether this will be the situation in olmstead remains to be seen
