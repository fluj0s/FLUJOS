measures has been one of the fastest gr owing economies in the world the growth has brought an improvement in the standard of living of the average russian citizen and has brought economic stability that russia had not experienced in at least decade this strong performance is majo r factor in the popular support that former president now prime minister putin enjoys some 7080 of the population view him favorably the improvement in the ru ssian economy is also arguably factor in the boldness with which the putin leadersh ip has reasserted russias status as world power challenging the united states europe the other fo rmer soviet states in economic and nati onal security areas the russian economy is highly depende nt on the production and export of oil gas and other natural resources its succe ss has largely been the result of record breaking world energy prices although prude nt fiscal policies have also helped to promote economic stability however il dependence could prove to be double edged sword the putin regimes failure to complete important economic reforms and its penchant for reasse rting government control ove r key economic sectors also loom among the possible roadblocks down the road russias dependence on oil and other weak spots in the economy have been exposed by the 2008 credit crisis and other events although its influence has been greatly diminished

and over 800 in 1993 before it declined to mo re tolerable but still high levels of around 20 by the end of the 1990s the infl ation robbed russian citizens of their savings as the value of the ruble collapsed eventually forcing the russian government to issue new currency on ja nuary 1 1998 with 1 new ruble equaling 1000 old rubles as hedge against infl ation some resident s who were in position to do so invested in hard assets such as art works foreign currencies and real estate but the greater portion of the population saw their savings evaporate the disposable income income available af ter taxes of the average russian declined 25 in real terms between 1993 and 19996 the quality of life of the average russian deteriorated in other terms in 1991 the life expectancy of the average russian male was 64 years and for the average russian woman it was 74 years by 1999 the life expectancy had declined to 59 years for males and 72 for females russia did not perform much better in the foreign sector foreign direct investments were meager given the si ze and needs of the russian economy furthermore russia was incurring seri ous capital flight some 150 billion between 1992 and 1999 by one estimate7 russian foreign debt soared in part because russia had taken on the foreign debts of the entire former soviet union in an arrangement made with the other former soviet states however ru ssia had also incurred its own foreign obligations since the co llapse of the soviet union the economic problems were in part continuation of economic collapse that was factor in the demise of the soviet g overnment the problems were also in part the result of the rapid disintegration of an economic system in which the state guided by the communist party maintained complete control and market forces were an anathema it was system in which the government emphasized heavy industry production regardless of cost and to th detriment of other sectors including agriculture services and consumer indus tries the central planned economy also operated huge production f acilities that proved to be ine fficient not very adaptable to change often producing products of poor quality and not competitive in world markets however the problems were also th product of poorly executed if not poorly conceived economic policies of the yeltsin regime the regime failed to rein in government

finance debt at very high interest rates the yeltsin regime was also criticized for employing shock therapy or radical macroeconomic measures as part of its economic reform program largely attributed to prime minister yegor gaidar critics claimed that the measures unnecessarily created inflation and destabilized the economy because market prices were intr oduced too early in the reform process the most controversial aspect of the early postsoviet economic transition was the effort to privatize st ateowned and operate d production facilities in particular the socalled loans for shares program in 1995 the government auctioned off to local banks shares in 29 of the most poten tially lucrative firms including major oil companies and mineral producers yukos l ukoil sufgutneftegas and novolietsk iron and steel8 the banks would hold the shares as collateral against which they issued loans to the government to finance its ballooning deficits the auctions were controlled by individuals with close ties to the yeltsin regime and whose banks won the bids they obtained the shares at fraction of their market value and were able to keep them when the government failed to pay back the loans the government did not challenge their control of these asse ts because their owners who became known as oligarchs financed yeltsins reelecti on as president in 1996 they used their new wealth to gain control over other interests such as the media the privatization program also resulted in small and diumsized firms owned by those who managed them during the soviet periodthe red directors9 russias economic problems came to head in the financial crisis of august 1998 the crisis proved to be pivotal event in russias transition to market economy it exposed many of the weakne sses of russian econo mic policies and the need for economic reform10 the crisis culminated in august 1998 when the government abandoned its defense of strong ruble it also faulted on official domestic debt forcing its restructuring and imposed 90day mo ratorium on commercial external debt payments the crisis led to the mise of many russian banks owned by oligarchs which had he ld government debt symptoms of the crisis developed months before august russian interest rates soared prices on the russian stock market plummeted and the value of the russian ruble sank between the end of july 1998 and the end of

the immediate cause of the crisis was the accumulation of russian government shortterm debt in the form of treas ury bills the gkos and bonds ofzs to finance burgeoning budget deficits as long as the russian government could service the debt it managed to maintain large budget deficits without incurring inflation and was able to keep the ruble stable but beginning in 1997 and into 1998 number of forces came into play that placed russi in financially vulnerable position world prices for oil and other commodities on which russia depends for much of its foreig n currency earnings plummeted putting downward pressure on foreign currency reserves and making it more difficult to service the debt and defend the ruble the asian financial crisis made investors much more wary of holding risky shortterm securities such as gkos foreign economic shocks that hit financ ially vulnerable russia largely explain the suddenness of the 1998 fi nancial crisis but russi became vulnerable because of more fundamental problems associat ed with its economic policy and economic structure these included the failure to institute tax reform property rights and bankruptcy laws and procedures despite the setbacks russia made some strides toward economic reform during this period it jettisoned the centrally planned economic system and introduced market prices for most g oods and services it made the russian ruble convertible for trade transactions and the economy was ope ned to foreign trade and investment the downturn in the russian economy was inevitable in transition from an economy that was 100 controlled by the state at the direction of ubiquitous communist party officials at the same time the downt urn was exacerbated by bad policies the turmoil of the economic crisis and yeltsins poor persona l health and very low popular support led him to relinquish th presidency to his prime minister vladimir putin whom yeltsin had appointed in july 1999 putin became

reversed on many accounts the radical improvement is arguably factor in the wide popularity that putin enjoyed during his term at the same time improved economic conditions have brought significant degree of economic stability to russia the economic trends during the last nine years raise several important questions why has russia achieved economic growth nd is it sustainable what have been the economic policies of the putin regime and do they help or hinder russias long term economic success internal economic conditions and trends as figure 1 and table 2 show russia has experienced strong

temper inflation from the skyhigh rates of the 1990s inflation rates remain hig h in 2006 the consumer price index rose 97 and is estimated to have risen 90 in 2007 rate that was above the government target the life expectancy of the average russian citizen particularly males remains low for an advanced c ountry in 2006 it was 724 years for russian woman and 589 years for russian male17 increases in alcoholism and other diseases some of which like tuberculosis ve been nearly eradicated in developed countries have contributed to the decline it is also explained by the poor and deteriorating health system which has been slow to adjust to the transition from central planning the high mortality rate is contributing to shrinkage of the russian population of an average of 05 during 20022006 period that means that the average age of the russian population will in crease leading to decline in the pool of working age individuals trend that does not bode well for economic growth in the future economic data indicate also that as the russian economy has grown the distribution of income within russia s become increasingly unequal during the postsoviet period standard measure of income distribu tion is the gini coefficient or index which is on 000 to 100 scale the lower the number the more equal the income distribution thus 000 is perfec tly equal income distribution while 100 is totally unequal in 1992 ru ssias ginicoefficient was 028918 by 2007 it had increased to 042219 before the collapse of the soviet union the richest 20 of the russian population accounted for 307 of russian income while the poorest 20 accounted for 119 in 2006 the richest 20 held 468 of the income while the poorest 20s share had declined to 54 the middle 60 of the populations share had declined from 574 in 1992 to 478 in 200620 the two sets of income distribution measurements mean that while the russian standard of living has improved small segment of th population is enjoying close to half of the benefits inflation might explain at least part of the skewered distribu tion as those who hold hard assets can protect themselves from inflation more easily than the less wealthy the income distribution trends might also be explained by the large role played by exports especially oil and natural gas in russian gdp growth as owners of energy related assets reap the benefits of the surge in world energy prices21 foreign trade and investment trends the roots of russias robust economic gr owth during the last eight years are reflected in the surge in russian trade and capital flows see

exacted huge price in terms of russian financial credibility the economic growth that russia has experienced since 1999 has b een largely driven by favorable trends in the russias international economic interactions the sharp depreciation of the ruble in 1998 cut demand for imports and encouraged domestic production of goods but by definition such factors are ephemera l when putin took the reins of authority in 19992000 first as acting president then in march 2000 as president his task was to avoid the economic chaos that had plagued russia earlier and to put russia on track toward longterm economic growth to do so required the putin leadership to take advantage of the window of opportun ity of the post1998 crisis economic surge and undertake some majo r economic reforms by the end of 1999 the russian governme nt had achieved degree of financial stabilization as former prime minister primakov had instituted measures to cut government spending and increase tax re venues the russian economy had begun to grow because of the severe deprecia tion of the ruble as result of the 1998 financial crisis wh ich boosted exports26 key objective of the putin regime would be to make sure to maintain stability especially after the effects of the depreciated ruble had disappeared rationalize government expenditures and revenues the high inflation and general econo mic chaos of the 1990s contributed to political and social instability the instability undermined the governments ability to build market economy in order to attain economic st ability the government would have to

years russian government re venues soared from 126 of gdp in 2000 to 236 of gdp in 2006 largely because of tax revenues generated by the surge in oil revenues at the same time the government managed

these reforms have largely improved the busine ss climate although so authorities still conduct inspections contrary to the new regulations35 the russian government has also addressed the issue of corporate governance particularly the protection of the rights of minority share holders that were notoriously subjected to abuse in the 1990s for example the government established regulations on the

achieving economic stability and launching some critical re forms the second term was largely characterized by the governments reestablishing control over critical sectors of the russian economy it has done so by acquiring the assets of companies that had been privatized during the yeltsin regime and taken over by socalled oligarchs via questionable transactions the putin administration has been renationalizing companies directly by taking control of assets or indirectly through ostensibly private sector companies in which the russian government has subs tantial ownership the first major step in this direction was the governments attack on the yukos oil company and its president khail khodorkovsky on october 25 2003 khodorkovsky was arrested and charged w ith tax evasion other yukos executives were also arrested even tually khodorkovsky was senten ce to eight and half year in an east siberian prison khodorkovsky had acquired yukos and several other companies in the loans for shares aucti ons in the mid1990s while his ostensible violation was tax fraud many experts contend that k hodorkovskys real crime was to have crossed red line in challenging putin politically by financing several opposition political parties khodorkovsky also challenged the governments monopoly on oil transport by proposing the construction of privately owned oil pipelines in the end the government seiz ed yukoss assets to pay tax penalties and sold them at below market value prices to rosneft stateowned oil company yukos was left bankrupt45 the case is noteworthy not only for the

activities also the heavy taxation of oil revenues is another contributing factor most oilsector investment in russia is aimed at increasing current production rather than developing new fields therefore any slowdown in the growth of capital spending is soon reflected in slower gr owth of production and exports russia will be not be able to sustain oil production over the long term if the

impor t competition while they are still trying to develop the ruble appreciation has been caused in part by the strong demand for russian energy exports particularly oil the trend has led some
