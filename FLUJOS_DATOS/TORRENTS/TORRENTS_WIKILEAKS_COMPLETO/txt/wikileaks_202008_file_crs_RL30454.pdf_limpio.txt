conference was agreed to and report was filed5 the house agreed to the conference report version of the bill by vote of 300 to 125 on october 9 1998 but the bill which president clinton had threatened to veto was not brought before the senate for vote prior to adjournment6 although the senate and house bills differed significantly they were referred to as implementing needs based bankruptcy iea consumer bankruptcy system that differentiates among debtors and by application of external jurisdictional standards or through casebycase scrutiny imposes strict filing standards and strives to ensure that creditors receive higher distribution than they might otherwise hr 833 and s 625 106th congress 1st sess 1999 the bankruptcy reform acts of 1999 and 2000 like their predecessors both bills are comprehensive with respect to consumer bankruptcy great deal of the impetus towards legislative action has been fueled by the everincreasing rate of consumer bankruptcy filings7 congressional debate over bankruptcy reform during the 105th congress repeatedly evidenced desire by members to elevate personal responsibility in consumer financial transactions to prevent bankruptcy filings from being utilized by consumers as financial planning tool rather than lastresort solution to personal financial crisis and to recapture the stigma associated with bankruptcy filing which many believe has eroded since enactment of the us bankruptcy code in 1978 opponents of the legislation argue inter alia that the growth in consumer bankruptcies is not result of liberal bankruptcy laws but is the consequence of greatly expanded consumer credit and highrisk lending practices that the imposition of means test will permit debtors to manipulate jurisdictional filing criteria that undermining the fresh start in bankruptcy by making commercial debt nondischargeable will adversely impact debtors family support obligations that the increased cost of administering the us bankruptcy court system will not be justified by the incrementa l increase in debt recovery realized by creditors and that the legislation is longer warranted because recent statistics indicate that consumer bankruptcy filings have leveled off and in some instances declined hearings during the 106th congress elicited testim ony by many experts suggesting significant disagreement over the causes of increased consumer filings and the most effective way to enhance debt repayment8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30454crs3 9hr 833 passed by the senate at 1425 10id at 1426 11id at 1430 1431 structural overview of the senate
