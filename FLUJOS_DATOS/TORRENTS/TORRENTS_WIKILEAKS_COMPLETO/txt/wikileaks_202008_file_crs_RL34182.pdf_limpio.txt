securities only at prohibitive rates and prices if at all the liquidity crunch was most extreme for firms and securities with links to subprime mortgages but it also spread rapidly into seemingly unrelated areas the stock market experienced unusual volatility and investors rushed to buy the safest of all investments us treasury securities on august 31 federa l reserve chairman ben bernanke noted that although this episode appears to ve been triggered largely by heightened concerns about subprime mortgages globa l financial losses have far exceeded even the most pessimistic projections of credit losses on those loans the spread of disruptions from housing in to other debt markets is an example of financial contagion or systemic risk contagion spread among nonbank institutions mortgage lenders hedge funds nd issuers of various types of securities including commercial paper assetbacked securities st ructured products and debt supporting leveraged buyouts and takeovers as fear of risk has increased these institutions saw sources of credit vanish and struggled to meet existing financing commitments to post additional collateral and to cope with portfolio losses some financial institutions primar ily mortgage lenders and he dge funds have been unable to resolve liquidity problems and have cl osed in the months ahead there may be more failures central banks including the federal reserve have responded by providing liquidity injecting cash into the banking system and lowering interest rates in order to prevent financial disruptions from slowing real economic growth while financial paper losses have direct effect on output or employment there are channels through which changes in financial conditions may be transmitted to the real economy for example tight credit and equity markets restrain business investment in plant and equipment in the wake of the liquidity crunch polic ymakers may consider several areas for reform could regulation ve prevented current problem s in the mortgage market should credit rating agencies like moodys and standard poors be subject to more oversight by the securities and exchange commission should the nonbank institutions that have been central to this episode be subject to greater regulatory supervision or information disclosure requi rements this report analyzes the causes progress and broad

august 2007 certain financial instruments especially mortgagebacked collateralized debt obligations cdos became illiquid that is they became difficult to sell at any price liquidity problems then spread across other credit markets as investors feared that losses linked to housing securities might affect br oad range of market participants there was flight to quality as i nvestors shifted funds into th least risky securities such as us treasury securities as result many types of cor porate and financial borrowers even some with few or links to mortgage markets had trouble obtaining credit whether to fund new projects or transactions or to refinance existing debt the stock market experienced unusual volatility although the dow jones industrial average actually gained 156 points during august the financial volatility observe d in august is particularly significant because it illustrates how stress in one financial market in this case housing may spread to other markets causing losses to investor s and intermediaries not directly involved in the market where the trouble originated these events raise questions about the ability of policymakers to respond to financ ial crises

is more than double any fiveyear rate in the past 30 years specific regions experienced even faster appreciation in 2004 alone housing in miami angeles and west palm b each appreciated more than 20

g third types of housing not covered by this data series such as condominiums ma have experienced very different pattern of appreciation source office of federal housing enterprise oversight notes the figure is based on repeat sales index of single family homes with conventional loans it measures the nominal appreciation in price of given house from the first time it was sold to the second time it was sold in rapidly appreciating regions many borrowers refinanced their mortgages quickly both because they could tap this new equity for other purposes and because the increased equity could improve their credit profile and allow them to borrow on better terms as result mortgage products designed to be refinanced after short period of time such as socalled 228s interest only adjustable rate

liquidity plays crucial role in securities markets liquidity is important when housing is bought for investment purposes in vestors whose financial plans are based on being able to sell house promptly may run into difficulties when sales slowrates have been closely tied to local ec onomic conditions but these rates are rising today even in some areas that have relatively low unemployment and strong local economies as well in severa l formerly hot markets prices began to fall even though local unemployment remained low for example several florida cities were among the weakest housing markets even though floridas unemployment rate of 39 remained below the us average of 46 in july 2007 furthermore surveys of mortgages origin ated in 2005 suggest that defaults and foreclosures will rise even higher in late 2007 and the first half of 2008 as result potential buyers of mbs now demand greater detail about the composition of their securities in an effort to determine their exposure to poorly underwritten loans in the past buyers might rely on the rating agenci to label the risklevel of loan pool but events have shown that the ratings ag encies underestimated the risk there have been several examples of mbs downgra ded from the leastrisky aaa rating to ccc neardefault overnight4 troubles in housing markets thus caused uncertainty in financial markets and reduced the liquidity of loans and securities backed by loans was the boom bubble in the aftermath of the housing boom the question that economists are heatedly debating is how much of the increase in housing prices was due to economic funda mentals and how much was due to bubble rise in price due to irra tional exuberance about future price appreciation in the famous words of alan greenspan bubble would be consistent with many borrowers taking on mortgages th at they could not really afford in the belief that they could borrow against the property when prices rose or flip the property by quickly selling it at profit after prices rise these borrowers may find their position untenable now that prices in local markets are instead flat or falling and sales have slowed5 there were also reasons for hous prices to rise based on market fundamentals however such as rising incomes and falling mortgage rates as discussed above mortgage rate s during the housing boom were low by historical standards but that does not n ecessarily imply that they would stay low this raises two questions about housing ma rket behavior first why did borrowers increasingly use arms rather than locking in relatively low fixed rate which would have had risk of fu ture interest rate increas second why did mortgage lenders and investors not factor in rising rates when estimating the future probability of arm delinquencies default is costly to the holder of mortgage as well as the borrower the answer to either questi on could be based on f undamentals or bubble mentality the yield curve the first question borrower choice may be due to borrowers taking advantag of the difference between short and longterm interest rates called the yield curve the greater the difference between short and long term rates the greater the incentive for borrower to use an arm which is tied to short rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs5 6 see ben bernanke the global saving glut and the us current account deficit the sandridge lecture virginia association of economics march 10 2005 available on the federal reserve board of governors webs ite for discussion see crs report rl33140 is the trade deficit caused by global saving glut by marc labonte 7 this was the problem behind the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s inflation and rising interest rates required lenders to pay their positors more than they were earning on their fixedrate mortgage assetsrather than fixed rate mortgage which is tied to long rates especially if the borrower plans to sell or refinance the house after short period of time the relatively wide spread between short and long rates from 2001 to 2004 may explain the popularity of arms earlier in the decade but more recen tly the spread between short and long rates has become small so that the rates available on arms are longer much lower than fixed rate mortgages the continuing popularity of arms in light of the fall in sp reads since 2005 suggests that many borrowers might have been motivated by the prospect for shortterm financial gain instead the global savings glut the second question lenders and investors willingness to finance depends in part on expectations of future interest rates in hi ndsight we know that interest rates have been trending up in global markets at the time however many analysts believed that wo rld surplus of savings would hold down interest rates among the proponents of this view was the current chairman of the fede ral reserve ben bernanke6 economic growth in countries with high sa vings rates such as china was forecast to add to this surplus of world savings and hold down interest rates note that interest rates in japan for example have been near zero for almost decade financial returns for investors in real estate and mbs looke d favorable when compared to prevailing interest rates and compared to the risk in stocks following the bear market of 20002002 investors increasingly turned to riskier types of mbs and these investments performed well as long as house price appreciation held down mortgage defaults securitization in the mortgage market changes in the structure of mortgage fi nancing may have c ontributed to market volatility securitization allowed mortgage lenders to bypass traditional banks securitization pools mortgages or other debts and sells them to investors in the form of bonds rather than leaving loans on nders balance sheets the mbs market developed in part because longterm fixed rate mortgages held in banks portfolios place banks at significant risk if interest rates rise in which case the banks interest costs could exceed their mortgage interest earnings7 mbs were popular with investors and banks because it allowed both to better diversify their portfolios but because the mbs market was growing rapi dly in size and sophistication accurate pricing of its risk was difficult and coul d have been distorted by the housing boomhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs6 8 for example securitization meant that non banks needed to obtain financing only until mortgage was sold on the secondary market so deposits were not needed to finance mortgages 9 julie creswell and vikas bajaj mortgage crisis begins to spiral and casualties mount new york times march 5 2007 p c1 10 economist intelligence unit heading for the rocks august 2007 p 13there are several forms of mbs th simplest are called passthroughs interest and principal payments from homeowners are collected by the lender or service firm and passed through to the owner of the mbs more complex securities are created by pooling mbs as well as mort gages and by giving investors menu of risk and return options mortgage pool may be split into part s called tranches to allow cautious investors to purchase sa fer portions and aggr essive investors to purchase the riskier highreturn tranches eg tranches that bear initial losses finally mortgage cash flows may be combined with derivative instruments that link payment levels to the performance of financial variables such as interest rates or credit conditions these securities combinations of traditional bonds and derivatives are calle d structured products the growth of securitization meant that more loans could be originated by non banks8 many of which are not subject to ex amination by federa l bank examiners and not subject to the underwriting guidances i ssued by federal fi nancial regulators studies of loans securitized in 2005 outside federal lending oversight suggest that the average subprime debttoincome ratio ro to 40 well above prudent levels in federal guidances as the 228 or 327 ans with interestonly io periods and adjustable interest rates reset their monthly payments in 2007 many borrowers have been unable to meet their now higher monthly payment while falling prices make it difficult to sell the house except at loss forecasts of the coming resets suggest that the problem is likely to worsen in the s econd half of 2007 and th first half of 2008 the fall of 2008 however is forecast to have far fewer reset problems because underwriting guidelines tightened significantly starting in august 2005 financial problems for lenders one of the first signs that the slowdow n in house price appreciation could have wider financial effects was the early stress on mortgage originators as discussed above securitization facilitated specialty nonbank mortgage lenders that operate outside the banking reserve system begi nning in late 2006 some of these nonbank mortgage lenders suffered significant losses and their lines of credit began to dry up for example ownit mortgage reportedly coul d not cover its early payment defaults which triggered promise by ownit to repurchase the nonperforming loans9 lenders such as ownit depend on continuing loan sales to replenish their lines of credit and issue new mortgages as subpr ime delinquency and faults continued to rise in early 2007 the willingness of invest ors and securitizers to purchase mortgages from nonbank originators declined and lines of credit began to disappear subprime lending contracted severely and at least 90 lenders have gone out of business since the beginning of the year10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs7 11 housing housing finance and monetary policy remarks by chairman ben s bernanke at the federal reserve bank of kansas citys economic symposium jackson hole wyoming august 31 2007turmoil in financial markets significant downturn in the housing ma rket would be expected to cause economic distress among mortgage lenders homeowners who expected to refinance sellers and related sect ors such as construction but it is not inevitable that even severe disruption in housing should lead to crisis in the broad financial market in the summer of 2007 however the global cred it markets suffered liquidity crunch that went well beyond the mortgage ma rket and the relatively small subprime segment of the market where stresses were concentrated up to then as federal reserve chairman ben bernanke noted although this episode appears to have been triggered largely by heightened c oncerns about subprime mortgages global financial losses have far exceeded even th most pessimistic projections of credit losses on those loans11 in retrospect it appears that easy credit caused by the saving glut and underestimation of risk were not confined to the mortgage market spreads between risky corporate debt such as junk bonds issued to finance takeovers and safe obligations like us treasury securities were very low by historical standards investors were willing to ta ke risks without demanding correspondingly high interest rates in return with both stocks and traditional fixed income markets producing low yields after 2001 pension funds and other ins titutional investors were driven by their actuarial needs and competition to seek out higheryielding investments creating market for hedge funds and other investme nt managers using exotic and complex securities and strategies longterm rates did not rise much even after the federal reserve began raising the federal funds overnight rate in 2004 implying that the market anticipated plentiful supply of cr edit to continue into the future this perception may have encouraged the overu of leverage or borrowed money to boost returns for example until august leveraged buyouts corporate takeovers heavily financed by debt had soared in recent years financial market adjustment need not cause widespread disruptions lenders could tighten their standards debt holders could reprice their securities to reflect an updated view of risk and take the balancesheet losses nd reckless speculators could simply go out of business all without inte rrupting the mainstream of credit flows that support the global economy but instead of such an orderly adjustment financial markets experienced what various observers have called rout panic crash bursting bubble or crunch losses have already exceeded even pessimistic expectations as chairman bernanke noted and there may be more to come the rest of this section examines how liquidity pr oblems spread through the financial system in august 2007 problems for hedge funds and investment banks in midjune 2007 the investment banking firm bear stearns announced that two of its hedge funds that invested heavily in subprime mbs were in difficulty thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs8 12 bond rating agencies of which moodys and standard poors are the bestknown are private firms that assign grades to debt secur ities indicative of the raters estimates of the probability that interest and principal will be paid on schedule the ratings are important not only to investors trying to select portfo lio that matches their risk preferences but they are also written into many federal laws and regulations for example the amount of regulatory capital banks are required to hold to cover the risk of loss to their bond holdings is determined by the rating assigned by the ag encies and thrift institutions are not allowed to own bonds rated below investment grade in 2007 many blame the rating agencies for failing to downgrade subprime mbs in timely way in response to negative information about rising defaults and imminent resets that became available early in the year 13 credit derivatives are essentially bets that debt security or firm will default be downgraded by rating agency or experience another credit event they provide insurance for bondholders and speculative opportunities for those who believe that the bonds credit quality are deterioratingsecurities were estimated to have lost 28 of their value since the beginning of the year although the funds held only about 600 million in investor capital negligible amount in terms of the whol us mortgage market the announcement caused alarm for several reasons first the mbs held by the funds had been originally classified as very safe and lowrisk by the bond rating agencies12 the revelation that they had lost much of their value over very short period rais ed doubts about the ratings of all similar bonds and appeared to confirm what ma ny believed that during the boom many market participants had significantly underestimated the risks of lending the announcement suggested that other holders of subprime mbs might be experiencing similar but as yet undisclosed losses t hus traders and lenders became less willing to deal with any fund or financial ins titution known or suspected to be holder of subprime mbs additionally there is large credit derivatives market for mbs multiplying the prospects for losses stemming from mbs volatility13 second alt hough as noted above the interest rates on subprime mbs are relatively high compared to other debt securities they do not by themselves provide the kind of returns that hedge fund i nvestors expect therefore hedge funds commonly use leverage borrowed funds and derivative instruments to boost returns this means that losses in hedg funds are not only problem for their investors who by law must be wealthy individuals or financial institutions presumably able to bear risk and loss but for their creditors and counterparties as well the bear stearns funds had borrowed about 6 billi on from other firms including merrill lynch goldman sachs bank of america and deutsche bank since hedge funds are unregulated and do not disclose their sources of funds this created uncertainty about which institutions were exposed to credit risk from hedge funds many derivatives markets are also largely unregulated which means that the identities of hedge funds counterparties are not widely known thus the bear stearns announcement led many to infer th at other hedge funds were likely facing difficulties which proved to be the case and raised uncertainty about which associated brokers lenders and deriva tives dealers might also face losseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs9 the liquidity crunch firms are said to be liquid when they are able to meet current obligations or shortterm demand for funds firm is said to be solvent but

and prices if at all the liquidity crunch was most extreme for firms and securities with links to subprime mortgages but it also spread rapidly into seemingly unrelated areas the apparent triggers for this liquidity crunch were losses related to us housing at french and german bank which followed on the bear stearns he dge fund announcement discussed above clearly losses at two european banks alone would not be enough to cause global liquidity crunch rather news of these sses led to sudden change in expectations among market participants that made them unwilling to lend to firms or buy securities at prevailing rate s and prices beyond the sudden undesirability of firms and securities related to s ubprime mortgages there was general increase in risk aversion investors suddenly required much higher premium in order to be induced to hold risky assets and corre sponding flight to quality this may be seen in the sudden plunge in the yiel ds on 3month treasury bills shown in

normally considered less risky than subprime homebuyers14 in august however aversion to risk spread into these sectors of the mortgage market as investors became less willing to purchase any mbs not

fundament supply or demand linkages lawrence summers former secretary of the treasury put it this way as investors rush for the exits the focus of risk analysis shifts from fundamentals to investor behavior17 if investors believe that othe r investors are likely to sell they have strong incentive to sell even assets they believe are undervalued as prices fall collateral demands and margin calls force more selling leading to cascading liquidations and market crash key issue for whether the liquidity crunch has lasting economic effects will depend on whether it becomes or alread has become credit crunch which is defined as situation where creditworthy borrowers are unable to borrow at all on terms that are consistent with economic fundamentals18 when the panic is on the fundamentals do not matter wh asset prices fall sharply creditors become fearful not only about the value of their collateral but about the solvency of their borrowers according to moodys economist big problem is that lenders dont know which of their clients is likely to default because the system is so opaque so they stop lending to everybody19 from policy perspective higher risk premia may be warranted market adjustment but true credit crunch could be problematic were it to emerge since it could reduce economic output the response of central banks central banks across the world including europe japan and the united states acted quickly to restore liquidity to the financial system following august 9 one sign of the liquidity crunch could be seen in the us federal funds market private market

provided 156 billion euros 215 billion of liquidity to markets on august 9 and 10 normalcy soon returned to the federal funds ma rket although other parts of the financial system remained illiquid how should the feds actions of august 9 and 10 be characterized the feds actions cannot be classified as policy ch ange since it left the federal funds target rate unchanged for over month21 nor can it be considered unusual that the fed bought treasury securities to keep the federa l funds rate at its target the fed does this on daily basis what was unusual about the incident was the initial sharp increase in the federal funds rate above its target and th magnitude of liquidity the fed needed to add to bring the rate back down to its target on august 17 the fed took further actions to restore calm to financial markets when it reduced the discount rate at whic h banks can borrow directly from the fed from 625 to 575 the change in the discount rate might seem unusual since the liquidity crunch does not seem to be c oncentrated in the sector depository institutions with discount window access it is believed however that banks extended lines of credit and bridge financing to many of the entities suffering from the liquidity crunch so the extent of the banking sectors exposure to the crunch is still unclear in any case discount wi ndow lending is dwarfed by open market operations on september 18 the fed reduced the federal funds targ et rate by 05 percentage points to 475 stating that th change was intended to forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader ec onomy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial ma rkets at the same time the fed lowered the discount rate to 525 why did it happen there are two ways to think about the cause s of financial market disorder first recent events can be seen as part of the st andard narrative of cycles endemic to credit markets during periods of relative st ability lenders become complacent and gradually overconfident and the profit motive increasingly pushes aside the fear of loss then the credit boom comes to an end suddenly triggered by some random event and lenders and inve stors become more and perhaps overly cautious then the cycle begins again financial markets had b een unusually calm for sustained period prior to augusts events the prolonged period of low and smooth in terest rates was probably responsible for the notable widespr ead drop in risk pre mia as investors may have been lulled into false sense of conf idence history suggests that this period of placidity would inevitably end at some point once rates rose and became morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs14 22 hedge funds leverage and the lessons of longterm capital management report of the presidents working group on financial markets april 1999 p 23volatile investors tolerance for risk diminished changes in investor sentiment can be sudden and seemingly disp roportionate to the proximate causes of the change in such circumstances investors may even ta ke positions that are based more on their perceptions of herd behavior eg selling an asset in anticipation of panic than underlying fundamentals i nvestors may take liquidity for granted until the rare occasion when it unexpectedly disappears when markets have been calm for sustained period liquidity pre mia tend to fall and when it dries up the price of less liquid assets may suddenly fall in liquidity crisis firms may be forced to sell assets for less than their fundamental value to stave off insolvency second many observers attribute the curre nt episode to additional factors that are byproducts of the ways that markets and institutions have evolved over the last few decades low interest rates made highly leveraged positions relatively more profitable and highly levera ged market participants have grown quickly in size and importance hedge funds the proprieta ry trading desks of investment and commercial banks private equity firms nd others frequently magnify their positions through borrowing the use of derivatives repurchase agreements or short sales highly leveraged positions will generate higher positive returns on average but also have more potential for generating large losses large or unexpected losses by highlyleveraged institutions can have widespread consequences as the presidents working group on financial markets noted in its 1999 report on the longterm capital manageme nt hedge fund nearcollapse when leveraged investors are overwhel med by market or liquidity shocks the risks they have assumed will be discharged back into the market thus highly leveraged investors have the potential to exacerbate instability in the market as whole the outcome may be direct losses inflicted on creditors and trading counterparties as well as an indirect im pact on other market participants through price changes resulting from the disappearan ce of investors willing to bear higher risks the indirect impact is potentially the more serious effect volatility and sharp declines in asset prices can heig hten uncertainty about credit risk and disrupt the intermediation of credit these secondary effects if not contained could cause contraction of credit and li quidity and ultimately heighten the risk of contraction in real economic activity22 much financial intermediation has migrated from the banks which are closely supervised and insured by fe deral regulators to ligh tly or unregulated nonbanks and as result the financial system has become more opaque similarly the use of ever more complex financia l instruments derivatives cdos structured products etc both permits risks to be transferred quickly from one market or institution to another and makes it difficult to discern where the ultimate risk exposure lies for example mbs investors have had difficulty telling whether the mortgages underlying their securities are at risk this opacity is not problem when markets are functioning smoothly and indeed the cons ensus view is that the ability to unbundle and transfer risk has made the financial system more r obust and efficient but the downside is that when losses do occur ther is greater uncertainty about who might be affected and the extent of the dama ge potentially leading to greater panichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs15 23 see crs report rl33140 is the us trade deficit caus ed by global saving glut by marc labontesome economists have specu lated that the growing co mplexity of and turnover in financial markets can ex acerbate rare periods of ex treme volatility for example when highly leveraged positions go sour the process of unwinding those positions can drive asset prices even further down hi ghly sophisticated hedges based on assets that are normally uncorrela ted may suddenly become co rrelated during episodes of instability for example hedge based on the assumption that two asset prices will not fall simultaneously could become costly to unwind if all prices are falling liquidity is crucial for many of these transactions to work when it disappears they fall apart relatively new classes of securities may have too short history for comprehensive knowledge of their risk profile so that unexpected events lead to sudden and dramatic repr icing of the securities as discussed above the downturn in the housing market has been unfolding for some time and it was always likely that it would result in financial market adjustment for securities related to the hous ing market perhaps what was surprising was how sudden and extreme that adjustment turned out to be although asset bubbles have often burst suddenly at this point the adjustment seems to be based more on anticipation of future rather than actua l rise in mortgage delinquencies and so actual delinquencies could turn out to be higher or lower than current financial markets reflect the recent increase in subprime deli nquencies remains small portion of the total mortgage market if so there will be further financial market adjustment for better or worse what is not yet clear is whether recent events which were much more broadly based than just the mortgage market will lead to permanent changes in asset pricing due to change in underlying fundamental s or whether recent financial losses are mostly the result of panic and will eventually be reversed as calm is restored to large extent this question revolves around whether permanent financial adjustment is limited to the mortgage market or whether the mortgage market represents the proverbial tip of the iceberg it could prove to be the latter if the period of global liquidity glut and low risk premia was an aberration that has come to close data suggest that low global interest rates were always being driven more by low investment demand than high saving23 if so it was always likely that investment demand would eventually rec over and when it did intere st rates would be driven up policy issues the liquidity crunch of august 2007 raises number of policy issues the fundamental question underlying them is whether the crunch and the current policy approach to its resolution has exposed th economy to an acceptable level of risk if the liquidity crunch leaves lasting harm and the policy response mainly the feds attempt to replenish the financial systems lost liquidity is effective and has negative side effects then some woul d argue that the natural ups and downs of financial markets are useful and necessary way to ensure that capital is allocatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs16 24 while the fed can increase the availability of credit there is always the rare possibility that lenders will not use it in which case th feds efforts to restore liquidity could be stymied this scenario is referred to as liquidity trap 25 carter dougherty british central bank critical of cash infusions new york times september 13 2007 soon after the british central bank appeared to reverse its stance by providing financial markets with significant liquidity 26 this argument should not be overstated investors will only be bailed out in instances when their losses correspond with steps by th fed to restore liquidity and plenty of investors still experienced losses during recent events despite the feds actionsefficiently in the famous words of joseph schumpeter th credit crunch may represent capitalisms creativ destruction but the 2007 credit crunch has raised issues in number of policy areas where economists have ques tioned whether policy changes could have averted the crunch or at least tempered its more destructive side effects without underminin g market efficiency the first part of this section evaluate s the macroeconomic response namely the efficacy of the feds current approach to provide liquidity to financial markets when it dries up the rest of the section focuses on regulatory issues that have been raised by augusts events the fear of fina ncial contagion finding the proper degree of regulation for modern financial markets and potential shortcomings with rating agencies and the regulation of mortgage markets with an eye on preventing their reoccurrence finally to understand wh liquidity crunch merits policymakers attention the report links fi nancial unrest to its ultimate effect on the real economy monetary policy in liquidity crunch with the potential to flood the market with virtually unlimited amounts of money the fed can in effect offset any loss in overall liquidity in financial markets24 but adding too much liquidity would undermine the feds longterm goals of maintaining low inflation and stable economic growth so when faced with financial unrest the feds options for restoring calm in the shortterm are constrained by its unwillingness to undermine its longterm go als since monetary changes feed through to inflation only gradually the fast er excess liquidity is withdrawn after calm is restored to financial markets the less of threat it poses to low inflation if liquidity crunch is the market outcome resulting from the decisions of private investors why should the fed interv ene some have argued that when the fed does restore liquidity it increases moral hazard the economic term for the idea that people take greater risks when they are insured against adverse outcomes in this case in the words of the head of brit ains central bank the recent provision of such liquidity support undermines the efficien t pricing of risk by providing expost insurance for risky behavior that encour ages excessive risktaking and sows the seeds of future crisis25 these critics argue that more efficient investment decisions would be made in the long run if the fed allowed liquidity crunches to run their course and imprude nt investors took losses26 the effectiveness of the feds efforts to restore liquidity is limited by the fact that the feds actions only affect market liqui dity at the broadest level as long ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs17 27 see crs report rl30232 systemic risk and the l ongterm capital management rescue by mark jickling 28 see crs report rl33666 asset bubbles policy options for the federal reserve by marc labonteinvestors shun classes of borrowers or ssets those markets will remain illiquid and out of line with underlying fundamentals as result monetary policy cannot make all markets function smoothly all the time this reduces moral hazard however since it means that the feds actions do not interfere with market rewards and punishments for specific risktaking behavior the drawback to the moral hazard critique is that allowing liquidity crunch to run its course could run c ounter to the feds longrun goal of maintaining economic stability if the liquidity crunch were to lead to recession not only would overly risky investors take losses but so would efficient firms that saw demand for their products drop solely because of the cyclical downturn some would argue that liquidity has characteristics of positive externality whose benefits to society exceed the benefits to private firms who provide it if so enough liquidity can be provided only through government intervention in this case by the fed although the positive externality argument is generally consistent with mainstream economic thought it and the moral hazard critique are not mutually exclusive traditionally government pr ograms that create moral hazard are complemented by government regulations to reduce risky behavior for example deposit insurance creates the incentive for ba nks to take on excessive risk so bank regulations restrict the amount of risk that banks ar allowed to take as will be discussed below if moral hazard really is being created by the fed there may not currently be corresponding regulations to offset the extra risk it generates the decision to lower rates is similar to the 1998 experience similar to today the us economy had been experiencing sustained expansion when financial turmoil suddenly erupted in september 1998 in response to the russian debt default the second round of asian crises and fina ncial difficulties at hedge fund called longterm capital management27 in response the fed cut interest rates by 025 percentage points on three separate occasions over the next two months then held rates constant until june 1999 following these actions calm was restored and the economic expansion and bull ma rket continued for another two years in hindsight some economists have argued that cutti ng interest rates in 1998 was the wrong decision because it caused the economy to ove rheat inflation to rise and stock market bubble to grow they argue that the economic downturn and stock market decline that began in 2001 could have b een mitigated had the fed not acted in 199828 systemic risk and contagion the events of august are an example of financial c ontagion which occurs when financial shocks are not confined to the markets where they originate but are transmitted to other firms markets or countries with fundamental link to the original problem trouble in the u s subprime mortgage market has triggered systemic risk or repercussi ons throughout the global fina ncial system is systemichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs18 risk too high in todays financial system if so what options do policy makers have to reduce the incidence of c ontagion or systemic risk in general markets are selfcorrecting and selfstabilizing the price mechanism ensures that when asset prices fall fa r enough new buyers w ill be found and new equilibrium established in the united states some of the largest financial markets trading in foreign exchange and us treasury securities for example have functioned very well with virt ually government regulation true systemic risk episodes are rare events and when they do occur there may not be significant damage to the real ec onomy it is impossible to know whether instances where the fed has successfully stepped in to quell financial turmoil such as october 1998 and august 2007 were narro wly averted near misses or whether calm would have been restored anyw ay without government intervention nevertheless financia l regulators spend considerable time thinking about worstcase scenarios because of the possible severity of the macroeconomic consequences in the united states modern banking and securities regulation both have their roots in and derive their basic princi ples from the lessons of the great depression when the stock market crash of 1929 and banking panic accompanied decade of economic contraction and stagnation in economic terms systemic risk is an externality to individual market participants all firms have an incentive to limit their own risk taking to avoid loss of their capital but none has an adequate incentive to limit risk taking to reduce instability in the system at large in the recent housing boom decisions made by individual borrowers and nders may have been entirely reasonable given the information available at the time but at the systemic level those choices produced an unstable situation should financial regulators try to re duce systemic risk by setting limits on private risk taking there are difficulties in this approach first if regulators want to mandate that market participants hold more capital as cushion to enable them to better withstand fina ncial shocks one knows how much additional stability any given capital increase will yield the problem is analogous to writing eart hquake insurance policies with lowfrequency highseverity event there is not enough historical data to support robust model of the likely cost of the next unlikely occurrence prudential regulation imposes costs but the systemic benefits are uncertain second financial markets are extremely dynamic creating moving target for regulatory attempts to reduce systemic risk in recent years there has been massive movement of capital out of regulated entities like mutual funds and banks into unregulated hedge funds and private equ ity the spread of new instruments to manage unbundle and redistribute risk s been noted above furthermore in modern financial markets assets may be held for very brief periods of time making regulation technically difficult where i nnovation is rapid risk models can quickly become outdated thus there is easy option for regula tors to use to reduce the frequency of systemic crises in advance the best av ailable policy may be the current one whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs19 29 some critics have argued that banks would have made more prudent loans if they did not routinely securitize them but instead held them on their balance sheet as they did in the pastis to rely on the federal reserve to step in after the fact to provide liquidity and if need be to act as lender of last resort to bail out institutions whose failure would have unacceptable systemic cons equences as discussed in the previous section the main drawback of this approach is the potential for moral hazard to increase could problems in the mortgage market have been averted several factors contributed to the hous ing boom and bust nd only time will tell which factors played the largest role in hindsight many borrowers took on loans that were unsustainable especially loans with introductory rate s and interestonly periods whose use peaked in 2005 eviden ce shows that loans originated by banks subject to federal safety and soundness regulators were more likely to maintain prudent underwriting29 the nonbank lenders in st appear to have been more likely to extend imprudent loans potential reasons on both the borrowing and lending side could include relative lack of financial sophisti cation by borrowers in the subprime market which is disproporti onately conducte d by nonbanks deceptive or misleading loan marketing techniques by mortgage brokers and lenders with little longterm financial interests in loan performance inflated appraisals during high refinance periods by appraisers seeking repeat business weak underwriting criteria of lenders speculating on continued house price appreciation to hold down defaults insufficient data and weak default models used by ratings agencies to estimate financial risks and lack of due diligence by overconfident investors in mortgage backed securities each factor suggests different but not mutually exclusive response better financial education and improved disclosure laws which would apply to both bank and nonbank lenders might ve improved the judgment of borrowers who took out unsustainable loans improved supervisi on of mortgage brokers and lenders could have resulted in tighter nding standards more accu rate and objective estimations by parties paid for their opinion such as appraisers and ratings agencies could have led to more accurate pric ing of value and risk which would minimize the current need for correction more prudent unde rwriting standards among nonbanks either through better due diligence by securities investors or regulation by federal bank examiners could have reduced the volume of unsustainable loans the latter option would mark break from current policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs20 30 krishna guha credit turmoil h as hallmarks of bank run ftcom september 2 2007although federal disclosure laws apply to all mortga ges not all lenders are subject to federal scrutiny for safety nd soundness federal financial regulators concerned for the safety and soundness of the banking system issue guidances that encourage prudent lending these guidan ces do not apply to many subprime and jumbo loan lenders that choose to securitiz their loans the underwriting standards of these lenders depend on the willingness of investors in mbs to purchase the loans while house price appreciation was hol ding down defaults mbs securities performed well investment demand for them was strong and underwriting standards loosened average debttoincome ratio fo r subprime loans for example rose from 36 in 1998 to 40 in 2005 it appears at this time that problem loans originated disproportionately in the unregulated channel when considering wh ether nonba nk mortgage lenders should f ace the same regulatory scrutiny as banks it is useful to recall the purpose of bank regulation because of deposit insurance banks face little scrutiny from depositors regarding the riskiness of their lending safety and soundness bank regulation reduces risk and thereby the costs of deposit insurance in the face of moral hazard it was not meant to protect borrowers the traditional rationale for why other financial institutions face less regulation than banks is because they face nothing analogous to the moral hazard created by deposit insurance financial market regulation according to axel weber president of the german central bank the current turmoil has all the characteristics of cla ssic banking crisis but one that is taking place outside the traditional banking sector30 in predeposit insurance days if one bank got in trouble depositors at the bank across the street would line up to withdraw their money not because they had new in formation about the condition of their own bank but simply as pr ecautionary measure the cost of withdrawing funds was minimal the cost of waiting too long might be high what is happening now in webers analysis is comparable except that instead of banks the affected institutions are mainly conduits and inve stment vehicles raising funds in the corporate bond market these institutions have borrowed shortterm eg using commercial paper to finance longterm investments mbs and they are as vulnerable to runs as bank in the absence of deposit insurance with illiquid assets loans financed by shortterm borrowing deposits most notably in the case of subprime mbs some of the asse ts are now at higher risk of default but investors are having difficulty telling which ones so they are avoiding the entire asset class one of the original rationales for banking regulation was to reduce the cyclicality of the credit markets and other parts of the fina ncial sector have s hown themselves to be less prone to cyclicality hedge funds nonbank mortgage lenders private equity firms issuers of commercial paper and their

agency reform act of 2006 by michael v seitzingerthe federal safety net in exchange for accepting some form of prudential regulation problem with the current approach is that the federal reserve can only inject liquidity into the financial system through the banking sector if banks are under stress one estimate is that they have had to take 13 trillion in risky assets back onto their balance sheets in recent months31 they may not be in position to pass liquidity to the nonbank sectors that most need it according to one commentator the federal reserve could in that situ ation find itself pushing on string32 the objections to widening the safety net based on the concept of moral hazard are discussed above but even if the federal safety net we re not extended an argument for extending regulation coul d be made based on the mora l hazard created by the federal reserves actions to maintain liquidity the sec has sought unsuccessfully to date to impose disc losure requirements on large hedge funds the word opaque appears often in writing about the current liquidity crunch including this report perhaps more disclosure by currently unregulated financial institutions would re duce uncertainty as noted above key motivation for the recent flight to quality ppears to be that investors are unable to tell whether the assets they are holding are in danger investors might be expected to demand greater disclosure in return fo r the use of their funds but at least until august investment was migrating to sectors with the least disclosure the limitation to increasing disclosure is that it is most useful when financial positions are relatively simple and stable when they are dynamic and complex disclosed information becomes rapidly outdated rating agencies bond rating agencies of which moodys and standard poors are the bestknown are private firms that assign grad to debt securities indicative of the raters estimates of the probability that interest and principal will be paid on schedule the rating agencies have been of interest to congress since the enron collapse when bonds of many companies we re not downgraded until long after their management and accounting problems had become public knowledge congress passed the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 pl 109291 to address the perceived problems created by the absence of statutory regulation of credit rating agencies33 the act attempts to increase compe tition in the rating industry by making it easier for an agency to obtain securities and exchange commission sec certification the sec however does not exer cise any direct regulatory supervision over the rating agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs22 34 in their defense rating agencies have noted that relatively small share of rated tranches have defaulted so farin 2007 the rating agencies have been widely blamed for missing looming problems in subprime mbs causing first false sense of security among investors and then widespread insecurity as investors lost faith in rating designations34 what are the options for additional reforms one approach would be new legislation to bring the rating agencies under some form of sec regulation the sec could be authorized to examine or require disclosure of rating methodologies and pe rhaps prescribe standards for revising ratings in response to new information or changes in market conditions the sec could also monitor possible conflicts of interest critics have charged that the rating agencies may sometimes adjust their ratings for competitive purposes that is to win business from rival by offering more favorable rating since issuers pay for ratings and that issuers seeking ratin gs may be pressured to purchase various consulting services offered by rating agency affiliates there have been public allegations that such practices underlie the problems with subprime mbs ratings an opposing view is that efforts to impr ove the quality of the ratings are likely to produce only limited results markets react to new information quickly and continuously is it realistic to think that ra ting agencies can have superior information about each of the thousands of rated debt securities the rating agencies employ highly skilled analysts but basic financial theory holds that single individual or firm or the sec for that matter can do better job of valuation than the market as whole if rating agencies decisions sole purpose was to guide private investment decisions one could argue that questions concerning the quality of ratings were of concern to public policy the rating agencies are concern however because many regulations hinge on an assets rating among th legal consequences of rating change may be higher capital requirements for banks or securities brokerdealers or forced divestment of certain assets for example by federally insured thrifts that are forbidden to hol d below investment grade or junk debt an alternate approach th would be for congress to reconsider the numerous provisions in regulation and statute that refer to private rating decisions those doubting the usefulness of rating agencies might argue that the role of ratings in public policy should be diminished financial markets and the real economy the overarching goals of the governme nts macroeconomic policies are not to prevent financial losses but to maintain low inflation and stable economic growth as long as the financial system as whole remains stable losses for some investors are needed for capital to be allocated mo st efficiently and the economy to prosper maintaining some degree of financial stability is policy goal not in and of itself but because it is required for economic stability httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34182crs23 although financial paper losses have direct ffect on economic output or employment there are channels through wh ich changes in financial conditions are transmitted to the real economy most im portantly physical capital investment is key component of gross domes tic product gdp and firm s decision to invest in physical capital plant or equipment is influenced by borrowing costs access to capital markets and its stock price if these three determinants deteriorate then firms are likely to reduce their physical investme nt and gdp growth would eventually fall all else equal given that mortgagerelated asset prices have fallen most significantly in the recent episode any decline in physical investment may turn out to be concentrated in residentia l investment house building even if firms and individuals would still like to borrow after financial downturn financial firms that have suffered losses may curb their nding to improve their balance sheets another channel from which financial losses can lead to lower gdp growth is through household consumption if house hold wealth declines households may eventually increase their saving equivale ntly reduce their consumption in order to replenish it consumption remained relatively strong however during the stock market decline from 2001 to 2003 which was mu ch larger than recent losses to date households with mortgage difficulties small fraction of the total may be forced to reduce consumption as result of lost access to credit households may also reduce their consumption as result of declining confid ence and financial turmoil may cause confidence to decline if investment or consump tion were to decline it may be partly offset by an improvement in the trade deficit foreign capital inflows have played an important role in financing us inves tment spending in the past few years and if investment spending were to fall foreign capital inflows might also fall by accounting identity net foreign capital inflows are equal to the current account ficit of which the trade deficit is the largest part lower net capital inflows would reduce the value of the dollar which would make exports and importcompe ting goods relatively less expensive while the trade deficit w ould improve foreign capital outflows could prevent interest rates from falling however as the examples of the stock market decline on october 19 1987 the largest single day percentage decline in hist ory and the financial turmoil in 1998 demonstrate financial losses need not lead to economic recessions nor is the direction of causation obvious in cases wh ere stock market declines and recessions have coincided for example while th stock market decline preceded the 2001 recession it might have been caused by i nvestors recognition that the economy was weakening as opposed to causing the r ecession itself in general historical experience suggests that prolonged bear markets not transient financial unrest are associated with recessions
