introduction strain of the avian influenza virus know n as h5n1 first appeared in birds and humans in hong kong in 1997 since resu rfacing in late 2003 the virus has spread throughout asia and caused over 165 reported human deaths from vietnam to egypt while appearing in birds in africa and eur ope although media coverage of the virus abated significantly in 2006 both the num ber of cases 116 in 2006 versus 97 in 2005 and deaths 80 in 2006 versus 42 in 2005 accelerated the h5n1 virus has been confirmed in humans in ten countries with an overall mort ality rate of about 601 the virus disproportionately affect s children and young adults although avian influenza is still considered to be extremely inefficient in humantohuman transmission there have been cases of limited humantohuman transmission in indonesia some health aut horities continue to stress th at h5n1 has the potential to cause major human pandemic in janua ry 2007 the world health organization who warned that avian influenza could again spread across asia to europe in 20072 birds mostly domestic poultry remain the primary source of human infection confirmed cases of h5n1 infection in birds have appeared in over 50 countries including new outbreaks in east asia cent ral asia the middle east and europe in early 20073 in some countries the virus is c onsidered endemic meaning that avian

fiscal years us agencies and departments might commit additional resources to global avian flu efforts that were not specifically appropriated for those purposes overview of international response responding effectively to the spread of avian influenza has continued to challenge national governme nts and international organizations while more developed countries have largel been able to stem the tide of the virus less affluent states lack the resources to improve local preparedness the veterinary services to provide surveillance and early warning and established biosecurity systems to prevent outbreaks in poultry meanwhile number of more developed asian governments such as singapore and h ong kong have developed sophisticated programs to research the virus and res pond to potential outbreaks the world bank the european commission and united nations agencies including who the food and agriculture organization fao and the world organization for animal health oie have all provided fi nancial support and distributed donations to poorer nations to help improve their capacity to prevent the spread of h5n1 the united states has continued to work with many of the affected countries as part of its strategy to use global partnerships to respond to the outbreaks5 australia indicated its concern by carrying out an elaborate pandemic flu simulation in october 2006 involving over 1000 people inviting representatives from 15 countries to observe the exercise6 asia continues to be the epicenter of human cases of h5n1 indonesia remains the most critical of the aff ected countries with 63 fatal confirmed cases to date all of them since 2005 analysts contend that the effectiveness of indonesias response is limited in part by the fact that international health authorities are based in jakarta but have little reach outside of the c ity and among the dispersed population scientists also point out that indonesia s not been able to replicate the successful strategies employed by vietnam and thailand because of its widespread use of backyard farms thailand and vietnam ve larger percentage of commercial poultry farms which are more easily regulated7 some have expr essed concern

whether the immunizations eliminate or only reduce the level of infection sk eptics argue that birds that are immunized but still infected could be risk to humans and make the virus more difficult to track new confirmed human case in china in january 2007 the first reported case in six months renewed alarm about chinas potential to suffer nother outbreak the countries of the european union eu appear to have successfully stemmed the spread of the h5n1 virus cases have been confirmed in humans and only limited sporadic infections in birds have been detected health authorities give credit to strong and consiste nt veterinary measures carri ed out by eu governments as directed by eu legislation8 on the other side of the spectrum surveillance in africa remains very weak in africa onl egypt suffered further human cases and deaths in 2006 but concern remains that s ubsaharan africa lacks the infrastructure and resources to deal effectiv ely with an outbreak in humans antiviral production9 production of the antiviral treatment eltamivir markete d as tamiflu has accelerated swiss manufacturer roche pr oduced approximately 190 million courses of the drug in 2006 and claimed that it could produce up to 400 million courses annually in the future in response to pr essure and increased demand roche granted licenses to drugmakers in india and china to produce less expensive versions of the antiviral and dozens of countries now have stockpiles of the treatment10 however concern about tamiflus eff ectiveness against mutations of h5n1 were raised when new strain in egypt was found to be resist ant to oseltamivir an alternative drug zanamivir marketed as relenza was effective against the strain but it is more expensive and more difficult to use and ship than oseltamivir11 the discovery of new strain underscored the difficulty and expense of governmental programs to stockpile antiviral treatment as the virus mutates most scientists continue to argue that oseltamivir at present remains the most effective and promising treatmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33871crs4 table 1 total number of human cases and deaths by country through february 27 2007 countryhuman cases since
