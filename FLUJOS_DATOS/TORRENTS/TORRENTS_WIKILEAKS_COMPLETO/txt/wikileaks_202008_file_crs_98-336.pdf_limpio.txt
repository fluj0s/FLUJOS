invited by committee before officially inviting witness committee staff identify and often interview prospective witnesses committees consider people from diverse backgrounds including individuals from the executive branch state and local governments academia business and interest groups as well as other private citizens committee may invite as many witnesses as it chooses and may schedule multiple days of hearings generally committees strive to ensure that range of views are represented for instance rules of the committee on finance direct staff to try and schedule witnesses so as to attain balance of views early in the hearing in other cases only witnesses expressing particular points of view might be invited senate rules allow the minorityparty members of committee except appropriations to call witnesses of their choice on at least one day of hearing majority of the minority members must make this request to the committee chair before completion of the hearings rule xxvi paragraph 4d the committee on finance explicitly allows every member of the committee to choose witnesses to testify on many committees the minority members work informally with the majority to invite witnesses representing their views once witnesses are identified the committee chair usually sends each witness formal letter of invitation this letter generally provides the witness with basic information on the proposed hearing including its purpose subject date time and location in addition the letter might indicate limitation on the length of witnesss oral testimony the committee also might send witness additional information this information could include list of committee members the committees rules copy of the measure under consideration if legislation is the goal and published articles relating to the issue the letter of invitation might also request that witness send the committee biographical information and an advance copy of written testimony the latter being required at least one day before witness testifies except before the appropriations committee rule xxvi paragraph 4b committee may reimburse witness for expenses related to testimony and if reimbursement is expected the letter of invitation might address this point often the letter indicates staff contact committee staff will sometimes meet with witnesses prior to hearing to answer questions and to review procedure g21g158g139g153g152g142g151g138g561g18g152g160g142g155g561 most individuals respond favorably to an invitation to testify believing it to be valuable opportunity to communicate and publicize their views on question of public policy however if person declines to appear by invitation standing committee may require witness to appear through subpoena rule xxvi paragraph 1 committees also may subpoena documents subpoenas are used sparingly but are most common at investigative hearings s httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98336g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142

subpoena some committees delegate this authority to the chair and ranking minority member while other committees require majority approval to authorize subpoenas still other committees allow subpoenas to be authorized by either committee leaders or committee majority or have other detailed procedures g8g152g155g150g138g157g561g138g151g141g561g17g155g141g142g155g561g152g143g561g25g146g157g151g142g156g156g561g22g142g156g157g146g150g152g151g162g561 committees determine the format and order of witness testimony common format is that witness makes statement and then responds to questions from committee members committees may also employ panel format often for witnesses with divergent viewpoints it is normally the practice in this case for all panel members to make statements then for committee members to pose questions to the panel or to various panelists some observers believe this format stimulates debate and elicits more pertinent information committees sometimes use other formats for gathering information such as joint hearings field hearings seminars roundtable discussions and video conferencing with witnesses who may be located almost anywhere in the world the order in which witnesses testify is arranged at the discretion of the committee protocol dictates that member of congress generally testifies before other witnesses and similar privilege often is extended to highranking executive branch officials and to former members and other highlevel government officials celebrity witnesses may be judiciously placed in the lineup to generate media coverage and public attention to an issue testimony from academics interest group representatives and other private citizens may be arranged to ensure that committee members hear different perspectives in the most desirable order for instance to allow one individual to refute arguments made by another
