______________________________________________________________________________________ page1i i ntroduction 1 the procurement task force the task force was created on 12 january 2006 to address all procurement matters referred to the office of internal oversight services oios the creation of the task force was the result of perceived problems in procurement identified by the independent inquiry committee into the oilforfood programme and the arrest and conviction of united nations procurement officer alexander yakovlev 2 under its terms of reference the task force operates as part of oios and reports directly to the undersecretarygeneral for oios the remit of the task force is to investigate all procurement cases including all matters involving procurement bidding exercises procurement staff and vendors doing business with the united nations the united nations or the organisation the mandate of the task force also includes review of certain procurement matters which have been closed but it nevertheless has been determined that further investigation is warranted 3 the task force investigations have focused upon numerous individuals and vendors doing business with the organisation some of these matters are particularly complex and span significant periods of time since its inception more than 200 matters involving numerous procurement cases in various united nations missions and the united nations headquarters have been referred to the task force the task force continues to report on matters individually the task force has given priority to the matters involving eight staff members placed on special leave with pay including the subject 4 on 20 january 2006 the internal audit division of oios iad issued comprehensive management review of dpkos procurement operations oios procurement audit review addressing particular concerns expressed in recommendation 30 including finding that fraud indicators were present in the transaction and that the subject had involvement in referral of the ultimate vendors to the requisitioner 1 the task forces investigation has since identified that these vendors two peruvian generals and other parties associated with them have committed fraud and overcharged the organisation 5 since the issuance of the initial oios procurement audit review further draft audit review draft unpa audit review dated 20 march 2006 was issued by the iad raising concerns regarding the sale of the united nations postal administration the unpa archives 2 6 principal focus of the task forces investigation concerned indications of fraud corruption and mismanagement in the transactions identified in the oios 1 oios internal audit division comprehensive management review of the department of peacekeeping operations procurement ap200560020 19

______________________________________________________________________________________ page2procurement audit review and other transactions referred to the task force or independently identified by the task force the task force examined wealth of other evidence including voluminous forensic data electronic media hardcopy documents obtained from foreign offices and at the united nations headquarters 7 it is important to note that thorough and comprehensive review of allegations of fraud and corruption takes time an investigative body without subpoena power must rely on cooperation from various entities whose information and records are essential to any thorough and complete examination and analysis further the task force must rely upon the cooperation of the staff member the organisation and member states not all of which was immediately forthcoming this fact was particularly relevant here as set forth more fully below the investigation has revealed criminal scheme did exist in connection with the procurement of the mi26 helicopter to the mission in east timor in 2000 subject of the oios procurement audit review recommendation 30 the task forces investigation has identified that the individua ls the subject referred to the department of peacekeeping operations dpko were involved in fraudulent conduct and were assisted in their efforts by representatives of vendor involved in the transaction the task force has identified bank account in switzerland to which proceeds of the transaction were delivered the account was established specifically for the purpose of this transaction and the proceeds paid by the united nations organisation for the transaction were ultimately deposited into it the account holder is party to the transaction and has refused to release the records to the organisation 8 as set forth more fully below the task force has made extensive efforts since march 2006 to gain access to the records of this account without full examination of the financial records concerning this transaction the task force simply cannot take concluded view on the matter generally or reach firm conclusion as to whether any staff member received an improper benefit from any party to the transaction directly or indirectly therefore as discussed below the task forces investigation continues 9 further in connection with its investigation of the issue of fraud corruption and illegality the task force made repeated requests to the subject that he provide personal financial information to the task force in august 2006 questions were posed to the subject in form created by the task force which sought information and details relating to the subjects financial transactions and fi nancial holdings ultimately and after considerable debate and discussion the subject refused to comply with the task forces request thereafter the deputy secretarygeneral on behalf of the secretarygeneral and relying upon the relevant rules and regulations of the organisation issued directive to the subject in november 2006 the deputy secretarygeneral quoting the applicable staff regulations and rules which compel staff member to produce any and all information when requested by the secretarygeneral notified the subject that he was required to provide specific financial information to the task force by certain date the subject initially refused to provide the information asserting that he intended to challenge the regulations and rules cited in the dsg note the subject expressed that as matter of principle he disagreed with the need to produce financial details to the task force of either himself or his spouse ultimately however upon further direction by oios p rocurement task force report on concerned united nations staff member strictly confidential ______________________________________________________________________________________ page3the dsg the subject showed the task force records of four of his bank accounts for the period 19992005 he did not allow the task force to make copies of the documents or otherwise retain them the subject also declined to provide any information prior to 1999 or concerning 2006 such partial compliance has advanced the task forces investigation but cannot conclude it the report on the subject was delayed by the inability to secure bank records in switzerland and the financial disclosure issue set forth in the preceding paragraph the discussion with the subject concerning his bank accounts has been ongoing since august 2006 when the task force first made request of the subject to provide personal financial information ii matters investigated 10 this report addresses several procurement exercises undertaken during the course of the subjects tenure at the organisation including the matters identified in the abovementioned audit reviews several other matters have since been referred to the task force regarding the subject and also are addressed in

acquisition and possession of confidential telephone records and v the implementation of staffing support contract between the united nations and telecommunications consultants of india ltd5 it should be noted that the task force has within the last few weeks been referred an additional matter involving significant procurement exercise directly involving the subject because of this referral and the open issues in the investigation of matter set forth in ii above this report should be considered interim 3 this report focuses solely on th subject subsequent report on staff member 1 will be

some which were located outside of new york and information and evidence concerning the subject which was not forthcoming until as late as the week before the filing of this report all materials still have not been provided to the task force on some matters as discussed herein the investigation of the procurement of the mi26 helicopter has been hampered by the inability of the task force to conduct full examination of the financial transactions and examine records gathered by swiss prosecutorial authorities and held by them the swiss prosecutors have indicated that they are not able to recognize oios as law enforcement body and thus take the position that they cannot share the contents of the records directly with the task force this issue will be addressed more fully in the annual report of the ptf however this investigation is good illustration how this legal deficiency can impede the progress of the investigation the task force will recommend the organisation take the matter under consideration further the investigation has been delayed by the ongoing debate over the production of the subjects personal financial information 18 as stated elsewhere in the report it is important to emphasize that the task force has limited coercive powers and without recognized status beyond the united nations cooperation with member states vendors and other third parties is dependent upon the goodwill of the person or party whose assistance is sought 19 it should be noted however that the use of forensic tools has been invaluable in number of task force investigations and has led to the gathering of important evidence which is important in three matters the task fo rce has already referred to prosecutorial authorities forensic methods have been of significant value in this investigation as well 20 investigators visited foreign offices and interviewed united nations staff members and witnesses the task force also interviewed staff members former employees and

vendor which was detrimental to the interests of the organisation the underlying conspiracy and the extent of the subjects knowledge or involvement if any in it 22 32 the oios procurement audit review found the commercial bidding process flawed in that it demonstrated indications that bidrigging may have occurred the oios procurement audit review made several criticisms of the procurement including the fact that the procurement division only allowed seven days for vendors to respond to the first itb two initial commercial bid prices were similar the price reductions from these bidders on the second bid were too similar two vendors tyumenaviatrans and 2 nd archangelsk may have benefited from inside information and finally there may have been bid rigging on the commercial side in order to justify the pursuit of an loa 33 the oios procurement audit review noted indicators of fraud in the overall process which led to the award of the loa the auditors noted that the loa did not commence with an invitation from the united nations to peru rather it originated when the subject then chief of procurement referred peruvian officials to the field administration and logistics division fald

associated with the transaction or whether any staff member was otherwise involved in the alleged criminality second to determine whether conflicts of interest existed between the various vendors to the bidding and selection process third whether officials within the organisation otherwise acted appropriately in connection with the selection process and execution of the contracts 35 as set forth in more detail herein criminal investigation of this transaction was commenced in peru and relevant financial records were requested by the peruvian authorities from financial institution in

considerable effort in the last six months to gain access to these records to form concluded view on the question of whether the fraud involved any united nations staff member and whether any staff member was paid any sums of money by any vendor participating in this transaction directly or indirectly the task force has sought access to these records since april 2006 the task force has also requested that the principals of the vendor agree to the release of the records to the task force these individuals have refused the lack of access to these records has delayed the task forces report on this matter l etter of assist with peru 36 letter of assist loa is contractual arrangement between the united nations and member state government an loa for an aircraft charter differs from commercial air charter agreement with commercial vendor both in its award as well as its execution 37 with commercial air charters the procurement service is primarily responsible for these awards after dpko identifies an initial need it requests the procurement service to issue an invitation to bid once the procurement service receives the bids it forwards the bid documents minus financial information to dpko for technical evaluation the procurement service then presents the case to the headquarters committee on contracts the hcc and recommends vendor upon recommendation by the hcc the matter is sent to the assistant secretarygeneral of the ocss who authorizes the award at the end of this process commercial contract is signed 38 an loa on the other hand is administered only by dpko the process typically commences when dpko approaches member state governments to determine their ability to provide assets in some cases member states that are aware of requirement approach the united nations without any solicitation and offer government assets dpko staff then negotiate directly with the member state to reach an agreement as to the terms and costs the subsequent contract between the united nations and the member state is memorialized in letter of assist dpko remains responsible for the execution of the contract 39 one key benefit of an loa is that the united nations pays only for the actual hours flown by the aircraft and reimburses the member state only for actual costs conversely commercial contract is intended to be profitable for the vendor under these contracts the

transmitted the results to its headquarters in toronto as matter of course 87 company 1s dual roles in the overall process participating directly in the procurement exercise and representing other

knowledge of the commercial bid prices being offered had influenced the prices offered by him in the loa process company representative 2 stated that he could not recall he believes that if he had made conscious comparison at the time he would have remembered 125 88 company 1s involvement in these multiple capacities was inappropriate because it gave the peruvians and company 1 an unfair advantage over the united nations in the loa negotiations company 1s participation deprived the united nations of conducting transparent and fair procurement process for the procurement of the mi26 the information company 1 purposefully withheld from the united nations was relevant to the organisations decision whether or not to procure the aircraft through an loa with the peruvian government as

two lines in length on this document he noted the name fathers reference to christopher fathers procurement official 104 the loa which was the subject matter of the second document was not normally handled by the procurement service accordingly the receipt of such an unusual document which included the notation personal as discussed is noteworthy other correspondence to the subject from company

peruvians 179 118 the loa stipulated reimbursement of costs for the peruvian government in the words of the chief of fald he would not expect government to ask for one penny more than it had actually cost them and there was expectation that there would be profit margin included in the costs 180 however many of the costs on this loa were either inflated to provide substantial profit for company 3 or were completely fictional false invoices issued to the united nations 119 the peruvian investigation which uncovered the corruption established that the invoices presented by general silva tejada

representative 2 recorded the positioning costs as 503752 the difference between the actual costs of positioning the helicopter and what the united nations had been actually charged was considerable in effect the investigation has determined that the united nations was overcharged by more than us500000 124 company representative 2 later stated in letter dated 30 november 2000 to the peruvian military officials who took over responsibility for the deal after general silva tejada fled the country that company 3 had incurred us11 million actual costs for prepositioning he broke down these

197 the united nations was not aware it was paying for new rotor hub the organisation never agreed to be charged for the item separately or informed that the helicopter needed repairs before it was made operable the organisation could reasonably expect to receive helicopter which could fly any such spare parts requirements were the responsibility of the peruvians and any associated costs should have to come out of the us13500 per flight hour cost as stated in the loa 198 company representative 2 acknowledged to the task force that the united nations would not have been prepared to pay for new rotor hub 199 127 even more troubling is the fact that the new rotor hub was never actually fitted to the mi26 deployed to east timor for the organisation the oil leaks were simply patched up prior to deploying the helicopter 200 the rotor hub arrived only after the ship had sailed and was instead fitted to one of the peruvians mi26s remaining in lima201 the united nations received benefit

peru that company 3 had incurred insurance costs of 100000 which was included in the prepositioning costs charged to the united nations the task force investigation has determined that the only insurance paid on the shipping was approximately 15000 the insurer believed that the peruvians were selfinsuring the war risk for the helicopter and that other insurance was taken out by company 3 or company 1 204 test benches 129 general silva tejada told falddpko in march 2000 that the peruvians needed to purchase additional test benches for the helicopter as the ones already owned by the

been obtained for the helicopter going to east timor or if the armys own had been sent and replacements obtained for the fleet remaining in peru 130 the reimbursement for the lease of new test benches was not legitimate expense the united nations was charged us72000 month for the test benches but company 3 and peru never in fact incurred these expenses peru never leased new test benches for east timor as previously claimed by general silva tejada 207 witness confirmed that the militarys own test benches were deployed to east timor additional benches were purchased to replace them in peru with the result that the remaining two mi26s were effectively grounded 208 the united nations appears to have been fraudulent billed for these charges 131 in addition it is highly doubtful whether

that the subject was aware of or involved in any criminal scheme to defraud the united nations however any final determination concerning the question of involvement of united nations staff in this scheme if any can only be completed once the task force has received full financial data tracing the proceeds of the transactions associated with this procurement and the payments made in connection with it in that regard in order to render definitive statement on the issue the task force must examine certain financial records including company 3s account activity and transactions company 3 and company 1 officials despite their status as registered vendors and the fact that they are currently engaged with the organisation in providing goods and services to it have refused access to their records and the release of documents by swiss prosecutors currently holding them their consent to release such records would expedite the matter exponentially 147 the task force has determined that the subject had knowledge of certain facts underlying the loa negotiations in particular the conflict of interest engendered by company 1s dual roles in the competing loa and commercial bids his knowledge was unique within the united nations and his failure to identify company 1s multiple roles in the process and notify the relevant departments within the organisation constituted management

ontract with company 2 1 interim contract 154 prior to 1996 the ej electrical company was responsible for maintaining the united nations electrical equipment as well as running the electrical operations and construction for its offices in new york the contract was set to expire on 30 june 1996 so fmd submitted request for procurement of these services on 18 march 1996 the procurement service issued request for proposal rfp for new contract the contract was one of the largest awarded by the united nations valued at approximately us 35 million with an option to extend it annually for approximately us4 million year 155 mr om taneja chief of the plant and engineering section drafted the technical specifications and the scope of work for the rfp at the request of mr benon sevan assistant secretarygeneral for the office of central support services and mr richard nasereddin director of the fmd mr taneja drafted the proposal in such manner that limited the number of vendors who would qualify to bid mr sevan and mr nasereddin told mr taneja that they wanted to make sure the union employees currently employed under the ej electrical contract remained in place they also wanted to make sure nonunion companies would not bid on the contract 230 156 few vendors responded only three of the five companies that submitted bids were considered technically compliant as result of the poor response mr alain fontaine procurement officer and mr bahel officerincharge procurement and transportation division amended the rfp and issued another tender for the contract this time it offered fixed fee for electrical services with the hope that this would encourage more responses it did not the procurement service only received three bids this time including bids by ej electric and company 2 both of which had responded to the first rfp 157 on 27 june 1996 after recommendation by the headquarters committee on contracts company 2 was awarded the contract the contract was for term of five years with an option to extend it three additional years 158 the contract however was not immediately executed the parties still had to resolve several outstanding issues before they could sign final contract during this time both the procurement service and fmd wanted to make sure there would not be any interruption in electrical services to the united nations buildings because the general assembly would be in session 231 consequently the organisation decided it needed an interim contract to cover these services until the parties reached final agreement 230 staff member 13 interviews 21

work 35 hours per week plus an additional 25 hours per week or 375 hours per week while the general assembly was in session 233 160 one outstanding issue concerned the electricians union at the time the electricians were represented by local 3 of the international brotherhood of electrical workers local 3 234 fmd was apprehensive that under the current collective bargaining agreement the union employees might not have been able to perform all of the work required by the contract accordingly company 2 agreed in the interim contract to use its best efforts to enter into collective bargaining agreements as soon as possible reflecting all assumptions and requirements set forth in the rfp and the proposal 235 161 martin bender buildings management service staff member decided to confront the union issue and contact company 2 he also suggested that the united nations negotiate directly with the local union ola however advised against directly negotiating with the unions which it believed would have placed the united nations in precarious position 236 ola cautioned mr bender that any such negotiations must be handled by company 2 since it was company 2s responsibility to meet its contractual obligations 2 1997 fiveyear contract 162 on 31 january 1997 the united nations entered into fiveyear contract with company 2 for electrical operations maintenance and electrical construction services 237 at the expiration of the contract in june 2001 the organisation had the option to extend the contract annually for up to three years 163 pursuant to the contract company 2s

only breached the contract but also jeopardized the safety and security of united nations personnel for example in august 2001 the fire control center conducted response drill test of the fire pump in the secretariat building after laying out scenario that there was fire on the upper floors of the secretariat and that the pump needed to be activated to ensure water reached the upper floors the electrician that responded could not operate the pump had knowledge of the system and stated it had been years since he had been in the fire pump room 240 figure errol edwards incident report

november 2001 166 in addition company 2 still had not completed its electrical inventory nor had it developed detailed preventative maintenance plan242 also there were two significant problems with company 2s performance under the contract 1 the united nations inability to track employee time and attendance and 2 the electricians outright refusal to perform certain jobs 167 first absenteeism amongst company 2s electricians was systemic problem from the very beginning and affected the day to day operations of the facilities the oios audit conducted in 2002 showed how the plant and engineering section had capability of monitoring attendance of company 2 electricians and relied solely on the records submitted by company 2 as to what electricians were working when the plant and engineering section acknowledged that it only conducted spot checks on invoices submitted by company 2 claiming work performed without any system in place to verify whether the electricians were actually present or absent that day the issue of the unusually high absenteeism was highlighted in mr santangelos memorandum to edward perry general foreman of company 2 243 242 om taneja notetofile

attendance verification system even though it was required under the contract the united nations therefore was unable to monitor and verify an employees attendance or nonattendance 244 169 similarly the organisation was unable to confirm whether an employee was entitled to be paid for unused sick or vacation leave 245 although the united nations repeatedly requested this information company 2 refused to provide any kind of documentation regarding what each employee was entitled to for vacation sick and workers compensation days 170 the lack of employee attendance made it difficult for the united nations to receive timely services under the contract there were instances when electricians were on extended leaves of absence without being replaced for over three weeks 246 244 an2002454 6

perry 26 july 2000 171 without knowing who was showing up for work each week the united nations was unable to complete its projects on time as result building maintenance suffered and many projects were not completed 247 172 second significant problem was the electricians performance of their contractual duties company 2s electricians refused to perform certain jobs such as basic electrical work though explicitly covered under the contract the electricians claimed that certain work orders violated their local unions collective bargaining agreement moreover even when they did complete projects many were finished far behind schedule as result the united nations had tremendous backlog of work orders some of which were eightmonths old 173 the united nations raised both of these issues numerous times with company 2 the united nations repeatedly complained to company 2 about the extended absences of company 2 employees as well as the companys failure to manage the electricians and to complete projects 248 247 the problems were so great that in 2002 an oios audit recommended that the united nations immediately establish personnel veri fication system an2002454 pa ra 21 recommendation 6 6

strictly confidential ______________________________________________________________________________________ page58 figure claudio santangelo memorandum to edward perry 9 january 2001 177 company 2 however was longer managing the work orders instead the company relied upon local union representative to liaise with the united nations for example mr taneja contacted company 2s employee mr lenny copicotto who served as the union representative mr taneja asked mr copicotto to explain why his employees refused to perform basic electrical repairs such as installing light fixtures and outlights which appeared to be covered by the contract he also asked the union representative to clarify local union guidelines mr copicotto insisted improperly that such work was outside the scope of the contract and therefore violated the local collective bargaining agreement he added that because the project constituted an outside job the united nations would have to pay the employees additional money to complete it 178 despite the united nations attempts nothing was resolved in fact company 2 employees stopped performing basic services such as maintenance work and making minor repairs as result there was significant impact on united nations operations and the failure to perform such services jeopardized the safety and security of united nations personnel furthermore the organisation was forced to hire outside contractorsat an additional costto complete these necessary and urgent projects 252 251 claudio santangelo memorandum to ed ward perry 9 january 2001 252 claudio santangelo

problems 179 from the very beginning senior management was well aware that company 2 was not meeting its contractual obligations with the organisation as early as 1996 staff member 13 began to notice problems with company 2s performance and started documenting his concerns he notified mr bender in fmd as well as numerous people in the procurement service including mr bahel mr alain fontaine mr yakovlev and mr brian streb specifically staff member 13 mentioned that the organisation needed to confront the issue of employee nonattendance because it negatively affected the united nations 180 similarly the subject received copy of the audit review of september 1999 which outlined the problems253 in addition to the audit review the subject received the joint response from the procurement service and fmd in november 1999 drafted by mr bahel and mr bender the audit which had taken place in january 1997 identified serious deficiencies in the procurement process and company 2s award 254 for example the auditors criticized the procurement service for not giving vendors enough time to respond to the rfp fact reflected in the poor response it found fault with the cancellation of the original rfp the reason for its cancellation and the subsequent rebidding it also criticized the rating system which was instituted after the rfp was issued and the reason why company 2 won over ej electric 181 fmd viewed company 2s failure to perform its contractual obligations as direct breach of the contract 255 accordingly in january 2001 the procurement service notified company 2 that the organisation would not tolerate its lack of performance256 specifically mr john mullen section chief in the procurement service complained 253 the subject also received procurementfmds response to the audit in november 1999 which was drafted by mr sanjaya bahel ps and mr bender fmd 254 notably although the aud it review identified serious deficiencies many of the issues raised by the auditors were not conducted by pr ocurement personnel in accordance with the revised procurement manual which was not released until 1998 255 martin bender memorandum to bruce rashkow 1 december 2001 256 john

the untied nations exercised two of its options permitted under the contract first due to budget cuts in the biennium of 20002001 it reduced the number of electricians from 27 to 22 second the united nations decided to use its own employees for relamping projects which merely entailed replacing light bulbs and making minor electrical repairs the organisation hoped the latter step would free up more of company 2s employees to handle the backlog of work orders of more complicated projects 257id 258idoios p rocurement task force report on concerned united nations staff member strictly

nations the grievance alleged that the united nations use of its own employees for relamping and minor electrical repairs viol ated the electricians collective bargaining agreement 185 when the united nations confronted company 2 the company blamed the problems on the union company 2 asserted that local 3 instructed the electricians to purposefully slow down their rate of work and even refuse to perform some projects all together 259 3 the december 2000 memorandum to the subject 186 in november 2000 the subject received notice of the reduction in company 2 electricians 260 the following month

rights under the contract under the contract the united nations had the right to make those changes it deemed necessary even if those decisions conflicted with the unions collective bargaining agreement 264 indeed company 2 was bound to make sure that any agreement it reached with the unions was to fully reflect and implement company 2s obligations under the organisations contract moreover company 2 was not to enter into any collective bargaining agreement that conflicted with the terms and conditions of the united nations contract 265 190 in response the subject requested in december 2000 that mr mullen of the procurement service and mr bender of fmd determine whether or not company 2 was in breach of the contract for its employees failure to work 266 since company 2 contracted to

page64formalized in memorandum of understanding mou the subjectserving as the officerincharge of the procurement service in 2001 authorized the mou with company 2 which ultimately left the united nations in weaker position the effect of the mou was to disadvantage the organisation to greater extent than the original contract staff member 15 stated that the subject would not authorize any document while serving as the officerincharge of the procurement service until he had the contract in question and all related documents in his presence 268 staff member 15 explained that the subject would not just sign off on any document without first reviewing the contract file and other documents associated with the issue at hand so that in this case he had an understanding of the elements of the mou before he authorized it 192 specifically the mou was intended to resolve the outstanding issues regarding company 2s performance under the contract at the meeting company 2 agreed to take several actions including 1 the creation of performance plan 2 generating specific plan to deal with the backlog of work orders and address future work orders and 3 developing system to distinguish construction work orders from maintenance work orders 269 in response the united nations agreed to reimbursement plan for company 2s outstanding invoices which the united nations had not paid because of the electricians refusal to complete certain projec ts if the united nations was satisfied with company 2s new performance plan it agreed to pay company 2 onethird of the total amount owed after thirty days if the united nations found company 2 had substantially complied with its performance plan it would pay the remaining balance 270 193 ola prepared the draft mou added comments to make sure each of these issues was addressed and asked for input from the procurement service and fmd 271 in spite of olas comments and the primary purpose of an mou to address these outstanding issues the final version did not adopt any of the recommendations as result the mou failed utterly to address crucial items needed to protect the organisations rights under the contract 272 194 first the final version of the mou did not require company 2 to have formal detailed performance plan 195 second the mou did not include any specific measures to resolve the backlog of work orders for instance company 2 was not required to complete certain number of work orders within specific time frame the mou also did not address how the parties would track classify and monitor future work orders 196 third it failed to differentiate between electrical construction from electrical maintenance necessary difference which would have provided guidance to the united nations as to how it should classify future work orders without clarifying the classification of work orders once again the local unions would be able to refuse certain 268 staff member 15 interview 2 november 2006 269 jay pozenel

on the basis that they were outside the scope of the current contract similarly the mou failed to include any detailed provision regarding preventive maintenance for united nations facilities 197 conversely rather than holding company 2 to its original obligations the mou in fact provided several advantages to company 2 for instance company 2 was allowed to assume responsibility for relamping traditionally done by united nations staff 273 company 2 was supposed to assign an employee at additional cost to specifically handle the relamping work the task force investigation continues to determine if lamper was indeed provided and if so whether there was any additional cost to the organisation 198 likewise company 2 was able to add senior class of electricians which later proved both problematic and costly to the united nations under the original contract maintenance electricians performed minor electrical jobs 274 the mou however added class electricians to handle all electrical construction work class electricians were considered to be more experienced electricians and therefore paid at significantly higher rate normal pay and overtime dbm designated electricians remained responsible for standard electrical work because the mou did not differentiate between electrical construction and electrical maintenance senior class electricians ended up performing minor electrical repairs this work which should have been handled by less senior employees ended up costing the organisation more money since company 2 was able to use senior electricians for it 275 199 moreover company 2 succeeded in getting the united nations to pay its outstanding invoices without quid pro quo ola had advised that the organisation should not pay company 2 until the company came up with performance plan see supra paragraph 65 under the mou however company 2 was entitled to payment without having to create such performance plan 276 200 despite these glaring defects the subject as

sure technical points like the ones raised by ola were indeed in the best interests of the organisation since fmd never told the procurement service not to extend the contract with company 2 the subject disregarded the legal advice and authorized the amendment without hccs approval 284 the subject was not acting within his rights when he made the decision to not heed the advice of ola ola made the determination that the mou changed the terms and conditions of the original contract the mou superseded the three year extension because the united nations was dealing with different contract so exercising the three year option under the original contract terms appeared to be invalid 209 the threeyear extension failed to benefit the organisation for the very same reason the mou did these subsequent agreements simply did not address the systemic problems arising out of the original contract once again the parties never addressed company 2s failure to provide the united nations with performance plan system to handle work orders or distinguish electrical maintenance from electrical construction 210 it is clear that the subject was made aware of these shortcomings when he received

changes were implemented and fmd agreed extension of the contract without correcting these problems 3 the second amendment to the contract 212 as the contract entered its fifth year the united nations continued to experience the same problems with the electricians 287 inexplicably the united nations amended the contract with company 2 for second time in april 2002 without addressing any of these issues 213 for second time ola had numerous comments which were not incorporated into the final version ola had expressed concern with company 2s performance and tried to protect the organisations rights under the contract consequently it sent draft with comment in november 2001 to both mr saunders and mr bender after negotiations with company 2s counsel ola sent second draft to mr saunders and mr bender which highlighted the changes made by company 2 288 214 despite olas efforts the final version did not reflect any of the needed changes to resolve the outstanding problems in fact company 2 gained several advantages under the amended version first company 2 changed the classification and caliber of its electricians twenty dbm electricians were re classified as serving in more senior capacities which affected the cost of work performed on overtime 215 second company 2 removed from the contract fixed number of compensation days for its employees under the original contract and ola draft the electricians were entitled to limited number of sick and worker compensation days 10 each the final version however eliminated the fixed number which left the question of workers leave openended and ambiguous 216 third the united nations also lost the option to employ apprentice electricians apprentices had been performing basic electrical work for the upkeep of united nations facilities it was costeffective since such elementary projects did not require the more expensive senior electricians the amended contract eliminated this options and the loss of this was significant

simple electrical preventative maintenance by eliminating apprentices the problem was exacerbated 217 lastly the new version also provided rates for overtime payment at level well above industry standards 289 the industry average at the time was approximately 2025 more than the rate per hour to include for overhead and profit290 ola had recommended the hourly rate be the same regardless of whether the minimum number of man hours per week was met if company 2 did not meet the required number credit was due the united nations and conversely if company 2 worked in excess of the minimum requirement they would be compensated for the work performed under the final version however company 2 was paid at rate of 30 higher than their regular rate for work in excess of the minimum while any credit due the united nations was the same figure used in the draft prepared by ola 291 chart f changes in the second amendment terms 218 after forensic analysis of the subjects united nations

going to continue to receive full pay and benefits for unauthorized sick days and workers compensation days in excess of approved amounts without the ability to control sickness and absenteeism the u

never sought or achieved company 2 failed to provide the united nations with personnel monitoring system to track attendance and did not submit timely attendance sheets to allow the organisation to appropriately document and disperse payment for authorized work of their employees 222 in the execution of the second amendment the sick and workers compensation day allotments were eliminated when the subject received this email the terms of the second amendment were not finalized therefore the subject had an opportunity to address the issue of quantified sick days as well as the other changes ultimately made to the draft amendment by company 2 again it appears that the subject was made aware of essential elements of key contractual decisions that were contemplated but failed to properly address the needs of the organisation 4 financial effect on the united nations 223 in 2004 mr giulio mantin then acting chief of the plant and engineering section organized team to examine the time and attendance issues of company 2 employees the team conducted an exhaustive review of employee time sheets and attendance records unfortunately however they were only able to analyze three years 2000 to 2003 as result of company 2s claim that it longer possessed earlier attendance records 294 224 the team discovered that company 2 overbilled the united nations approximately us800000 295 some

representative assigned to the company 2 contract disagreed staff member 14 did not identify any amount credited back to the united nations which he explained would have been noticeable due to the size of the amount owed 300 226 the task force also continues to determine the financial impact of the mou and subsequent amendments and the findings of mr mantins team regarding the overcharges the task force will report in full on this issue in separate report focusing solely on the company 2 contracts valuation by the taskforce 227 company 2 repeatedly and systematically violated its contractual obligations by failing to perform the electrical services required under the contract in timely manner and in some instances altogether on this issue company 2 cast blame upon the local union for instructing the electricians to purposefully engage in work slowdowns and work refusals such circumstance even if true does not exculpate the company even if such circumstances existed company 2 nevertheless remained ultimately responsible for its employees when company 2 executed the original contract with the united nations in 1996 it agreed that any subsequent arrangement with the unions would comply with the contractual terms accordingly company 2 was obligated to make sure their union contract did not conflict with their contract with the organisation and it maintained full responsibility to ensure that its employees performed all of the services guaranteed to the organisation similarly company 2 failed to create and implement performance plan as required under the contract failed to develope an effective system to address the enormous backlog of work orders or deal with future work orders and failed to maintain records to confirm employee ttendance as result of these failings and other acts the united nations overpaid company 2s personnel 296 staff member 17 in terview 31 may 2006 297 staff member 19 in terview 14 july 2006 298 claudio santangelo memorandum

position as the officerincharge of the procurement service and assistant secretarygeneral of ocss the subject had gained substantial knowledge of these problems and was repeatedly made aware of these

the disposal of the items indeed according to staff member 21 he asked lisa fagerlund the then chief of arms if the items should be transferred to arms 336 according to staff member 21 ms fagerlund told him that was not necessary because the items were not archives337 261 an unpa efficiency review report supported this position when it concluded that the terminology archives is not an accurate

auction houses to the procurement department and failed to report the intended sale of the archives to the property survey board 275 the omission of reference to the property survey case in the rfp constitutes breach of procurement regulations the existing rules and regulation require the participation of the property survey board to ensure the appropriate mode of sale and disposal the subject as chief of the procurement service failed to ensure that these regulations were followed the task force disagrees with the subjects assessment that such referral was dispensable procedure because approval had been implicitly given by the under secretarygeneral the relevant rules do not provide for an exception upon the approval of the under secretarygeneral moreover at the time the rfp was issued neither the procurement officer nor the chief of pd was aware of memorandum indicating such approval by the under secretarygeneral 276 the 4 february 2003 letter authored and signed by the

it by the under secretarygeneral for oios as it properly was within her purview b u nited nations telephone system 280 at relevant times the telephone records for the united nations headquarters were electronically maintained in the secretariat building these records detailed inter alia the telephone numbers of the outgoing calls dialed the times duration of the call and the extension from which

instituted and outlined steps to be followed for any request of it data which included telephone computer and email records staff member 6 director itsd told the task force that these guidelines were designed and implemented to protect the privacy rights of the staff member the underlying objective was to insure that only duly authorized access to data was given and that such requests for access were fully noted requests for certain information had to be directed to the director of itsd itsd was authorized to only accept requests from oios ola the office of human resources management ohrm and chief of security and safety service the memorandum further provided that any request must be in writing and provide pertinent information such as short description of the data required the name of the staff member from the requesting office in whose presence the search will be conducted and to whom the records will be delivered in exceptional cases itsd could respond to verbal requests from an authorized official if the requester submitted written request immediately thereafter moreover the designated staff member from the requesting office was required to sign note confirming his request for access to the data finally the memorandum established special register to be maintained in secure place in the office of the director of itsd with limited access control 285 on 8 june 2001 mr corell responded with written memorandum 364 he agreed interim measures were warranted and suggested that more formal review of the matter was necessary by way of an administrative instruction he believed the matter would need to be carefully examined and felt any future united nations rules on the practice should be based on those of the national jurisdictions and other similar international organizations 286 during 2001 the subject in his capacity as director of facilities and commercial services division received copy of mr corrells memorandum 287 on 29 november 2004 secretarygenerals

was the chief of the voice communications unit and voice and messaging section of itsd in the past staff member 7 occasionally received requests for detailed telephone calling records because this information was highly confidential he provided it only to those individuals who were authorized to receive it staff member 7 typically received such requests from the security service or from oios he explained that if request came from one of his superiors he followed the established protocol if he received request from someone outside his chain of command however he referred the matter to mr eduardo blinder or mr john campbell in itsd 367 290 initially staff member 7 said he did not recall generating the records found on the diskette in the subjects office nor any requests made by the subject 368 however he later admitted that over the years he had received confidential requests for telephone data including one from the subject after his interview he telephoned task force investigator to clarify his original statement 369 in this subsequent conversation he told the task force that in june 2004 he was called to the subjects office and the subject asked him to run call histories on certain telephone extensions which the subject provided the subject further instructed him that he was not to disclose this request to anyone staff member 7 ran the numbers copied the information onto an electronic storage device and delivered it to the subject the subject then asked staff member 7 whether he saved the data on his computer after confirming he had staff member 7 said the subject instructed him to delete both the request and the telephone numbers from his computer he again cautioned staff member 7 he was not to say anything staff member 7 returned to his office and ran deletion software program to remove all the information and make the fact of the search undetectable 370 2 absence of formal request for the information 291 the task force contacted

identify any request for mr nairs telephone records for the months of may and june 2004 staff member 6 told the task force that as result of this inquiry he discovered the subject had indeed contacted staff member 6 directly to obtain this information he confirmed that the subjects request was not officially recorded nor was it handled in the proper manner 3 absence of notification to dileep nair 293 mr nair had never been advised by any united nations official that his office telephone records were sought or obtained for review in fact he only learned of this fact recently after the task forces investigation exposed the matter if mr nair had been advised of such request he said he would have vehemently objected because he considers such actions to be highly improper mr nair explained that oios was intended to be operationally independent accordingly special measures should have been taken to obtain the telephone records of any oios representative especially that of its usg while he could not cite any explicit rules preventing the release of this information in his view this conduct threatened oioss statutory independence 294 the task force investigators asked mr nair whether he had been subject of any investigative action he informed the task force that an incident had occurred in june or july 2004 an anonymous letter surfaced in connection with complaints made by the united nations staff council alleging corrupt practices in recruitment and promotion in his office at that time the chef cabinet told him ms catherine bertini under secretarygeneral for the department of management would be looking into this matter mr nair said he was cleared of these allegations 295 notwithstanding this complaint mr nair reiterated his belief that it was highly improper for the department of management to investigate oios on the contrary any investigation into oios should have been conducted by an external independent entity pursuant to the rules of protocol and investigation which were formulated in 2003 or 2004 all investigations were strictly within the purview of oios alone and other division mr nair acknowledged lack of clearly defined supervisory rules on this issue and believed the secretarygeneral had the authority to investigate all improprieties oios p rocurement task force report on concerned united nations staff member strictly confidential ______________________________________________________________________________________ page914 the subjects explanation 296 the task force showed the subject several interoffice memorandums discussing the protection of electronic records at least one of which he received as copy 371 he admitted that at the time of his request he knew the protocol stipulated that all requests for this material needed to be documented 297 shortly before mr withers carried out the subjects instruction to obtain the telephone data the subject was called to ms bertinis office ms bertini asked the subject to retrieve mr nairs telephone records for specific time period although the subject claimed ms bertini never provided specific reason for her request she did explain that the secretarygeneral himself requested the investigation 372 she added that the investigation was extremely confidential 298 the subject conceded that while it was ms bertinis idea to retrieve the telephone records it was his decision to circumvent the proper procedure in light of the confidential nature of the investigation consequently he decided he would not submit the request to mr blinder and have it recorded instead he chose to deal directly with the staff member who conducted this type of search 299 the subject also admitted he contacted mr withers directly to run the request and that mr withers provided him with the results of his search the subject stated that he never instructed mr withers to delete the print out however the subject confirmed instructing mr withers not to divulge the search to anyone 373 300 the subject claimed he relied on ms bertinis assertion that the secretary general authorized this investigation the subject acknowledged that it was unclear as to which department had the authority to investigate the head of oios nevertheless he believed the secretarygeneral had the necessary authority to do so in his view he was simply doing what he had been instructed to do by his superior 301 the task force uncovered some evidence which appeared to corroborate the subjects belief that the secretarygeneral authorized the investigation the task force was told by ms bertini that she instructed the subject to obtain the telephone records as she in turn had been instructed by the secretarygeneral himself to conduct an inquiry of mr nair and leaks to the press in fact the task force identified an email of 29 june 2004 sent by the subject to ms bertini which referred to your call with sg in the message the subject informed ms bertini that i am checking other details the one communication previously mentioned on 28 may for 11 mins 374 the task force discovered that telephone call had been placed to switzerland from mr nairs extension on 28 may 2004 375 according to the

page92minutes initially the subject told the task force that he was not told of the reason for the investigation however when he was asked why he focused on this particular call he admitted he had been told to look for telephone calls to switzerland and possibly vienna 376 the subject believed the investigation of mr nair was related to pending oios investigation into mr rudd lubbers 302 the secretarygeneral was asked about his knowledge of events surrounding the retrieval of mr nairs telephone records the secretarygeneral explained that he had been concerned about leaks of confidential information from oios and in particular by mr nair and he therefore charged ms bertini to look into the matter he said he was not aware how ms bertini was to accomplish this nor did he inquire valuation by the taskforce 303 the subject claimed the only reason he requested staff member 7 to extract the history for these telephone numbers was as re sult of the instruction of his supervisor ms bertini and believed that the secretarygeneral had authorized this investigation having been so assured by her this belief appears to have been made in good faith as evidenced by his 29 june 2004 email to ms bertini in which he references the secretarygeneral 304 nevertheless the subject admitted he knew th ere were firm procedures in place at the time to gather such sensitive information and that he failed to follow them in fact protocol existed which required such requests to be memorialized in writing and tracked such information is obviously sensitive and access should be duly noted in fact bulletin came into effect shortly thereafter in november 2004 providing precise and exhaustive guidance on the manner in which such information may be obtained and those authorized to retrieve such information the subject admitted to knowingly circumventing the established protocol at the time but claimed he did so in order to maintain confidentiality 305 the task force is of the view that the process the subject employed to obtain this information and thereafter maintain the secrecy of the search was improper although there was formal rule at the time governing the access to such material there were several memorandums addressing the topic and itsd had an established procedure in place 377 the subject failed to comply with the spirit and practice of these protocols and his acts resulted in failure to document the request in any manner and resulted in the destruction of evidence of the search 376 the subject interview 4 october 2006 377 the secretarygenerals bulletin

efficiency of operations of the united nations missions as discussed below 319 first deployments proved that tcil was not prepared to meet its obligation under the contract to supply missions with qualified personnel in timely manner primarily because of two reasons first the majority of tcil staff deployed to the missions either did not have valid drivers license an rfp requirement andor could not pass the united nations drivers test for the operation of 4x4 motor vehicle 400 second tcil was not adequately providing for the general welfare of its personnel as stipulated in article 13 of the contract 401 deployed with us300 to us500 on hand tcil staff was unable to cover their boarding and food402 in fact the situation became so dire that the missions themselves were forced to intervene

sinvolvement 1 the resident auditors findings 329 in october and november 2000 monuc staff members requested the missions resident auditor to examine the tcil contract one specific area they asked him to examine was whether tcil was paying msa amounts to its employees which were required if not tcil was failing to adhering to labour standards 421 330 during the course of his review the resident auditor discovered serious problems with the contract he contacted both cess and the procurement service and suggested that oios get involved in particular he was concerned that the united nations had been reimbursing tcil for msa amounts but tcil was not actually paying 420 sanjaya bahel memorandum to mr phelan 6 november 2000 421 edwin nhliziyo email to livio calgaro 24 october 2000 edwin

whether the united nations had any obligations with respect to labour laws accordingly he requested oios to review the contract to clarify these matters 422 2 response of the united nations headquarters 331 cess officials responded positively to the resident auditors request and supported both formal review of the contract and intervention by oios in its correspondence to the procurement service cess further maintained that tcil was supposed to show proof of payment of msa amounts before the united nations paid the contractor and expressed hope that the procurement service will enforce this provision in the contract the exchange with cess and the resident auditor was forwarded by mr sachdeva to mr bahel officerincharge of the procurement service and mr mullen chief of the headquarters procurement section of the procurement service 423 332 on the other hand the procurement service did not welcome the resident auditors involvement mr bahel instructed the case officer with copy sent to john mullen and sergei shishkin of the internal audit division to clarify certain provisions in the contract to cess mr bahel underscored that msa amounts were payable to the contractor when they invoice us he further asserted that contractual clause stated that msadsa elements were payable directly or fully to the contractors staff in conclusion he offered to refer the issue to ola if fald needed any further clarification 424 333 mr bahel further expressed his discontent with the resident auditors actions in critical email that he sent directly to the resident auditor and his supervisor mr sergei shishkin ms esther stern the director of the audit and management consultancy division amcd received copy of mr bahels email 425 while mr bahel acknowledged that contract was full of problems and if not corrected could lead to potential dispute he openly disagreed with the resident auditors interpretation of the contract moreover he criticized the unsolicited involvement by the resident auditor because he felt the interpretation of contract fell within the jurisdiction of the procurement service furthermore mr bahel asserted it was the procurement services prerogative to take action to involve ola or which ever other office when considered appropriate 426 334 mr bahel also dismissed the allegations that tcil was failing to provide for its staff he told oios that the procurement service had reported the issue to tcil which assured the united nations that as government companies sic it was legally bound 422 edwin nhliziyo email to kanwarjit sachdeva 1

______________________________________________________________________________________ page101to follow the laws and rules regarding wagesbenefits including deputing to foreign land427 furthermore he maintained the procurement service had right to intervene in internal matters between tcil and its staff additionally mr bahel asserted that the contract did not contain clause that allowed oios to audit the contractor or its contracts with its employees in mr bahels view an internal staffing problem was not any of the united nations business 428 335 contrary to mr bahels assertions the contract did permit the united nations to audit tcil and the contract with its staff article 16 of the contract required tcil to maintain separate complete and accurate set of books and records relating to the staffing support which were to be available at all times for inspection and audit by or mission auditors 429 336 similarly the contract squarely addressed the issue of msa payments article 13 of the contract stipulated that the paym ent of msa to tcil was conditional upon the contractors provision of satisfactory proof that equivalent benefits have been paid or applied by the contractor to or for the benefit of the personnel 430 furthermore prior to the amendments to the contract in 2001 the missions chief administrative officer had the discretion to make mission subsistence facilities av ailable to the contractors staff in lieu of payment of subsistence amounts to the contractor 431 337 finally article 77 of the contract required that any contracts between the contractor and the personnel shall conform to the relevant provisions of this contract 432 338 consequently under these various sections the united nations had the right to verify tcils compliance with its obligations and indeed an obligation to do so the procurement services failure to exercise due diligence and to investigate the numerous allegations of tcils noncompliance from both the tcil and the united nations staff was inadequate and questionable ultimately such failure was an act in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme which existed between mr bahel the kohlis and tcil to enrich the company through inappropriate favourable treatment by mr bahel g t hesubject searly involvement 339 in november 2000 the subject became actively involved in the tcil contract after the procurement service received the comments of the resident auditor at monuc 340 prior to this date the subject generally legated the matter to mr bahel for example this was the case when mr n singh of tcil nanak kohli

______________________________________________________________________________________ page102subject to lodge several complaints against the united nations missions and their actions in particular he wanted to meet with the subject to address the contradictions and utter confusion between the headquarters and missions and problems with the implementation of the contract created by the united nations missions by paying tcil staff in cash without authorization and providing copies of the tcil contract in violation of the confidentiality clause433 in response the subject simply referred the matter to mr bahel and asked that he handle it 341 however the subject became personally involved and reacted strongly in response to the resident auditors actions in several emails to ms stern and mr nair the subject censured the resident auditor for getting involved in and interpreting contemporaneous contract the subject questioned the competence and expertise of the resident auditor as to his ability and appropriateness of him trying to interpret contractual terms he suggested that the resident auditor overstepped his boundaries and that this issue was best left to ola 434 342 in an email to the senior management of oios the subject expressed his disbelief that an auditor was interpreting an ongoing contract and warned of the potential impact the recommendations could have on the contract he found the resident auditor to have gone beyond prudence to engage in discussions of an operational nature 435 343 month later the ongoing inquiries from the resident auditor prompted further involvement of the subject in his email to the senior management of oios ola and ocss the subject warned that the auditor may be taking the organisation on slippery road to litigation through his interpretation of the contract with tcil striving to ensure there will not be any ugly fingerpointing in the event the exercise of the contract becomes contentious the subject urged to develop clear definition of roles and address the issue of the auditors acceptance of responsibility for the recommendations or advice they provide 436 the subject then forwarded this email to both mr bahel and mr sachdeva ten days later the subject wrote to mr bahel again suggesting mr bahel contact ms stern to discuss auditors role in tcil contract 437 433 n singh email to the s ubject 1 november 2000

discuss the role of the auditor stand in sharp contrast to the subjects previous deference to mr bahel on all the matters surrounding this contract by criticizing the resident auditor before his supervisors the subject appears to be attempting to limit the inquiries of the resident auditor and effectively thwart his efforts such behaviour also directly contradicted the subjects claim that he merely supervised his employees and played little role in the implementation of the contract itself 438 h s ubsequent investigation 345 in spite of the resistance by the procurement service the resident auditor continued his investigation he eventually learned that tcil had engaged the services of thirdparty enkay associates enkay associates provided tcil with the staff that tcil eventually sent to staff the united nations missions significantly tcil failed to disclose this material fact to the united nations in fact such an arrangement was in direct breach of the contract under the contract with the united nations tcil was permitted to use subcontractor provided it obtained the prior written approval and clearance by the united nations for all subcontractors 439 since tcil never notified the united nations of its arrangements with thirdparty this action violated the contract 346 there was ample reason for the resident auditors concerns reports from monuc unamsil and untaet

contract with the deployed staff careful review revealed that enkay associates was not obligated to pay employees dispatched to the field their msa amounts the contract did not contain provision for these payments even though the tcil contract required such clause 444 this too was in violation of the contract which required any subcontract to comply with the terms of original tcil agreement 445 348 furthermore the resident auditor raised the issue of connection between the tcils representative to the united nations mr n singh and enkay associates 446 he believed mr ub singh was manage r of

time and for any reason request the replacement of any of the personnel the contractor shall at its own cost and expense replace such personnel forthwith and in manner that will not have an adverse impact on the performance of the staffing support 451 nevertheless the procurement service proceeded on the basis of olas interpretation of the contract terms the procurement service also accepted

regarding the subject contract he assured that the procurement service was indeed trying to resolve the iss ues in due consultation with fald ola and the vendor 453 353 with respect to the payment of the msa to staff the subject said the procurement service had not been earlier notified of tcils failure to do so on the contrary he believed that for the most part tcil was paying its personnel also the subject did not believe it would be appropriate for the united nations to comment on the financial costing of the company to determine whether or not they was profiting from the msa or any other component of their bid 454 354 the subject acknowledged that monuc however was special case because the mission independently paid tcil staff advances against future msa payments which was in direct violation of the contract he claimed the procurement service was never told about the problems at monuc prior to the mission paying out the msa amounts 455 355 finally the subject conveyed tcils

tcil was providing them with all the benefits and dues as per their agreement with the company the purpose of the letter was to inform the united nations that misguided colleagues who were possibly bribed had been submitting false allegations regarding the payment of benefits further the letter indicated that interested parties were trying to blackmail tcil so that the staffing contract with tcil was cancelled 461 the task force has located copy of the email to tcil team leaders that demonstrates that employees were coerced into signing this petition 462 361 in the interview with the task

amend it to fix the problems but recalled other details 463 however the facts bear out that the subject weighed in on the side of mr bahel and principally adopted the companys defenses to the claims as expressed by tcil officials and mr bahel it is on this issue that the subjects actions become troubling on their face the claims by the tcil contract staff were serious and if true constituted breach of contract and potentially fraudulent conduct by the company by accepting mr bahels position on the matter without further scrutiny of the claims by an independent entity and defending his

evidence that the msa was being applied for its intended purpose mr bahel also advised the subject of other changes which he characterized as nonoperational 466 363 the subject agreed with mr bahels view of the nonhire clause and the payment of msa to tcil staff as nonoperational furthermore while acknowledging his desire to obtain falds support for the amendment he nevertheless was determined to quickly resolve the matter rather than continuously rehashing issues that have been discussed and concurred 467 364 consequently the subject executed amendment 1 to the tcil contract amendment 1 on 15 may 2001 468 which contained several major changes first the amendment clearly and firmly stated that the united nations was to pay the msa amounts to tcil and not to its personnel 469 second the amendment extended the deployment schedule for tcil staff from 15 to 30 business days third the amendment prohibited the missions from offering employment to tcil staff for at least six months after their contract with tcil was terminated in return tcil made concession to take all reasonable measures to ensure that the personnel conform to and abide by all written or oral rules and regulations to pass the drivers test and obtain drivers permit issued by such mission to have the ability to operate vehicle with the mission area 470 these terms were further to the detriment of the organisation and the contract staff and allowed the company method to defend against the contract staffs claims the changes benefited the company and placed the organisation in weaker position to ensure that funds

contract was seriously hampered by tcils failure to provide its personnel in the various missions with adequate food and lodging or to pay their salaries in full and on time 484 furthermore the audit found that tcils actions constituted violation of the contract on tcils part which resulted in disruptions in the missions operations and obliged two missions monuc and unamsil to make cash advances

least should have exercised caution and referred the matter to oios for thorough and supported investigation 493 the united nations had duty to investigate such matters because it appears that tcil was in direct breach of its contractual obligations and was misappropriating the organisations funds 380 first tcil failed to comply with the terms of the contract requiring notice to be provided to

contract between the organisation and tcil the task forces investigation has established that the employment contract between tcil deployed staff and enkay associates and later gti contained subsistence allowance clause and amounts were paid 382 second the task force investigation has revealed that at the time tcil received the contract award from the organisation it entered into

enforce certain provisions in the contract which may have prevented significant losses to the organisation as described above article 7 required any tcil subcontract to comply with the terms of its agreement of the united nations contract similarly the united nations had the right under article 16 to audit tcils subcontract and related records 500 accordingly had the united nations examined the contract between the deployed staff and the subcontractor gtian examination permitted under both provisionsit immediately would have discovered tcils breach of its contractual obligations 386 it is now evident that the procurement service failed to enforce its contractual rights and simply accepted tcils hollow representations at its face value because mr bahel favoured the company and its agents the procurement services inaction is highly problematic in light of the numerous reports from the field regarding abuse and fraud which affected both the morale of staff and the overall image of the united nations 387 tcil confirmed to the task force that support staff did not receive their msa payments as required under the united nations contract according to tcil gti failed to honour its obligations to pay msa to the support staff indeed tcil claimed this was the primary reason the company eventually severed ties with gti in 2003 501 however under the contract it was tcil that was obligated to take all reasonable steps to keep all costs and expenses for which the united nations is responsible for reimbursing the contractor at the lowest possible level 502 even though the contract between enkay associates and its staff did not have an msa provision it nevertheless remained tcils obligation to ensure these costs were paid furthermore the lack of msa payments to personnel had considerable financial implications on the united nations it appears that none of the amounts paid to tcil as reimbursement for msa ever reached the staff 503 on average subsistence allowance of us4000 was paid by the organisation to tcil per worker on the contrary the task force has confirmed that enkay associates and gti actually required each staff to post an irrevocable bank

he could not remember the specifics of the tcil contract which he claimed was merely one of many procurements carried out under his supervision the subject further maintained that while in the procurement service he concentrated on the systemic shortcomings and deficiencies of procurement at the united nations and not on the daytoday details or specifics in contracts he simply relied on the professionalism of his staff and refused to micromanage his subordinates 505 389 the task force confirmed that the subject did not sign the original contract with tcil in june 2000 the investigation also established the fact that the requisition was started and the contract was prepared duri ng his tenure as the chief of the procurement service furthermore the subject did sign amendment 1 in may 2001 which introduced substantial changes to the contract aimed at resolving the underlying problems which existed at the time 506 in addition as the officerincharge of the procurement service and the signatory on numerous correspondences in connection with the contract he maintained responsibility for an awareness of the significant activities of his subordinates in supervising high value contracts and an awareness of and responsibility for severe issues which are brought to his attention and not resolved by subordinates 390 in the interview with the task for ce investigators the subject asserted that the procurement service exhausted the avenues available to it under the terms of the contract the procurement service forwarded staff complaints to and raised the issues of msa payments and subcontracting with the vendor when appropriate the procurement service engaged ola for legal assistance the subject further defended that ps had reasons to doubt the response from the vendor who refuted the allegations as well as affidavits from tcil staff regarding the full receipt of their dues 391 given the extent of the allegations and the magnitude of supporting documentation amassed by the united nations the task force is not persuaded that the subject appropriately placed his full confidence in the representations made by tcil and its representative to the united nations without requesting cursory review of the claims by oios the provisions in the contract allowed the united nations to investigate these claims and yet the subject and the procurement service under his stewardship failed to take advantage of this mechanism 392 in the interview with the task force inve stigators the subject asserted he took issue with the principle of the auditors involvement in

the supporting documents used as the basis for the latters activities he claimed he relied on mr bahel who was his primary source of information for these issues 507 such heavy reliance was misplaced while the subject cannot be faulted for failing to identify mr bahels role in the fraud and his clear favouritism towards the company and its representatives he should have scrutinized mr bahels actions to greater degree and tested his continuing assertions defending and supporting the company 393 the task force does not agree with the subjects criticisms of the resident auditors involvement in the matter and his efforts to discourage the address of the serious allegations of misconduct by the vendor tcil the subject now claims that had he known all the facts and the documents he undoubtedly would have referred the issue to ola and considered terminating the contract 508 although the subject claimed that he relied heavily on his subordinates to whom he delegated responsibilities of making sure that work was not disrupted due to his intermittent presence in procurement service 509 he did not believe that he was misinformed or that information was withheld from him by his subordinates 510 394 the task force is of the view that the subject was fully aware of the developments with the contract and in the procurement service and failed to take appropriate steps to prevent the abuse of position and favouring of the vendor by the individual the subject appointed to manage the procurement service on his behalf mr bahel consequently the subjects inaction

revealed that the subject owned real property in singapore and usa during the reporting period and failed to disclose them in his 2005 financial disclosure form 551 it is clear and the subject

26000 at the end of that year557 421 the subject did not disclose the details of his bank accounts in 2005 altogether despite an aggregate value in excess of us40000000 however the 2005 form did not identify bank accounts within the definition of asset despite the fact that the definition did include such items before and after likewise the relevant sgb also failed to identify bank accounts as an asset nonetheless such disclosure is purely within the spirit of the concept of as set officials from the ethics office are of the view that such details were required to be disclosed regardless of an absence of identification bank accounts within the definition of asset reasoning similarly further the absence of these details is compounded by the fact that the subject served on working group at

on financial disclosure requirements 21 april 2005 426 the precise items required to be disclosed were the subject of extensive debate and discussion in the working group it necessarily follows that the subject was intimately involved in issues surrounding financial disclosure the organisations requirement to produce such information the perceived importance of such disclosure as well as fully aware of the nature of the items required to be disclosed d valuation by the taskforce 427 the task force has not identified evidence of fraud or illegal conduct on the part of the subject in the materials he has produced which consists of bank accounts in which he has maintained an interest during the period 19992005 however the task force has been unable to examine 1998 and 2006 and the sources of funds used by the subject to purchase real estate in connecticut in 1998 and in singapore in 2002 without such information the task force cannot take firm and unequivocal view of the matter 428 it is clear that the subject has not been fully compliant with the relevant legislations regarding financial disclosure and the requirements of the financial disclosure forms 429 the subject has challenged the meaning extent and applicability of prevailing financial disclosure requirements salient feature in his response to the task force is the complete absence of recognition of the purpose underlying financial disclosure given oios p rocurement task force report on concerned united nations staff member strictly confidential ______________________________________________________________________________________ page131his role as chairman in the working group established under the aegis of the deputy secretarygeneral to review the financial disclosure regime his refusal to grant the task force full access cannot be said to be one of ignorance as to the purpose underlying the requirement for senior staff to make

the subject joined the wfp in 1980 in july 1998 the subject arrived at united nations headquarters in new york as part of secondment to the office of coordination of humanitarian affairs in march 1999 the subject was appointed chief of procurement and served in that capacity until november 2000 when he became the director of the facilities and commercial services division while serving in this capacity the subject remained as officerincharge of the procurement service until october 2001 when mr saunders was ultimately appointed chief in july 2003 the subject was appointed assistant secretarygeneral office of central support services where he has remained until the present oios p rocurement task force report on concerned united nations staff member strictly confidential ______________________________________________________________________________________ page133433 in january 2006 the subject was placed upon special leave with pay following an internal audit review which identified fraud indicators in the procurement of an mi26 helicopter for the united nations mission in east timor and fraud indicators in number of other procurement exercises which occurred during the subjects tenure leading the procurement service in the intervening period the task force has examined several matters during the subjects tenure as chief of the procurement service the director of facilities management division and assistant secretarygeneral including i the lease of an mi26 helicopter from peru for the united nations mission in east timor in 2000 ii the auction of certain owned philatelic material which commenced in 1996 and was ultimately completed in may 2003 iii the provision of certain electrical and engineering services by the firm company 2 electrical company from 1996 to the present in which the organisation paide the company in excess of us50 million during the entire period and iv certain manpower contract for various united nations missions awarded to the firm telecommunications consultants of india limited between 2000 and 2005 434 further the task force has examined three additional matters which have come to the task forces attention during its investigations of the abovereferenced cases to include i the acquisition of certain telephone call detail records of the then under secretarygeneral for oios mr nair procured by the subject in june 2004 ii the accuracy and completeness of the subjects personal financial disclosure statements to the organisation in calendar years 2003 2004 and 2005 and iii issues surrounding the task forces request for additional personal financial information of the subject and his spouse and which were ultimately required to be disclosed by the secretarygeneral through the deputy secretarygeneral 435 the task force has not identified evidence of fraud or illegality on the part of the subject in any of the matters it has examine d however the task force has not been able to examine the subjects 1998 or 2006 records as he has declined to produce them further it has to be noted that the investigation of the mi26 for the mission in east timor in 2000 is not complete in as much as the task force continues to await opportunity to review the bank account details and transaction records held in bank account in switzerland of party to the transaction which is relevant to the inquiry without full examination of these financial records the task force cannot take concluded view of the matter or the subjects role in it it is evident that proceeds from the transaction to the lease the mi26 helicopter were paid into the vendors account company 3 and that the transaction involved fraudulent conduct that said an examination of the subjects personal financial records post 1999 has not revealed evidence of improper benefit or transfer of funds from any vendor or improper source oios p rocurement task force report on concerned united nations staff member strictly confidential ______________________________________________________________________________________ page134436 the task force has also examined all the abovementioned matters in the context of the relevant financial and administrative rules and regulations of the organisation and has addressed the subjects managerial oversight in the procurement exercises of these significant contracts in this regard the task force has examined whether the subjects conduct comports with the charter and relevant regulations and rules of the organisation requiring senior management to uphold the highest standards of efficiency integrity and conduct 437 first taking these matters individually and seriatim the task force finds that in connection with the sale of the owned philatelic archives the effort to sell the material commenced before the subject served as chief of the procurement service and continued after his tenure the subject did not initiate the sale which realized us247 million net proceeds nor was he responsible for it however as chief of the procurement service the subject failed to ensure that the relevant procurement rules were followed in that the subject did not ensure that the property survey board an entity within the organisation established to oversee the sale of property participated in the process disposal of any united nations asset requires prior approval of this board further the subject signed letter prepared by the purchaser which contained claims to the auction house and therefore ultimately to the public about the completeness of the materials which turned out to be inaccurate 438 the organisations contract with company 2 was executed in 1996 before the subject held the position of chief of procurement however the subject was made aware of the significant failings of the contractor in providing electrical and engineering services to the secretariat building at headquarters and the extreme work performance deficiencies of the contractors agents and employees nonetheless the subject executed memorandum of understanding with the company in 2000 and first amendment to the contract against the advice of ola allowing the company to continue to provide services to the organisation under even more favourable terms further the subject failed to present the matter to th hcc notwithstanding the position of ola that such presentation needed to be undertaken the mou and the execution of the first amendment to the contract allowed the company to continue to proceed to provide services to the organisation these work performance failings notwithstanding the execution of the contract with company 2 the subsequent mou and amendment to the contract caused the organisation to sustain further financial losses and exposed the organisation to continued performance deficiencies and ongoing financial risk the company continued to overcharge the organisation and failed to cure work performance issues the organisation has paid company 2 more than us50 million under these contracts since 1996 439 the manpower contract between the organisation and tcil was tainted by the fraudulent conduct of the vendor and mr bahel the principal supervising procurement officer responsible for the contract within th procurement service the subject asserts that he did not have day to day involvement with the procurement exercise or the execution of the contract vesting mr bahel with responsibility for such matters nevertheless the subject was repeatedly made aware of issues arising under the contract oios p rocurement task force report on concerned united nations staff member strictly confidential ______________________________________________________________________________________ page135and the complaints that workers employed by the vendor were not receiving subsistence sums rightfully due and owing to them while the subject claims that he questioned and pressed mr bahel on such matters he nevertheless defended mr bahels erroneous and partial positions supporting the company on the matters raised mr bahel clearly favoured the company tcil and its agents nanak and nishan kohli in the bidding exercise and throughout the execution of the contract task forces investigation identified that mr bahel later received substantial benefit from the kohlis in the form of real estate deals below market value and received other favourable treatment when oios auditors posed questions and raised concerns the subject criticized the auditors whose expressions rightfully should have resulted in full scale investigation and referral to the investigations division of oios at the time 440 in connection with the lease of the mi26 helicopter to the united nations mission in east timor through peruvian officials the subject learned that officials of the united nations vendor company 1 acted as an agent for two vendors on the commercial bid and defacto counterparty of the united nations in the letter of assist loa which was ultimately executed this circumstance created conflict of interest and compromised the integrity of the procurement process through the process the subject gained unique knowledge of the conflict and failed to disclose the conflict to either dpko or oios secondly the subject also made statements to task force investigators about the extent of his knowledge of the transaction which were incomplete and not plausible namely the subject denied awareness of the role of company 1 and its principals in the bidding process and execution of the contract the subject further initially minimized his knowledge of the identity and role of the peruvian generals only to later acknowledge some awareness after presented with relevant evidence 441 the task forces investigation has identified that criminal scheme existed in the acquisition and deployment of the peruvian helicopte r to the united nations mission in east timor in 2000 the investigation has further determined that the vendor company 1 through its front company company 3 submitted false documents to the peruvian officials knowing they would be submitted to and be relied upon by the organisation in addition company 1 through company 3 overcharged the organisation for certain rendered services and falsely billed the organisation for services in fact not rendered although the subject cannot be held responsible for these failings as they were perpetrated in surreptitious and clandestine manner by officials of company 1 and its representatives there were various red flags which emerged which should have caused an investigation to be launched such signals included 1 the role of company 1 2 the emergence of company 3 in the transaction 3 the request to pay funds into swiss bank account in the name of third party and 4 various press accounts depicting possible fraudulent scheme had the role of company 1 been made known to dpko or oios investigations could have been launched at that time the subject was aware of company 1s role in the transaction and in unique position to disclose this fact to dpko and oios 442 at the direction of the then undersecretarygeneral for management ms catherine bertini the subject retrieved the telephone call detail records of mr nair the oios p rocurement task force report on concerned united nations staff member strictly confidential ______________________________________________________________________________________ page136then undersecretarygeneral for oios the request for these records came after the secretarygeneral raised concerns with ms bertini that mr nair may have been inappropriately divulging information to certain official of the press the subject acting at the direction of ms bertini retrieved the call detail records of mr nair for may and june 2004 and then instructed the official within the united nations information technology services division to keep the matter confidential the manner in which the records were obtained and the resulting destruction of the trace of the search for the records are troubling the subjects direction to keep the matter confidential resulted in the destruction of any indication that the records were in fact gathered and any trace of the search as the communications official used specia l software to ensure that the trace could not be identified these facts resulted in breach of the established protocol within itsd to memorialize all such requests in writing in effect there was documentation generated concerning the gathering of the records and the appropriate notebook within itsd failed to contain any reference to it as result of such directions established procedures within itsd were abrogated 443 the task force has examined the subjects financial submissions to the organisation for the years 2003 2004 and 2005 notwithstanding the subjects role in working group established in 2005 to consider strengthening the organisations reporting requirements and the appropriate need for the organisation to require production of accurate and reliable financial information the subject omitted critical information from his submissions to include in 2004 bank account held at barclays bank in the united kingdom in which he maintained an interest b in 2005 real property in his name in singapore and other real property in the united states purchased for 510000 and which was supported by us300000 down payment further the subject has failed to identify any information concerning his spouse 444 review of the partial information submitted by the subject to the task force does not reveal any evidence of improper payments or improper benefits to him the subject has produced personal financial information to the task force only after being directed to do so by the deputy secretarygeneral however the note to the subject from the deputy secretarygeneral required the subject to present certain financial information to the task force between calendar year 1998 and the present the subject presented bank account information from 19992005 contending that he would provide only those years when he was employed by the secretariat in new york however the subject refused to provide details of his banking records in 1998 and in 2006 in the latter claiming that he was effectively suspended from the organisation and thus not employed by it and has not produced records of the source of funds used to purchase his sinagpore and united states residences the subject disc losed his interest in the real property in singapore which he held between 2002 and 2006 only when the task force raised the issue similarly only after the task force investiga tors raised the issue of the barclays account did the subject provide the relevant records 445 the subject continues to refuse to provide information anterior to 1999 despite being directed to do by the deputy secretarygeneral and notwithstanding the fact that the subject was in new york as of july 1998 seconded to ocha and previously oios p rocurement task force report on concerned united nations staff member strictly confidential ______________________________________________________________________________________ page137employed by united nations the wfp beginning in 1980 the subject declined to produce information concerning 2006 contending being placed upon administrative leave effectively terminated his employment despite the fact that he continued to be paid as staff member received benefits associated with staff membership and maintained an active contract with the organisation which is in existence until july 2007 xiv c onclusions 446 based on the foregoing the task force finds that united nations staff member the subject has not committed any fraudulent or corrupt act in any of the matters reported on in this investigation the subjecthas however violated staff rules of the organisation and has failed in his management responsibilities in the following matters by i wilfully refusing to obey the proper instruction given to him by the secretarygeneral requiring financial disclosure and wilfully omitting critical information required to be disclosed by the organisations financial disclosure form contrary to staff regulations n and r as well as staff rule 1044e ii failing to disclose conflict of in terest in the untaet helicopter matter of which he was fully aware to the appropriate organs of the organisation the conflict compromised the integrity of the process iii improperly endorsing the continuation of major electrical services contract well knowing the performance of the contractor to be wholly unsatisfactory and thereby exposing the organisation to continuing risk of financial loss and further performance deficiencies iv failing to properly include the property survey board relevant component in the organisation whose approval is required prior to the sale of property in the process to sell owned material philatelic archives thereby resulting in violation of staff rule 11032 v not properly scrutinizing and challenging the vendors denials of claims of misconduct and illegality in valuable manpower contract for various missions whose position was supported by procurement officer sanjaya bahel the subjects designated officer in charge of procurement the allegations and claims by the vendors contract staff were ultimately determined to be valid through subsequent task force investigation vi causing established procedures within the information technology services department of the organisation for requests for sensitive information of staff members to be abrogated 447 as consequence the subject violated united nations staff regulations passim in the matters identified above in the aggregate this pattern of mismanagement demonstrates failure by staff member the subject to uphold the highest standards of integrity competence and efficiency as chief of the procurement service director of oios p rocurement task force report on concerned united nations staff member strictly confidential ______________________________________________________________________________________ page138facilities management division and as an assistant secretarygeneral of the united nations the failings in these cases establish pattern of service well below what is expected of an assistant secretarygeneral of the organisation indeed these instances of conduct described above are inconsistent with the clear expectations enunciated in the charter of the united nations as the acabq recently commented in its 1 december 2006 release the advisory committee has in the recent past pronounced itself strongly in favour of an enhanced accountability framework for senior management in report the committee recommended that specific set of sanctions up to and including termination of employment be put in place to deal with failure to perform or poor performance on the part of senior managers at the undersecretarygeneral and assistant secretarygeneral levels xv r ecommendations 448 based upon the foregoing the task force recommends that united nations staff member the subject be held accountable for the failings described above and that consideration be given to whether personal financial responsibility is warranted oios p rocurement task force report on concerned united nations staff member strictly confidential
