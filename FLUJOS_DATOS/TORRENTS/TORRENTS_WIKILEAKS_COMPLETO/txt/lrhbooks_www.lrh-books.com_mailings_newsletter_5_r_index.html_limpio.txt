ones attitude toward life makes every possible difference in ones living you know you dont have to study thousand ancient books to discover that fact but sometimes it needs to be pointed out again that life doesnt change so much as you l ron hubbard this excerpt was taken from the book new slant on life by l ron hubbard dianetics story of the week can your past memories dictate your life view details on dianetics the modern science of mental health he suddenly erupted in bloodcurdling cry that sent jumping into the air and throwing my papers and notes everywhere during my time in the us army while stationed in germany i had lot of free time on my hands after work each day i needed to find something to help wile away the idle hours and normally i did this through reading books on the base there was bookstore that only carried bestsellers and it was there i first saw dianetics the modern science of mental health i thought the title sounded interesting and because it was goodsized book it gave something to read for while thats when i started my journey into truly discovering and learning about the human mind after the first read through i thought this was really something and even if only fraction of it was true it would mean great deal for mankind i then began reading it over again this time with even more attention and curiosity soon the paperback book became worn from my intensive reading and slowly the book began falling apart however this was fortunate for my roommate who began picking up the fallen pages and reading along with pretty soon he was just as curious as i was about the subject of dianetics the adventure begins one day bill my roommate suggested i try using the procedure on him as laid out in the book i told him that i wasnt sure it was good idea and didnt know what would happen he persisted and pointed out in the book where it states you cant hurt anyone with the procedure and that some of the procedure even if done badly was far better than doing nothing well he had on that one bill settled himself down on one of the bunks and with book on one knee and notepad on the other i began the procedure i meticulously followed the commands and made notes as best i could for short while i didnt notice any changes and began to get nervous i kept following the procedure just as mr hubbard wrote and then came across section where the book said if nothing else works try this so i did the hidden memory blood curdling cry erupted from bill and had jumping out of my chair falling on the floor and throwing the book and papers all over the room i was frightened half to death uneasily i climbed back up to my chair and arranged the papers and the book again to continue the process looking closely at bill i could see tear streaming down his face while his eyes were still closed what had just happened the next step was to address the area of emotional and physical pain we had contacted and i set out to do this following the procedure in the book exactly and in short time had bill back up to present time and longer in any pain or discomfort afterwards bill commented boy i must have quite an imagination after all theres way this could be true i was one year old kid when this happened and my parents for sure would have told about this bill had uncovered previous unknown injury one that he had never been told about few days passed and he was still wondering about whether or not this was for real or just his imagination i suggested he write his mother and ask after all she would surely know about major injury that happened to him at such an age he agreed and promptly sent off letter to his mother casually asking about this newly discovered injury reading between the lines three weeks later i entered our room after work and bill was sitting on his bed face white as sheet staring at letter in his hand i asked what was wrong and he handed the letter it was the answer from his mother she was interrogating him as to how he could have possibly found this out and asking questions like where did you hear this from have you been talking to aunt martha etc from this letter it was evident that the injury they had uncovered was real even though she refused to confirm it directly both of us were in complete shock we surmised from his mothers letter and the details of the incident that his family had covered this up and made pact never to tell him they were ashamed and embarrassed you see when he was only year old on christmas eve all his relatives were visiting and had been drinking little too much his father was holding him next to the christmas tree and they had real candles on the tree which were of course all lit he was fascinated by the flame and reached out with one finger to touch it but as he realized it was hot and it began to burn he tried to withdraw but his father accidentally turned him into the flame and he was burned severely as he cried everyone was so intoxicated they did not realize what had happened and continued socializing and laughing in fact one in the family noticed the burn marks until the next day and then they quickly took him to doctor the result after getting over the initial shock bill had sudden realization that he had been afraid of candles his whole life and never knew why everything having to do with candles and even fire just made him feel uneasy it was one of those feelings he had just grown to accept as normal and just the way he was but after addressing this with dianetics he was longer afraid of this as the physical and emotional pain had been erased and was longer subconsciously affecting him needless to say i had found something that really worked and i was very impressed it was not matter of how smart or clever i was as person as just by following the simple procedure in the book i had produced incredible results over the next two years i devoted much of my time to helping other people with dianetics and also increasing my knowledge of the subject by studying more of what l ron hubbard wrote there is state in the book called clear where you have gotten rid of the negative effects of every one of these moments in your past few years later i
