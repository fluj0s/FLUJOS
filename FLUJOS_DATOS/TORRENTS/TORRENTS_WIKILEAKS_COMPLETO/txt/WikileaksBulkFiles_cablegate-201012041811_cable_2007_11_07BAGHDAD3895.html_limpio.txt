ambassador to tehran geoffrey adams in series of meetings with us embassy baghdad and mnfi officials outlined his recommendations on how to negotiate with iranians ambassador adams thought that iran had several goals from talks with the us both superficial and substantive in negotiations he advised being steady and firm tough but not aggressive and at the same time seeking to engage and draw attention to mutual interests he outlined irans preconceptions and its obsession with and mistrust of the west which he said can blind it to its interests he warned that the iranian participants would likely have very strict instructions what they could say and that it would be difficult to get them off script though the element of surprise could work adams added that the iranians would be very nervous of negative repercussions if they made misstep and they would likely report on each other answers to questions and proposals would more likely only come at followon meetings and decisionmaking in iran is slowed by the need for consensus so patience is needed that said it was important to rid the iranians of their standard notion that time was on their side end summary 2c british ambassador to iran geoffrey adams offered advice in negotiating strategies with iran in series of meetings with us officials and military officers in baghdad november 2425 the following is an amalgamation of three meetings held in advance of the fourth round of iraniraqus trilateral discussions on iraq adams who has served in tehran for almost two years said his observations were borne of much experience to include master class8 when iran captured at gunpoint 15 british navy personnel in march 2007 british ambassador to kuwait stuart laing also joined the discussions as well as british first secretary in tehran alex pinfield among those present on the us side at various briefings were ambassador crocker mnfi commanding general petraeus polmil minister counselor ambassador marcie ries mg kevin bergner special advisor david pearce and irpo director jillian burns the british ambassadors views of irans strategic interests and the internal political situation to be reported septel 3c iranians goal in adams view is to institutionalize talks with the us and keep open the possibility of broadening the agenda while he heard that the iranians were disappointed in the lack of substance8 in previous bilateral talks with the us they felt they derived good publicity from participating adams predicted the iranians will seek to keep them going both to engender their prestige and to keep tabs on what the usg is thinking he also thought the talks had triggered useful internal debate in how to make the best use of the talks and their strategic interests adams added that he believed there is significant lobby in iran against holding talks with the us assumptions 4c in talks with iranians ambassador adams recommended being steady and firm tough but not aggressive and at the same time seeking to engage he stressed that iranians are obsessed with the west and this obsession at times blinds them to their interests in this light the us side should be aware of the following preconceptions on the iranian side the usg seeks to remove the current regime and replace it with prowestern one usg policymakers spend an inordinate amount of time and energy thinking about and plotting against iran as such iranians assume that everything we do or say has meaning and has been carefully thought out and coordinated both internally and with the uk there are accidents the current us administration is politically very weak facing major internal opposition and as such the threat of us military action against iran is not realistic iran sees the us as tough determined adversary that can be manipulated and wounded mistrust baghdad 00003895 0024 of 003 5c the legacy of the iraniraq war when the international community was either silent or sided with saddam even when he used wmd against iranians must be kept in mind iranians mistrust the outside world to include the very same western powers and sunni arab states that are now seeking to ensure that proiranian shias do not dominate power in iraq short leash 6c islamic republic of iran iri government negotiators arrive with precise and detailed instructions from which they do not deviate out of fear of professional repercussions they will go through all their talking points the usg should not expect substantive responses to questions or initiatives in real time this problem can be obviated to an extent by scheduling lots of breaks8 allowing irig officials time to confer amongst themselves and to seek guidance via telephone from tehran however given the fear of misstep on the iri side the usg should not expect real engagement from the iri outside of their instructions answers to questions and responses to suggestions are likely to come at followon meetings although some questions never get answered preparation 7c irig officials will likely prepare in detail for the talks they may consult with iranians with extensive experience with americans such as academics who have participated in track two talks or worked in the us he also mentioned that the head of irans chamber of commerce mohammad nahavandian is also perceived as us expert and is likely consulted adams doubted that iran would seek advice in negotiating with americans from other countries adams repeatedly said iranians are not stupid8 meaning they follow all the issues closely even if they at times misread the signals slow process 8c in light of the short leash negotiators have plus the collaborative and multipolar nature of iri decisionmaking and the extreme sensitivity of the topic of direct usgirig talks the usg should not expect immediate big steps8 any progress will be slow and come only after much deliberation and discussion in iran with pushback from those circles opposing talks if the irig concludes that policy shift is in their interests it can do it and find way to justify it but will first have to achieve internal consensus stay calm 9c it is important with the iranians not to lose ones temper or show that one is upset trading accusations allows the irig to rely on familiar script far better is to ask unexpected questions that will take them offscript8 when asked how to best broach continued irig support of jam splinter groups despite irig assurances to the government of iraq to stop the flow of weapons adams recommended keeping the tone matteroffact and raising issues in question form ie given your assurances that you are seeking to help iraqi forces reestablish peace and security how can we explain the ongoing training of jamrelated illegal combatants in iran8 agenda 10c dont offer an agenda beforehand otherwise the agenda itself will become subject to ongoing negotiations establish mutual interests 11c seek to show commonality or intersection of national interests that will justify iran taking actions suggested by the usg prove to them that if we fail in iraq they fail too8 draw them out on their contradictory tactics in order to spark debate within the irig assess what the iranians want out of the talks beyond their publicly stated position of wanting timetable for withdrawal of foreign troops baghdad 00003895 003 of 003 clock ticking 12c irig interlocutors assume that time is on their side and hence default towards inaction convince them that now is the time to act and that not doing so will hurt their interests and that the situation could get worse in related vein the iri must be convinced that the usg is prepared to stop dialogue although not necessarily close the channel if there is progress at the same time realize internally that the negotiators cannot take bold move without consultation reasonable degree of patience is required and progress may take time put the ball in their court 13c ask lot of questions always put the ball back in their court doing so will encourage internal discussion and debate in tehran as well as put pressure on them to deviate from their prepared script wrong foot them by saying something unexpected to try to take them off script focus on accountability asking for clarifications of actions that contradict their stated commitments keep your message clear including redlines and do not be too subtle weaknesses 14c despite their rhetoric iranians understand their weaknesses include lack of allies and foreign investment publicity 15c iran is very sensitive to press coverage that makes them look weak at the same time the irig has high threshold for embarrassment8 when they are accused of illicit activities after the talks the irig will seek to present the exchange as businesslike8 with the us and iran on equal footing where the irig gave nothing away8 butenis
