individual income tax tends to violate the goal of marriage neutrality marriage neutrality means that the tax system should not influence the choice of individuals with rega rd to their marital status however under the current federal income tax system some married couples pay more income tax than they would as two unmarried singles marriage tax penalty while other married couples pay less income tax than they would as two unmarried singles marriage tax bonus the three most important structural featur affecting the marriage neutrality of the income tax are the earned income tax credit ic the standard duction and the tax rate schedules under the current income tax syst em single individuals heads of households and married couples are subject to different standard deduc tions and tax rate schedules the eic amounts and phaseout ranges also vary according to filing status these differences give rise to structur marriage tax penalties and bonuses because of these asymmetries when the income of one spouse is added to the income of the other spouse married coupl might find themselves paying either more federal income tax marriag penalty or less tax marri age bonus than they would by filing as two singles two singles or some combination of singles and heads of households contemplating marri age might find that their federal income tax liability increases marriage tax penalty or decreas marriage tax bonus by filing joint return in general the division of income or inco split of the two individuals determines whether they will have marriage tax bonus or penalty the largest marriage tax bonuses occur when one spouse earns 100 of the inco the more evenly divided the income the more likely married couple will experien ce marriage tax penalty the largest tax penalties occur where the income is evenly divided between the two spouses 5050 income split for example consider th case of two married couples where each couple has 60000 of income one couple is oneearne r household where one spouse earns all the income while the other couple is tw oearner household where each spouse earns 30000 under the federal income tax rate structure in ffect in 2001 the oneearner couple has marriage tax bonus of 4326 tha t is they pa 4326 ss filing joint return than they would if they filed as tw single individuals wh ile the twoearner couple has marriage tax penalty of 406 that is they pay 406 more filing joint return then they would if they filed as two single individuals eliminating marriage tax pe nalties and bonuses and crea ting marriage neutral income tax are elusive equity goals marriage neutrality conflicts with two other concepts of equity progressivity and equal taxation of couples with equal incomes regardless of how these three concepts of equity are juggled an income tax can achieve any two of these goals but cannot under current defin itions simultaneously achieve all threehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21000crs3 1 for more information on the
