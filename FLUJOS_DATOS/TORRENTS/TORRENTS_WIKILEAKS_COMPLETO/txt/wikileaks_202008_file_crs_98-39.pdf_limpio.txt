international set of st andards on foreign investment in the form of multilateral agreement on investment mai such an agreement would aim toreduce the remaining obstacles to foreign investment to stem the growth ofinvestment subsidies being offered by many developing economies and to protect developed nations overseas investments as prospects grow for new multilatera l investment agreement some

investment treaties is negatively affecting domesticinvestment spending by us firms the us international trade position and thegrowth of domestic us jobs since multilateral and bilateral investment treatieslower the risks involved for firms that invest abroad some observers believe thesetreaties may encourage firms to invest more overseas shifting jobs out of the united states and potentially lowering the firms share of traditional investment spending done in the united states eventually th ey argue reduced levels of investment spending will lead to fewer jobs and lowe r incomes in the united states relative to economies abroad analysis to date however indicates that foreign investment treaties by themselves have little if any influence on foreign investment spending as whole instead such treaties may alter the composition of overseas investing by influencingus firms to increase their investment spending in some developing countriesparticularly those with bilateral invest ment treaties at the expense of other developing economies but not likely at the expense of domestic investmentspending additionally recent analyses indicate that employment among foreignsubsidiaries especially among economically developing countries is not closesubstitute for employment in the united stat in most cases investment spending abroad by us multinational firms is due to favorable economic conditionsinvestment treaties apparently shift employment demands within multinational firmsamong subsidiary operations in developing nations with similar levels of economicdevelopment and

foreign investment through international organizations either failedstalled or delivered meager results in most cases these efforts were rebuffed by large number of developing countries which viewed foreign investment with suspicion with capital in short supply in the 1990s however many developing economies dropped their opposition to foreign investment and started offering financial and tax subsidies to foreign firms willing to invest this policy shift sparked surge indirect investment abroad by the developed countries and boom in the number ofbits as the number of bits multiplied the united states and other oecdcountries resolved to develop an interna tional set of rules on foreign investment presently the oecd countries are engaged in discussions over proposedmultilateral agreement on investment mai 2 according to the negotiating group on the mai the mai is expected to be much broader in scope than most bits andtherefore largely will replace the bits in practice for

foreign investme nt in developing countries international lawyer fall 1990 p 659the impetus for this flurry of treatymaking activity over the last thirty years has been the strong drive by nationals and companies ofcertain states to undertake direct fore ign investments in other countries and the consequent need to create stable international legal framework tofacilitate and protect those investments these investors felt that relying on host country law alone subjected fore ign investment capital to variety of risks host countries may easily change the law after an investment ismade and host government officials responsible for applying local lawmay not always act impartially toward foreign investors and theirenterprises moreover investors and their home country governmentsbelieved that local law in some countries impeded the entry of foreigncapital treated foreign investments in an arbitrary and discriminatorymanner and imposed onerous conditions on the operation of privatelyowned foreign enterprises these concerns proved to be more thantheoretical for the 1960s and 1970s w itnessed numerous interferences by host governments with foreign investments in their territories 8 the united states began negotiating bilate ral investment treaties in 1982 after other forms of bilateral and multilateral arrangements proved too limited in removingbarriers to

certain specified industries or sectors activities such as these which are designed to channel foreign investment into specifi ed could easily obscure the impact bit has on the foreign investment

though may affect the composition of firms overseas investments firms weigh broad range of issues only one of which is multilateral or bilateralinvestment treaty before they commit thei r resources after all the challenges facing firm that is operating plant ab road far from the home office compound the everyday problems that arise in operating any business moreover while itseems obvious that firms invest abroad to increase their profits what is less obviousis which factors trigger the initial investme nt decision or why firms choose to invest where they do in the first place and what distinguishes multinational firms fromthose that remain purely domestic 17 most economists believe that foreign direct investment offers positive benefits to both the investing and the reci pient countries these benefits include an increase in competition and consumers choices and gains in productivity andefficiency while such actions likely benefit or harm individual plants and localitiesdifferently economic theory and prepondera nce of studies indicate that they likely enhance the performance and longterm gr owth rate of the economy nevertheless some americans argue that the national ga ins attributed to investing overseas are offset by perceived local losses which can include displaced us workers and lost economic growth broad assortment of economic studies generally agree thatinvestors consider range of factors before they decide to invest abroad and that they have an array of options available to them which allows them to craft their investments in ways that suit their specifi c purposes and corporate requirements for instance firms can export to overseas mark ets instead of operating abroad or they can arrange licensing agreements to lessen the burden of managing overseassubsidiaries firms can also establish joint ventures to take advantage of theexperience of foreign firms or they can invest directly by establishing wholly owned subsidiary acquire an existing facilit or be minority partner with another foreign investor according to number of economic an alyses the relative rates of economic growth between the united states and othe r foreign

and acquisition activity abroad 26httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9839crs13 economic effects one of the most important economic i ssues that arise concerning bits and other officially sponsored actions is how these actions affect the flows of spending on foreign direct investment whether in tended or not investment treaties may well promote foreign investment to particular country potentially at the expense ofother countries without such treaty because investment treaties reduce some of theuncertainty firms face when they are investing abroad while this and any numberof other developments seem plausible it has not been proven conclusively that investment treaties promote overseas investments overall above the levels that wouldhave existed without such treaties in most cases economists contend that actionssuch as an investment treaty which reduce investors risks tend to induce investorsto shift their investments in this case from one country to another investmentscould be shifted among countries or change in the composition of investmentspending without this leading to net incr ease in the overall level of foreign direct investment these and other complications further compound the problems analysts face in attempting to assess the impact investment treaties have on foreign directinvestment so far analysts have not di scovered clear pattern from the available data that offers any indication of how i nvestment treaties may affect the flow of investment funds to particular country th is ambiguity arises in part from the fact that any number of factors could account for an increase in direct investment spending including the national rate of ec onomic growth also bit may promote foreign investment by signaling foreign firms that the bit signatory country haschanged its policies and has become more r eceptive to foreign firms as group the bit signatory countries increased their shar of us direct investment funds by 27 over the 1991 to 1995 period the

early 1990s the developed economies of the oecd have shown heightened interest in an international agreement on investment rules such interestlikely stems from the rapid growth in overseas investment many developed economies experienced during the 1980s and 1990s as figure 2 shows foreign direct investment by the oecd countries more than quadrupled over the 19831994period rising from 447 billion in 1983 to 21 trillion in 1994 27 this growth in foreign investment likely reflects the view of many firms that investing overseas is an essential component of their overall bus iness strategy and that it is complement to their export efforts as one oecd official states although investments abroad by the largest firms are by means new phenomenon growing number of firms now view

concern over the ways us direct investment abroad aff ects the nations trade performance and jobs situation such concerns were heightened during the debate over the northamerican free trade agreement or nafta some observers believe that liberalized trade and investment with developing economies either through abilateral investment treaty or multilateral investment agreement spurs shift inmanufacturing production from the united st ates with its higher paid american workers to developing countries with lowwage workers some critics argue thatsuch shift in production would worsen the us trade deficit with developingeconomies because us multinational firms will substitute foreignmade goods forgoods they previously had manufactured in the united states contrary to these impressions broad range of economic analyses conclude that us direct investment abroad on the whole helps sustain us exports commerce department data through 1993 indi cate that american subsidiary firms operating abroad generally produced for the foreign local market invariably somefirms do invest abroad specifically to export lowpriced goods back to the unitedstates but this is by means the dominant or even substantial practice thelargest share of the production of american foreign subsidiaries in 1993 was sold in the local market with about 10 of world wide production shipped back to the united

that bilateral investment treaties or newmultilateral investment agreement could pr ovide strong impetus for us firms to shift major parts of their operations or employment abroad doubt investment treaties may influence some firms in some states or cities to shift parts of theiroperations abroad but the preponderance of an alyses to date indicate that the overallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9839crs21 effects of inward and outward direct investment on the us economy are positive this dichotomy between public concerns and empirical evidence may well stem from the fact that the empirical evidence is generally not well known outside relatively small group of analysts and the public has arrived at some conclusions on its ownbased on local rather than on economywide effects indeed at the local level overseas investments by us firms may well affect jobs at particular location or plant upsetting communities dependent on such jobs for the us economy as whole however such job shifting ultimately will improve workers jobs and incomes as well as other economic choices in an economy such as the us economy that has operated for some time at full employment beyond thelevels economists once thought of as the outmost limits some firms may well search overseas for workers not easily recruited at home the range of factors firmsconsider when they look overseas to invest is broad enough to encompass almost anypossibility but the existence of investment treaties does not seem to rank very highon the list new multilateral agreement on investment will not necessarily replace all of the existing bilateral investment agreements depending on how the mainegotiations proceed the bilateral treaties ma in fact be preferred to multilateral agreement that has jettisoned many of the provisions desired by the united states because the provisions proved to be too di visive on multilateral basis regardless of the form of any final multilateral agr eement bilateral and multilateral investment treaties have not been shown to be major forces propelling us direct investmentabroad such investment treaties howev er do reduce the risks for firms looking to invest abroad and likely would be one fact or that could encourage them to do so under these circumstances investment trea ties likely alter the composition of direct investment spending flowing to developi ng countries particularly among those with similar levels of economic development or similar levels of labor force skills
