straight forwar d review of the status and short rm outlook of military forces on the peoples republic of china prc and taiwan sides of the taiwan strait it looks in considerable detail t2 salient weapon systems and other military hardware on both sides it also pays clos attention to the two sides efforts in upgrading software such as information an d electronic warfare and it discusses strengths and weaknesses in the military leadership education training and morale of the fighting forces on both sides against this backdrop it examines the broader defense strategy and war planning of the prc and ta iwan and reviews in particular how the prc might use its military forces to carry ou t operations against taiwan four specific options for the prc are noted blockade missile strikes air superiority and amphibious inv asion the report explains why the likeliho od of such operations is not high now given the october 1998 resumption of highlevel dialogue across the strait and efforts by bot h sides to avoid provocative military exercises or other activity in the strait following the crisis caused by the prc provocative military exercises there in 1995 and 19963 limitations and perceived shortcomings of the department of defense report some of the following issues relate to the reports limited scope defined b congressional mandate the report does not address several policy issues as well s seemingly relevant military issues outsid its original scope additionally some observers would challenge the findings and conclusions of the report from other perspectives 1

us6 ally in asia shares us interest in regional stability it eschews any explicit statements about the security situati on around taiwan though its interest in this neighboring area is thought to be very keen7 2 the rep ort focuses narrowly on prc military options to use force agains t taiwan it tends to treat these options ie blockade missile strikes air superiority and amphibious invasion s eparately many other specialists judge that beijings approach to using forceif carried outwould be much more sophisticated and multifaceted integrating numerous political as well as military options thus they see the prime prc8 goal in these circumstances as intimidation of taiwans political leaders they believe the prc might use force in order to coerce the taiwan leadership to come to terms n taiwans reunification with the mainland acceptable to the prc the use of force could follow sliding scale of escalating military pressure or perhaps involve all areas ie blockade air superiority missile attack amphibious invasion at once and presumabl would be combined with political overtures to taiwan for settlement on prc terms and diplomatic and other international moves designed to keep the united states and othe r powers out of th conflict the prc leadership is not seen as likely to use military force to destroy taiwan rather it is thought that it might use military force in ways that do the least damage to taiwan and prc interests in order to get taiwan leaders to give in t prc demands over reunification and other sensitive issues military pressure against taiwan could include clowlevel intimidation milita ry exercises weapons displays confrontations at sea or in the air and various kinds of covert subversion cnaval blockade or interdiction efforts amphibious

congress 2d session june 1980thas result these specialists tend to see the key variables in this situation as the prc leadershi ps willingness to escalate the use of force their effectiveness in keeping th united states and other powers from intervening in the conflict and the taiwa n government leadership and people s willingness to continue to resist rising prc pressure these critical variables are not examined in this report 3 the re port can be interpreted in different ways regarding us military support for taiwan those us policy makers in congress and the administration who ar e9 cautious about giving greater us military support for taiwan may read the report s introdu ction which notes that the security situation in the taiwan strait remains cal m with threat of imminent hostilities as indicating remedial action by the unite d10 states as far as added military support for taiwan is required to counter the opposing view that chinas rising military power poses growing threats to taiwan requiring greater us military support for the i sland these policy makers could cite the first paragraph of the conclusion of the repor t which states the dynamic equilibrium of prc and taiwan forces in the taiwan strait has not changed dramatically over the last two decades11 some us policy advocates argue that even if there is growing prc military threat to taiwan the appropriate us response is t to add us military support for taiwan12 they belie ve that it is in the us best interests to try to calm the cross strait situation by persuad ing and even pressuring the two sides to ease tensions establish confidenc building measures and move toward accommodation they judge that more us military support for ta iwan has the added disadvantage of exacerbating usprc relations over this sensitive question raising the prospect of renewed confron tation in the taiwan strait something they seek to avoid on the other hand the bulk of th findings in the report when considered against the backdrop of past assessments of the military balance in the taiwan strait can be read by13 us policy makers in congress and the administration who favor greater us militar support for taiwan as buttressing their position they could make several major points cchanged strategic environment the main strat egic obstacle to possible prc use of military force against taiwan in the later 1970s and early 1980s was the sovie t union prc leaders were focused on the strategic danger posed by the ussr it s active fleet in the western pacific its alliance relationships with vietnam and india and its bases in vietnam any use of force against taiwan would not only hav diverted chinese military resources needed to confront the soviet threat but als would have prov ided the

reviews in considerable detail the growth in numbers and improvement in accuracy of prc ballistic and cruise missiles fo r possible use against taiwan beijing had much less capability in the 1970s an d15 1980s the report lso makes clear that taiwans ability to defend against this kind of threat has not kept pace with prc advances p osing major strategic vulnerability for taiwan this vulnerability affects taiwans need to maintain air superiority i n order to thwart blockade and fend off an amphibious invasion see discussio n below cair superiority the report makes cle ar that taiwans air superiority visavis prc forces is eroding in the 1970s and 1980s pla air forces were so backward tha t beijing chose not to use them in its world war i style mil itary attack against vietnam in 1979 using mainly artillery and infantry taiwan air forces had markedl superior airtoair missiles and overthehorizon radars to compete with antiquated prc fighters that had to rely on lineofsigh t engagement although taiwan fighters were outnumbered it was assumed by us specialists that t hey would be able to pick off incoming prc fighters before they got close enough for engagement and quickly return to base to refit and fight again in this way air superiority would b maintained allowing taiwan aircraft the ability to counter prc blockade r amphibious invasion16 the dod report makes clear that taiwan longer has the advantage in air to ai r missiles meanwhile the increased accuracy of ballistic and cruise missiles mean s that prc fo rces could destroy taiwan airfields making it harder and perhap s impossible for the very capabl but outnumbered taiwan jet fighters to resupply and fight again losing air periority would mean that taiwan would not be able to use its air force to counter prc blockade andor amphibious invasion cblockade taiwans air superi ority and prc backwardness persuaded us analysts in the 1970s and 1980s that beijing would not be able to xecute successful military blockade of taiwan in particular it was thought by analysts at that time tha t17 interdicting shipments t the eastern part of the island would be particularly difficult for prc forces in

securit environ ment that allows beijing to focus primary military attention on taiwa n contingencies these us advocates of greater military support f or taiwan could conclude cthe us needs to press the prc to curb its military buildup focused on taiwa n contingencies or face us countermeasures to redress the balance in the taiwa n strait ccountermeasures could include providing more advanced airtoair missiles fo r taiwan fighters support for stronger taiwan defenses against growing cruise an d ballistic missile threats from the prc and support for the taiwan efforts to thwart prc blockade eg better antisubmarine aircraft submarines for taiwans navy of course as noted above other us policy advocates would draw differen t implications for us policy they may see growing prc military

taiwan those are taiwan declarin g independence foreign intervention in taiwan and taiwan developing nuclear weapons it does not note other circumstances in which the prc might use force against
