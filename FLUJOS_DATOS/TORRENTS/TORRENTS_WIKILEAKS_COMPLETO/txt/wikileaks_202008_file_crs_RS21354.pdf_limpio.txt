transformation summit on november 2122 2002 the nato allies met in transformation summit in prague they sought to culminate allied efforts to change from military alliance geared for conflict against the soviet union to more flexible alliance with new capabilities for new threats they opened the door to demo cratic candidate states and agreed to forwardlooking program for partnership c ountries able to contribute to security the bush administration with the suppor t of then secretary general george robertson had been the driving force for changed nato the administration sought to use the summit to revitalize the alliance by clearly stating natos mission securing pledges of capabilities to accomplish that mission and embracing enlargement some allies resisted aspects of the administrations design for nato mission and capabilities1 during the cold war natos mission was to provide collective defense against the soviet threat in europe some allies military structures remain geared for this threat even though russian conventional forces are weak and in disarray the bush administration wishes to redefine the principal threats as terrorism and the prolif eration of weapons of mass destruction administration fficials believe that the unite d states is at war todayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21354crs2 2 nato communiqué paragraph 5 reykjavik may 14 2002 3 rumsfeld press conference brussels dec 18 2001against the sources of these new threats and that the allies must be prepared to engage adversaries in north africa the middle east and asia to ensure security the europeans in contrast with few excep tions do not believe that they are at war and any policy of moving outside the nato treaty area of europe remains controversial one most eu ropean allies believe that terrorism can be subdued not through military acti on but primarily throug h elimination of its underlying causes and through lawenforcement measures at natos may 2002 ministerial meeting in reykjavik the allies agreed that to carry out the full range of its missions nato must be able to field forces that can move quickly to wherever they are needed sustain operations over distance and time and achieve their objectives2 the european allies had resisted such clear statement of moving outofarea until the reykjavik mee ting and few have dedicated the resources to develop the mobile forces necessary to achieve such an objective some bush administration officials are now describing natos mission as global most prominently defense secretary rumsfeld in decem ber 2001 when asked what natos area of operations should be he responde d the only way to deal with the terrorist network thats global is to go after it where it is3 for some allies reykjavik did not suppl definitive word on natos mission and reach above all french ge rman and belgian officials ve been wary of outofarea missions in raising doubts they tend to cite the administrations new doctrine of pre emptive or preventive action against terrorist or wmd threats they do not wish nato to become the instrument of us policy against such threats unless guidelines for taking nato outofarea are more clearly agreed for example paris contends that resolution should be required for any such outofarea nato action the germans and some other allies believe that the principal threats to european security remain on the continent primarily in the balkans where instability in their view may yet again result in refugee flows and ultranationalist ideas and conflicts berlin believes that collective security in the form of robust peace operations should rema in natos principal objective the iraq war of 2003 undertaken primarily on the taken assumption that iraq was producing wmd has further dama ged us leadership of the alliance however in 2002 the bush administration took several actions in an attempt to ensure that the summit would move the alliance towards its own view of mission and capabilities it led efforts to replace the defe nse capability initiative of 1999 which listed 58 capability goals that nato should obtain with prague capabilities commitment pcc the pcc lists pledges by member states to

highreadiness status for high intensity conflict and able to reach its destination within 730 days of nato decision to use it the nrf woul d be an insertion force partly us but mostly european in com position for rapid m ovement primarily against terrorist and wmd threats the prague capabilities co mmitment and the nato response force are closely related in political terms the administra tion is calling upon allies to spend more on defense for capabilities to equip the nrf as well as capabilities for larger mobile forces that might follow after the insertion of the nrf administration officials described these two initiatives to the allies as test of allie d will to revitalize nato implicit in these initiatives is view that only governments with sharply improved capabilities will play role in coalitions of the willing against adversaries and that only such governments would therefore have an important voice in allied decisionmaking the allies have accepted these two adminis tration initiatives in general terms although with number of reserv ations some allies such as germany contend that eu imposed budget strictures prevent their spendi ng appreciably more on defense many also contend that us restrictions on technolog transfer impede the purchase of such items as precisionguided munitions and ground surveillance radar the nrf is now operational and has approximately 18000 troops the pcc however remains work in progress ther has been some progress in purchasing or leasing sea lift and even more progress in developing chemicalbiologicalradiological defense battalion yet there re main serious shortfalls in aerial refuelers and air lift reforming the nato command structure the administration was moved forward with an initiative to reduce the number of nato commands and to streamline the ones that remain most controversial was the transf ormation of saclant supreme allied command atlantic in norfolk from strategic command to functional command the europeans have long desire d maintaining the two strategic commands one in europe saceur and one in the united states in part as political symbol of transatlantic linkage the administration wished to modify saclant to command that would work on conceptual issues such as developing new doctr ines and new forces devising experimental training for such forces and then putting them into the field ultimately the allies accepted this proposal and the new command is now operational enlargement of nato membership the alliance viewed enlargement as sec ondary issue for the summit at prague nato issued invitations for membership to lithuania latvia estonia slovenia slovakia bulgaria and romania each candidate had pursued an indi vidual membership action plan map since1999 to improve democr atic structures and military capabilities and procedures some administration officials contended that the baltic states across the board had made the most progress and that

normally require decade or more to approach those standards officials in allied states have tended to describe the prague r ound of enlargement as political rather than st rategic round underta ken

issue of joint peacekeeping arrangements between nato and russia with less progress over such issues as stemming pro liferation some allie d governments believe that the russians wish to use the council to revive an earlier era in which washington and moscow were the two principal interloc utors in resolving key matters of european security us officials believe that nato should give the russians time to be educated in the ways of working with an alliance of independent sovereign states meetings of the natoukraine working group have often been difficult the allies viewed kiev as having made little progress on the road to democratic and military reform the bush administration believed that in vi olation of sanctions the nowdeparted kuchma government may have sold s ovietera earlywarning system called kolchuga4 to iraq step that led to the suspension of some us aid the allies pointedly did not invite ukrainian president leonid kuchma to the summit however with the election of reformminded gove rnment in december 2004 nato is assertively inviting kiev to review its interest in membership from strategic viewpoint the administr ation believes that partnership

central asiahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21354crs5 debate over the alliances future in the background of discussions at the summit were concerns over the lliances future some administration officials sharply criticized the allies for their failure to develop forces to respond to todays thr eats and for the cumbersome decisionmaking procedures that seem to impede steps to make nato more flexible some allies continue to have very different views of the threat to european and allied security while some states such as fran ce germany and italy see growing threat from terrorism and proliferati on they believe that the unite d states is narrowly obsessed with such issues and that political diplomatic and lawenforcement initiatives can manage much of the current threat they do agree with the administration that law enforcement measures are key element in combating terrorism and proliferation but think that military instruments are less effective they believe that the administration is often impulsive in confronting current dangers they strongly object to president bushs doctrine of preemptive or preventive action and almost uniformly oppose using nato assets in the name of such doctrine the administrations strong support for the sharon government in israel in the view of some europeans have unduly antagonized the islamic world and are political abrasions unde rmining allied solidarity some european officials talk of following the french practice of developing hedging strategies in the event that us policies in the middle east viewed by the europeans as overly aggressive should fail building an eu force to handl crisis management or developing better relations with iran are exam ples of such strategies
