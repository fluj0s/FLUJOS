why the us is losing in afghanistan by anthony h cordesman 01 october 2008 most of the literature on the cost of the iraq war afghan war and war on terror focuses on the burden it places on the federal budget and the us economy these are very real issues but they also have deflected attention from another key issue whether the war in afghanistan is being properly funded and being given the resources necessary to win the situation in afghanistan has now deteriorated steadily for more than five years an assessment the us intelligence community has agreed to in its latest analysis of the war the north atlantic treaty organization nato commander in afghanistan general david mckiernan has noted that violence was at least 30 higher in september 2008 than in september 2007 and was driven by three factors the insurgents have adapted their tactics to smaller scale ieds and ambush type attacks the us and natointernational security assistance force isaf have greater presence and therefore greater contact with the insurgency deteriorating condition in these tribal areas of pakistan more drugs and insurgents are being sent over the border new center for strategic and international studies csis briefing losing the afghanpakistan war the rising threat tells this story in more depth and how it is reflected in growing afghan and allied casualties united nations and declassified us intelligence maps that show the steady expansion of threat influence and the regions that are unsafe for aid workers other data show how afghan drug growing has steadily moved south and become major source of financing for the taliban and other insurgent movements work by seth g jones leading rand analyst has shown how insurgent groups like the taliban haqqani network gulbuddin hekmatyars hezbi islami hi alqaeda and affiliated groups in pakistan have formed three fronts in northeastern southeastern and southern afghanistan that are linked by what he calls complex adaptive system of loosely cooperating groups that act as distributed and constantly adapting network at the same time the and other assessments summarized in the csis briefing show that the taliban and other groups have steadily expanded their presence and influence in the country side particularly in the many areas where natoisaf and the afghan government cannot provide either security or governance these now include substantial areas in central afghanistan in and around the capital and growing pockets in the north and west this recovery and expansion did not begin to gather serious momentum until 2003 and did not seriously threaten the afghan government and usnatoisaf forces until 2005 the us had several critical years in which to provide the resources necessary to deter and defeat it instead of acting decisively and effectively however the us failed to provide the necessary resources situation that the chairman of the joint chief made clear continues to this day in his testimony to the house armed services committee on september 10 2008 the chiefs and i recommended the deployment of marine battalion to afghanistan this fall and the arrival of another army brigade early next year these forces by themselves will not adequately meet general mckiernans desire for up to three brigades but they are good start i judge the risk of not sending them too great risk right now to ignore if nation chooses to fight war it has to pay enough to win it look at the reporting on the overall cost of the afghan war shows that the us has failed to commit anything like the resources it committed to the war in iraq the us has been slow to commit the resources required and has never adequately funded the conflict the us failed to provide substantial funds early in the war when national building and stability operations might well have stopped to resurgence of the taliban and growth of the insurgency and then reacted to the growth of the threat with inadequate resources and funding of the us military us aid and diplomacy and afghan force development efforts the end result is consistent failure to provide the resources to allow the us and natoisaf to seize the initiative and defeat the insurgency it is also legacy of underfunding that has progressively increased the length and total cost of the war in human lives the wounded and dollars this will be major challenge to the next president the problem is not simply us troop levels it is dealing with failure to create anything like an effective overall strategy to fight the war if strategy is defined as requiring practical plan to implement and the resources to act afghanistan is larger than iraq has larger population has far more difficult terrain to fight in and has virtual enemy sanctuary in pakistan on its eastern and southern borders it is also nation which has never had cohesive government and whose governmental structure was in war or near chaos over two decades before the us invasion it also never had military or police force that was more than fraction the size of iraq and had modern national military forces after 1993 while there are reliable statistics on either country the cia data provide as good rough estimate as any moreover many of these numbers show just how much more serious the nation building challenge is in country that has never moved towards major economic development in the past and that afghanistan faces ethnic sectarian and linguistic divisions at least as serious as those in iraq while there are reliable estimates of the size of talibanhihaqqani forces in afghanistan relative to the size of alqaeda in iraq and its affiliates the background briefings given by various intelligence organizations indicate that the insurgent threat to afghanistan core cadres the guesstimate of 10000 is often used for both wars part time fighters and associated supporters is probably at least as large as the insurgent threat in iraq recent background briefs also indicate that there are now significantly more foreign fighters involved in the insurgency in afghanistan than the insurgency in iraq although numbers vary so much from estimate to estimate that it is impossible to provide even reasonable range of numbers comparison of the cost to date of the afghan and iraq wars however reflects the same comparative lack of resources that is reflected in troop levels and in aid personnel in spite of significant allied contributions the afghan war has so far received less outside funding than the iraq war and has had fewer combat troops than were committed to the coalition forces in iraq at their peak afghanistan is also far poorer country had savings and capital resources to draw upon once the initial fighting war over and not oil exports or other economic activity capable of funding the basic needs of its population much less funding development and strong national security forces resourcing the war there are differences in the estimates of the relative cost of the afghan and iraq wars but there is broad consensus as to the cost of direct expenditures by the federal government in terms of budget authority the most recent work by amy belasco of the congressional research service shows that the total budget authority for the afghan war now totals 1711 billion for expenditures over eight fiscal years counting the fy2009 bridge funds as part of fy2008 versus 6531 billion for six fiscal years of the iraq war accordingly expenditures have been 38 times higher on iraq to date and the average expenditure on afghanistan per years has been 2146 billion versus 1089 billion for iraq the average expenditure on iraq has been roughly five times higher comparative costs are only part of the story the us made the same fundamental mistakes in both wars it entered them without any plan to conduct meaningful stability operations to take on nationbuilding tasks or to fight major insurgency this grand strategic failure occurred as result of decisions made by the george w bush administration in spite of warnings from many experts in the us military us state department the us intelligence community and outside experts this failure contributed immensely to the us and allied casualties in both wars and to their length total cost civilian casualties collateral damage and opportunity costs there was however fundamental difference in the way in which the bush administration reacted to the challenges it faced after the initial moment of conventional victory the us reacted almost immediately by making massive expenditures on us forces in iraq and economic aid total funding rose from 53 billion in fy2003 to 759 billion in fy2004 s855 billion in fy2006 1336 billion in fy2007 and 1492 billion in fy2008 these figures were radically different in the case of afghanistan the us effectively failed to resource steadily more serious insurgency as it developed during fy2002 through fy2006 the bush administration simply did not fund the war it had to fight it never committed anything like the aid resources necessary to support win hold build strategy in spite of the fact that afghanistan unlike iraq did not have substantial funds left over from the previous regime and major ongoing stream of income from oil exports there was never year in afghanistan where the us made major aid commitment as it did in fy2004 in iraq when it committed 195 billion in funds for foreign aid and diplomatic operations moreover the us wasted two critical years fy2001 and fy2002 by providing only token funds for foreign aid and diplomatic operations 800 million in fy2001 and fy2002 given the fact that start up aid program takes at least year to begin to be effective often takes 1418 months to go from authorization to start up on the ground and then takes months to years to complete this was major failure the administration never seemed to realize that it needed to take the initiative to shape the broad politicomilitary battlefield and dominate the situation before the talibanhihaqqanial qaeda could react for all the us talk of shaping the decisionmaking cycle it was the us that has reacted to enemy gains and actions since 2002 authorizing money versus spending it there are detailed data available on actual spend out rates for aid but the data on department of defense authorizations versus obligations provide rough idea of just how important the time gap is between authorizing and executing the same report by amy belasco reports that department of defense obligations for fy2001fy2008 totaled 4442 billion or 77 for iraq and 1004 billion or 18 is for afghanistan and other war on terror activity the budget authority for the same period was 808 billion with 6162 billion going to iraq and 1872 billion going to afghanistan and other war on terror activity note that like the other data these figures include other war on terror activity in the totals for afghanistan these numbers indicate that only 72 of the money authorized for iraq has been obligated which is not the same as actual spending or any form of actual activity on the ground and only 63 of the money for afghanistan and the war on terror ironically the rate of obligation is slower for the afghan conflict although it has been much longer conflict in terms of how low the average monthly obligation rates have been in the afghan war versus iraq nothing approaching that level of effort has occurred in afghanistan underresourcing the us defense effort there are clear formulas for deciding what level of forces or military spending is needed to win war what is clear however is that underresourcing and underreacting to the growth of the threat allow an insurgency to grow and potentially win and that deploying decisive resources and forces as early as possible enable force to both deter the growth of an insurgency and to defeat it the growth of department of defense spending on afghanistan not only lagged far behind spending on iraq it failed to provide adequate funding during the critical years immediately after the talibans defeat in 2002 what is equally striking about the relative defense efforts is that the us approached the early years of the afghan war as if could declare mission accomplished and all that was required was peacekeeping and aid in the process it was able to obtain substantial support from nato and other countries that showed great sympathy for the us after the events of 911 and obtain substantial money and forces for the peacekeeping and aid missions at least partly because of the demands imposed by the war in iraq however us and allied forces never reacted to the steady rise in threat activity by deploying adequate us troops military weaponry and contractor support all of the capabilities made possible by adequate spending by the department of defense the us instead attempted to pressure its allies and nato to increase their force levels and spending and convert from peacekeeping to warfighting mission it is tribute to nations like canada britain and denmark that they took on major warfighting mission in southern afghanistan it is scarcely tribute to the us that it sought to obtain more than it could from allied countries which lacked the domestic political support and often the kind of power projection resources necessary to make major shift in mission in fact us attempts to use nato as substitute for us forces were not the ultimate test of nato but rather the result of us failure to react to the resurgence in talibanhihaqqani activity from 2004 onwards that was made possible by progress us failure to deploy adequate resources this was scarcely matter of dollars alone us commanders repeated asked for more us forces as the insurgency intensified it was only in 2007 that the us officials have openly recognized realities that should have been clear half decade ago and it was not until 2008 that the us began to seriously respond even then the increase in us forces fell far short of what was required secretary of defense robert gates made this point somewhat obliquely in his testimony to the house armed service committee on september 10 2008 we did not get to this point overnight so some historical context is useful the mission in afghanistan has evolved over the years in both positive and negative ways reported insurgent activities and attacks have grown over the past twoand ahalf years in some cases this is result of safe havens in pakistan and reduced military pressure on that side of the border in others it is the result of more international and afghan troops on the battlefield troops that are increasingly in contact with the enemy in response to increased violence and insurgent activity in 2006 in january of last year we extended the deployment of an army brigade and added another brigade this last spring the united states deployed 3500 marines in all the number of american troops in the country increased from less than 21000 two years ago to nearly 31000 today at the nato summit in bucharest in april isaf allies and partners restated their commitment to afghanistan france added 700 troops in eastern afghanistan this fall germany will seek to increase its troop ceiling from 3500 to 4500 poland is also increasing its forces by more than 1000 troops the number of coalition troops including nato troops increased from about 20000 to about 31000 it appears that this trend will continue as other allies such as the united kingdom add more troops thanks to success in iraq we will increase us troop levels in afghanistan by deploying marine battalion this november and in january 2009 an army brigade combat team units that had been slated for iraq the chairman of the joint chiefs mike mullen made it clear in the same hearing however that us force levels would remain inadequate through at least the beginning of the 2009 campaign season and the next president would not only inherit war being fought without adequate resources but one that did not have coherent strategy i am convinced we can win the war in afghanistan that is why i intend to commission new more comprehensive strategy for the region one that covers both sides of the border its why i have pushed hard for the continued growth and training of afghan national security forces its why i have pressed hard on my counterparts in pakistan to do more against extremists and to let us do more to help them and its why the chiefs and i recommended the deployment of marine battalion to afghanistan this fall and the arrival of another army brigade early next year these forces by themselves will not adequately meet general mckiernans desire for up to three brigades but they are good start i judge the risk of not sending them too great risk right now to ignore my expectation is that they will need to perform both the training mission and combat and combat support missions simultaneously until such time that we can provide additional troops i cannot at this point say when that might be again we must continually assess our progress there and in iraq weighing it against global risk and the health of the force before we make any more commitments general david g mckiernan the nato isaf commander in afghanistan made similar points made about the need for more forces in an interview published in the national journal on september 13 2008 he stated later that the small increase in us forces that bush announced in september had still left him at least three brigades short of the us forces he needed in some ways bringing sustainable security to afghanistan is more difficult than in iraq starting with the fact that this is one of the poorest countries on earth with literacy rate estimated at only 30 mckiernan said in an interview at his headquarters in kabul there is lack of human capital in afghanistan to do the things you expect of government whether thats serving as mayor or policeman or running budget or managing labor force in comparison iraq is fairly rich and literate society which is why i dont find comparisons between the two conflicts all that helpful building afghan security and governance capability from the bottom up at the local level and from the top down at the national level will be one of the most important factors to winning in afghanistan military capability by itself wont win this fight after security is established we have to build governance and have reconstruction and development to meet the needs of the afghan people only when all three of those lines of operation work together in tandem will we get the right outcome there is doubt that afghanistan has not received the resources from the international community needed to meet its requirements for security governance or development militarily we have never had enough forces to conduct proper counterinsurgency campaign across afghanistan to do that clear out insurgents keep them separated from the population and set the conditions for reconstruction and development all of that translates to boots on the ground and we are short of them im happy to take contributions from as many partner nations as possible but what these national restrictions do is limit natos inherent advantage in speed mobility intelligencegathering firepower commandandcontrol and logistics when nations restrict the use of their forces it decreases those advantages so did major general jeffrey j schloesser the commander of the 101st airborne division and us forces in eastern afghanistan in an interview published on the newsweek web site on september 10 2008 we need more troops here in the east i think general mckiernan has said the same speaking more broadly of afghanistan i dont want to characterize it as troop surge but to clear hold and build we will need more forces and that includes more afghan forces which are critical are two to three more brigades the answer it depends on our success as we increase the number of troops and then whats the impact on the enemy some things are not knowable in the coming months the problems in aid spending are complex and difficult to summarize the us was able to get significant percentage of allied aid contributions in terms of pledges but cash flow was often slow and some pledges were not met or given in the flexible grant terms that afghanistan needed national aid programs were diverse in character and dividing the country into national provincial reconstruction teams prts ensured lack of coordination aid efforts also initially treated afghanistan as if it were secure exercise in traditional economic development rather than war zone in which aid had to be used to offset insurgent activity as part of coordinated win build hold activity that concentrated both military and aid resources in joint effort to contain and defeat rising insurgency even in 2008 it is sometimes difficult to find clear references to the fact that afghanistan is at war in the reporting by various aid efforts in other cases the fighting is treated as an annoyance or interference in peaceful aid activity regardless of the fact that the insurgent see aid workers as major target and the has expanded its maps of threats to aid workers to cover well over half the country in many cases however most aid workers cannot or will not go into the high threat areas where dollars are critical complement to bullets and aid is critical there are also basic shortages of qualified us aid workers the department of defense report to congress on the war issued in june 2008 reported that 1021 of the us aid worker in the prts were military in contrast there were 11 department of state aid workers 12 of 13 authorized usaid personnel and four of 11 authorized department of agriculture personnel the situation is further complicated by trying to run major drug eradication program without adequate aid aid workers and afghan government support to provide alternative income the aid agenda even lacks the broad emphasis on agricultural development that is critical in country where this is the major source of employment which has suffered from decades of war and is now significant food importer the end result has been to make many afghans dependent on growing opium while confronting them with the threat of eradication without adequate options or compensation ironically it has also driven opium cultivation steadily into the talibancontrolled areas in southern afghanistan effectively funding the insurgency the lack of coordination in the aid effort has also been matched by far too many efforts that do not spend their resources in afghanistan and which lack validated requirements fiscal controls and measures of effectiveness while there are many dedicated and competent aid efforts there are many failures compounded by the pervasive corruption of the afghan government there is lack of noble concepts and good intentions but execution generally falls far short of what is required the us did recognize the need to surge aid money into iraq early in that war in spite of the fact iraq still had large reserves of capital left over from the era of saddam hussein and significant oil export income the us committed 3 billion in fy2003 the first year of the war and surged 195 billion in aid funds in fy2004 the us spent total of only 800 million in aid in the afghan war during fy2001 and fy2002 and only 07 million in fy2003 it never surged aid during any year of the afghan conflict and its peak spending of 28 billion came in the fifth year of the war this underfunding takes on particular importance in the view of the testimony that gates gave to to the house armed services committee on september 10 2008 as in iraq additional forces alone will not solve the problem security is just one aspect of the campaign alongside development and governance we must maintain momentum keep the international community engaged and develop the capacity of the afghan government the entirety of the nato alliance the eu ngos and other groups our full military and civilian capabilities must be on the same page and working toward the same goal with the afghan government i am still not satisfied with the level of coordination and collaboration among the numerous partners and many moving parts associated with civil reconstruction and development and building the capacity of the afghan government similarly mullen stated we can build roads and schools and courts and our provincial reconstruction teams are doing just that we can build roads and schools and courts and our provincial reconstruction teams are doing just that but until we have represented in those teams more experts from the fields of commerce agriculture jurisprudence and education those facilities will remain but empty shells less than one in twenty prts throughout the country are supported by nonmilitary personnel afghanistan doesnt just need more boots on the ground it needs more trucks on those roads more teachers in those schools and more trained judges and lawyers in those courts foreign investment alternative crops sound governance the rule of law these are the keys to success in afghanistan we cant kill our way to victory and armed force anywhere matter how good can deliver these keys alone it requires teamwork and cooperation and it will require the willingness by everyone in the interagency and international community to focus less on what we think we each do best and more on what we believe we can all do better together underresourcing the afghan military the impact of underresourcing the war goes beyond inadequate us force levels and nationbuilding activity the bush administration made equally serious mistakes in the timing and scale of its efforts to create effective host country forces in both wars it came to see the need for large and effective host country forces only after the insurgency had taken hold in both afghanistan and iraq and it then continued to underreact and underresource the creation of both afghan and iraqi security forces once again however these mistakes were corrected much more quickly in iraq than afghanistan and the us has never funded an adequate effort in afghanistan for years the us pushed key parts of the afghan mission off on allies who had real capabilities to create anything more capable than conventional european police force it did not provide either the us money or us military personnel to create an afghan army close to the size required as the department of defense reported in june 2008 the 2001 bonn agreement established the goal of 50000person ana and 62000person anp the bonn ii agreement in december of 2002 expanded the ana target endstrength to 70000 personnel since the bonn agreements and the international declaration of the afghanistan compact in 2006 security conditions have evolved with resurgence of activity by insurgents and anti government elements consequently in may 2007 the international communitys joint coordination and monitoring board jcmb approved an increase to 82000 authorized anp similarly with the endorsement of the jcmb on february 5 2008 the authorized ana force structure increased to 80000 personnel with an additional 6000 allotted for the trainee transient hospital and student account it was not until september 11 2008 almost seven years to the day after 911 that the chairman of the joint chiefs announced that the slow expansion of the afghan army would suddenly change from goal of some 85000 men to 162100 troops mullen provided the following testimony to the house armed services committee on september 10 2008 as i once said about iraq let now say about afghanistan absent broader international and interagency approach to the problems there it is my professional opinion that amount of troops in amount of time can ever achieve all the objectives we seek and frankly sir we are running out of time we can train and help grow the afghan security forces and we are in fact they are on track to reach total end strength of 162000 troops by 2010 the marines conducting this training are doing phenomenal job but until those afghan forces have the support of local leaders to improve security on their own we will only be as much as crutch and temporary one at that it is important to note that these increases come after warning by the gao and others that the goal of making afghan forces ready in 20112012 was not realistic even when qualified by the fact that such readiness would still be limited and full development of adequate afghan forces was planned to require lasting commitment of natoisaf forces and strategic partnership that extended beyond 2019 the interim cstca campaign plan for the development of afghan national military and police forces agreed to in january 29 2008 and before two followon expansions in the force goals for the ana set the following goals phase 1 fieldgenerate afghan national security capability army and police forces are manned have completed individual training and are equipped to 85 percent or better complete by mid2010 phase 2 develop afghan national security capability afghan and coalition forces will jointly plan coordinate and conduct operations coalition forces will partner with army and police units to assist in the development of capabilities necessary to achieve cm1 complete by the end of 2011 phase 3 transition to strategic partnership the afghan government will assume the lead responsibility for its own security needs with continued engagement by the international community cstca will have completed its current mission and should transition into security assistance organization under resourcing the afghan national army ana to put this expansion in perspective the original goal set in 2002 was to create an ethnically balanced and voluntary ana force of more than 70000 this goal was still being reaffirmed in 2006 and the us natoisaf and the afghan government set the end of 2010 as the timeline for the establishment of the ana it was not until february 2008 that they responded to the steady growth in taliban activity by endorsing 10000 person increase in the ana from 70000 to 80000 the us also failed to provide serious funding for force that could take on serious counterinsurgency missions until fy2005 and then cut back in fy2006 for reasons that are remarkably hard to determine it only began truly major funding effort in fy2007 and that was cut by more than 50 in fy2008 only to see the war worsen and the sharp increases in force goals that took place in cy2008 the us not only failed to adequately fund the ana it only reacted after the talibanhihaqqani scored major gains in the power vacuum left by inadequate forces and resources it then reacted erratically and as if s surge in one year could somehow solve the problem the strategy for the ana was more coherent or effective than the strategy for us force levels or us aid the us was strong on concept and rhetoric and dismally incompetent in planning management and execution the cost of failing to provide the proper resources for the afghan army which has been seen as the key alternative to more us troops and the inability to obtain more allied troops has been that an effective force has not been created as quickly as possible and us and natoisaf goals remain unmet the gao summarized the progress in creating the afghan army as follows in report in june 2008 the united states has invested over 10 billion to develop the ana since 2002 however only 2 of 105 army units are assessed as being fully capable of conducting their primary mission and efforts to develop the army continue to face challenges first while the army has grown to approximately 58000 of an authorized force structure of 80000 it has experienced difficulties finding qualified candidates for leadership positions and retaining personnel second while trainers or mentors are present in every ana combat unit shortfalls exist in the number deployed to the field finally ana combat units report significant shortages in about 40 of equipment items defense defines as critical including vehicles weapons and radios some of these challenges are due in part to competing us global priorities without resolving these challenges the ability of the ana to reach full capability may be delayed the gao also provided more details on the impact of slow start and systematic underfunding in the full report since we reported in 2005 more personnel have been trained and assigned to the ana specifically focusing on combat troops defense reports that 37866 combat troops have been trained and assigned to the ana as of april 2008 compared with 18300 troops in march 2005 although this represents more than twofold increase in the amount of combat troops it is approximately 5000 forces less than defense had predicted would be trained by fall 2007 moreover new positions have been added to the anas structure since our 2005 report including an expanded afghan air corps and the ana force structure has increased to 80000 while more troops have received training as of april 2008 only two ana units out of 105 rated are assessed as cm1 fully capable thirtysix percent of ana units 38 of 105 rated units are assessed at cm2 and are capable of conducting their primary mission with routine international support the remaining ana units are less capable thirtyone percent 32 of 105 rated units are cm3capable of partially conducting their primary mission but reliant on international support 11 11 of 105 rated units are cm4 formed but not yet capable and 21 22 of 105 rated units are not yet formed or not reporting the expected date when the ana will gain the capability to assume lead responsibility for its own security is unclear as of april 2008 monthly reports provided by cstca show the expected date of full ana capability as march 2011 however this date does not account for shortfalls in the required number of mentors and trainers thus defense officials cautioned that currently predicted dates for the achievement of fully capable afghan army are subject to change and may be delayed defense assessment reports from november 2007 to february 2008 show between 8 and 12 of combat unit personnel were absent without leave awol with awol rates as high as 17 for soldiers in one ana corps for the ana to achieve sustained growth senior defense official stated that awol rates should be higher than 8 although basic recruiting is strong the ana is experiencing difficulties finding qualified candidates for leadership and specialist positions defense reports that recruiting goals for ana infantry positions have been met despite adjustments to increase ana training output by 6000 soldiers annually however cstca noted shortfalls in the number of candidates available for noncommissioned officer nco and specialty skill positions such as logistics and medical support between november 2007 and february 2008 ana manning levels for ncos ranged between 50 to 70 of the authorized number shortages exist in the number of embedded trainers and mentors fielded for instance as of april 2008 the united states has fielded 46 1019 of 2215 of defenses required number of embedded trainers officials attributed these shortfalls to competing us priorities for defense personnel including the war in iraq cstca has submitted requests for additional forces to act as embedded trainers to assist the ana however the request has been deferred as of april 2008 members of the international community assisting in this effort have fielded 32 out of 37 mentor teams promised although the number of international mentors in the field is smaller than the number of us embedded trainers approximately onethird of personnel in the field assisting ana unit development are coalition mentors while twothirds are us personnel since we reported in 2005 new equipment plans for the ana have been implemented and the ana has received more equipment items in 2005 defense planned to equip the afghan army with donated and salvaged weapons and armored vehicles however much of this equipment proved to be worn out defective or incompatible with other equipment in 2006 defense began providing some ana forces with us equipment further as security deteriorated equipment needs changed and defense planned to provide more protective equipment such as armored humvees and more lethal weapons such as rocketpropelled grenades of 55 critical equipment items for ana combat forces cstca reports having less than half of the required amount on hand for 21 of these items the gao reporting on shortages of us and nato advisors are also only part of the story as department of defense reporting in june 2008 stated as of march 2008 us etts require total of 2391 personnel however only 1062 are currently assigned 44 fill the low fillrate is due to the additional requirement to provide support to the anp though police mentor teams pmts full pmt manning requires 2358 total military personnel currently 921 personnel are assigned 39 fill sourcing solutions are being worked to address the shortfall of personnel across the ett and pmt requirements afghanistan deployment requirements are being weighed against other global manning priorities the failure to provide effective resources for the afghan national police anp has been even more serious what is striking is that it took until fy2004 to begin serious funding of the police effort given the lead times involved in creating effective units this meant that any major output from the funding could only begin in fy2005 and could only gather serious momentum in fy2006 in practice however the actual training effort was so badly manned and organized that the actual pace of progress has been far slower only 35000 men had been trained as of january 2005 and one knew how many had actually stayed in service this is scarcely reassuring for force whose completion dates have reflected nightmare of slippage whiles its force goal rose from the original goal of 62000 men to 82000 in may 2007 since 2002 the united states has provided about 62 billion to train and equip the anp however as of april 2008 police unit was assessed as fully capable of performing its mission over threefourths of the police units were assessed as not capable the lowest capability rating defense assigns to units that have been formed as of the same date the anp had reportedly grown in number to nearly 80000 about 97 of the forces end strength of 82000 however the extent to which the anp has truly grown is questionable given concerns that have been raised by defense about the reliability of police manning figures building capable anp requires manning training and equipping forces however several challenges have impeded us efforts to build capable anp the us is now experimenting with new system called focused district development where it takes all of the police in given district offline for training and replaces them with model unit in the interim this effort only began in november 2007 however and is still experimental so far it has been completed in less than 11 of 433 ano units in 365 districts if urban police districts are included moreover the gao notes although defenses newly adopted focused district development initiative to reconstitute the uniformed police involves considerable resources and is expected to last four to five years at minimum interim milestones or consistent end date for the effort are identified in defenses fivepage document monthly status reports or briefings that outline the effort in the absence of interim milestones and consistent end date for focused district development it will be difficult to determine if this ambitious new effort is progressing as intended without an end date and milestones for the us effort to complete and sustain the entire anp it is difficult to determine how long the united states may need to continue providing funding and other resources for this important mission one that us military officials stated may extend beyond decade anthony h
