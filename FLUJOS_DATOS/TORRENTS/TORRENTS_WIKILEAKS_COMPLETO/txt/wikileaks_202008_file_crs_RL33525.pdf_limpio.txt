park service nps the fish and wildlife service fws nd the bureau of land management blm in the department of the interior doi and the forest service fs in the department of agriculture1 these agencies manage federal lands for variety of purposes relating to the pres ervation development and us of the lands and natural resources the nps administers the national park system for recreational use of parklands and preservation of park resources mission th at can be contradictory the fws manages wildlife refuges primarily for protecting and improving fish and wildlife habitats with other uses to the extent that they are compatible the blm manages public lands and the fs manages national forests for similar multiple uses including grazing recreation timber water and fish and wildlife many forests and public lands also are available for miner exploration and development the national trails system admin istered by the fs nps nd blm often in cooperation with state and local authorities permits many recreation uses but motorized vehicles generally are prohibited this preservationuse dichotomy while varying among agencies is focal point for debate over recreation on federal lands increased r ecreation and allegations of overuse in some areas contribute to disagreement on issues of access regulation integrity of natural and cultural resources and motorized versus nonmotorized recreational activities recreation debates also arise in areas managed by other federal agencies such as reservoirs nd rivers managed by the army corps of engineers in the department of defense and the dois bureau of reclamation where decisions on water releases may affect recreation the growth and development of western states proximity of many urban areas to public lands and growing popularity of outdoor recreation have translated into high demand for variety of recreationa l opportunities on federa l lands and waters blm for example reports that over 22 million people live within 25 miles of public lands and that twothirds of blmadministe red lands are within 50 miles of an urban area2 agency figures indicate an overall increase in recreational visits to federal lands in recent decades

and grassla nds and the corps 400 million visits for the most recent year available over the last 40 years forms of moto rized recreation snowmobiles personal watercraft other offhighway vehicles and nonmotorized vehicles such as mountain bikes have evolved and gained in popularity these new forms intersect with the many popular trad itional forms of recreation these include waterbased activities fishing canoeing kayaking rafting etc and variety of landbased pursuits birdwatching camping hiking hunting horseback riding rock climbing etc the use of ohvs on federal lands and wate rs has been particularly contentious and lawsuits have challeng ed their management ohv s upporters contend that these vehicles provide outdoor r ecreation opportunitie s for the disabled senior citizens and

the first eo 11644 februa ry 8 1972 defines an offroad vehicle orv now commonly referred to as an offhighway vehicle as any motorized vehicle designed for or capable of cro ss country travel on or immediately over land water sand snow ice marsh swampland or other natural terrain with exceptions for any registered motorboat or authorized or emergency vehicles it was issued to establish policies and provide for procedures that will ensure that the use of offroad vehicles on public lands will be controlled and directed so as to protect the resources of those lands to promote the safety of all users of those lands and to minimize conflicts among the various uses of those lands the order directed each agency to develop and issue regulations to carry out this purpose and to provide for the designation of areas and tr ails on which ohvs may be pe rmitted and areas in which such vehicles would not be permitted agencies were to monitor the effects of ohv use and amend or rescind area designations or other actions taken pursuant to the order as needed to further th policy of the executive order subsequent executive order 11989 may 24 1977 amended the 1972 order to exclude military

rewrote its draft policies extensively based on analysis of over 45000 comments u ltimately retaining in large part the 2001 policy language and its emphasis on conservation the 2006 document cites

groups generally are supportive of the final management policies but cautious about future policy implementation and forcement policy critics view the document as favoring conservation over recreation and are uncertain how the preservation and protection of na tural soundscapes may affect motorized recreation however some critics point to new lang uage that promotes public collaborative relationships between nps and gateway communities among other provisions as positive step for incorporating local views on the importance of recreation to the economy of these communities separately nps is developing proposed rule addressing mountain bicycles within nps units current regulations 36 cfr 430 nd park management policies 9225 require speci regulations to designat bicycle trails other than those on park roads parking lots and w ithin developed areas such as campgrounds nps anticipates that the proposed rule will authorize park superintendents to designate trails for biking if such proposed designations are noncontroversial mountain biking advocates ch as the international mountain biking association imba actively support opening additional trails to m ountain bikers while other groups have expressed concern that easing trail designation pr ocedures could cause resource damage and conflict with the enjo yment of visitors on foot or horseback legislative activity two bills s 3113 and hr 6233 would affect ohv management at cape hatteras national seashore both bills seek to nullify the april 2008 consent decree placing seasonal rest rictions on ohv access to defined beach areas at cape hatteras national park the bills would reinstate the nps interim management strategy issued on june 13 2007 until final ohv management plan and implementing rule are completed anticipated in 2010 and 2011 respectively senate and house committee hearings july 30 2008 and september 11 2008 respectively focused on the impact of limited public b each access for fishing and other recreational activities on tourism and the local ec onomy one member said nearly 15 reduction in seashore visits since implementation of the settlement is economically damaging the areas tourism dependent businesses each bills s ponsor also expressed concern that the seashore is being managed via court decision without sufficient public input one witne ss testified that resource closures affect small sections of beach from which nes ting shorebird and rtle populations have benefitted and increased in number further an nps representative said the consent decree accommodates both

pending formal rulemaking and public comme nt to date nps has taken further action on general policy for snowmobiles however the final nps management policies released on august 31 2006 did include ne w language to cover both snowmobiles and oversnow vehicles 8232 they state that outsi alaska special regulations are required to designate snow mobile and oversnow vehicle routes after park planning determines such use to be appropriate designated routes are limited to those used by motorboats and mo torized vehicles in other seasons administrative actions since the summer of 2000 regulatory and judicial actions to restrict or allow snowmobile use have centered on ye llowstone and grand teton national parks and the connecting john d rockefeller jr memorial parkway the clinton administration issued final rules to incrementally eliminate snowmobile use in these three park units with limited exceptions in favor of multi passenger snowcoaches by the 20032004 winter season21 however june 2001 bush administration lawsuit settlement with the international snowmobile manufacturers association isma and the state of wyoming required nps to revisit the snowmobile ban and consider any additional information on cleaner quieter snowmobile technology the new nps final rule reversed the snowmobile ban in favor of daily entry limits use of trained guides snowmobile emission standards and an adaptive management strategy allowing park managers to take remedial action if monitoring indicates unacceptable impacts from air and noise pollution22 subsequent legal challenges effec tively split the 20032004 winter season with each subseason managed under different rule s with significantly different limits on daily snowmobile entries these conflicting rulings created confusion for park visitors local communities and businesses with many unsure whether they could visit the park in winter and what winter us rules were in effect subsequently nps issued final rule to implement temporary winter use management plan effective for three winter seasons through 2006200723 the interim rules intent was to provide certainty to gateway communities businesses and park visitors while nps completed longterm environmental impact analyses of motorized oversnow vehicles on the three area parks and developed new longterm plan to manage winter recreational use the temporary rule expired at the conclusion of the 20062007 winter season without new rule and winter use plan in place for the 20072008 winter season snowmobiles and snowcoach would be prohibited however on september 24 2007 nps

reconciling the geographic applicability of the relevant laws it further recommended that the secretary of transportation direct the faa to take certain actions to ensure that the nps receives

areas of population growth in the west has contributed to an incr ease in recreation on some blm lands blm lands are used for diverse forms of recr eation including hunting fishing visiting cultural and natural sites birdwatchi ng hiking picnicking camping boating mountain biking and offhighway vehicle dr iving the growing and diverse nature of recreation on blm lands has increased th challenge of managi ng different types of recreation such as low impact eg hi king and high impact eg ohv uses it also has increased the challenge of mana ging recreation and other land uses for instance in some areas recreation and energy development have come in conflict with hunters fishermen outfitters and guides nd other recreationists at odds with energy producing interests seeking to maintain or increase energy development on public lands overall access to blm lands for variety of recreational purposes is viewed as important for fostering public healt h public support for nd management and stable economic base for communities that depend on recreation and tourism recreational access also has enhanced interest in protecting the ecological integrity of federal lands from envi ronmental harm as re sult of recreational use motorized ohv use including use of dirt bikes and allterrain vehicles is major recreational use of blm lands that s been controversial controversy exists in various areas throughout the west such as the san rafael swell in southern utah the imperial sand dunes recreation area in southern california and the arizona strip in northern arizona while mo torized user groups often have opposed restrictions on ohv use many environmenta lists have been cerned about harm to natural and cultural resources in some areas ohv use ma conflict with other types of recreation such as hiking that seek qui et and solitude on agency lands there are also differing views on how effectively ohv authorities are being enforced while blm employs variety of means of forcement including monitoring law enforcement signing and mapping and emer gency closures of routes enforcement may be impeded in some locations due to their remoteness insufficient signs inadequate staff and

lands is provided in law executive orders and agency regulations and policies under agency regulations 43 cfr 8340 blm has been designating public lands as open limited or closed to ohv use as of augu st 7 2008 the following designations had been made closed where ohv use is prohibited 117 million acres 5 of designated area limited where ohv use is in some way restricted 1348 million acres 60 and open where ohv use is permitted anywhere 799 million acres 35 included in the open figure are about 100 specifically designated ohv areas the remaining 331 million acres of blm land mostly in alaska are not currently designated because blm management plan s do not address motorized use in these undesignated areas there are restrictions other regulations govern ohv use in particular areas for instance on augu st 18 2005 blm issued final supplementary rules for its lands in oregon and washington which include guidance on ohv use blm manages transportation on its nds through process described as comprehensive travel and transportation management50 goals include providing varied transportation routes for access to blm lands and providing areas for variety of motorized and nonmotorized forms of recreation travel and transportation management plans are devel oped for particular areas in addition blm has issued two national strategies dealing with transportation on its lands the national management strategy for motorized offhighway ve hicle use on public lands51 has multiple purposes including to guide land managers in resolving ohv issues to promote consistency of ohv decisionmaking to highlight needed staff and funding for ohv management to reduce conflicts am ong land users to promote responsible ohv use and reduce habitat degradation and to lead to an update of ohv regulations which has not occurred to date the national mountain bicycling strategic action plan52 addresses mountain bicycling and other musclepowered mechanical transport blm revised its land use planning handbook in 2005 regarding motorized and nonmotorized recreation53 the agency makes ohv designations during the planning process on an areabyarea basis and such designations often have been contentious and complex the agency is in the midst of multiyear effort to develop and update land use plans because many plans do not currently address ohv use and other relatively recent issues for instance six of the eleven blm field offices in utah have released proposed resource management pl ans governing land uses in those areas54 ohvs were major issue addressed during the process as part of travel management planning for the areas the efforts were expected to reduce the acreage open to cross country travel according to blm some of the plans call for the establishment of special recreation management areas where the combination of high level ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33525crs19 55 the report is available on the usgs website at httpwwwfortusgsgovpr oducts publicationspub_abstr actasppubid22021specific recreational activity and valuable natural resources would require more intensive management some of the plans also call for the establishment of extensive recreation management areas where r ecreation would be dispersed and non specialized and thus would not require intensive management in some cases the blm and fs jointly address ohv use on their lands for instance an interagency plan governs ohv use on lands in montana north dakota and south dakota joint management approaches where federal lands are intermingled can promote consistency and public unde rstanding of ohv guidance however blm and fs lands are different and they are governed by separate authorities making complete consistency on vehicular travel management difficult to achieve 2007 report of the us geological surv ey usgs contains literature review on the effects of ohv use on blm lands55 the report covers ohv effects on soils and watersheds vegetation wildlife and habitats and water and air quality it addresses the socioeconomic implications of ohv use mitigation and restorati on and monitoring and research needs legislative activity the continuing

for fy2009 the administration requested decrease in f unding to 591 million large part of the decrease was due to the administrations proposal to shift funding for national monuments and national conservation areas to another subactivity some pending measures would affect ohv use in particular areas for instance hr 222 contains provisions related to ohv use in central idaho they include conveying blm land to the state of idaho to establish motorized recreation park establishing special management area on certain blm and fs lands to provide opportunities for motorized and other recrea tion together with other uses and authorizing up to 10 million for the secretary of agriculture to grant to the state of idaho for the offroad motor vehicle program as another example s 802 and s 2833 would require the development of trav eltransportation mana gement plans for recreation on blm lands in owyhee county idaho other measures pertain to access for partic ular types of recreation for instance hr 6449 would provide access to and mana gement of blm lands for recreational shooting the bill would define recreational shooting as forms of shooting sport or pastime such as target and pr
