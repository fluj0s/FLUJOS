enhancement act of 2004 crs4 receiving militarytype training from foreign terrorist organization hr 10 sec 2042 s 2845 similar provision federal law proscribes providing material support or resources

weapons of mass destruction under series of jurisdictional circumstances violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years andor fine of not more than 250000 the jurisdictional circumstances include the fact that the offense is committed in the us in whole or in part or that the offender is us national us permanent resident alien stateless habitual resident of the us or later brought to or found in the us or that the offense involves aiding and abetting violation of section under which there is us jurisdiction providing material support to terrorism hr 10 sec 2043 s 2845 similar provision existing law prohibits providing material support for the commission of any of list of designated offenses 18 usc 2339a in addition anyone who aids or abets the commission of

organization 18 usc 2339b sections 2339a and 2339b apply within the united states and in some instances to violations occurring overseas in the case of section 2339a the section has the same extraterritorial application as its predicate offenses if the united states has prosecutorial jurisdiction over the terrorist crime that has been materially supported crs5 then it has prosecutorial jurisdiction over the violation of section 2339a in the case of section 2339b there is an explicit state of extraterritorial application 18 usc 2339bd as noted above some courts have indicated that application of the definition of material support may be subject to constitutional challenge under some circumstances humanitarian law project v united states department of justice 352 f3d 382 403404 9th cir 2003 vacd for rehg banc f3d 9th cir sept 8 2004 united states v sattar 272 fsupp2d 348 35761 sdny 2004 section 2043 amends 18 usc 2339a and 2339b with respect to section 2339a in addition to clarifying amendments the bill adds to the designated offense list any crime of international or domestic terrorism as defined in the usa patriot act 18 usc 2331 committed under particular jurisdictional conditions the jurisdictional conditions include the fact that us jurisdiction exists over the underlying terrorist offense the offense occurs in or affects interstate or foreign commerce the underlying domestic terrorism offense is calculated to coerce the us government matter where the offense occurs the offender is us national us permanent resident alien or stateless habitual residence of the us and the international terrorism offense is calculated to coerce the us or foreign government the act of international terrorism is committed within the us by foreign national and calculated to coerce the us or foreign government the act of international terrorism is committed outside the us by foreign national and calculated to coerce the us government with respect to section 2339b the bill identifies specific circumstances under which the us has jurisdiction over the offense the offense occurs in whole or in part in the us the offender is us national us permanent resident alien or stateless habitual resident of the us the offense occurs in or affects interstate or foreign commerce the offender is later brought to or found in the us the offense involves aiding or abetting violation over which there is us jurisdiction the bill also provides clarifying definition under section 2339b of providing assistance in the form of personnel and it supplies rule of construction that precludes prosecution so as to abridge the exercise of first amendment rights financing of terrorism hr 10 sec 2044 s 2845 similar provision section 2044 provides clarifying amendments to 18 usc 2339c which outlaws financing terrorism or concealing such financing to make it clear that the crs6 concealment proscription applies to direct and indirect funding and to material support as defined in sections 2339b and 2339a weapons of mass destruction prohibition improvement act of 2004 hr 10 sec 2051 s 2845 similar provision section 2051 designates subtitle iicd as the weapons of mass destruction prohibition improvement act of 2004 weapons of mass destruction hr 10 sec 2052 s 2845 similar provision present law condemns the use the threat to use and the attempt or conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction which it defines to include biological and atomic weapons as well as destructive devices bombs 18 usc 2332a when the crime is committed overseas by or against an american when the crime is committed within the us and the use affects or would affect interstate or foreign commerce or when the crime is committed against federal property in the us or elsewhere individual parallel proscriptions cover biological weapons 18 usc 175 chemical weapons 18 usc 229 nuclear materials 18 usc 831 and to somewhat lesser extent explosives 18 usc 842 844 thus section 175 outlaws the production acquisition or possession of biological materials for use as weapon or attempting threatening or conspiring to do so the prohibition applies within the us without the need for further jurisdictional justification and overseas if the offense is committed by or against an american by the same token section 229 outlaws production acquisition possession or use of chemical weapons or the attempt conspiracy or threat to do so there is federal jurisdiction over the offense if it is committed within the us or committed by or against an american overseas or committed against federal property located in this country or elsewhere and section 831 outlaws possession or use of nuclear material under circumstances likely to endanger person or property or to threaten attempt or conspire to do so federal jurisdiction exists if the offense is committed within the us the offender or victim is an american the offender is later found or brought to the us the offense involves threat directed against the federal government or us territory or the offense involves shipment in interstate or foreign commerce although somewhat less comprehensive particularly with regard to attempts and misconduct committed by americans overseas section 844 outlaws burning or bombing property used in or used in an activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce burning or bombing federal property using the mails or some other medium in interstate or foreign commerce to threaten to burn or bomb or conspiring to do so host of other federal laws prohibit violence regardless of the form it takes under variety of jurisdictional circumstances eg 18 usc 1114 crs7 killing federal officers employees or members of the armed forces 2332 acts of violence committed against americans overseas section 2052 enlarges the jurisdictional coverage of the generic weapons of mass destruction section 18 usc 2332a so that it more closely approximates the jurisdictional reach of the individual proscriptions covering nuclear material as well as biological and chemical weapons in addition to section 2332as commerce clause foundation section 2052 permits prosecution when violation of section 2332 involves the use of the mails or interstate or foreign commerce in furtherance of the offense or when the offender travels in interstate or foreign commerce or when the offense is committed against the property of foreign government within this country section 2052 makes 18 usc 2332a applicable to chemical weapons in addition to the other weapons of mass destruction already included in the section chemical weapons were dropped when the individual provisions of 18 usc 229 were enacted section 2052 also enlarges the classes of restricted individuals who may not possess biological toxins under 18 usc 175b to include members and agents of designated terrorist organizations and agents of nations that support terrorism finally section 2052 adds 18 usc 175178 biological weapons and materials 18 usc 229229f chemical weapons and 18 usc 831 nuclear materials to the rico predicate offense list and consequently to the money laundering predicate offense list rico the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organization provisions outlaws the acquisition or operation through the patterned commission of any of series of serious crimes predicate offenses of an enterprise whose activities affect interstate or foreign commerce 18 usc 1961 1962 the federal money laundering statutes outlaw financial transactions involving the proceeds of various serious crimes predicate offenses 18 usc 1956 1957 rico predicate offenses are by definition money laundering predicate offenses 18 usc 1956c7a the purpose of section 2052 here seems to be one of emphasis since each of the offenses it appears to add to the rico predicate offense list is already there by virtue of its standing as federal crime of terrorism under 18 usc 2332bg5b which rico includes in its predicate offense list by cross reference 18 usc 19611g participation in nuclear and weapons of mass destruction threats to the united states hr 10 sec 2053 s 2845 similar provision anyone who aids or abets the commission of federal crime is treated as principal 18 usc 2 that is is treated as if he committed the offense himself one aids or abets the crime of another for purposes of section 2 when one in some sort associates himself with the venture that he participates in it as in something that he wishes to bring about and that he seeks by his action to make it succeed central bank of denver v first interstate bank of denver 511 us 164 190 1994 crs8 quoting nye v nissen 336 us 613 619 1949 in much the same way anyone who conspires to commit federal crime is liable for the underlying offense pinkerton v united states 328 us 640 64647 1946 in addition to the separate crime of conspiracy 18 usc 371 section 57b of the atomic energy act of 1954 42 usc 2077b outlaws engaging in the production of special nuclear material outside the us moreover it is also federal crime to use or to threaten to use or to attempt or conspire to use weapon designed to release radiation or radioactivity at level dangerous to human life when the offense occurs within the us and affects or would affect interstate or foreign commerce when the offense is committed against an american outside the us or when the offense is committed against federal property regardless of where the property is located 18 usc 2332a it is likewise federal crime to possess or use nuclear material or nuclear byproduct material under circumstances likely to cause serious injury or substantial property damage or to attempt threaten or conspire to do so in the us or overseas when the victim or offender is an american when the offender is subsequently brought or otherwise found in the us or when the offense is directed against the us territory or the us government 18 usc 831 section 2053 amends section 57b of the atomic energy act 42 usc 2077b and creates new 18 usc 832 the amendment to the atomic energy act adds proscription against participation in the development of special nuclear material outside the us to the existing prohibition against production of special nuclear material outside the us presumably one who participated in the development of special nuclear material outside the us would at the same time be either aiding and abetting the production of special nuclear material or conspiring to produce special nuclear material in violation of 42 usc 2077b in its present form on the other hand the proposal takes conspiracy and aiding and abetting liability one step back for under its provisions conspiring to participate or aiding and abetting participant in the development of nuclear material becomes crime the new 18 usc 832 consists of two crimes one concerned with foreign weapons programs and the other with misconduct in this country involving radiological weapons proposed subsection 832a bars participation in or providing material support to the weapons of mass destruction program of designated foreign terrorist organization or of country designated sponsor of terrorism when the offense is committed either within the us or by one subject to us jurisdiction eg us company or citizen it also outlaws attempts or conspiracies to engage in such misconduct the subsection supplements existing proscriptions against providing material support to terrorist organizations generally 18 usc 2339b against producing biological or chemical weapons or possessing nuclear materials under dangerous circumstances attempting or conspiring to do so 18 usc 175 229 831 or aiding or abetting such production or possession 18 usc 2 or providing material support to such production or possession 18 usc 2339a proposed subsection 832c outlaws the development or possession of radiological weapon or attempt or conspiracy to do so it also outlaws the use or threatened use of such weapon against anyone within the us an american overseas of federal property regardless of its location radiological weapons are crs9 not defined either in proposed section 832 or in the existing united states code it is therefore difficult to determine to what extent if any it is intended to replicate the proscriptions of 18 usc 2332a relating to any weapon that is designed to release radiation or radioactivity at level dangerous to human life or those of 18 usc 831 relating to misconduct associated with nuclear material and nuclear byproduct material1 the new section 832 is designated federal crime of terrorism under 18 usc 2332bg5b and as consequence is added to the list of rico predicate offenses 18 usc 19611g money laundering predicate offenses 18 usc 1956c71 1957f3 aggravated identity theft predicate offenses 18 usc 1028a terrorist crimes involving risk of serious injury for which there is statute of limitations 18 usc 3286 terrorist crimes for which lifelong term of supervised released may be ordered 18 usc 3583 conduct in aid of counterfeiting hr 10 sec 2122 s 2845 similar provision it is federal crime to possess plates or analog digital or electronic images for purposes of counterfeiting us or foreign obligations or securities 18 usc 474 481 or to possess distinctive paper or counterfeit deterrents 18 usc 474a section 474 has explicit extraterritorial application 18 usc 470 in addition to enlarging section 470 to provide explicit extraterritorial application for section 474a distinctive paper and counterfeit deterrents section 2122 augments existing proscriptions with prohibition against possession with the intent to defraud of any material that can be used to make alter forge or counterfeit any obligation or security us or foreign proposed 18 usc 474 481 grand jury information sharing hr 10 sec 2191 s 2845 similar provision testimony and other matters occurring before federal grand jury are secret frcrimp 6e violations of grand jury secrecy are punishable as contempt of court frcrimp 6e7 traditionally such matters could be disclosed under narrow set of circumstances with the permission of the court and without the courts permission they could be disclosed to other federal prosecutors and to government personnel assisting the grand jury frcrimp 6e18 usc app 2000 ed the usa patriot act and later the homeland security act expanded the exception to 1 there is also clear indication of the relationship between this section and section 2405 of the bill that outlaws the production acquisition possession and use of radiological dispersal devices depending upon how the two are reconciled section 2405 may provide some clarification because it applies to weapons or devices designed or intended to endanger human life through the release of radiation or radioactivity see discussion infra crs10 permit disclosure to various federal officials without court approval of grand jury matter involving foreign intelligence counterintelligence or foreign intelligence information 115 stat 278 2001 116 stat 2256 2002 section 2191 expands the exception in number of ways first it enlarges the class of government personnel to whom grand jury material may be disclosed without court approval in order to assist in the grand jurys investigation the class already includes state local and tribal personnel frcrimp 6e3aii section 2191 adds the personnel of foreign governments second with subsequent notification of the court but without prior court approval it permits any attorney for the us government to disclose any grand jury matter involving threat of actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of foreign power or an agent of foreign power domestic or international sabotage domestic or international terrorism or clandestine intelligence gathering activities by an intelligence service or network of foreign power or an agent of foreign power to any state local indian tribal or foreign government official for the purpose of preventing or responding to the threat the rule already permits disclosure to the appropriate federal officials under such circumstances any official receiving such information may use it only for his or her official duties subject to any limitations on its unauthorized disclosure and may use it only in manner consistent with guidelines jointly issued by the attorney general and the national intelligence director third it allows disclosure to foreign courts or prosecutors to use in official criminal investigations at their request and with the courts approval in related change it amends the provision frcrimp 6e3eiii which now permits disclosure of evidence of violation of state or tribal law to the appropriate state or tribal authorities with court approval to allow disclosure of evidence of foreign law violations to the appropriate foreign officials again with court approval finally violations of the guidelines jointly issued by the attorney general and the director of central intelligence sic probably should read national intelligence director are punishable as contempt of court although the efficacy of such sanction in the case of violations by foreign officials may be open to question short title hr 10 sec 2201 s 2845 similar provision section 2201 designates subtitle iii as the badge security enhancement act of 2004 police badges hr 10 section 2202 s 2845 similar provision crs11 existing law prohibits unauthorized possession of police badge or counterfeit police badge that has been transported in interstate or foreign commerce 18 usc 716a the law however recognizes certain affirmative defenses including the fact that is used or intended for use exclusively for exhibit collection decorative theatrical or other recreational purposes section 2202 eliminates the affirmative defenses now available with respect to badges used for decorative or other recreational purposes short title hr 10 sec 2301 s 2845 similar provision section 2301 designates subtitle iij as the railroad carriers and mass transportation protection act of 2004 attacks against railroad carriers and mass transportation systems hr 10 sec 2302 s 2845 similar provision train wrecking is federal crime 18 usc 1992 the same statute outlaws destruction or the attempted destruction of railroad buildings tunnels trestles and the like the usa patriot act outlawed terrorist attacks on mass transit 18 usc 1993 more precisely it is federal crime to place biological weapons or destructive devices on mass transit with the intent to endanger or to engage in such conduct proximate to mass transit facilities or to impair the function of operational components of mass transit systems or to interfere with mass transit personnel recklessly or with the intent to endanger or to commit an act of violence against mass transit employee or passenger or to attempt conspire or threaten to do so section 1992 applies to trains or railroad systems operated in interstate or foreign commerce and section 1993 applies where the mass transit provider of the system attacked is engaged in or affects interstate or foreign commerce or if the offender traveled in interstate or foreign commerce in furtherance of the offense the two have roughly comparable penalty structures imprisonment for not more than 20 years for most offenses section 1992 however punishes offenses resulting in death by imprisonment for life or death and punishes attacks on trains carrying high level radioactive waste by imprisonment for life or for any term of years subject to 30 year mandatory minimum section 1993 on the other hand punishes attacks that result in death or attacks on vehicle or ferry while it is carrying at least one passenger by imprisonment for any term of years or for life section 2112 merges the two sections into single new 18 usc 1992 conduct outlawed under the two remains unlawful in addition the broader and slightly expanded jurisdictional base of existing section 1993 applies throughout the crs12 new section ie train wrecking is covered if the carrier engages in or affects interstate or foreign commerce or if the offender travels communicates or transports facilitating material in such commerce in furtherance of the offense in like manner the new section preserves and slightly expands the sanctions imposed for violations the basic 20 year term remains but offenses resulting in death are punishable by death or imprisonment for life recall that 18 usc 1993 is not capital offense under existing law moreover under the new section the 30 year to life sentence that applies when nuclear waste is involved applies whether rail carrier or some other form of transit is victimized existing law applies the penalty only in the case of rail transit the new section punishes violations with imprisonment of any term of years or for life when an employee or passenger is on board at the time of the attack or when certain hazardous material is being carried under existing law there is penalty increase simply because passenger is on board at the time of train wreck absent death and neither section 1992 nor 1993 increases the penalty for the presence of an employee or hazardous cargo other than nuclear waste short title hr 10 sec 2401 s 2845 similar provision section 2401 designates subtitle iik as the prevention of terrorist access to destructive weapons act of 2004 findings and purpose hr 10 sec 2402 s 2845 similar provision under subsection 2402a congress finds that manpads manportable air defense systemsantiaircraft missiles here pose serious threat to civil aviation world wide that atomic weapons and dirty bombs in the hands of terrorists could inflict enormous damage that variola virus smallpox is extraordinarily dangerous and consequently may be appealing as terrorist weapon that as result the us has national security interest in preventing the unlawful production acquisition possession export and import of such materials and that there is legitimate reason for private production possession or traffic the stated purpose for the subtitle is to combat the potential use of weapons that have the ability to cause widespread harm to united states persons and the united states economy and that have legitimate private use and to threaten or harm the national security or foreign relations of the united states section 2332 sa the practical effect of the subtitle is to increase the penalties and to lesser extent the coverage of misconduct associated with this type of material crs13 missile systems designed to destroy aircraft hr 10 sec 2403 s 2845 similar provision any number of federal laws condemn the use of antiaircraft missiles against civil aircraft or military aircraft particularly within the united states for instance it is federal crime to destroy any aircraft in us special aircraft jurisdiction2 or any civil aircraft used operated or employed in interstate overseas or foreign air commerce or to attempt conspire or threaten to do so 18 usc 32 and it is federal crime to use weapon of mass destruction defined with sufficient breadth to cover antiaircraft missiles 18 usc 921 within the us in manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or when either the victim or the offender is an american regardless of where the crime is committed or to attempt conspire or threaten to do so 18 usc 2332a moreover it is federal crime to burn or bomb including by antiaircraft missile federal property 18 usc 844f or property used in or used in an activity that affects interstate or foreign commerce 18 usc 844i finally anyone who aids or abets the commission of any such federal crimes ie contributes to the success of the enterprise with the intent that it succeed is subject to the same penalties as those who commit the crimes 18 usc 2 aside from the prohibitions for use and attempts or conspiracies to use coverage of production possession export import exists if it is covered by somewhat fewer overlapping statutes applies less extensively outside the us and is somewhat less severely punished within the us it is federal crime to manufacture possess export or import any unregistered destructive device eg an antiaircraft missile 26 usc 5861 or to import or export items on the munitions list eg antiaircraft missiles without the required licenses 22 usc 2778 section 2403 creates new federal offense 18 usc 2332g under which it is federal crime to produce construct acquire transfer receive possess export use or possess and threaten to use guided antiaircraft missiles or their components under various jurisdictional circumstances the offense is within federal jurisdiction when it occurs in or affects interstate or foreign commerce when the victim or offender is an american overseas when the offense is committed against federal property regardless of where it is located or when the misconduct involves aiding or abetting 2 49 usc 465012special aircraft jurisdiction of the united states includes any of the following aircraft in flight civil aircraft of the united states b an aircraft of the armed forces of the

principal place of business whose permanent residence is in the united states crs14 the commission of violation over which jurisdiction exists3 offenders are subject to imprisonment for life if the crime involves use or an attempt conspiracy or threat to use an antiaircraft missile other violations are subject to imprisonment for not less than 30 years or for life offenders are subject to death penalty or imprisonment for life if death results in any event the offender is subject to fine of not more than 2 million4 existing law punishes use less severely and is considerably more lenient on lesser crimes section 32 and 2332a of title 18 carry the death penalty when death results from use and imprisonment for not more than 20 years 18 usc 32 and imprisonment for any term years or life 18 usc 2332 in other cases but neither features mandatory minimum of 30 years or any other mandatory minimum term although the overseas reach of existing law is comparable to or exceeds that of the proposed new section for use offenses the scope of the existing manufacture possession export and import proscriptions 26 usc 5861 22 usc 2778 are pretty much limited to activities within the us or efforts to import into the us and their 10year maximum sentences are more lenient atomic weapons hr 10 sec 2404 s 2845 similar provision the atomic energy act outlaws the transfer or receipt of atomic weapons in interstate or foreign commerce as well as their production or possession 42 usc 2122 possession use or transfer of nuclear material or any attempt or conspiracy to do so is also federal crime when committed in the us or when the offender or victim is an american or the offender is later brought to or found in the us regardless of where the offense was committed 18 usc 831 use of atomic weapons in manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce against federal property or when the offender or the victim is an american is violation of 18 usc 2332a weapons of mass destruction as is any attempt or conspiracy to do so 3 as general rule one may only be liable as principal under 18 usc 2 for aiding or abetting crime over which federal jurisdiction exists listing the fact as jurisdictional element simply states fact that is generally assumed it does not expand the jurisdictional reach of the statute cf united states v yousef 327 f3d 56 85111 2d cir 2003discussing the extraterritorial application 18 usc 32 in the context of indictment count that charged violations of 18 usc 32 and 18 usc 2 ie assuming the question of the extraterritorial application section 2 turned upon whether section 32 applied extraterritorially united states v felixgutierrez 940 f2d 1200 1205 9th cir 1991we have inferred extraterritorial application of conspiracy statutes on the basis of finding that the underlying substantive statutes reach extraterritorial offenses we see reason why different rule should apply in accessory after the fact cases 4 although the 2 million maximum fine seems an increases over the 250000500000 maximums that apply to felonies under existing law existing law permits imposition of an alternative fine of twice the profit or loss associated with the offense if that amount is higher than the standard maximum 18 usc 3571 consequently existing law provides for higher maximum in any case where the profit or loss exceeds 1 million crs15 section 2404 amends the atomic energy act in 42 usc 2122 and 2272 to expand and clarify its jurisdictional reach and increase the penalties that attend violation as presently phrased it is unclear whether section 2122 bars production or possession in the us under all circumstances or only when there is some nexus to interstate or foreign commerce the amendment provides for federal jurisdiction under the same circumstances as it is used in connection with its antiaircraft missile proscriptions the offense occurs in or affects interstate or foreign commerce the offense is committed overseas by or against an american the offense is committed against federal property regardless of where it is located or the offense involves aiding or abetting the commission of violation of the section by another violations of 2122 are punishable under existing law by fine of not more than 250000 not more than 500000 for legal entities andor by imprisonment for not more than 10 years or by imprisonment for any term of years or for life when the offense is committed to injure the us or aid foreign nation 42 usc 2272 as in the case of antiaircraft missiles the amendment increases the penalties so that offenders are subject to fine of not more than 2 million and to imprisonment for life in the case of use of an atomic weapon or attempting or conspiring to use or possessing and threatening to use such weapon in cases where death results the fine remains the same but the offender must be sentenced either to death or to life imprisonment in the case of other crimes under the section production simple possession importing or exporting the penalties are fine of not more than 2 million and imprisonment for not less than 30 years or for life radiological dispersal devices hr 10 sec 2505 s 2845 similar provision existing federal law bans the use threat to use attempt to use and conspiracy to use any weapon designed to release radiation or radioactivity at level dangerous to human life when the offense affects or would affect interstate or foreign commerce when it is committed by or against an american overseas or when it is committed against federal property regardless of where the property is located 18 usc 2332a weapons of mass destruction it is likewise federal crime to possess or use nuclear material or nuclear byproduct material under circumstances likely to cause human injury property damage or environmental degradation or to attempt conspire or threaten to do so in various jurisdictional settings 18 usc 831 federal jurisdiction exists if the offense is committed within the us or is committed by or against an american overseas or the offender is later brought to or found in the us or the offense constitutes threat against the us government or us territory section 2405 creates new 18 usc 2332h that outlaws production construction acquisition transfer receipt possession importing or exporting weapons devices or other objects designed or intended to release radiation or radioactivity dangerous to human life it supplies the standard array of jurisdictional predicates the offense occurs in or affects interstate or foreign commerce the offense is committed by or against an american overseas the offense is committed against federal property wherever located or the offense involves aiding or abetting crs16 violation of the section over which jurisdiction exists and it carries the usual array of penalties capital punishment or imprisonment for life if death results imprisonment for life if the offense otherwise involves the use attempt to use conspiracy to use or possession and threat to use the proscribed devices imprisonment for not less than 30 years or for life in all other instances and fine of not more than 2 million in all cases the section differs from existing law in several ways first its penalties are more severe existing law has mandatory minimums under either 18 usc 2332a or 18 usc 831 and even where death results violations of section 831 are not punishable by death second it more clearly covers production of and trafficking in proscribed devices up until the time to they contain radiological material than does section 831 third its jurisdictional reach is comparable to that of 18 usc 2332a but somewhat shorter than that of 18 usc 831 which extends to all violations within the us without any required commerce nexus or elsewhere since prosecution may occur anytime the offender can be brought to or found in the us variola virus hr 10 sec 2406 s 2845 similar provision it is federal crime to use attempt to use conspire to use or threaten to use weapon involving biological agent toxin or vector in manner that affects or would affect interstate or foreign commerce in this country or by or

2406 creates new federal crime 18 usc 175c that outlaws production acquisition transfer possession importing exporting or possessing and threatening to use variola virus smallpox it uses the same jurisdictional array commerce american victim or offender federal property and the same penalty structure mandatory minimum of 30 years generally mandatory life imprisonment for use and use related crimes possible capital punishment if death results as the other crimes under the subtitle the jurisdictional scope of the new section is comparable to that of 18 usc 2332a use of weapons of mass destruction less comprehensive domestically than 18 usc 175 that requires neither commerce nor federal property nexus but more comprehensive extraterritorially than section 175 that applies where an american is the victim or offender but not without more where federal property is the victim of the offense as in other instances the penalty structure of existing law is more lenient than that of the new section neither 18 usc 2332a nor 175 carry mandatory minimums and even where the offense results in death violations of 175 are not punishable by death interception of communications hr 10 sec

resulting in the death of victim are punishable by death eg 18 usc 1114 murder of federal officer employee or member of the armed forces and others are not eg 18 usc 43 animal enterprise terrorism where death results it is not clear that capital punishment may be imposed for any crime that does not involve the taking of life6 where killing is involved the constitution may bar imposition of capital punishment upon coconspirator or accomplice who does not himself kill attempt to kill or intend that killing take place or that lethal force will be employed7 while it is crime to conspire to commit any federal crime 18 usc 371 there is general federal attempt statute in number of instances however the statute establishing particular crime will make commission of the offense and attempts or conspiracies to commit it all subject to the same penalties eg 18 usc 175 biological weapons offenses 6 enmund v florida 458 us 782 797 1982 coker v georgia 433 us 584 594 1977 7 enmund v florida

section 2502 establishes new 18 usc 2339e under which the commission of terrorist offense that results in death is punishable by death or imprisonment for any term of years or for life somewhat repetitiously the section defines the terrorist offenses to which it applies as 1 federal crime of terrorism as defined in 18 usc 2332bg other than 18 usc 1363 destruction of property within us special maritime or territorial jurisdiction 2 any violation of 18 usc ch113b most of the chapter 113b crimes are federal crimes of terrorism or of 18 usc 175 biological weapons 175b biological

weapon 46505 carrying weapon or explosives aboard an aircraft 60123 sabotage of interstate gas pipelines section 2502 also creates new 18 usc 2339f under which persons convicted of terrorist offense are thereafter denied federal benefits the new section tracks similar disqualification that attends conviction for certain drug offenses 21 usc 862a except that the new disqualification is contingent upon motion by the government finally section 2502 adds to the list of aggravating factors to be considered under federal death penalty procedures the fact that particular murder occurred during the commission of one of the terrorist offenses which section 2222 defined in its new 18 usc 2339e terrorist offenses result in death death penalty in certain air piracy cases occurring before enactment of the federal death penalty act of 1994 hr 10 sec 2503 s 2845 similar provision in the late 1960s and early 1970s the supreme court held unconstitutional various elements in the procedures that governed imposition of capital punishment 8 but see 18 usc 1111murder within us special maritime and territorial jurisdiction crs21 under most state and federal capital punishment schemes9 in 1974 congress sought to address these defects with procedural adjustments in the capital punishment statute covering air piracy10 in 1994 when congress made the procedural adjustments necessary to revive federal capital punishment statutes generally it replaced the air piracy procedures with those of the new regime11 at least one court however held that the new procedures could not be applied retroactively to cases occurring after the 1974 fix but before the 1994 legislation12 the courts decision was predicated at least in part on the fact that congress in 1994 had failed to indicate whether it intended the new procedures to apply retroactively13 section 2223 makes that intent specific short title hr 10 sec 2601 s 2845 similar provision section 2601 designates subtitle iim as the pretrial detention and lifetime supervision of terrorists act of 2004 presumption for pretrial detention in cases involving terrorism hr 10 sec 2602 s 2845 similar provision existing law recognizes rebuttable presumption in favor of the denial of bail pending trial when there is probable cause to believe the accused has committed serious drug trafficking offense or conspiracy to commit crime of
