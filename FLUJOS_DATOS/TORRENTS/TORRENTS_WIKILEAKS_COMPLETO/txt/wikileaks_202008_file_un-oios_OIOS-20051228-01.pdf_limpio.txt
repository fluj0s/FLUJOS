other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations programme management 10 oios assessed that project financial monit oring was not adequately performed the spmrs submitted by the partners on quarterly basis were signed by the programme officer and programme assistant and were recorded in the ipr mo dule however there was evidence that the financial monitoring went beyond desk re view and subsequent entering of spmr data into fmis the representation did not perform spot checks of partners accounting records to link the performance of the partners with the finan cial reports oios recommended that financial monitoring visits be carried out at least twice ear and documentary evidence of the review and any followup be maintained the representation indicated that first visit was made during the last quarter of 2005 to caritas venezuela and wr itten correspondence has been shared with the partner which has replied to each of the specif ic issues raised similar strategy would follow in the field in the first quarter of 2006 in futu re financial monitoring visits would be carried out every quarter 11 in order to facilitate the financial monit oring and reporting all unhcr partners in venezuela used the same accounting software which had been purchased by unhcr since then the spmrs are submitted electronically the b ackup data was restored by unhcr and transferred to fmis improvements are required to better meet the expectations of the partners given that this system was developed for commercial activities its included functions not relevant for the unhcr partners while it lacked cer tain key functions relevant for unhcr some partners used excel spreadsheets used to compe nsate the weaknesses of the software for instance to facilitate the bank reconciliation or t prepare list of beneficiaries transactions have to be reentered individually in excel which is time consuming and increases the risk of error oios recommended that the representation obt ain the partners comments on the difficulties in operating the system and improvemen ts suggested and discuss with the software 3 provider the possibility of modifying the software accordingly the representation indicated that the software provider carried out field visits to m onitor the situation action would be taken that the bank reconciliation and lists of beneficiaries be prepared directly from the software direct implementation 12 the controls over the expenditures for dir ect implementation were found weak there was lack of segregation of duties since the same person selected the service suppliers awarded the contracts and confirmed prices and performance the transactions for project expenditure were often initiated by person to whom the author ity to engage unhcr funds had not been delegated it was observed for pi expenditure made in caracas and also in the fos where the certifying function was often performed by unvs d ue to the lack of regular staff in the fos unv regularly replaced one of the heads of fos oi recommended that the representation revise its financial procedures to ensure adequate segregation of duties in particular for programme and pi expenditure and strengthen its in ternal controls by submitting the selection of the suppliers to the approval of the lcc oios also recommended that the representation ensure that authorized officers perform financial c ontrols and in the absence of the head of office the representation establish appropriate pr ocedures to ensure that financial controls be administered remotely 13 the representation indicated that the selection of the suppliers is being duly submitted for lcc approval as of august 2005 authorized offi cers perform financial controls and the representation has established procedures to ensure financial controls and proper follow up by the admin and programme units in the absence of t he head of office in addition to the mechanisms put in place to ensure financial control s administered remotely possible temporary responsibility from unvs will be well documented g iven that as of 9 december 2005 all field offices are staffed by unhcr personnel this would be exceptional finampyme 14 in february 2005 the representation signe d an agreement with finampyme micro credit institution the selection procedures follow ed by unhcr are not clear there was documentation to substantiate the selection process made in view of the responsibility of finampyme in managing significant unhcr funds and u nhcr beneficiaries information oios recommended that the representation review and document all steps of the selection process and confirm or not the selection made the representation initially indicated that finampyme was selected from five other microcredit institutions by using criteria referred to in the unhcr manual and that documentation was avai lable to substantiate the selection made however the documentation submitted later note for the file issued by unv working in san cristobal and an extract of consultants report indicated that finampyme was selected without comparison of submissions made since it w as the sole microcredit institution having submitted complete file it also confirms that unhcr staff member was involved in the selection process given the importance of the rol of microcredit institution for resettlement project it would have been appropriat to have unhcr staff members involved in the selection cash management procedures 15 the cash management practices varied consi derably from one partner to another and 4 some were not compatible with appropriate internal controls cheques were issued by jrs with the mention endosable since in this province the unhcr beneficiaries do not have problems cashing cheque at the bank cheques issu ed by caritas venezuela were endosable which allow person other than the legitimate bene ficiary to cash them though such practice corresponds to cash payments the controls were not modified accordingly due to the difficulties for the refugeesasylum seekers in cashing cheque all the cheques for payment of assistance made by caritas tachira were issued in the name of caritas employee instead of beneficiary whereas the accounting records indicated the refuge easylum seeker as beneficiary of the cheque oios recommended that the payee name on cheque ways be the same as that on the payment voucher and entry in the cashbook and the hand over of cash be duly documented and attached to the payment voucher the representation indicated having discussed this issue with caritas tachira additionally it is expected that the lis t of beneficiaries which will come out directly from the accounting software will indicate who exac tly was benefited from the assistance b review of implementing partners 16 for the three partners reviewed reasonabl assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accord ance with the subagreements oios assessed that internal controls of all partners wer generally in place and operating effectively except for caritas venezuela for which significant improvements were required 17 the representation complied with the unhcr audit ce rtification policy for 2003 and 2004 the audit reports expressing an unqualified opinion were available for all partners with budget in excess of us 100000 management letter s which pointed out the weaknesses in the accounting and internal control systems were issued to all the partners for 2003 and 2004 as followup measure the representation attached to t he transmission letter addressed to the partners summary of the recommendations made and requested the partners to indicate the action taken to implement them servicio jesuita refugiados jrs 18 the controls in place in jrs on procureme nt of goods and services were found weak in several cases three quotations were not compared representative of unhcr did attend the contracts committee meeting dealing with transactio ns exceeding bs 800000 us 1750 as established between unhcr and jrs oios recommended that jrs take the measures to adhere to the rules and that the decision to grant contract without comparing three offers should be documented and unhcr informed accordingly the representation indicated that the procurement issue has been discussed with jrs it was agreed th at given the lack of suppliers in guasdualito and nula the local contracts committee will deal wi th transactions exceeding bs 800000 us 1750 including cumulative procurement made of min or transactions adding up to that amount for transactions below this threshold decision to grant contract without comparing three offers would be documented and unhcr informed accordingly 19 though jrs implements projects other than unhcrs oios could not establish whether the method of allocation of expenditures co mmon to all projects jrs was reasonable and transparent with an increasing number of donor s working at the border this issue needs to be taken into consideration at both the planning an d reporting phase oios recommended that the jrs submit to unhcr for approval the apportionm ent of common expenditures and include this issue in their financial and narrative reporti ng the representation stated that jrs as well 5 as other partners describe contributions of other d onors in their final narrative report likewise during the submission the partners will provide breakdown of the contributions expected from other donors monitoring controls would address th is issue in systematic manner in 2006 b caritas venezuela 20 financial controls in place were found wea k the payment voucher used did not evidence the controls made there was segregatio n of duties between the authorizing and approving functions there was evidence of recep tion of goods and services nor that the payment voucher prepared by the accountant and pporting documents for payment were reviewed when signing the cheques 21 weaknesses were also observed for payment of assistance which from 2003 to 2004 increased by 90 per cent the lists of the assistan ce payments were not signed there was evidence that the amount of assistance established had been verified the justification of the payment did not provide evidence that the beneficia ry was refugee or an asylum seeker nor indicate the number of dependants the beneficiary cards had not been filled since 2002 oios recommended that the representation request caritas venezuela to strengthen its financial controls on assistance payments 22 review of the outstanding cheques was t performed regularly as of december 2004 total of 25 cheques for payment of assistan ce amounting to bs 5593167 us 2600 were outstanding since january 2004 given the amo unt concerned oios recommended revision of the spmr more attention should be giv to this issue in the future this situation might be the result of poor needs assessment outst anding cheques should be reviewed monthly and beneficiaries should be contacted when cheques for assistance remain outstanding for more than month 23 the representation indicated that the amount of bs 5593167 corresponding to the 25 cheques for payment of assistance outstanding since january 2004 was recovered through the 3rd instalment under the subproject 05abwlals401 d the representation further stated that the need to establish segregation of duties be tween the authorizing and approving functions was stressed during the financial monitoring visit in october 2005 in addition to the importance of documenting the reception of goods and services and the review by the approving officer of the payment voucher and the supporting documents fo r payment when signing the cheques the representation will meet with caritas venezuela in early 2006 with the aim of instructing them on the need to i document the procedure as t how assistance payments are made the justification based on the socioeconomic evaluatio n the category of the beneficiary and the number of dependants ii fill out the beneficiary cards these instructions will also be made in writing following the meeting with the partner c caritas tachira 24 supporting documents for payment of assist ance consisted mainly of receipts signed by the beneficiaries there was evidence that the r equest had been made by social worker and duly revised by hisher supervisor given the dista nce between the caritas office and the areas where the beneficiaries are living the identificat ion of persons in need of assistance was made by social workers working in the field in remote locat ions because they informed caritas tachira only verbally on the name of the ics and the estima needed for the payments oios 6 recommended that the supporting documentation of th payment of assistance include note for the file indicating the basis on which the payment was made the representation will meet with caritas tachira to agree on procedure which woul d address this issue and will ask field office san cristobal to follow up c supply management asset management 25 the current review included followup of the previous oios recommendations we were pleased to note that assettrak inventory has b een updated in may and june 2005 physical inventory was performed in caracas for t he fos the assistance of all custodians has been requested to update the data use of official vehicles 26 logbooks and summary of monthly expenditur were maintained but not properly filled there was only one entry per day in the logbook ins tead of one per trip the purpose of the trip was often imprecise the number of kilometres was f ound excessive etc oios recommended regular verification of the logbooks by the adminis tration and new logbook form showing the kilometres at the departure and arrival and the ac tual number of kilometres made the representation introduced new logbook form with i mmediate effect to log each trip the new form is used since mid july 2005 and verification xercises are carried out procurement 27 as improvement since the previous oios aud it mission an lcc had been established and is dealing with major procurement cases howev er to strengthen the controls mainly relating to direct implementation activities oios recommended that in the future when selecting the suppliers the representation also ta ke into consideration all contracts made with single vendor within the previous period of 12 mont hs the procedures made to identify the most suitable supplier need to be documented and bmitted to the lcc for review the representation is preparing list of expected serv ices which will require several contracts throughout 2006 all contracts with single vendo r will be reviewed on regular basis to ensure that the amount of us20000 has not been ex ceeded once approaching the amount of us20000 the case will be submitted to the lcc fo r review value added tax vat 28 following recommendation made by oios in 2002 the representation approached the government to obtain reimbursement of vat paid af ter negotiations unhcr was allowed to submit retroactive claim starting june 1999 all vat paid directly by unhcr is now admissible for reimbursement two vat reimbursement s amounting to bs 145 million us 68000 were received in 2004 oios is pleased to note tha t the implementation of recommendation made in 2002 has eventually generate d recovery of us 68000 d security and safety 29 several measures have been taken during th last two years to improve the security of the 7 premises in caracas and in the field the securi ty officer inspected the new office premises before signing the rental contract the managers an d staff are aware of the difficult environment of unhcr operations in venezuela security trainin g has been provided to the staff all of them have passed the basic security in the fiel d staff safety health and welfare online exercise unhcr in venezuela is moss complia nt additional security equipment was purchased at the end of 2004 generators security vehicle equipment etc however due to budgetary constraints the blast protective film fo r glass has not yet been purchased for caracas which is building with large windows an indepth security assessment was carried out in july 2005 in caracas and in the three field locations to address the security issues the representation stated that blast protective film is difficult to p urchase in caracas and thus expensive since funds under the 2005 and 2006 abod are not availabl to cover this expense request for additional funds throughout the ess budget has been made however due to possible move to other premises in the future significant investm ent in blast protective glass may not prove to be efficient in view of the limited security threat s administration 30 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr offices in venezuela generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review financial management 31 an informal form of purchase order was onl used for the major procurement of goods but not for services as consequence the financ ial controls related to the decision to procure some goods and services were not properly documente d 32 the supporting documents for programme exp enditures attached to the payment vouchers were often found insufficient in most of the case s the documentation existed but was not attached to the payment voucher as consequence the approving function could not be adequately performed the representation indicated that the approving off icer reviews all supporting documentation when the supporting docu mentation is voluminous the records are filed with the programme financial records though many supporting documents for payments were actually found in the programme unit there wa s evidence that the approving officer had reviewed them the representation confirmed that all supporting do cuments are now being attached to the payment vouchers controls on administrative expenditures 33 since 2003 significant efforts have been made to reduce administrative expenditures such as rental of premises travel and communicatio n which decreased by 50 30 and 25 per cent respectively the reduction of the charges for ren tal of premises is partially due to the negotiation of new contract but also to economica l factors in venezuela though the monthly charges for premises reduced from us 8600 to us 3900 oios believes that more could be done some agencies in venezuela obtained free p remises from the government we were not provided with evidence that the representation made such request as recommended earlier by oios the new representation is currently making formal c ontactsintroductions with the government of venezuela in the near future the r epresentation will make request to the government for office premises 8 human resources management 34 despite the opening of two new fos the au thorized staffing did not vary considerably since january 2003 the authorized number of staff for venezuela as of 1 may 2003 had been 8 international including two jpo 1 and 14 gs as of may 2005 total of 10 international including two jpo 1 and 12 gs were approved f or caracas and for the three fos san cristobal guasdualito and machiques at the time of the audit several of the authorized posts were still vacant including one jpo post which d been vacant since 2003 the representation indicated that since the audit took place all vac ant posts have been filled or are in the final process of being filled 35 in order to compensate for the lack of reg ular staffing 10 unvs 3 international and 7 national were contracted nine of them were assig ned to the field offices in addition three persons recruited under the irc protection surge ag reement were working in caracas san cristobal and machiques however given that they are not unhcr regular staff most of the financial functions cannot be delegated to them wh ich has an impact on the establishment and functioning of the internal control system there representation indicated that the financial control has been centralized in caracas for the maj ority of transactions 36 the staffing approved for drivers is two f or caracas and one for each fo given the region to be covered and the security requirement only one driver for each fo turned out not to be sufficient to compensate for the lack of driver s the regional and the fos have an agreement with local taxis that use their own vehicles to pro vide services considering the security situation at the border with the frequent checkpoints oios b elieves that using unhcr vehicles would be more secure the representation indicated that request for mo re drivers would be introduced in the cop for 2007 the indepth security review considers that local taxis whose driver and vehicle have been cleared may provide temporary solution for missions in populatedclose areas and for missions to border in colombia where there was coverage by unhcr insurance company unhcr vehicles and drivers are necessary for isolateddistant missions vari 37 the staff working at the border are author ized vari every three month while the unhcr staff assigned to colombia in fos established on th other side of the same border are authorized vari every two months oios questioned this inconsi stent treatment of staff the representation indicated that the issue had been brought to the at tention of dhrm but that reply had been received to date recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management sh ould review the current vari arrangements for unhcr staf f working in the colombia and venezuela border areas to ensur consistent and fair treatment rec 01 medical insurance plan mip 38 oios review of the mip claims indicated t hat some improvements are needed oios recommended that more thorough analysis of data s

oios could not followup on the previous r ecommendations issued on panama since the unhcr representative in panama longer reported t the regional representative in venezuela since september 2003 the representative in panama reports directly to the director of the bureau the memorandum addressed to the ahc mentioned that the bureau would make formal arrangements in order that the representatio n in venezuela would continue to provide support to panama given its availability of resourc however oios found that the sole support provided by unhcr venezuela consisted in recording in fmis the transactions done in panama as consequence monitoring by the region representation in venezuela has ceased although the staffing at the representation in pana ma only two international staff does not ensure minimum segregation of duties recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for the americas should establish adequate monitoring arrangements for the representation in p anama rec 02 v
