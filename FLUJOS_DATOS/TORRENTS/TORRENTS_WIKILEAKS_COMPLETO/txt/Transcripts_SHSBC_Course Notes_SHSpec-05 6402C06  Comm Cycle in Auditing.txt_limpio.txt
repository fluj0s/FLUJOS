6402c06 shspec5 comm cycle in auditing the magic of communication is all that makes auditing work if you sat down at onehand electrode emeter you would be amazed at this fact you would get tone arm motion beyond perhaps brief residual flurry at the very start with another auditor you would get 175 ta divisions with yourself you would get two it works this way because the thetan in this universe has begun to consider himself mass so he is subject to the laws of physics consequently he cant asis much mass he has to have second terminal to discharge the mass or energy against if an auditor thinks he is mest he is apt to get the condition of the pc because he mocks up or envisions the pcs charge in himself making himself matched terminal but that is not what makes auditing work it is all consideration backflow actually hits the auditor the ability to hold position in space or to hold two terminals apart is definition of power in the auditing situation there is an apparent exchange of energy from the pcs point of view which doesnt hit the auditor but because thetans think of themselves as terminals you get an exchange of energy going on nothing hits the auditor and it asises as far as the pc is concerned but you have set up twopole system and that will bring about an asising of mass it isnt burning the mass it is asising the mass that is why there is nothing hitting the auditor the magic of auditing is contained in the comm cycle of auditing you are concerned with the smooth interchange between these two poles which is necessary for as long as the pc considers himself to be matter and therefore considers that he must discharge against something eventually the pc will get up to point where he longer considers himself matter when lot half of the bank is gone the meter will longer read on sneeze when pc cognites that he is not mest the auditor cant knock any energy off and the meter goes dead running r6 the meter only reacts when the pc decides what something is you have to ask the pc if that is it when the pc looks and decides if that is it or not only then does the meter read the pc is advancing away from the automatic physical energy manifestations of the physical universe you get to point where you have intention gpm is just method of limiting the persons ability to intend that is the whole idea behind implanting to foul up intention by fixing it so that every time thetan intends positive he gets negative and vice versa so he cant decide if you talk to person and every time he says yes you say he will get to an indecisional state of mind where he can longer intend yes fully this wears him down it breaks his spirit this is the whole idea behind implanting to get being unable to effectively intend or determine anything successfully he intends to write but something is intending that he not write therefore he cant write all ideas of power of choice selfdeterminism etc stem from the ability to intend something the more enmested someone is the more trouble they have with intention with the twopole arrangement person can be influenced without his knowledge the difficulties of auditing are just the difficulties of the comm cycle you can hit the parts of the comm cycle as buttons the auditor must permit smooth flow between himself and the pc if matter is to be asised by the pc using the comm cycle when you dont permit smooth flow between yourself and the pc as terminals you get noasising of matter part of the trick is knowing what has to be asised but that is matter of technique if the auditor is capable of getting the pc to be willing to talk to him he wouldnt have to hit particular button in order to get ta action basic auditing and the comm cycle is senior to the technique the fundamental entrance to the case is not in tech but in the comm cycle in case supervision you can look at the points of the comm cycle that are missing in the pcs case and heal those points up there can be the comm cycle between the pc and the auditor and between the pc and the auditing room you can address the pcs comm between himself and the environment by looking at what he is worried about with an unconscious person pick up his hand and have him touch the pillow your arm etc giving the command at the same time you are just getting him in comm with the auditor and his surroundings but now you are into technique communication is simply familiarization process based on reach and withdraw when the auditor speaks to the pc he is reaching when he ceases to speak he is withdrawing when the pc hears you he is bit withdrawn he reaches towards you with the answer he is in withdraw as he looks for the answer he reaches the answer and reaches the auditor it is communication exchange that asises energy and registers on the emeter meter action occurs in the absence of that exchange namely the comm cycle if the comm cycle isnt in the pc selfaudits and you get case gain and ta that is the fundamental discovery of dianetics and scientology it is so simple that everyone has overlooked it because mest is very complex stuff being composed of atoms molecules wavelengths etc it is so complex that nobody can understand it people who are ploughed into matter who think as matter think very complexly they cannot observe the simplest things with which they are confronted they observe none of this the ease with which you can handle comm cycle depends on your ability to observe what the pc is doing your inspection of what you are doing should have ended with your training now all observation should focus on the pc the comm cycle you watch is the pcs the true touch of genius that makes an auditor that can crack any case is the auditors ability to observe the comm cycle of the pc and repair its various lacks this consists of asking question that the pc can answer observing that the pc has completed the answer to it acknowledging the pc and then giving the pc something else to do that is the auditing comm cycle see also p 450 above for an illustration this includes clearing the auditing command so that the pc can answer the question ask the question in such way that the pc can hear it and know whether the pc is answering that question you can tell when the pc is finishedit is piece of knowingness an instinct you should know without having to ask the pc if he is finished then knowing that he is finished you use the acknowledgment to tell him that he has said it using only the right amount of stop to stop that cycle not the whole session then you give him something else to answer when you dont see when he is finished and therefore fail to acknowledge he thinks he is not done and looks for more he even takes up humming if you dont give him something else to answer he will go on automatic he will selfaudit with ta action the degree of lack of ta action measures the degree of selfaudit that the pc is indulging in get your comm cycle good enough so that you dont have to pay attention to it and give your attention to the comm cycles of the pc spend your basic auditing doing nothing but repairing the basic communication inabilities of the pc and you will be genius you will crack 99 of the cases that walk in for instance the case that goes on and on with his comm you may think that you are acknowledging him but he never gets it it is up to you to get that communication acknowledged so he knows that it is heard or take the pc who takes twenty minutes to answer the auditing question and then in that answering doesnt answer it the very smart auditor knows that he would have to do three processes because 1 the pc cannot have an auditing question he didnt answer it so he never got it this gives you the first process what auditing question wouldnt you mind beingshould you be asked 2 since he cant have auditing he is wasting it so after you have comm line going you can run wasting auditing run it as concept since you cant expect such case to recall anything you could use get the idea of you wasting auditingor what could you do here that would waste auditing or what could an auditor do here that would waste auditing and maybe get him to waste communication elementary havingness is the ability to do 3 run who would i have to be to audit you 4 after that perhaps you could work on his memory you would see the whole case change take pc who is sitting there not saying anything find what the pc is doing and dream up something accordingly eg what could you say to you get long comm lag then he says something build it up until youve got him in communication with you then inspect the rest of his comm cycle for other wrongnesses maybe now you have to find out whether he can have an auditor it is what the pc isnt doing that the auditor might be able to get him to do that determines the auditing question if you are alert you will see these little disabilities showing up for instance someone stammers obviously he is having trouble communicating dont ask the pc to do things the pc cant do for instance the auditor asks from where could you view catfish the pc says uh im sorry ive never viewed any catfish the auditor has asked the pc question he couldnt answer he is guilty of not having cleared the question clear questions beforehand to make sure the pc can do it before asking it always respect the pcs saying that there arent any more answers otherwise you give the pc loses your entrance point to the case is where the pc breaks down in his comm cycle with the auditor and with the environment for instance if the pc cant look at the auditor you could run if you looked over here what would or might you see these are the ways you crack cases there are tons of processes that you could use suppose you are running scs on pc who you find cant stand still dont ignore the disability take something else to remedy it eg stand stilldont stand still which gets rid of automaticities if the pc knows that he has the disability he can itsa about it because it is real to him but often what the person is worried about is not what he is bugged with you could still trigger the bank and run it out on an automaticity as in dianetics but then you would get pc who gets better and doesnt know about it pcs will run off total automaticity of what is wrong with them and they wont even listen to themselves talk an auditing session is highly artificial but it is only artificial because it approximates to such harsh staggering reality the exact points of contact with beings and existence like lycoming engine in model t ford auditing highlights the exact important points of communication here is capsule version of what is wrong with the mind the only thing really wrong with people is that they have withdrawn from communicating the individual has gone out of contact he has stopped looking the last time he looked there were three sabretooth tigers ready to bite him of course he believes that there are still three sabretooth tigers there he does this throughout enough trilennia and hes got an awful big stack of tigers all of which have left but he doesnt know this fact he cant be sure that they have left person who withdraws from contact with tigers all the time and refuses to contact the area doesnt see whether the tiger is still there or not but keeps mocking it up just to be sure the tigers actually are gone but this individual is in condition of total withdrawal he is safeguarded with automatic bank with automatic beingness valence stands where he ought to be total withdrawal is capsule summary of aberration thetan has as his remedy for safety shortening his reach when he gets to the point of zero reach he inverts it into an inverted withdrawal and you get the cycle of the dynamics coming on down he comes away from actual reach to zero reach but he still has to reach so he figures out some other way to reach zero of what he is doing always has remedy that is lower so you can get an inversion of an inversion of an inversion of withdrawal this shows up in an auditing session right away in the pcs inability to talk to the auditor about pertinencies so you must remedy his communication by reaching him in order to get him to reach with person who is on compulsive outflow you have to get him there before you can run anything eg by touch that chair you have to have session before you can have technique this is how to get one you use observe and remedy the communication cycle and after you have remedied it notice that it has been remedied note that the pc is now able to communicate with the auditor and notice what else needs to be done sometimes the remedy of the outpoint happens so fast that you are astonished dont overrun it if things are going all right dont remedy them if things are going all wrong find what you can fix up and fix it up if the pc is fully in session you can run almost anything and he will sail but technique by itself will put the pc in session the auditor has to do it
