below the fy2008 level for fire and safer grants combined acco rding to the budget justification the administration believes that 287 million is an appropriate vel of funding given the availability of significant amounts of fundi ng for first responder preparedness missions from other dhs grant programs which are c oordinated with state and local homeland security strategies and unlike afg are allocat ed on the basis of risk priority will be given to applications that enhance capabilitie s needed for terrorism response and other major incidents funding will only be availa ble for critical response equipment training and personal protective gear and will not be available for wellnessfitness activities or modifications to facilities for firefighter safety on june 19 2008 the senate appropr iations committee approved the fy2009 appropriations bill for the partment of homeland secur ity s 3181 srept 110396 the bill would provide 750 million for firefi ghter assistance including 560 million for fire grants and 190 million for safer grants this is the same f unding level approved for fy2008 the committee directed dhs to c ontinue the present practice of funding applications

of homeland security the committee would provide 800 million for firefighter assistance consisting of 570 million for fire grants and 230 million for safer grants the committee directed fema to continue granting funds directly to local fire departments and to include the us fire administration during the grant administration process while also maintaining an allhazards focus and not limiting the list of eligible activities the committee would continue the requirement that fema peer review grant applications that meet criteria established by fema and the fire service rank order applications according to peer review fund applications according to their rank order and provide official notification detailing why applications do not meet the criteria for review the committee also directed fema to encourage regional applications issues primary issue in the 110th congress is how appropriations for fire grants should compare with the authorized levels of 1 billion for those years the administrations budget proposals have typically recommended significant cuts for fire grants as well as zero funding for safer grants opponents of the cuts have argued that the reduced levels are inadequate to meet the needs of fire departments while the administration has cited the availability of other riskbased dhs first responder grant programs and has argued that reduced levels for afg are sufficient to enhance critical capabilities in the event of terrorist attack or major disaster aside from budget issues an ongoing issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21302crs6 has been the focus of the fire grant progra m administration budget proposals have sought to shift the priority of the fire grant program to terrorism preparedness firefighting groups have questioned this proposed shift ar guing that the original purpose of the fire act enhancing basic firefighting needs should not be compromised or diluted similarly in recent years the house and nate appropriations co mmittees have directed the afg program to maintain broad allhazards focus s 608 the riskbased homeland security grants ac t of 2007 would direct dhs to conduct study analyzing the distribution of fire grant awards and th level of unmet firefighting equipment needs in each state related issue is the role of the us fire administration in the administration of the fire grant program at its inception the program was administered by the usfafema and focused on enhancing the basic needs of fire departments acro ss the nation in the fy2004 budget request as part of its effort to consolidate terrorism preparedness grants under single entity the administration propos ed to relocate the fire grant program within the office for domestic preparedness odp whose mission was to provide state and local governments with assistance to improve their readiness for terrorism incidents the fy2004 dhs appropriations act pl 10890 acceded to the administrations request and relocated the fire grants to odp the conferees directed that dhs shall continue current administrative practices in manner identical to the current fiscal year including peer review process of applications granting funds directly to local fire departments and the inclusion of the unite d states fire administration during grant administration on january 26 2004 thendhs secretary ridg informed congress of his intention to consolidate odp including the assistance to firefighters program into the office of state and local government coordina tion preparedness oslgcp the fy2005 homeland security appropriations act pl 108334 placed the fire grant program within oslgcp however the assistance to firefi ghters grant program reauthorization act of 2004 pl 108375 designated administra tion of the fire grant program to usfa according to the fy2006 budget request the fi re grant program w ould be administered by the oslgcp in cooperation with the usfa on july 13 2005 dhs secretary michael chertoff announced restructuring of dhs effective october 1 2005 under the restru cturing plan the fire grants as well as the safer grants were to be administered by the office of grants and training in the new dhs directorate for preparedness however legislation considered in the 109th congress sought to restructure fema within dhs with the result that fire and safer grant programs would be transferred back to fema ultimately title vi of the conference agreement on the dhs appropria tions bill pl 109295 hrept 109699 the post katrina emergency management re form act of 2006 transferred most of the existing
