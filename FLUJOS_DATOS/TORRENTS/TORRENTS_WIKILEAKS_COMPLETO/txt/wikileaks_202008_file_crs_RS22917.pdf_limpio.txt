september 16 2008 the lowincome housing tax credit program the fixed subsidy and variable rate mark p keightley analyst in public finance government and finance division summary the lowincome housing tax credit lihtc program was originally designed to provide financing for re habilitated and newl constructed rental housing with subsidy equal to 30 and 70 of their construction cost re spectively to ensure that the 30 or 70 subsidies were achieved the us departme nt of the treasury designed formula for determining the lihtc rate the formula depends in part on current market interest rates that fluctuate over time these fluctuations have also caused the lihtc rate to change over time the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 temporarily changed the credit rate formula used for ne w construction the act effectively places floor equal to 9 on the new construction tax credit rate the tax credit rate that is applied to rehabilitation construction remains unaltered by the act this report which will be upda ted as warranted by legisla tive changes explains the original method for determining the lihtc ra the relationship be tween interest rates and the lihtc rate and the mporary 9 tax credit rate floor instituted by pl 110 289 historical data on the ne w construction credit rate is analyzed in order to gain insight into the potential effect of the temporary 9 floor

lihtcs are allocated to each state according to its population states in turn award lihtcs to developers of qualified projects developers can either keep the tax credits to reduce their own tax liability or sell them to investors to raise capital for their projects the lihtc whic h is claimed annually over 10year period is used to offset portion of the projects cost the cost offset provides

lihtc rate formula the lihtc program was originally design ed to deliver 30 or 70 subsidy depending on the nature of the rental housing project rehab ilitated and federally subsidized construction projects receive the 30 subsidy while new nonfederally subsidized construction projects generally r eceive the 70 subsidy for the purposes of the lihtc program the subsidy is the present value of the 10year tax credit stream expressed as fraction of the pr ojects eligible basis costs to ensure that the 30 or 70 subsidies were achieved the us department of the treasury designed formula for determining the lihtc rate the formula which is still used today depends on three factors the cr edit period length the desired subsidy level and the current interest rate the credit peri od length and the subsidy levels are fixed in the formula while the interest rate changes over time according to current market conditions given the current interest rate the formula determines the lihtc rate that delivers the desired subsidy level because tw different subsidy levels are possible the formula produces two different tax credit rates lower tax credit ra generally referred to as the 4 credit rate is used to obtain the 30 rehabilitation subsidy higher tax credit rate generally re ferred to as the 9 credit rate has been used to ensure the 70 subsidy for new construction once the credit rate has been deter mined it is multiplied by the projects cost to obtain the annual lihtc historically the rehabilitation and new construction tax credit rates have not been exactly 4 and 9 respectively the actua l credit rates depend on the current interest rate used in the treasurys formula the inte rest rate used by the treasury is subject to market fluctuations and thes fluctuations have caused th lihtc rate to change over time2 for example since 1987 the annual tax credit rate that has delivered the 30 rehabilitation constr uction subsidy has appr oximated 4 although it has fallen as low as 3333 at the same time the annua l tax credit rate implied by the 70 new construction subsidy has approximated 9 with range between 789 and 9274 while the taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22917crs3 credit rates have fluctuated over time the project subsidies themselves have remained constant at 30 and 70 there may be difference between the tax credits project is expected to be awarded and the tax credits actually awarded credit award does not occur until project is placed in service potential developers nd investors interested in pursing lihtc project however will form an expectation bout the amount of credit they believe will be awarded once the project is completed the accuracy of their predictions will determine to what extent the exp ected and actual credit amounts differ regardless of the difference between the expected and actual credit award the project subsidy value has always been fixe d this fixed subsidy feature of the lihtc program was intended to insulate the value of the lihtc from market fluctuations an example an example may be useful for understanding the original lihtc rate formula the relationship between the tax credit rate and the current interest rate and the fixed project subsidy let us assume newl constructed rental housing prope rty with an eligible basis equal to 500000 because the project is new c onstruction it is eligib to receive the 9 tax credit as previously mentioned the actual tax credit rate awarded will not be exactly 9 but rather set such that the project receives subsidy equal to 70 of the projects cost or 350000 the tax credit rate th at satisfies this re quirement will depend on the interest rate used in the treasurys formula table 1 lihtc rate response to interest rate change ab c eligible basis new construction 500000 500000

rate table 1 presents three different interest rate scenarios the middle column b assumes an interest rate of 290 corresponding to the actual intere st rate used by the treasury to calculate the july 2008 tax credit rate given this intere st rate and the fixed 10year credit period the lihtc rate formula dictat 793 tax credit rate at this credit rate the project generates 39668 in tax credits per year or 396680 in total tax credits over 10 years the present value of the tax credits by desi gn of the formula equates to 70 of the projects costs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22917crs4 5 the appendix verifies that the subsidies in table 1 are indeed constant across all three interest rate scenarios columns and c of table 1 illustrate the relationship between the tax credit rate and the interest rate implied by the treasur ys original formula by considering one percentage point deviation from the interest rate in column b decrease in the interest rate leads to fall in the tax credit rate whereas an increase in the interest rate causes the tax credit rate to rise the subsidy however is constant at 70 of the projects cost across both of these interest rate changes5 the relationship between the interest rate the tax credit rate and the subsidy follows from the original design of the formula used by the treasury to fix the present value of the subsidy to see this consider an increase in the interest rate all else equal an increase in the interest rate would cause the present value of the tax credit subsidy to fall below 70 as originally enacted however the law required that the present value remain constant thus the tax credit rate increased to keep the present value of the total 10year tax credit stream at 70 likewise all else equal decrease in the interest rate would cause the present value of the tax cr edit subsidy to rise above 70 again the original tax law prohibited this outcome therefore the tax cred it rate declined in response to an interest rate decrease in order for the subsidy to be held constant the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 temporarily changes the lihtc rate to not less than 9 for new construction placed in service before december 31 2013 the change implies that th applicable tax credit rate for new construction will be the greater of 9 or the rate as deter mined under the original method described above the effect of the 9 tax credit rate floor on the applicable new construction tax credit rate and the size of the subsidy w ill depend on the spread between the original variable credit rate and the new temporary floor the credit rate floor will have effect if the variable credit rate is greater than the 9 floor this is because the credit rate floor imposes lower bound below which the credit ra cannot fall if th variable rate is above the floor the floor becomes nonbindi ng and therefore has effect in this scenario the value of the subsidy remains at 70 on the other hand if the variable credit ra is below the floor which has been the case recently then the effect will be an increase in the credit rate as result new construction projects will likely be conferred subsidy above the 70 level the size of the subsidy increase will depend on the extent to which the variable credit rates fall below the floor the greater the difference the larger will be the increase in the subsidy as previously mentioned the new construc tion credit has recently been less than 9 suggesting that the applicable credit rate and subsidy levels will likely increase figure 1 provides some indication as to how much th value of the new construction subsidy may increase the solid line in the figure represents the monthly new construction lihtc rate since january 1987 while the dashed line indicat the temporary 9 floor in the recent past there has been downward trend in the new construction credit rate if this trendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22917crs5 continues then the credit rate as determined under the orig inal formula may be expected to be below the 9 floor and the new met hod for determining the new construction credit may be expected to increase the value of the subsidy new construction projects receive current conditions however may not accura tely predict futu re conditions and figure 1 must therefore be interpreted with some caution source novogradac company llp affordable hous ing resource center tax credit percentages httpwwwnovococomlow_income_housingfacts_figurestax_credit _2008php visited on july 14 2008 figure 1 historical ne w construction lihtc rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22917crs6 appendix present value of low income tax credit stream this example illustrates empirically that the present value of the 10year tax credit stream presented in table 1 is constant across all three interest rate scenarios thus while the credit rate varies across the three interest rate scenarios in table 1 the present value of the 10year tax cred it stream remains c onstant at 350000 or 70 of the projects total cost
