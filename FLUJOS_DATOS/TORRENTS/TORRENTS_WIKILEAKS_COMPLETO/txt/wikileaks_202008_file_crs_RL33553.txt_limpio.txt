dairy export incentive program deip eep spending has been negligible since 1996 and deip spending has been declining since 2002 export subsidies but not other us export and food aid programs are subject to reduction commitments agreed to in multilateral trade negotiations export market development programs include the market access program map and the foreign market development or cooperator program fmdp although criticized by some as corporate welfare these programs are considered to be nontradedistorting by the world trade organization wto and are exempt from multilateral spending constraints the fsria authorizes map spending of 200 million annually in fy2006 and fy2007 and sets fmdp spending at 345 million annually through fy2007 the fsria authorizes export credit guarantees by usdas commodity credit corporation ccc of up to 55 billion worth of farm exports annually plus an additional 1 billion for emerging markets through 2007 actual levels guaranteed depend on economic conditions and the demand for financing by eligible countries the 2002 farm bill also authorizes through fy2007 foreign food aid programs including pl 480 food for peace food for progress the emerson

committee began deliberations to reconcile house and senate version of farm bill to replace the expiring 2002 farm act on march 20 2008 the world food program wfp made an urgent appeal to the united states and other food aid donors for an additional 500 million to address funding gap for food aid caused by rising food and fuel prices1 the wfp is the united nations agency charged with meeting hunger needs of vulnerable people throughout the world the us agency for international development also indicated that rising food and fuel prices would result in significant scaling back of emergency international food aid in fy2008 according to press reports on march 1 2008 usaid expects that in fy2008 it would need as much as 200 million in additional funding to meet emergency food aid needs on

exports agricultural exports are important both to farmers and to the us economy production from almost third of harvested acreage is exported including an estimated 48 of food grain production almost 20 of feed grains and about 36 of us oilseeds cotton exports amounted to 70 of production in 2006 exports also generate economic activity in the nonfarm economy according to usda each 1 received from agricultural exports stimulated another 148 in supporting activities to produce those exports recent data show that agricultural exports generate an estimated 825000 fulltime civilian jobs including 437000 jobs in the nonfarm sector2 nearly every state exports agricultural commodities usda data shows that the states with the greatest shares of us agricultural exports by value are california iowa texas illinois minnesota nebraska kansas washington north dakota and indiana these 10 states accounted for 58 of total us agricultural exports in fy2005 in addition arkansas florida kentucky missouri north carolina ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin each shipped over 1 billion worth of commodities3 usdas forecast is for us agricultural exports to reach 101 billion in fy2008 new record high with

wheat flour feedstuffs and vegetable oils and consumerready products such as fruits nuts meats and processed foods have outpaced such bulk commodity exports as grains oilseeds and cotton in fy2007 high value agricultural exports accounted for 60 of the value of total agricultural exports5 highvalue product continue to rise but according to usda bulk commodity exports account for threequarters of the year toyear increase in agricultural export value with about onequarter of that increase from volume gains6 usda attributes the fy2008 level of farm exports to continued strong demand tight global markets higher prices for grains and oilseeds and weak dollar in addition to these current factors other broader variables also influence the level of us agricultural exports income and population growth and tastes and preferences in foreign markets and exchange rates us domestic farm policies that affect price and supply and trade agreements with other countries also influence the level of us agricultural exports while many of these factors are beyond the scope of congressional action farm bills have typically included programs that promote commercial agricultural exports or provide foreign food aid usdas international agricultural programs the trade title of the 2002 farm bill the farm security and rural investment act fsria title iii of pl 107171 authorizes and amends

export enhancement program eep and the dairy export incentive program deip export enhancement program eep8 eep was established in 1985 first by the secretary of agriculture under authority granted in the commodity credit corporation charter act and then under the food security act of 1985 pl 99198 the program was instituted after several years of declining us agricultural exports and growing grain stockpile several factors contributed to the fall in exports during the early 1980s an overvalued dollar and high commodity loan rates under the 1981 farm bill made us exports relatively expensive for foreign buyers global recession reduced demand for us agricultural products and foreign subsidies especially those of the european union eu helped competing products make inroads into traditional us markets eeps main stated rationale at its inception was to combat unfair trading practices of competitors in world agricultural markets the office of the general sales manager in usdas foreign agricultural service fas operates eep the sales manager announces target countries and amounts of commodities to be sold to those countries and then invites us exporters to bid for bonuses that effectively lower the sales price an exporter negotiates sale with foreign importer calculates the bonus necessary to meet the negotiated price and submits the bonus and price to fas fas awards bonuses based on bids and amount of funding available initially awarded in the form of certificates for commodities owned by the ccc bonuses since 1992 have been in the form of cash most eep bonuses have been used to assist sales of wheat in fy1995 the last year with significant program activity 72 of eep sales were wheat 8 flour 6 poultry and the remaining sales were eggs feed grains pork barley malt and rice although many exporters have received bonuses since 1985 three exporting firms have received almost half of the total of all eep bonuses which now exceed 7 billion the former soviet union egypt algeria and china were major beneficiaries of eep subsidies the united states agreed to reduce its agricultural export subsidies under the 1994 uruguay round agreement on agriculture the agreement requires that outlays for export subsidies fall by 36 and the quantities subsidized by 21 over six years 19952001 legislation to implement the uruguay round agreement pl 103465 reauthorized eep through the year 2001 and specified that eep need not be limited to responses to unfair trade practices as in the 1985 food security act 7 for discussion of usdas export programs in relation to the next farm bill see crs report rl34227 agricultural exports and the 2007 farm bill 8 additional information on the export enhancement program is available at httpwww fasusdagovinfofactsheetseepasp crs6 but also could be used to develop export markets eep was reauthorized most recently in the 2002 fsria authority to spend ccc funds on eep expires in fy2007 eep has been controversial since its initiation in 1985 many oppose the program outright on grounds of economic efficiency eep they argue like all export subsidies interferes with the operations of markets and distorts trade others noting that the uruguay round agreement on agriculture restricts but does not prohibit agricultural export subsidies point out that as long as competitors such as the european union use export subsidies the united states should also be prepared to use them the effectiveness of eep also has been an issue several studies of the use of eep found that wheat exports would have decline somewhat if eep were eliminated suggesting that the eep program increased wheat exports other analysts however found that subsidizing wheat exports under eep resulted in displacing exports of unsubsidized grains9 recent eep activity although almost always under some pressure from interested commodity groups to use eep more extensively usda has limited its scope and funding since 1995 usdas rationale for not using eep is based on the argument that using it might depress world market prices for eligible commodities some analysts say that not using eep also strengthens the us hand in ongoing wto agriculture negotiations where major us aim is the elimination of agricultural export subsidies in fy1995 the last year of significant program activity eep bonuses were valued at 339 million from fy1996 to fy2006 total of only 17 million of eep bonuses were awarded there were eep bonus awards from fy2002 through fy2007 dairy export incentive program deip10 deip most recently reauthorized in the commodity program title not the trade title of the 2002 farm bill was established under the 1985 farm act to assist exports of us dairy products its purpose was to counter the adverse effects of foreign subsidies primarily those of the european union early bonus payments were in the form of sales from cccowned dairy stocks later they were generic commodity certificates from ccc inventories now they are cash payments as with eep usda announces target countries and amounts of dairy products that may be sold to those countries under the program exporters negotiate tentative sales and bid for bonuses to subsidize the prices of the sales the uruguay round subsidy reduction commitments see eep above apply also to deip legislative authority for deip expires on december 31 2007 9 see for example the article by paarlberg and seitzinger simulation model of the us export enhancement program for wheat in the presence of an ec response at httperaeoxfordjournalsorgcgicontentabstract164445 government accountability office gao report found that eep increased exports and helped bring competitors notably the european union to the bargaining table in uruguay round multilateral trade negotiations the gao report is available at httparchivegaogovd23t8141716pdf 10 additional information on deip is available at httpwwwfasusdagovexcredits deiphtml crs7 while many oppose subsidizing dairy products for reasons similar to those held by eep opponents the program has strong support in congress dairy producers consider deip an integral part of us dairy policy an important adjunct to domestic support programs recent deip activity deip bonuses were awarded from fy2005 through fy2007 the program level for deip in fy2003 was 32 million and in fy2004 it was 3 million administration farm bill proposals the administration calls for the repeal of the export enhancement program eep usdas justification for this move is that eep is longer useful tool for us agricultural exports it has been inactive since 1995 and its elimination would not materially affect us exports eep the secretary says is inconsistent with the us goal of eliminating export subsidies worldwide in doha round negotiations farm bill legislative action the housepassed bill extends authority for eep through fy2012 while the senate version calls for the repeal of eep both the senate and house farm bills also extend the authorization for deip in title i the commodity title through fy2012 market development programs fas administers five programs to promote us agricultural products in overseas markets including the market access program map the foreign market development program fmdp the emerging markets program emp the quality samples program qsp and the technical assistance for specialty crops program tasc all of these programs are funded through the borrowing authority of the ccc farm bill authorization of ccc funds for the market development programs expires at the end of fy2007 legislation hr 1600 the eat healthy america act introduced during the 110th congress included provisions to substantially increase funding for map and tasc market access program map11 map assists primarily valueadded products the types of activities that are undertaken through map are advertising and other consumer promotions market research technical assistance and trade servicing nonprofit industry organizations and private firms that are not represented by an industry group submit proposals for marketing activities to the usda the nonprofit organizations may undertake the activities themselves or award funds to member companies that perform the activities after the project is completed fas reimburses the industry organization or private company for part of the project cost about 60 of map funds typically support generic promotion ie nonbrand name commodities or products and about 40 support brandname promotion ie specific company product 11 additional information on map is available at httpwwwfasusdagovmosprograms mapasp crs8 the fsria authorizes map through fy2007 the funding level for the program previously capped at 90 million annually gradually increases to 200 million for fy2006 and fy2007 foreign forprofit company may receive map funds for the promotion of foreignmade product firm that is not classified as small business by the small business administration may receive direct map assistance for branded promotions starting in fy1998 usda policy has been to allocate all map funds for promotion of branded products to cooperatives and small us companies recent map activity although map is not funded by annual appropriations appropriations acts have on occasion capped the amounts that could be spent on the program or imposed other restraints on programming for example the fy1999 agriculture appropriations act imposed limits on map funding but did prohibit map spending in support of promotion of exports of mink pelts or garments provision that was first adopted in the fy1996 agriculture appropriations law since 1993 map funds may be used to promote tobacco exports map has often been targeted for cuts by some members of congress who maintain that it is form of corporate welfare or to help offset increased expenditures on other programs but such efforts have been unsuccessful usda allocated the maximum amounts authorized for map in the 2002 farm bill for fy2002 through fy2006 foreign market development program fmdp12 the fsria also reauthorizes ccc funding for this program through fy2007 at an annual level of 345 million the program which began in 1955 is like map in most major respects its purpose is to expand export opportunities over the long term by undertaking activities such as consumer promotions technical assistance trade servicing and market research as with map projects under fmdp are jointly funded by the government and industry groups and the government reimburses the industry organization for its part of the cost after the project is finished like map fmdp is exempt from uruguay round agreement reduction commitments unlike map which mainly promotes consumer goods and brandname products fmdp mainly promotes generic or bulk commodities map and fmdp issues some of the same issues raised with respect to map are also raised about fmdp and in some cases all the export programs the basic issue is whether the federal government should have an active role in helping agricultural producers and agribusinesses market their products overseas some argue that map and fmdp are forms of corporate welfare in that they fund activities that private firms would and could fund for themselves others argue that the principal beneficiaries are foreign consumers and that funds could be better spent for example to educate us firms on how to export program supporters emphasize that foreign competitors especially eu member countries also spend money on market promotion and that us marketing programs help keep us products competitive in thirdcountry markets 12 additional information on fmdp is available at httpwwwfasusdagovmosprograms fmdprogramasp crs9 recent fmdp activity prior to fy2000 fmdp was funded as part of the appropriation of the foreign agricultural service the 1996 farm bill provided new statutory authority for the program and authorized it through 2002 in fy2000 usda moved funding for fmdp from discretionary to ccc funding thus shifting its funding into the mandatory category funds allocated for fmdp in fy2001 were 28 million usda allocated the farmbill authorized amount of 345 million for the program in fy2002 through fy2006 emerging markets program13 the emerging markets program emp provides funding for technical assistance activities intended to promote exports of us agricultural commodities and products to emerging markets in all geographic regions consistent with us foreign policy an emerging markets is defined in the authorizing legislation fsria of 2002 as any country that is taking steps toward marketoriented economy through food agricultural or rural business sectors of the economy of the country additionally an emerging market country must have the potential to provide viable and significant market for us agricultural commodities or products eligible countries must have per capita incomes of less than 10065 in 20052006 and population greater than 1 million the fsria of 2002 authorizes funding at 10 million each fiscal year through fy2007 funding for the emp is set at 10 million each fiscal year through fy2007 in the 2002 farm bill in fy2006 emp allocated 10 million for 76 agricultural trade promotion projects to support generic promotions and distribution of us agricultural products trade missions and research on new markets quality samples program14 the quality samples program qsp assists us agricultural trade organizations to provide small samples of their agricultural products to potential importers in emerging markets overseas the qsp focuses on industrial and manufacturing users of products not enduse consumers under the authority of the ccc charter act of 1948 fas uses up to 2 million of ccc funds to carry out the program in fy2006 fas allocated 18 million to 17 trade organizations participating in qsp technical assistance for specialty crops tasc program15 the technical assistance for specialty crops tasc program aims to assist us organizations by providing funds for projects that address sanitary phytosanitary and technical barriers that prohibit or threaten us speciality crop exporters the legislation defines specialty crop as all cultivated plants and the products thereof produced in the united states except wheat feed grains oilseeds cotton rice peanuts sugar and tobacco the types of activities covered include seminars and workshops study tours field surveys pest and disease research and preclearance 13 additional information on the emerging markets program is available at

httpwwwfasusdagov mostasctascasp crs10 programs the fsria of 2002 authorizes 2 million of ccc funds each fiscal year through fy2007 for the tasc program in fy2006 fas allocated 26 million to tasc projects carried out by 26 us trade organizations administration farm bill proposals the secretary proposes increased funding for the technical assistance for specialty crops tasc program from its current level of 2 million annually in mandatory funding under the proposal tasc would increase to 4 million in fy2008 6 million in fy2009 8 million in fy2010 and 10 million thereafter through fy2015 for the market access program map funding would rise from the current mandatory funding of 200 million annually to 250 million annually the additional funding would address perceived inequities between farm bill program crops grains oilseeds and cotton and nonprogram crops especially specialty crops organic agriculture would be allowed to compete for map funding to help develop the export of organic products farm bill legislative action both the senate bill and hr 2419 reauthorize usdas agricultural export promotion programs through fy2012 the senate bill increases map funding by 100 million over the five fiscal years fy2008fy2012 while the house bill increases map funding by 125 million both bills specifically authorize map to promote exports of organically produced commodities the house bill authorizes ccc funding for fmdp through fy2012 with change in the funding levels authorized in the 2002 farm bill ie 345 million annually the senate bill reauthorizes fmdp through fy2012 but increases its funding by 22 million over five fiscal years hr 2419 also increases funding for tasc which the 2002 farm bill authorizes at 2 million of ccc funds per fiscal year total funding for tasc in hr 2419 over five years would amount to 38 million the senate bill provides total of 292 million for tasc over five years export credit guarantees the fsria reauthorizes through fy2007 usdaoperated export credit guarantee programs first established in the agricultural trade act of 1978 pl 95 501 to facilitate sales of us agricultural exports under these programs private us financial institutions extend financing at interest rates which are at prevailing market levels to countries that want to purchase us agricultural exports and are guaranteed that the loans will be repaid in making available guarantee for such loans the us government or more specifically the ccc assumes the risk of default on payments by the foreign purchasers on loans for us farm exports export credit guarantee programs gsm102 and gsm10316 gsm102 guarantees repayment of shortterm financing six months to three years extended to eligible countries that purchase us farm products gsm103 guarantees repayment of intermediateterm financing up to 10 years to eligible countries that purchase us farm products eligible countries are those that usda determines can service the debt backed by guarantees use of guarantees for foreign aid foreign policy or debt rescheduling purposes is prohibited 16 additional information on ccc export credit guarantees is at httpwwwfasusdagov excreditsexpcredguarhtml crs11 the 2002 farm bill authorizes export credit guarantees of 55 billion worth of agricultural exports annually through fy2007 while giving fas the flexibility to determine the allocation between short and intermediate term programs the actual level of guarantees depends on market conditions and the demand for financing by eligible countries provision in the statute allows guarantees to be used when the bank issuing the underlying letter of credit is located in country other than the importing country the farm bill continues the provision that minimum amounts of credit guarantees would be made available for processed and high value products through 2007 the farm bill permits credit guarantees for high value products with at least 90 us content by weight allowing for some components of foreign origin the legislation provides for an additional 1 billion through 2007 in export credit guarantees targeted to emerging markets countries that are in the process of becoming commercial markets for us agricultural products the general sales manager in fas administers gsm102 and 103 us financial institutions providing loans to countries for the purchase of us agricultural commodities can obtain for fee guarantees from the ccc if foreign borrower defaults on the loan the us financial institution files claim with the ccc for reimbursement and the ccc assumes the debt if country subsequently falls in arrears to the ccc its debts may ultimately be subject to rescheduling the biggest recipients of export credit guarantees have been mexico south korea iraq algeria and the former soviet union fsu iraq is in default of more than 2 billion of previously extended guarantees in fy2006 the major recipients were turkey 249 million south korea 200 million and russia 200 million guarantees facilitate sales of broad range of commodities but in fy2006 mainly benefitted exports of wheat meat and poultry oilseeds feed grains and cotton the ccc can guarantee credits under gsm102 for two other programs supplier credit guarantee program scgp and the facilities guarantee program fgp supplier credit guarantee program under scgp the ccc will guarantee payment by foreign buyers of us commodities and products which are sold by us suppliers on deferred payment basis under this variation of shortterm credit guarantee the foreign buyer alone will bear ultimate responsibility for repayment of the credit the duration of the credit is short generally up to 180 days although the fsria permits guarantees of up to 360 days these credits are expected to be particularly useful in facilitating sales of high value products the fastest growing components of us agricultural exports facilities guarantee program17 the fgp is also carried out under the gsm102

guarantees financed 37 billion of us farm exports and 26 billion worth of exports in fy2005 guarantees of 14 billion of farm exports were made available in fy2006 the amounts of credit guaranteed each year depend on the demand for guaranteed financing of us agricultural commodities by eligible borrowing countries substantially lower guarantees in fy2006 may have resulted from the suspension in fy2006 of the supplier credit guarantee program because of high rate of defaulted obligations and other problems usda has proposed terminating the scgp in its 2007 farm bill proposal in addition applying more rigorous risk analysis as result of the us response to the wto cotton case to prospective beneficiaries could have contributed to the decline in guarantees the farm bill made specific authorization of funds for the fgp and funds have been allocated by usda to this program under the current farm bill in its 2007 farm bill proposals usda suggests changes see below that would make the program an effective vehicle for improving the infrastructure for handling us farm exports in emerging markets export credit guarantees and the wto cotton case on march 3 2005 world trade organization wto dispute appeals panel ruled against the united states in dispute brought by brazil against certain aspects of the us cotton program18 the wto panel found that the gsm102 gsm103 and scgp export credit guarantee programs effectively functioned as export subsidies because the financial benefits returned to the government by these programs failed to cover their longrun operating cost furthermore the panel found that this applies not just to cotton but to all commodities that benefit from us commodity support programs the panel also found that certain payments called step 2 payments authorized as part of special cotton marketing provisions in us farm program legislation to keep us upland cotton competitive on the world market were prohibited subsidies19 step 2 payments are made to exporters and domestic mill users to compensate them for their purchase of us upland cotton which tends to be priced higher than the world market price payments to exporters were found to be contingent upon export performance and therefore qualified as prohibited export subsidies in violation of wto commitments payments to domestic users were found to be contingent on the use of domestic over imported goods and therefore qualified as prohibited import substitution subsidies 18 for detailed discussion of the us response to the wto cotton panels decision see crs report rs22187

agriculture johanns announced number of changes intended to bring the united states into compliance with the wto cotton ruling including request to congress to remove the 1 cap on fees charged under the gsm102 export credit guarantee program termination of the gsm103 export credit guarantee program and elimination of the step 2 program the announced termination of gsm103 export credit guarantees programs can be made administratively but changes in the cap on fees and the step 2 program require legislation congress included provision in the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 signed into law on february 8 2006 that provided for the elimination of step 2 by august 1 2006 however congress did not change the cap on fees the house and senatepassed farm bills discussed below do make these changes in ccc export credit guarantee programs on october 15 2007 world trade organization wto compliance panel released its final report to the us and brazilian governments concerning us compliance with negative ruling in dispute settlement case ds267 brought by brazil against certain aspects of the us cotton program reportedly the panels ruling confirmed an earlier july 27 2007 interim ruling that the united states has not fully complied with march 2005 wto ruling against certain us cotton support programs the united states is expected to appeal the compliance panels ruling the ruling against the united states barring successful us appeal could necessitate further us farm program changes or if further changes are forthcoming clear the way for brazil to request wto authorization for retaliatory trade sanctions administration farm proposals three major changes are proposed for the export credit guarantee programs first the proposals call for reforming the credit programs to make them consistent with us wto commitments to bring the credit guaranty programs into conformity with trade rules the administration asks congress to remove the 1 cap on fees that can be collected under the shortterm credit guarantee program gsm102 and eliminate specific legislative authority for the intermediate export credit guarantee program gsm103 second the administration proposes termination of the supplier credit guarantee program largely because the scgp has incurred number of defaults and there have been instances of fraud usda had already suspended fy2006 program announcements for scgp third the administration proposes to expand the facilities financing guarantee program fgp by allowing lower or down payments 98 principal and interest coverage and longer terms for up to the life cycle of facilitys depreciation schedule not to exceed 20 years these recommendations are made usda notes because the current requirements to qualify for fgp have discouraged its use farm bill legislative action title iii in both the housepassed farm bill hr 2419 and the senate farm bill make the changes in usdas export credit guarantee programs recommended by the administration repeal of gsm103 and the sgcp and removal of the 1 cap on origination fees for gsm guarantees the gsm102 program is extended through fy2012 crs14 other trade proposals other administration 2007 farm bill

of wheat on june 10 2002 and 300000 tons of wheat on august 28 2002 the wheat from the reserve was exchanged for an equal value of corn beans and vegetable oil for use in humanitarian relief in southern africa where an estimated 144 million people needed emergency food aid to compensate for severe food shortages and stave off famine through much of 2003 in fy2003 the secretary announced releases of 200000 metric tons for emergency food needs in eritrea and ethiopia and 600000 metric tons for emergency needs in iraq of the announced releases only about half 400000 metric tons were used partial replenishment of the trust was addressed in the fy2003 emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act there were releases from the trust in fy2004 on december 3 2005 the secretary of agriculture and the administrator of usaid announced the release of 200000 metric tons of wheat from the trust for emergency food relief to western sudan on june 7 2005 the president announced that 250 million 500000 metric tons of emerson trust commodities would be used to meet emergency needs in africa 900000 metric tons of wheat and 107 million in cash remain in the trust food aid issues the us food aid program is often criticized as an inefficient way to meet the objectives of relieving emergency food needs or fostering economic and agricultural crs18 development in receiving countries critics including the administration point to delayed arrivals of up to four months when us commodities are shipped in response to emergency situations ocean transportation costs can be high in fy2006 usaid estimated that almost half of its food aid allocations went to paying the cost of transportation ocean transport and internal shipping costs26 ocean freight rates vary from year to year but paying such costs is one reason that both usda and usaid have proposed in various budget proposals allocating some portion of funds available to pl 480 title ii emergency programs to purchase commodities in areas near to the emergency the administration argues that with local or regional purchase not only could more food be purchased at lower prices but the food could be delivered more rapidly congressional and other critics of the local purchase proposal maintain that allowing nonus commodities to be purchased would result in undermining the coalition of commodity groups private voluntary organizations and shippers that support the program and in reductions in us food aid27 related to the question of costeffectiveness is the cargo preference issue the cargo preference act pl 83644 august 26 1954 as amended contains permanent legislation concerning the transportation of waterborne cargoes in usflag vessels the act requires that 75 of the volume of us agricultural commodities financed under pl 480 and other concessional financing arrangements be shipped on privately owned usregistered vessels maritime interests generally support cargo preference but proponents of pl 480 argue that it increases the costs of shipping us commodities to poor countries and potentially reduces the volume of food aid provided gao report found that shipments of food aid on usflag vessels did little to meet the laws objective of helping to maintain us merchant marine and that cargo preference requirements adversely affect operations of the food aid programs chiefly by raising the cost of ocean transportation and reducing the volume of commodities that can be shipped28 the monetization selling in local markets of food aid commodities also is an issue pl 480 provision section 203 first included in the food security act of 1985 pl 99198 allows private voluntary organizations and cooperatives to sell percentage of donated pl 480 commodities in the recipient country or in countries in the same region under section 203 of pl 480 private voluntary organizations or cooperatives are permitted to sell ie monetize for local currencies or dollars an amount of commodities equal to not less than 15 of the total amount of commodities distributed in any fiscal year in country the currency generated by these sales can then be used to finance internal transportation storage or distribution of commodities to implement development projects or to invest and with the interest earned to finance distribution costs or projects 26 see usaid fy2006

organizations that rely on sales of us food aid commodities to finance development projects support monetization as their major source of development finance some private voluntary organizations however have begun to question the use of monetization as source of funds29 care which has been major supporter of monetization in the past has decided to transition out of monetization over the next two years according to care monetization is managementintensive and costly and fraught with legal and financial risks in addition it is economically inefficient as care notes in its food policy paper purchasing food in the us shipping it overseas and then selling it to generate funds for food security programs is far less costeffective than the logical alternative simply providing cash to fund food security programs finally echoing criticisms of food aid heard in wto doha round negotiations care notes that when monetization involves openmarket sale of commodities to generate cash which is almost always the case it inevitability causes commercial displacement as such it can be harmful to traders and local farmers and undermine the development of local markets and be detrimental to longerterm food security objectives catholic relief services crs has taken similar position with respect to monetization30 using some portion of the funds available to food aid programs to make local or regional purchases of emergency food aid rather than us commodities has been an issue in annual food aid appropriations debates since 2003 the issue is discussed below the administrations farm bill food aid proposal the administration made only one farm bill food aid proposal secretary johanns in his january 2007 farm bill recommendations proposed that congress provide legislative authorization to use up to 25 of funds available annually to pl 480 title ii to procure food from selected developing countries near the site of crisis the administration justifies this proposal on the grounds that the us response to food emergencies would be more efficient and costeffective if commodities could be procured locally the administrations farm bill document notes instances in which the us food aid response to emergencies would have been enhanced with this kind of authority iraq in 2003 the asian tsunami in 2004 southern and west africa in 2005 and east africa in 2006 as if anticipating the same congressional antipathy expressed in regard to this idea in past budget requests the administration is careful to note that us grown food will continue to play the primary role and will be the first choice in meeting global needs local and regional purchases would be made only where the speed of the arrival of food aid is essential 29 see white paper on food aid policy care usa june 6 2006 at

food aid however the senate bill includes authority to use pl 480 title ii funds for pilot program for local or regional purchase of emergency food aid commodities pl 480 hr 2419 extends the pl 480 food aid programs through 2012 and authorizes discretionary appropriations for pl 480 title ii humanitarian donations of 25 billion annually if appropriated that amount would represent very

title iii also reauthorizes pl 480 food aid programs and extends the minimum tonnage requirements for title ii through 2012 in contrast to hr 2419 the senate bill does not increase the appropriation for title ii the senate bill increases the share of title ii funds that can be used to cover projectrelated expenses of pvos to not less than 75 but specifies upper limit as in the house bill and current law nonemergency development food aid the housepassed bill stipulates that of the funds made available for title ii not less than 450 million annually be made available for nonemergency development food aid this minimum level of nonemergency assistance could not be waived unless requested by the administrator of usaid followed by enactment of law approving the administrators request the senate bill also establishes hard earmark of 600 million for development food aid that also would not be subject to waivers following passage of the housepassed bill the office of management and budget in its statement of administrative policy said that it strongly opposed this provision because it would deprive the administration of the ability to quickly waive it in an emergency omb estimated that this house bill provision would result in 100 million decrease in emergency food aid omb also opposes the hard earmark in the senate bill crs21 local or regional purchase for emergency food aid the housepassed farm bill disregarded the administrations sole farm bill food aid proposal for legislative authority to allocate up to 25 of title ii funds to local or regional purchase of
