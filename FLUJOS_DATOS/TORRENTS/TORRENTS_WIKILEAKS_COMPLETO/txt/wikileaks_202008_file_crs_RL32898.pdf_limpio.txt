against variety of illegal activities including channeling or undering funds to terrorist groups collecting tax revenue managi ng and accounting fo r the public debt administering the federal governments finances regulating and supervising financial institutions and producing and distributin g coins and currency three important issues facing congress each year are how much to spend on each

report examines the presiden ts budget request for the treasury department and its largest operating bureau the internal revenue service irs in fy2006 congressional action on the request nd some of the key policy issues it raised1 department of the treasury organizational and functional profile in recent decades the treasury department has played four specific roles 1 formulating recommending and implementing economic financial tax and fiscal policies 2 serving as the sole financial agent for the federal government 3 enforcing federal financial tax counterfeiting customs tobacco alcoholic beverage and gun laws and 4 producing posta ge stamps currency and coinage the creation of the department of ho meland security dhs in late 2002 and its assumption of the authorities and duties transferred to it by executive order in march 2003 drastically reshaped treasurys func tional profile2 while treasury stillhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32898crs2 2 continued executive order 13286 federal register vol 68 mar 5 2003 pp 1061910633exerts strong influence over economic policymaking within the executive branch and still serves as the governments financial manager revenue collector and producer of currency and coinage its role in law enforcement is much more circumscribed at its most basic level of organiza tion the department is comprised of departmental offices and opera ting bureaus in general the departmental offices are responsible for the formulation and imple mentation of policy initiatives and the management of depar tmental operations the operating bureaus in contrast carry out specific tasks assigned to the department largely through statutory mandates the bureaus typically acc ount for more than 95 of the departments personnel and funding with one notable exception the bureaus ma be divided into those focused on financial matters and those engaged in w enforcement in recent decades the following treasury bureaus have all contri buted to the management of federal finances or the daily operation of the us financial system comptroller of the currency us mint bureau of engrav ing and printing fi nancial management service bureau of public

current or former treasury bureaus bureau of cohol tobacco and firearms batf us secret service federal law enforcement training center us customs service financial crimes enforcement network fincen and treasury forfeiture fund the exception to this simplified dichotomy is the internal revenue service irs which is involved in both the collection of tax revenue and the forcement of federal tax laws and regulations as noted above the creation of dhs grea tly diminished treasurys role in law enforcement under the law establishi ng dhs pl 107296 the secr et service customs service and federal

and financial crimes maintaining and safeguarding the integrity of federal finances and the us financial system and increasing opportunities for economic development thr ough policy initiatives such

housing and urban development and related ag encies on april 26 2005 available at httpwwwtreasgovpressreleasesoperations except the irs many of these issues are tied to the departments strategic objectives the policy issues rais ed by the budget request for the irs are examined in subsequent section combating terrorist financing not surprisingly recent congressional testimony by senior treasury officials indicat that one of their highest priorities is uncovering monitoring and disrupting or stopping the flow of funds to terrorist groups4 in the wake of the terrorist attack s of september 11 2001 treasury has taken several noteworthy steps to extend and restructure its i nvolvement in the federal governments evolving campaign to uproot the financing of terrorist groups hostile toward the united states and other fina ncial crimes in march 2003 the treasury secretary announced the establishment of the executive office of terrorist financing and financial crimes eotf from the outset the offices mission was to coordi nate and direct treasurys efforts to uncover and dismantle terrorist financing networks combat variety of financial crimes implement certain key provisions of the bank secrecy act of 1970 bsa and the usa patriot act and represent the united states in international organizations dedicated to fighting terrori st financing and fi nancial crimes in carrying out this task eotf was authorized to draw on the resources of fincen and the office of foreign assets control ofac it appears however that these plans never came to fruition about one year later the treasury secr etary announced the formation of another office to oversee and coordinate the depar tments contributions to the governments campaign against terrorist financing and other financial crimes the office of terrorism and financial intelligence tfi tfi seeks to integrate the operations and resources of the office of terrorist financing and fina ncial crime tffc ofac fincen the office of intelligence and analysis oia and the treasury executive office for asset forfeiture in essence tfi has two basic responsibilities 1 gathering and evaluating financial intelligence and 2 enforcing various financial laws and regulations oia provides the intelligence mainly through the analysis of complex financial transactions enfor cement is handled by tffc ofac and fincen and includes such activities as identifying and freezing the bank accounts of terrorists leaders of drug smugglin g operations and their support networks implementing us sanctions policy administering and enforcing the bsa and fostering close working relationships be tween domestic law enforcement agencies and financial institutions around the aim of exposing or tracking illicit activities upon request tfi also is authorized to assist irs special agents in their investigations of allegations of terrorist financing money laundering and other financial crimeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32898crs8 5 for example in one of the primary docum ents presenting its budget request for fy2006 the treasury department describes the purpose and organizational structure of tfi but says little about the justification for the added funding it is requesting see treasury department budget in brief fy2006 washington 2005 pp 3741 6 us congress house committee on appropriations authorizing appropriations for the departments of transportati on treasury and housing and ur ban development the judiciary district of columbia and independe nt agencies in fy2006 report to accompany hr 3058 109th cong 1st sess hrept 109153 was hington gpo 2005 p 67the administrations proposed budget fo r treasury in fy2006 seeks to bolster the agencys role in the campaign against terrorist financing it asked congress to increase funding for programs within the treasury department dedicated to combating financial crimes including terrorist financing from an estimated 25 million in fy2005 to 40 million in fy2006 rise of 60 more than half of this money 22 million was to be funneled into ofac nd the remainder to tfi congress evidently agreed with this approach the enacted version of hr 3058 included 40 million for these programs the administrations request to increas substantially spending on treasury programs to combat terrorist financing and other financial crimes raised significant questions about how these additional funds w ould be spent what they would mean for treasurys role in the federal governments campaign to combat terrorist financing networks and whether the likely benefits from the increased spending would outweigh the cost of expanding the programs more specifically would the proposed budget for countering financial crimes enhance treasurys capability to analyze and disrupt terrorist financing how would the proposed budget fit into the federal governments diversified and evolving campaign against terrorist financing would the activities to be undertaken by tfi in fy2006 duplicate any of the contributions of other treasury bureaus particularly fincen and ot her federal agencies particularly the department of justice or the federal bureau of investigation if so to what extent what are the expected benefits of expandi ng treasurys programs to counter terrorist financing and how do they compare to the additional cost of such an expansion the administration provided few details in its budget documents that addressed any of these questions5 some members of congre ss had similar questions bout treasurys plans to increase its involvement in the campaign agai nst terrorist financing in its report to the house on hr 3058 the committee on ppropriations expre ssed concern about the purpose of tfi and its role in the governments campaign against terrorist financing6 future congressional oversight of the tfi and related treasury programs may wish to focus on these policy questions administration of the community velopment financial institutions fund the administrations fy2006 budget re quest for the treasury department included reduction in funding for th community development financial institutions fund cdfi from 551 million in fy2005 to 79 million in fy2006 to say the least the proposal pr ovoked controversy over its meritshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32898crs9 7 for more details on the administrations proposed consolidation of federal community and economic development programs see crs report rl32823 an overview of the administrations strengthening americas communities initiative by eugene boyd pauline smale tadlock cowan garrine laney and bruce foote 8 see hannah bergman and laura thompson osur i bush budget would spell pain for cdfis american banker vol 170 27 feb 9 2005 p 1since its inception the cdfi which was created by the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of 1994 has sought to increase the availability of credit investment capital nd financial services in relatively poor urban and rural communities the fund pursues th objectives by augmenting the private resources for investment in economic development affo rdable housing and basic banking services in these communities it works with two sets of partners in boosting such investment private financial institutions certified by the cdfi as community development financial institu tions and private equity groups certified by the cdfi as community development entities cdes under the administrations proposal three core elements of the cdfi native initiatives bank enterprise award program and community development financial institutions program would have been consolidated within the commerce department with at least 17 other fede ral community and ec onomic development programs7 in taking such step the administration has said it was trying to achieve greater results and focus on communities most in need of assistance additional funding for loans and grants was proposed for the cdfi programs that were to be transferred to the commerce department it was not clear from the administrations budget documents whether funding for th programs would be cut relative to spending on them in recent fiscal years what was clear was that the 79 million requested for cdfi in fy2006 would have abled the fund to continue administering the socalled new markets tax credit created by the community renewal tax relief act of 2000 and manage its ex isting portfolio of loans and grants the credit is intended to inject greater private investme nt into poorer neighbor hoods with relatively high rates of poverty and unemploym ent through the medium of cdes the administrations proposal was sharply criticized on the grounds that it would undermine the pr ospects for needed economic development in poorer communities by effectively eliminating the cdfi programs to be transferred to the commerce department some feared the proposal would lead to substantial loss of seed capital for small banks classified as community development financial institutions8 among these critics were some members of congress their views apparently proved decisive in the congressional bate over the merits of the proposal the enacted version of hr 3058 not only reta ined the current administrative structure for the cdfi but also provided it with 550 million in funding in fy2006 and fy2007 6 million of which is for direct loans and 4 million of which is for technical assistance for native american hawaiian and alaskan communities policy issue raised by the administr ations proposal one that may have contributed to its defeat was its impact on the communities th at have benefitted from the cdfi programs the administration wanted to consolidate within the commerce department more specifically the proposal led some to ask whether thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32898crs10 proposed reorganization of the cdfi would tr igger sharp declines in lending to small firms and investment in co mmercial real estate development and lowincome housing and gradual retrenchments in the availability of financial services in these communities future congressional oversight of the cdfi may wish to assess the effects of its programs in the communities directly affected by them funding for the cohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau the administrations fy2006 budget request also s ought to charge user fees for some of the services provided by the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau two new fees were proposed 1 an administra tive fee for drawbacks from manufacturers of nonbeverage products and 2 filing fee for certificate of label approvals for distilled spirits wine and beer american viticultural areas proposed formulas and new permit applications to make the adoption of the fees feasible the administration said it would seek the enactment of legislation giving the bureau the authority to collect the proposed fees the administration said the fees were warranted because they would compel the firms benef itting from the bureaus regulatory activities to bear at least some of the cost of these activities among the benefits cited by the administration were the assurance that alcohol and tobacco products sold domestically were unadulte rated and fair competition among firms subject to the regulations the administra tion estimated that the proposed fees would raise 286 million in revenue in fy2006 some opposed the proposed fees on the grounds that they would prove unduly burdensome for smaller firm s especially familyowned wineries the opponents included some lawmakers evidently mo re than few members of congress found this line of reasoning persuasive the enacted version of hr 3058 rejected the proposed user fees in the minds of some the administrations proposal raised the broader policy question of under what circumstances is it ppropriate for federal agency to rely on user fees rather than appr opriated funds to cover the cost of providing specific services internal revenue service in order to finance its operations nd many of its programs the federal government levies individual and corporat income taxes social insurance taxes excise taxes estate and gift taxes customs duties and miscellaneous taxes and fees the federal agency responsible for adminis tering and collecting these taxes and fees except customs duties is the internal re venue service irs in discharging this responsibility the irs receives and proce sses millions of tax re turns and related documents and payments dis burses refunds enforces comp liance through audits and other methods collects delinquent

million from 15 in fy2004 to 28 in fy200817 the administration sought more resources for tax law enforcement for several reasons first failure to pay taxes owed was becoming significant problem according to the latest estimate by the irs the gross tax gap which is the difference between federal taxes owed on gal sources of income and federal taxes on that income paid on time in the 2001 tax year amounted to somewhere between 312 billion and 353 billion18 by contrast the gross tax gap was estimated to have been about onethird that level in 1992 1101 billion to 1270 billion19 tax evasion is serious policy issue because if left unchecked it can undermine the fairness and integrity of the tax system waste considerable economic resources and hamper the performance of the economy second from the mid1990s through the fi rst few years of the third millennium irss resources for enforcing compliance with tax laws and regulations declined while the volume of tax returns grew from fy1996 to fy2003 the size of the irs workforce engaged in enforcement activities steadily fell from 26061 in fy1996 to 19322 in fy2003 drop of 26 the downw ard trend ended in fy2004 when the total number of

10 million or more the audit rate stood at 1208 in fy2003 down from 2533 in from fy1996 third spending on enforcement has the pot ential to generate large return on investment through its enforcement activities the irs collects taxes that otherwise might go unpaid in addition the threat of investigation and pr osecution inherent in enforcement activities deters some individua ls from engaging in tax evasion leading to higher levels of currentyear tax paymen ts than otherwise would be the case in fy2004 irss enforcement activities yielde d 431 billion in additional revenue an increase of 55 billion or 15 from fy200320 without providing supporting evidence the administration argued in its budget request for the irs in fy2006 that spending 265 million more on enforcement in fy2006 than in fy2005 would yield nearly 12 billion in additiona l revenue by fy2008 research on the efficacy of tax law enforcement activities suggests there is incontestable causal connection between spending on enforcement nd the amount of revenue collected21 recent report by tigta questioned the methodology us ed by the irs to project return of 440 in fy2008 for every dollar spent on forcement in fy2006 above the level of fy200522 the proposed increase in spending on enfo rcement raised at least three policy questions that might be of interest to lawmakers how much additional revenue would be collected as result of the increase and over what period would it be collected could of its overall budget devot ed to enforcement without compromising taxpayer service or its commitment to pr otect and uphold taxpay er rights should congress set enforcement goals for the irs and make its budget for enforcement contingent on tangible progress toward achieving those goals use of private debt collection agencies as part of its strategy for improving taxpayer compliance and shrinking the gross tax gap the bush administration sought in its budget requests for fy2004 and fy2005 the legal

collection for federal agencies under federal supply schedule 5204 are eligible to submit bids if problems arise in the first phase of the initiative the number of contractors could be expanded to 12 in january 2008 the proposal to allow the irs to use pc as has been controversial since it was first unveiled critics c ontend that the use of pcas w ould violate the wellestablished and widely accepted principle that the collection of taxes is an inherently governmental function threaten taxpayer pr ivacy undermine the security of irs jobs and serve as an invitation to taxpayer buse by giving private debt collectors financial incentive to use aggressive tactics with the taxpayers they contact supporters of the proposal retort that th concerns are largely unfounded and that the proposed use of pcas plan offers seve ral advantages over hiring additional irs staff to pursue the targeted individual tax debt first appr opriated funds would be used to pay for the services rendered by the pcas second the private collection agencies would augment and not replace the irss own collection staff finally the use of pcas would enable the irs to focu s its enforcement resources on more legally challenging cases of tax evasion with potentially higher payoffs some members of congress remain opposed to irss private debt collection initiative even though it is just beginning to take shape in the house debate over hr 3058 representatives chris van hollen and rob simmons introduced an amendment hamdt 418 that would have prohibite d the irs from using any appropriated funds to

irs taxpayer assistance centers tacs the ir s telefile service and the irs tollfree telephone help line had declined in recent years as more and more taxpayers access the irs website to obtain needed tax forms and filing instructions and file tax returns electronically25 second the cost of assisting ta xpayers and processing returns was much lower online than in person or over the telephone some were concerned that further cutb acks in the budget for taxpayer service would reverse some of the advances in ta xpayer service that had occurred since the passage of rra9826 these advances included impr oved responses by irs staff to taxpayer questions over tollfree telephone lines and expanded access to number of selfserve options over the telephone and through the irs website aimed at simplifying the filing of tax returns and payment of taxes over the first eight months of 2005 nior irs officials announced or took several steps intended to cut 134 million from spending on taxpayer

taxpayer advocate the national treasury employees union and certain members of congress major cern of critics was how the loss of 68 tacs and reduction in toll free telephone assistance would affect compliance by those in greatest need of assi stance especially the elderly lowincome households and immigrants this concern so galvanized congressional critics that they inserted provision section 205

would lead to more individuals failing to fulfill their legal obligations under the tax code even if more money were spent on forcement although senior irs officials argued that compliance could only improve by shifting funds from taxpayer service to enforcement they provided hard evidence to support this claim during congressional action on the administration s budget request for the irs one
