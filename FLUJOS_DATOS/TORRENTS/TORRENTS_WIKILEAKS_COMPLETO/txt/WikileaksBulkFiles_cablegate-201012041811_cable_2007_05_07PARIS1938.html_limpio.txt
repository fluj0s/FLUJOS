gm pinr subject uk readout of blairsarkozy meeting classified by polmc josiah rosenblatt for reasons 14 b d 1 c summary uk pm blairs may 11 meeting with french presidentelect sarkozy focused primarily on next steps on the eu constitutional treaty in advance of sarkozys may 16 meeting with german chancellor merkel according to uk dcm hitchens the uk hope is that the blair sarkozy and merkel will reach quiet agreement on the way forward he said french and uk positions were close on avoiding new referenda qualified majority voting and social charter but they differed on establishing an eu president on turkey blair had stressed the importance of not interrupting turkeys accession negotiations with sarkozy not clear on his intentions there was little discussion of trade issues and none of european defense hitchens surmised that sarkozys operating style within the eu would seek to make deals with major capitals above the heads of the smaller states and saw sarkozys mediterranean union as way for france to deal with the turkish question he said it remained to be seen whether sarkozy intended to act on his campaign rhetoric criticizing the european central bank personal chemistry between blair and sarkozy was excellent the relationship with brown will take time to build not least because he speaks french blair also had short and unremarkable meeting with chirac end summary 2 c pol mc and deputy met may 14 with uk embassy dcm tim hitchens for readout of uk pm tony blairs may 11 lateafternoon meeting with french presidentelect nicolas sarkozy this was presidentelect sarkozys first meeting with foreign visitor following his may 6 election he had met with saad hariri the previous day his first official meeting as president will occur may 16 in berlin with german chancellor angela merkel following the transfer of power ceremony earlier that same day in paris with outgoing president jacques chirac the press has speculated that the focus of both meetings is on overcoming the eus current loss of momentum following the french rejection in 2005 of the eu constitutional treaty incoming presidential diplomatic advisor and national security advisorequivalent jeandavid levitte confirmed this in conversation with pol mc re scheduling for the deputy secretary moving the eu forward 3 c hitchens confirmed press reports that the discussions focused primarily on how to overcome the eus current blockage on institutional reform blairs main objective he said was to ensure that the way forward toward new constitutional treaty would not require referendum in the uk the mood of the discussions was positive and uk experts would be meeting with their french counterparts in the next day or so to try to close the distance between french and uk positions to the greatest extent possible in advance of sarkozys may 16 meeting with merkel while sarkozy would not arrive in berlin with frenchuk common position the idea was that sarkozy would have an understanding of uk red lines the hope was that by the end of the week there would be clear sense in london paris and berlin about what might be possible 4 c pol mc asked if merkel would be speaking for the 18 countries that have ratified the current draft constitutional treaty hitchens responded that merkel would want deal by the end of her presidency and the tradition was that the presidency was forced to settle for less than it ideally wanted comment hitchens demurred when asked whether the germans were running less neutral presidency than had the british end comment if all went well the german presidency would end with mandate for intensive negotiations on document to be approved by the end of the portuguese presidency leaving ratification for 2008 he thought it would be difficult for portugal and slovenia as small countries and france as the country that had rejected the eu constitutional treaty otherwise to reach deal four uk concerns sarkozy close on three 5 c on substance hitchens described four uk conditions for reaching an agreement on three of which he believed that the uk and france could succeed in narrowing their differences first the uk would insist on an amending treaty rather than new constitutional treaty in order to avoid referendum sarkozy appeared to agree second the uk wanted less qualified majority voting than did france but hitchens judged the differences as bridgeable third the uk said the uk did not favor symbols which gave the impression that the eu was state and therefore does not support an eu foreign minister similarly the uk was concerned by new sarkozy proposal for an eu president that would go beyond the rejected draft constitutional treaty comment this is the first we have heard of this idea end comment on paris 00001938 002 of 003 reflection hitchens speculated that sarkozy was using the idea as negotiating ploy that would please his french domestic audience finally the uk was not in favor of social charter hitchens said they believed that sarkozy also was not keen on the idea but that this was high priority for merkel turkey the toughest nut 6 c on turkey hitchens described blairs position as wanting to ensure that turkeys accession negotiations would continue uninterrupted as the uk viewed the negotiations as virtuous in themselves hitchens acknowledged that sarkozy was fierce opponent of turkish membership which he had made clear right away hitchens said the uk hoped that sarkozy did not perceive political reason to cause trouble in advance of the june 26 eu decision whether to open new chapters for negotiation or that if he chose to do so he would make waves only in paris and not brussels pol mc asked whether sarkozys idea of mediterranean union was intended as facesaving way out hitchens affirmed that the initiative was primarily aimed at turkey notwithstanding claims to the contrary he added it was typical of sarkozy to take strong position on subject and simultaneously offer an escape route hitchens agreed that france also saw benefit in mediterranean vocation as way to balance germanys ties in eastern europe little on trade 7 c hitchens said there was indepth discussion of trade he said the uk supported the role of ec commissioner mandelson whereas sarkozy had argued that it was illegitimate for an unelected commissioner to negotiate on behalf of europe otherwise the discussion was unsurprising or it was surprising only in the sense that sarkozy presented normal french position ie consistent with what chirac would have said he allowed that the uk had been hoping for signs of more flexibility and suggested that the uk would want to revisit this topic once new government was formed esdp 8 c on european defense hitchens noted that surprisingly there had been discussion sarkozy and europe 9 c asked about the impact of sarkozy on europe more generally hitchens expressed hope for better ukfrench working relationship although he hastened to add that ukfrench relations would never threaten to overtake the francogerman tandem indeed the uk hoped for good trilateral cooperation between europes main powerhouses hitchens thought there was risk that sarkozy would make deals with other major interlocutors such as the uk or germany without taking adequate account of the views of the smaller states he described sarkozy as not good at dealing with unimportant people hitchens said sarkozy would discover that he did not like european diplomacy with its emphasis on process and consensus the uk was waiting with bated breath to see what kind of attitude sarkozy would take toward the european central bank now that the election campaign was over on more political europe hitchens predicted that sarkozy would want above all to put france back at the heart of european decisionmaking although the uks main priority was that the french economy do better while more successful france might mean more difficult france this was still unquestionably preferable to an unsuccessful france origins of meeting 10 c hitchens said the idea of meeting came up during one of blairs and sarkozys phone conversations with blair offering to meet sarkozy at venue to be determined once it became clear that it would be paris blair also arranged meeting with president chirac the british were frankly surprised that sarkozy agreed to see blair before merkel although sarkozys trip to berlin would be his first official visit noting that it was pity that french and british timing were not in synch blair would be leaving as sarkozy arrived the meeting also made sense as way for the british to make up for the fact that their government would change in few weeks and thus would fall behind other european countries in engaging with the new french government sarkozy was accompanied at the meeting by likely pm francois fillon and sarkozys chief of staff david martinon to be the presidential spokesman the interpreter who came was not needed as is customary theirmeeting was entirely in french paris 00001938 003 of 003 sarkozyblair merkel brown 11 c hitchens said the chemistry between blair and sarkozy was good much because they related to each other as politicos over the years they have enjoyed comparing notes on party organization how to work with labor and business and how to appeal to the extremes note the suggestion was that sarkozy may have learned quite little from blair on this score hitchens noted that sarkozy also traveled frequently to london with his wife for personal reasons hitchens suggested that while blair and merkel talked frequently their different personalities she was far less outgoing made for more distant relationship but blair had great respect for her based on the brilliant hand she had played during the eus budget discussions hitchens hinted that sarkozy would not immediately get on as well with brown as he had blair if only because brown did not speak french meeting with chirac 12 c hitchens described blairs meeting with chirac as uneventful chirac spoke as an old friend noting that the uk and france sometimes differed while praising their cooperation on climate change and africa hitchens noted that blair and chirac would probably continue to cross each others paths in the future as both of them were setting up foundations to deal with these same issues please visit paris classified website
