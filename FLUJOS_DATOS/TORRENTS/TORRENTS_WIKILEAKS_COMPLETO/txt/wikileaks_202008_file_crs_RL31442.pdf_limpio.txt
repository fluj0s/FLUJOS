amtraks futu re is now at crossroads amtraks worsening financial situation and its relatively small overall share of the intercity passenger market have led some policymakers to consider other models of passenger rail regulation the experience of other countries is of ten cited in debates about passenger rail re gulatory regimes the foreign experience can provide some perspective and some insight in the debate on us intercity passenger rail many c ountries have dramatically reorganized the regulatory framework of their railroads market forces and political pressures were the underlying causes of railway reform the objectives of rail reform was to reverse declining market shares due to competition from the automobile and airplane to make the railroads more re sponsive to customers and to reduce the railroads dependence on government subsidies in order to accomplish these objectives governments have reorganized their railways along several dime nsions some national railroads were divided geographically into separate entities by region in some cases national railroads were also divided by business sector such as freight separated from passenger services vertical integration where one entity c ontrolled both train ope rations and track infrastructure versus vertical sepa ration where train operations and track infrastructure were controlled by separate entities was another choice offered by rail policymakers rail policymakers also faced choice between public versus private ownership levels of priv atization can be distinguis hed among several foreign railroads final important element of railway regulation is the role of competition theoretically competition in passenger rail service can take the form of multiple train operating companies competing on the same track however in practice competition more readily takes the form of franchises bidding for government contracts to perform rail services andor competition from other modes such as automobile bus and airplane the regulato ry framework of passe nger rail in seven countries is profiled arge ntina canada france germ any japan mexico and the united kingdom the level of government support for passenger rail in japan and european countries far exceeds the level of governme nt support in the united states in many cases at the initial stage of restructuring foreign governments absorbed the large debt that the previous national railroad had accumulated even the most market oriented governments have accepted some kind of public support for new high speed track construction federal gove rnments also provide direct operating subsidies to their railroads in most cases in japan few lines are able to cover their operating expenses without government opera ting subsidies although restructuring may provide opportunities for increasing pr oductivity and efficiency many rail analysts contend that more critical issue facing congress is the high level of government spending viable

congress is currently debating the fe deral governments role in providing intercity passenger rail service among the major issues being debated are possible changes to the regulatory regime best methods for financing capital and operational needs and the appropriate vel of public financ ial support for passenger rail service many believe that amtraks future is now at crossroads since its creation in 1971 congress has periodically rea ppraised amtraks financia l condition and its role in providing intercity passenger service some maintain that amtrak has received enough funds to keep the system in place but not nearly enough funds to develop an extensive high speed system like that in japan or europe amtraks worsening financial situation and its relatively small overall share of the intercity passenger market have led some policymakers to c onsider other models of passenger rail regulation by this fiscal year amtrak is required to ach ieve operating self sufficiency1 it is virtually certain that amtrak will not achieve this requirement2 amtraks reauthoriz ation is due in 20033 frequently foreign countries experience with intercity rail is cite d in the debate about us passenger rail regulation particularly with respect to the ability of foreign passenger railroads to achieve operating selfsufficiency in this debate this topic is relevant because it may illuminate the necessary prerequisites for creating stable nd viable intercity passenger rail service in the united states this report reviews the causes and goals of railway restructuring in other countries it

railroad mergers the end of history in frank wilner railroad mergers omaha nebraska simmonsboardman1997 p 342it is important to recognize the differences in the context in which railways have developed in various countries because of cultural historical political economic and geographic differences the countries re viewed in this report are presented as isolated cases for instance the united st ates lacks rail culture like that found in japan or france whose highspeed passeng er trains are source of national pride and attraction one reason for this differen ce may be that personal incomes in the united states have been higher than else where so enhanced access to autos and air travel attacked the railroads passenger traffic far earlier in the united states than elsewhere4 historically compared with japan nd europe railway development in the united states has been largely dominated by freight rather than passenger services in the united states rail captures only 01 of domestic interc ity passenger travel but 36 of the domestic intercity freight market in japan intercity trains capture nearly18 of the passenger market but only 3 of the freight market in france and germany trains carry about 7 of inte rcity passenger travel and about 20 of intercity freight5 industry analysts note that passe nger rail is most competitive with the automobile bus or airplane between distances of 50 to 500 miles for freight traffic rail is most competitive for di stances greater than 500 miles distances between cities in the united states are genera lly larger than in many other countries geographically countries with relatively small land areas may be better suited for passenger rail travel industry observers also assert that ra il ridership is dependent on the population density of the country as whole as well as the density of the cities themselves cities with high urban sprawl or lower urban density are generally less rail supportive the price of gasoline and the price and availability of parking are also factors that influence rail ridership it is important to consider these factors in assessing the rail experience of foreign countries and the potential lessons we can draw from those experiences in the past decade many countries have dramatically reorganized the regulatory framework of their railroads before re organization many nati onal railroads could be described as states within state they were often characterized as monolithic stateowned and staterun ente rprises in some cases notably in japan and germany the national railroad also serv ed to provide employment production goals such as constructing new lines mainta ining track and equipment and running the trains were the primary focus customer serv ice and financial performance were not the first concerns of the prereform railroads6 although the traditional focus on production and technical probl emsolving are still important the intent of

been to reorie nt the railways to become customerdriven commercial enterprises7 how well they have succeeded and the extent to which their experience is applicable to the us case is the focus of the remainder of this report origins and objectives of railway restructuring market forces and political pressures were the underlying causes of railway reform from the 1960s through the 1980s na tional passenger rail lost market share to the automobile and airplane passenger rails declining market share was due to rising personal income road building nd advances in air travel the general publics perception was that they were receiving mediocre service from their passenger railroads at th same time public subsidies were reaching unsustainable levels in many countries mounting debt s were creating macr oeconomic financial crisis in some countries in japan for example before refo rms were initiated in 1987 the national railways current defic it reached 49 of the total national budget and 09 of gdp these pressures prompt ed rail policymakers to adopt new models for railway regulation railway reform had three goals one goal was to reverse declining market share governments viewed greater use of passenger rail as means of reducing road congestion and environmental pollution second goal was to make their railroads more market responsive to customers as well as possible investors by increasing the railways distance from political influence policymakers believed that managers would have more discretion to improve efficiency and innovation third goal of reform was to reduce the ra ilroads dependence on the public purse or at least make public funding more transparent reform s were intended to reverse the increasing financial dependence of the ra ilroads on the taxpayer by freeing them to act more like customerdriven enterprises in the cases where privatization schemes were initiated the government also wished to replace at least portion of public funding with private sector involvement by reducing cr osssubsidization within the railroad and increasing the transparency of public s upport public financia l assistance could become more targeted and taxpayers woul d have clearer idea of where their funds were directed options for railway restructuring in order to accomplish the goals of railway reform governments have divided their national railroads along several dimensions one possibility was to divide the national railroad along ge ographic dimension for example in japan passenger rail was divided into three regions on the main island of honshu jr east jr central and jr west three additional passenger railroads were created on each of the three smaller islands jr hokkaido jr shikoku and jr kyushu service was divided so that 95 of all passenger trips would begin and end within the service territory of one companyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31442crs4 8western transportation advisory council railway structure models discussion paper dec 1997 p5

railroads were also divide d along functional or business sector dimensions in germany freight wa s separated from passenger service and passenger rail was split between long distance and regional service similarly in argentina the national railr oad was divided into three business sectors freight intercity passenger nd commuter networks another choice rail policymakers faced was whether to keep their railroads vertically integrated or separate train operations from track infrastructure vertical integration in which infrastructure ope rations and marketin g are all controlled under one organization is the traditiona l model of railway organization some industry analysts believe the interrelationshi p between track and trains is too complex to be separated they argue that tradeoff exists between the design and maintenance of track and the speed at which trains may operate over the track this tradeoff affects the cost of the entire operation8 another advantage of vertically integrated railway is that it allows for integrated planning of operations and gives incentive for the railroad to adopt long term perspective in its investment planning disadvantage is that it can be barrier to the introduction of competition because of the large infrastructure costs that new entrants must overcome also due to lack of competition integrated railways ma exhibit tendency toward becoming unresponsive monopolies to overcome the problems common to fu lly integrated railway some countries have separated the re sponsibility of train operations fro m track vertical separation of rail services puts rail on more equal footing with its competition namely automobiles buses and airplanes like highways and runways the government can provide rail track as public good in theory by placing the high fixed cost of providing and maintaining track under parate body train operating companies can more fairly compete with their intermodal rivals vertical paration like geographic and functional division also enhances the cl arity of government expenditures costs are more clearly separated and public subsidies more clearly directed toward specific purposes drawback of vertical separation is that it distances the entity providing infrastructure from its true customers the passengers by inser ting train operating company as its direct customer another disadvantage is that it may hinder long term investment planning because two indepe ndent organizations may have difficulty coordinating their plans regardless of how governme nts chose to divide their railways horizontally or vertically they also faced the choice betw een public or private ownership in the situation of complete public ownership nd control the railroad is government department the railroad s independence from govern ment control and is fully financed by budgetary transfers9 examples of this archetype were the railroads of the former socialist countries before re form the national railroads of germany and japan were also facto g overnment departments s econd situation is railroad that is structured as public corporation in this scenario managers are given morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31442crs5

the privat sector in this regulatory scheme managers are more insulated from politically directed decision making in joint stock company arrangement privatization occurs as the shares of stock are sold to the public an alternative course of privatization is franchising rail services to private companies franchising allows governments to retain ultimate control over the infrastructure through regulatory body while the private sector carries out the operating functions and competes for customers10 table 1 illustrates different levels of privatization table 1 classification of railway

governments aim in railway restructuring the extent of legal independence granted shows how much policymakers are willing to reduce their influence on the former national railroad11 in addition as the degree of privatiza tion increases tradeoff exists between financial and efficiency objectives on the one hand and social and equity objectiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31442crs6 12javier campos and pedro cantos rail transport regulation world bank p 17on the other12 high level of privatization reveals premium placed on financial goals in order to attract private capital and provide sufficient returns privatized railroad obviously must be prof itable to be profitable private railroad may need to abandon money losing routes usually th routes are in ru ral areas because low population density makes it difficult for the railroad to generate enough traffic to cover its operating costs to the extent that the railroad can attract private capital it reduces the financial burden on the state privatized railroad is also going to put premium on efficiency it has to continua lly pursue cost savings strategy on the other hand railroad kept under government control usually suggests premium placed on public service goals there is ss risk for example that the railroad will abandon unprofitable rural routes the gove rnment can subsidize those routes it deems socially beneficial state ownership also eliminates the risk of service disruption if private rail provider goes bankrupt however th financial burden on the state will likely be greater under state owned company another key element of rail regulatory regimes is the role of competition industry observers assert that privatiz ation alone does not necessarily ensure improved efficiency competition is at least as important theoretically the separation of operations from infrastructure could lead to competition on the track more than one train operator could run trains over the same track in reality there is little experience with this form of competition train scheduling and slot allocation difficulties are hindrances in franchising or concessioning arrangement competition can be created for the track companies can compete for the track based on the level of service and financial support they require the company awarded the franchise is given exclusive operation on the track third form of competition is intermodal competition between modes competition from the automobile bus and airplane also can bring about effici ency gains by the railroad sector selected country experiences the following section explains in more detail the data provided in table 1 individual country experiences are presente d below in order of increasing levels of privatization the degree of government financial support for

compared with its european union eu neighbors frances reorganization of its railroad has been relatively minor its restructuring has more to do with complying with eu directives than an effort to dramatically reform its railway in 1991 eu directive 9144013 outlined initial steps eu member countries should take in order to fac ilitate single european market for rail services the commission envisioned transeuropean ra il network with interoperability and technical harmonization of networks across borders its initial goal is creating seamless network for rail freight services the first objective is to separate the management of railway infrastructure fro m train operations accounting separation is compulsory while organizational separa tion is optional vertical separation is intended to lead to open access to the networks by member states for more efficient international transport of goods th 1991 directive as well as subsequent directives does not require member states

of the railways reorganization frances approach to rail restructuring reflects its strong or ientation towards public service ethic germany germanys approach to restructuring can more aptly be

buenos aires commuter services but freight was the priority in the restructuring process the first step was to identify profitable and unprofita ble routes and to award concessions to the private sector through competitive bids for those segments deemed commercially viable in the intercity passenger market only one route was found to be commercially viable the buenos aires mar plata line links the capital city with popular beach resort it is the most dens ely traveled intercity passenger line in the country initially this line was offered fo r concession under 30 year term and four groups responded to the bid however the province of buenos aires offered to take over this service and the federal government transferred the rolling stock and other assets necessary to run the service to the province18 in 1992 the federal government announced that it would longer subsidize intercity passenger service the governme nt believed that the highway network and the private bus industry provided adequate intercity passenger m obility the federal government offered the provinces the op tion of funding inte rcity passenger rail service themselves if they wanted service to continue most provinces rejected this offer and as result about 70 of the services were discontinued mexico like argentina freight rather than passenger service was the focus of rail reform in mexico in the early 1990s immediately before privatization the governmentowned mexican national railroad ferrocarriles nacionales mexico fnm captured only 15 of the passenger market and 15 of the freight traffic during the initial privatiz ation phase of the freight sector in 1995 and 1996 the government maintained that its financial support for intercity passenger service would continue however the government has since announced that its program of building rural roads connecting communities that previously were only connected by rail would gradually phase out the need for intercity passenger rail the federal government has declared that intercity passenger rail is underu tilized and too costly to subsidize it expects that the only pa ssenger service it will continue to support is the chihuahuapacific

the new rail regulatory arrangements british rail was the last in long string of public utilities to be pr ivatized in england in 1994 british rail was divided into over 70 companies railtrack was formed to own and operate the track stations and rail yards the source of railtracks income was the track access fees it charged the train operating companies to run over its track these infrastructure charges were intended to make railtrack selfsufficient and provide reasonable return to attract private investors in may 1996 railtracks stock shares were sold to the public twentyfive train operating companies tocs were established and awarded franc hises to run the trains over designated geographic regions the tocs were awarde d their franchises for periods of seven to fifteen years franchise awards were based on the level of g overnment subsidy the tocs would require and the amount of serv ices they were willing to offer the tocs were not required to own any physical assets such as track or rolling stock to allow for easier entry and exit in the market eighteen of the franchises were sold to private intercity bus firms three rolling stock companies roscos were created to own and maintain the existing passenger cars and locomotives these were leased to the tocs about dozen private comp anies compete for the contracts to perform track renewal and maintenance

strongly marketoriented governments have accepted some kind of public support for new construction21 in order for rail to maintain significant market share in intercity passenger travel policymakers appear to share the view that public investment in expensive high speed track is required as expre ssed by one industry observer one vital question remains unsolved in every country none of the current restructuring schemes seems able to sure the huge investment that railways badly need for survival22 construction of japans highspeed network the shinkansen was paid for entirely by the government until 1987 beginning in the 1990s cost share arrangement was instituted between the central government local governments and the railway lines for construction of new shinkansen lines the specifics of the cost share formula appears to be point of negotiation on case by case basis although the central and local governments bear considerable amount of the cost of construction now that the highspeed network is moving into lower density corridors the railroads have shown reluctance to build new lines because of the financial burden they will incurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31442crs12

the degree of government support for infrastructure can be compared by examining the price setting mechanism for track access charges in some countries infrastructure charges are intended to make up the difference between total infrastructure costs and the governments contribution23 however this objective may conflict with other policy objectives such as promoting rail use or setting charges so that they are comparable with other modes in france the government capped the fee that rff could charge sncf for track access in the first two years after reorga nization the price ceiling was kept well below the level rff would need to pay for infrastructure since 1998 the cap on access charges has increased in 2002 sn cf expects to pay double the amount it paid to rff in 1998 the charge level is point of contention between sncf and rff sncf finds them to be too high while rff finds them to be too low24 access charges still fall short of what rff needs for track maintenance costs and the

options for rail infrastructure investment many commentators have observed that railtrack was probably not given enough incentive to invest in its infrastructure they note that 97 of railtracks track

adopting strategy of making incremental repairs to track rather than overhauling and upgradi ng major sections of track because large portion of its income was fixed railtrack had incentive to try to increase the number of trains running by investin g in wholesale track upgrades in canada via rails passe nger routes are run on the freight railroads tracks the two canadian freight railroads are allowed to charge via rail access charges that cover their full costs the canadian freight railroads receive virtually direct government financial support fo r infrastructure investment government support for operations while governments may accept the need for public support for construction of highspeed rail track one of the stated go als of railway reform has been to reduce operating subsidies if not eliminate them entirely in japan the three main island railroads are able to cover operating costs from operating revenues and do not receive ope rating subsidies from the government the shinkansen lines are generally the most financially viable in terms of covering their operating costs but the three main island railroads also operate unprofitable conventional lines significant commercia l revenue is also derived from nonrail businesses the railroads opera along side their track such as offices department stores housing and recreational facilities the three smaller island railroads have not been able to cover their operating costs due to their relatively small popula tions it was not expected that they would be able to do so they receive direct s ubsidies in the form of management stability funds these funds are intended to cover their annual operating losses in france the sncf usually roughly break s even the intention of transferring most of the accumulated debt to rff was to enable the sncf to achieve profitability the sncf achieved operating profits for the first time in 2000 however this result was primarily due to rise in ticket receipts from st ronger

base d in part on the level of subsidy they will require the immediate effect of the reform package was actually large increase in subsidy levels because the tocs were required to pay commercial rates for the use of track and rolling stock subsidy levels almost doubled from 107 billion in 19931994 prereform to 219 billion in 19961997 postreform based on bid proposals operating subsidies totaled 18 billion in 1998 and are scheduled to decline on sliding scale to 11 billion by 200327 some observers are skeptical that the tocs will achieve their promised subsidy reductions they note that their costs ar largely fixed because their user charges with railtrack and the roscos are fixed toc profitability will depend on their ability to increase ridership and reduce costs on low density rural routes it is expected that the tocs will always require subsidy payments in canada via rail still relies on government subsidy but it has shown improvement in its cost r ecovery ratio through the 1990s via rails operating revenues cover about half of its total costs operatin g subsidies have decreased from can 561 million in 1989 to can 169 million in 1999 conclusion railway restructuring is still work in progress in many countries and industry experts are tentative in reaching definitiv conclusions about the success of reforms thus far however some common th emes can be observed one observation common in most country experiences is th at railway reorganization has required substantial political and financial commitment that has to be sustained over an extended period rail reform has usually been carried out in transitional phases over several years in japan the reform plan was carried out over decade and proceeded through two successive administrations in germany rail restructuring required strong political support to amend the german constitution however as rail analysts point out the united states is also familiar with the time required for reorganizing railroad in 1976 congress created the consolidated rail co rporation conrail from six bankrupt northeast freig ht railroads over decade later in 1987 conrail was returned to the private sector when the federal government sold its ownership interest in an initial public offering those advocating ma jor overhaul of us passenger rail regulation point to elements of conrail s reorganization they believe could

system feb 7 2002 p 5 available at httpwwwamtrakreformcouncilgov rail reorganization also took mixed form s of structure and ownership depending on the country involved each country creat ed its own unique form of rail regulation reflecting political and cultural values additionally in many cases the initial reform plan had to be altered because of unforeseeable developments experts note that reform models that are flexible and straight forward are more likely to succeed than overly complex and rigid frameworks one circumstance unique to the case of passenger rail in the united states compared with japan and europe is the fact that 97 of amtraks route mileage runs on track owned and maintained by the freig ht railroads the only track amtrak owns is the northeast corridor about 730 miles of track between washington dc and boston in japan and europe in the cas of routes with c onventional track freight railroads run on track owned by the pa ssenger railways highspeed passenger service runs on dedicated track us fre ight railroads as represented by the association of american railr oads believe that high sp eed rail can only be properly run on separate dedicated track with grade crossings the freight railroads oppose having more than one entity provi ding passenger service and they oppose having amtraks right of access access rate s and operating priority transferred or franchised to multiple entities28 because us freight railroads are perhaps the most commercially viable and selfsufficient railways in the world many experts recommend that any proposals regarding mtrak should not threaten the economic health of the freight carriers another theme applicable to most rail re organizations is that the reform plan involved increasing the degree of indepe ndence of the rail entity from political influence rail policymakers appeared to equate improving the economic performance of the railroad with the need to insulate rail managers from politically directed decisionmaking political intervention in rail management decisions has also been an issue raised in the debate over amtrak among the items the amtrak reform council has listed as root cause of amtraks poor performance is political pressure29 direct susceptibility to political pressures on major and minor management decisions which provides strong incentives to make decisions that are politically expedient in the short run but financially crippling in the long run the amtrak reform and accountability act of 1997 c ontained provisions designed to enable amtrak to increase ope rating efficiency such as repealing the mandate that congress approve changes in the criteria that amtrak uses to evaluate routes and services repealing the require ment that amtrak provide rail passenger service

geographicallybased strategic business units sbus the sbus are designed to increase revenues from either corridor longhaul or regional train services amtrak has also contracted out the maintenance of acela highspeed trains in the northeast corridor as stated earlier shared goal of most restructuring plans is to increase the transparency of government financial support for railway s by eliminating cross subsidization the intent of policymakers is to make railroads more accountable amtrak has been criticized by government officials for lack of clarity in its accounting statements the dot inspector general has called on amtrak to provide more specific and detailed information on project by project basis in its yearly budget requests in recent congre ssional hearing the ig testified30 the lack of clarity and specificity in its budget request may be symptomatic of amtraks unwillingness or inability to provide detailed information for effective decision making despite recommendations by the amtrak reform council to break out financial results from train operations and owned infrastructure and our repeat ed requests for detailed financial information on its mail and express business amtrak resisted implementing financial reporting system that provided the information the absence of this important data makes it difficult to arrive at good business decisions and to pinpoint responsibility and accountability for achieving measured results another lesson apparent in the foreign expe rience that is applicable to the debate about amtrak is that regardless of the re gulatory regime adopt ed intercity passenger rail requires substantial vel of public capital funding even if exceptional routes in high density corridors are successful in becoming operationally selfsufficient they still require an external source for the enormous investment required for track infrastructure the national association of rail passengers estimates that the united states spends 328 per capita in 1999 u s dollars on mainline rail spending compared with 6766 in france 3698 in britain and 1860 in germany31 amtrak estimates that it would need 1 b illion to 15 billion in capital
