students congratulations on being chosen and on attending the first ever class viii course fantastic love from all africa and joberg staff and scientologists very good well now lets get down to business where does standard tech begin what is it it is the accumulation of those exact processes which make way between humanoid and ot the exact method of organizing them the exact method of delivering them and the exact repair of any errors made on that route now that is quite remarkable because in actual fact that gives you 100 percent its 100 percent action there are unauditable cases unless theyre not present if you cant get them present they are unauditable and that is one of the cases that is unsolvable and in actual fact the only case that is unsolvable now you can think at once what about the person who is being audited against his own determinism what about the unconscious person he is present what about the psychoanalyst you know the psychoanalyst he had lot of troubled cases and lets see mans never been able to do this sort of thing before and there are different cases and therere also suppressives and weve got the so forth and question question question and thats what im trying to cure you monkeys of impolite now in the first place as far as the case who is present is concerned if you did an assessment list and you put down reading item isnt present there wouldnt be anybody to do the assessment on so that is missing on the resistive case list but the rest of them if you cant knock off hundred percent on it why you need your flywheel adjusted the uh thats fact thats fact there isnt much excuse for missing let us take the fellow who doesnt want to be audited and he is somehow or another persuaded to be present in the auditing room now you say at once that we will overwhelm the mans determinism naturally by forcing auditing on him we dont overwhelm his determinism because basically his own determinism would want to be audited so we have the oldest remedy of this there is and it hasnt changed for years and years and years and years and it does exist and all you do is engage in itsa on how he doesnt and why he doesnt want to be audited thats all thats the remedy if you can get the fellow to explain why he doesnt want to be audited why he hates to be audited why auditing so forth bopawop wop youve got it but if you let him stray out into the other dynamics you havent got it if he sits there and tells you how all scientologists are bad and how lesson is so hard then pig face the big politician has said from the depths of his implantedness how its all bad if you let him go off into this line of country you are not following the main line and the main line is simply why doesnt he want to be audited do you follow now the other may start to blow off but you may repeat the question because hes departed from it now if you can get him to explain in the fullest extent this exact process it is an exact process it has discussion of scientology connected with it whatsoever it is simply his itsa on the subject of now he will come to point where basic begins to appear into view and you simply go on into session and run it do you follow theres nothing to it its just session approach so therefore he doesnt want to be audited and he is asked to explain why he doesnt want to be audited and he will there upon give as to the reasons why and then he will hit some basic reason why and youll find yourself running something on the order of secondary or an engram now you push him on through it you dont push him through covertly you never do any of this covertly i hear of some auditor covertly auditing ooooo if he hasnt got his hands on the cans youre liable to pass the fn and hell hold onto the cans he doesnt know what they are we dont even know he doesnt even know what hes talking about but he will guided in his itsa guide himself right down into the channel of his resistance it could wind up most anyplace it could wind up in prep check it could wind up in secondary it could wind up dont you see and hell start answering these questions and the next thing you know hes in session and feels lot better for it and hell go away shaking you by the hand now there isnt anything covert about it you keep your trs in you do your auditing job you read your meter the same way and everything else hes explaining why he doesnt want to be audited do you follow and it is the most fundamental rudiment now i i look with horror at green form which winds up as one of its items very late on the green form that the pc did not want to be audited in the first place it takes this form he didnt want review in the first place well an auditors pretty dim bulb if he hasnt been able to detect that fellow comes in and you say alright good have seat here now at that moment you pick up the first out rudiment see its actually not something you put in all rudiments because for the excellent reason it just wastes time this guy sits down and so on now you could say its missed withhold its this its that we dont care what it is its just the fact that he doesnt want to be audited so you think now were dealing with uh you think were dealing with mr swillengullet the famous politician or mr jogbog who is the famous psychoanalist and youre not youre not dealing with the stellar light youre dealing with scientologist who has walked up to the examiner having been summoned because he hasnt been auditing for the last six months to find out what the hells wrong and the examiner has said go have review and as the review auditor is sitting there this guy walks in and hes uncooperative and very soggy about the whole thing if you simply ask him to explain why he didnt want to be audited he would go promptly into session it is process alright now lets get how far this process goes fellow hasnt been auditing for seven months on his ot3 and it isnt flat so its the same process why doesnt he want to be audited you could ask it in the version of why isnt he auditing but it comes down to why he doesnt want to be audited while auditing and this situation you will run into every now and then now it flies off by accident on most of these lines you achieve this accidentally and you will see so on many case reviews and you understand standard tech isnt that process which is only used in review review is that area where standard tech is corrected back to standard tech if it hasnt been done in the first place it winds up in review now this fellow hasnt been auditing as matter of fact i have just off hand i know of about three two of whom didnt want session and third who hasnt audited on her 3 just just brrrrt just this i think thereve theyve been on my desk in the last 24 hours so it is not an uncommon problem and you accidentally hit an arc break you hit some bypassed charge you hit some something that goes down the line and clears up why he hasnt been auditing and you yourself maybe if you had long run on some level hit some period where you really didnt want to sit down and audit you sort of wanted to leave the session and so forth well this is the this is the phenomenon now the common denominator of hitting the phenomenon to trained auditor would be why he doesnt why doesnt he want to be audited if some fellows doing ot sections something like that on himself anything from r6ew on up the line and he suddenly wants to leave session yeah hes sitting there and hes saying aaiii ugh well the rudiment thats out is horribly simple rudiment he doesnt want to be audited now hes just done something that fixed it up so he didnt want to be audited now at that moment if he is notcompletely dead in his head he is aware of his own activity that is actually the fundamental difference between scientologist and humanoid scientologist can is aware of his activities his mental phenomena he is aware of his behavior he has an idea of what he is doing he hes standing there nya nya nya nya nying yang yap yap yap yap and hes all of sudden hey wait minute boy i must have missed withhold see i must have missed withhold i mean its as simple as that you know he says to himself yeah he is aware of his own behavior it is not that hes introvertedly critical and you will find characters around in scientology who are not aware of their own behavior and that is the difference between scientologist and one who isnt you will find somebody who apparently has had some of the grades run who still attributes his behavior to some sort of an act of god or something i i felt i felt i felt bad today i i feel bad today thats about far as the cognition goes see but this therefore is process youre sitting there doing your materials all of sudden you feel bad hell with it i think im gonna leave you know pack it up and get out of here well now being aware of what youre doing you all of sudden recognize this is symptom so somethings wrong well youd better find out whats wrong and whats wrong actually will show up on the basis of why he didnt want to be audited if you simply will explain to yourself thats just sort it out you know just say lets see the reason i dont want to be audited is so and so and so on now this can go so far as to make one item list that is list that is listed to one item reading you can actually make list of it if you know your phenomena youre well trained auditor i got an arc break i arc broke myself something i dont like thatll show up and go bingobongo now you take somebody its very interesting watching somebody being audited on the grades who isnt trained even in the least they eventually come up to level of awareness that something is going on but they dont have the technology to explain what is going on and they couldnt isolate bypassed charge for the life of em they cant cant isolate they they know now wait something is wrong in auditing and something is wrong with and wmf wnf wmf wnf wmf wmf and lets see oh itd be an arc break ptp what if id gone and missed withholds ive done something here he doesnt know what to call it he hasnt got the he hasnt got the subject matter at his fingertips he doesnt know what to call it so of course he cant handle it you know theres wmwmm wmm wmwsm and you will see one of these guys then suddenly moving in the direction of getting trained he knows hes got deficiency he doesnt know what to call it but it still comes under the heading of explaining why he doesnt want to be audited and all of sudden why theres long blow down and there it is now ill tell you something very funny something that is very amusing as we used to hear occasionally where some sp had been operating very well that scientologists were far far harder to audit than people in off the street yes at the level of nonstandard tech i should smell em out that is certainly true not guy in off the street he isnt hard to audit at all hes so damn stupid that he lets the auditor do anything and scientologist is only hard to audit by very lousy auditor do you follow because hes sitting there and all of sudden the fellow says uh alright start of session good now yesterday we were taking up whether or not you had overts and so on and bla bla and this scientologist sitting in the chair says well what the hell are you talking about man where where the hell are your rudiments huh you havent got this set up whats going on the fellow off the street says yeah thats logical it it i dont feel very good about it but yeah well overt that we were taking up yesterday i wonder where gracie ann is i wonder uh she said shed telephone for it yeah wed taken up overts telephone at four i wonder if shes out with bill um wawawa but thats just auditing its just life you know uhhh oh yeah very hard to audit scientologists are very hard to audit by lousy auditor thats very funny because as case supervisor you can sit there and read somebody being driven straight into propitiation just like falling piece of lead on nonstandard session and now and then you will see in case supervision my comment in folders saying well maybe we got away with it and thats because i found something nonstandard in the session and its interesting that in the last three days i have had back before for review as repeat after completed review only those cases where i read well maybe we got away with it i dont know from this folder it all seems to be or but i dont know and sure enough here week two weeks later the person in back for review hes sick at his stomach hes this hes that or hes the other thing so you can go through the actual auditing actions on an auditors report and at this point of the session he is supposed to do whatever hes supposed to do and he didnt do it and he did something else and he phrased the questions in some other odd way and then you see couple of q and as following this and then you see the ta rising and then you see indicating bypassed charge of auditing over the last floating needle or something and you read down the line on this and your case supervisor report is the auditors summary sheet and so on is glowing the pc bright toned happy at the end wanted to loan his car the propitiation has entered in to it told what marvelous auditor i was and good shape you can expect in week or two to see this person in qual with headache or sick at his stomach or something else and so your well dones are only given to those where the session ran off like clock exactly on standard tech because you know that works and theres these little divergences and little zigs and little zags that you see in the session you dont ever call those well done not because you are being pedantic not because you are being snotty and mean but because simply you know this case will probably appear before the examiner in another week or two or before the master at arms he will be in one or two of those positions despite the glowing auditor report the summary it didnt go standard so the result wont be standard now its remarkable that anybody gets away with what they get away with at all it is better than man has ever heard before has ever seen and it is quite remarkable but he is much worse off than you ordinarily assume so the net result of all of this is that when it is not standard he will have had some gain its not all bad but hell also have not achieved his full gain and the difference between some gain and the difference between that and full gain is the difference between wobblybobbly tech and very standard precise tech now standard tech rolls off with clickety clickety clickety clickety click with total invariability now what you get away with sometimes we see that the rudiments are overrun so you will see in case supervisory report if this looks poor and so on is bring the pc back to session and indicate the over listed list well that is funny thing to do the guy was perfectly happy hes going to loan the auditor his car right after the session uh and he got an fn on it and thats all set and thats all or but the proper case supervisor action is to have him brought back although is was apparently very successful and have the over listed list indicated i just did folder just few minutes before i came down here on little kid we have lot of little cadets in the sea org and theyre pretty much on the ball and this little kid i dont know how old he is uh oh i dont know seven eight something like that well an auditor actually doesnt respect the pc if hes little kid to the extent that he did and its absolutely fascinating how the misapplication of technology just hair line knocks the kid around in the first place hes being audited from too high an altitude to easily protect himself so there was an over listed list on power process it went on and on and on i cant imagine what the hell the auditor was thinking about what in the name of god was going on he had his first blow down it went bong bong he even mentions it he marked it and everything and then he went on listing you know went on listing went on listing well the kid seemed alright the proper action was to have him walk back into session and have the over listed list indicated and that did happen and the needle fnd promptly and at once very abundantly the little kid knew something was wrong and all of that was not much of review session i dont know how many minutes were consumed in doing this one action but of course to do that action why you have to fly the needle and then do the action so he also got little tiny lick and promise on rudiments and so on all of this maybe took 3 4 5 minutes something like that indicated the over listed list and got nice fn on the thing and the kid cheerfully went out of session again so you say god damn thats being picky wow the fellow had the item indicated it was alright it was the correct item just because we add eighty or ninety additional items is reason to believe or just because we added five or six additional items after the blow down on 5a is reason to be that picky oh yeah one item past the first bd on 5a is one too many items it blew down thats it now about all the lads gonna do after that is cognite and if you start asking him for more listing items youve smothered his cognition so the needle wont fly now ive got question here its what is flying needle now i never punish people for asking questions they can ask all the questions they want to because in that way i get an idea of how much theyve got to learn an fn that is real fn and so forth takes off it flies you can see it disconnect from the bank and start to function so its just colloquialism fly needle float needle fn thats all and the explanation is that if you cant obtain an fn promptly and immediately on rudiments with pc in standard tech somethings goofy theres something wrong and it usually is wrong with the session doesnt even go back into the past theres something wrong right there right now so to give you the difference this little kids needle probably was doing one of these half inch floats or something like that and when the over list was indicated why it probably went to three inch float full dial float you get the difference now you can expand the floating needle but if you start expanding floating needle with too thoroughness you get the thing expanded to half an inch and then you collapse it to quarter of an inch and then you try to fly it further and it all of sudden packs up and goes stiff known as overrun the pc came out of it and the pc went back into it again now the essence of standard tech all of these things to the contrary and merely supplementary the essence of standard tech then is to get somebody in session and one of the best ways to get person in session who wont be audited at all is to ask him to explain why he doesnt want to be audited have you got thats process now somebodys going to say whats the command its is if there was canned command for that then you would miss certain percentage of pcs you might have to ask him in bottentott you know now the person who has to have the exact words of the command is person who hasnt grasped the thing that happens when you ask the command now ill give you an example somebody who wonders at what happens with release or wonders something about how you handle an overrun or wonders and madly goes around in circles on this subject has not mastered hasnt mastered what the hell release is now if he knows what is this phenomenon of release then he can produce it he can unproduce it but supposing you were trying to fix radio but you didnt know what it did so lets give radio to the ancient egyptian physicians and say fix it now you could explain to them that you take this funny flat bladed thing and twiddlediddle it into the shiny buttons in the front of it and that comes down and you hook together the wire when it doesnt run now youve got to tell him 8000 more things you see like this wire goes to the that youre teaching him by rote he doesnt know what radio is so youve got to have all kinds of exact rote little actions do you see these rote actions by rote i mean the chinese school you know type actions youd have to have you take the flat bladed end instrument and you put it in to the vertical slot which is in that that bright steel thing there and you rotate it against the sun now youd also have to place the instrument to the south to rotate it to the sun ah boo you better tell him what radio is now if he cant dig what radio is christ almighty dont let him fix it now the mechanism of release is simply this the guy has obsessively been thinking mass he himself we know in the first place that his whole bank is mocked up by himself and nobody else at his bank but we know also that theres whole bunch of body thetans that are also mocking up banks and these body thetans are copying each others banks and mocking up banks against banks and hes mocking up banks which are copies of body thetans banks and body thetans are copying his bank and weve got the most marvelous array of counter disowned super copying that you ever heard of but this this would be very simple if there wasnt such thing as body thetan now this guy is thinking mass or hes thinking thought which keeps body thetan mass connected to him thats the exact mechanic of this and you have made him recognize thought about that thought which causes him to cease to think the thought that keeps him connected if you go on past the point where the needle floats you have now made him rethink the thought which reconnects him or makes him mock up bank or makes the body thetans who are mocking up bank reconnect to him thats the mechanism of release let him finish his cognition and give him an thats it as far as that action is concerned now you can release him on other actions which are not immediately germane to that action as long as they are very different actions now this can go so far as if you get an fn on green form in spite of the fact that youre doing remedy bs s and ds or any other thing that the green form calls for and somewhere along that line doing the action called green form which the pc recognizes as repair if while doing that action you get an fn and then knuckle headedly continue on that green form you are going to make him think in terms of repair and he will rethink the thought which reconnects him and you might as well not have done it in the first place you get the idea so he does the green form to an fn and that is that it fns he gives you his last cognition and so on now the bank will remedy will put out the bank will put out the electrical phenomenon of disconnect moment before the pc himself cognites on it the meter reads just small bit below the reality or recognition of the preclear so that you normally get this odd phenomenon of the bank releases and then the pc says it he finds out about it after you find out about it on the meter so you have to make the marvelous adjudication of when to cut his comm because you do cut his comm you must cut his comm the trouble with the auditors that you see come in at level 0 at old saint hill courses and so on you watch them on tv its the most agonizing thing you ever heard of they ask this question and this fellow answers the question and he goes on and itsas and itsas and the auditors just not there and he sits there and the pc talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and runs his havingness down and pulls in mass hes talking to him and i get hold of those guys when im training them and i said control the session well control the session i dont quite know what to do thats all session consists of starting it running it and ending it and intermediately begins with beginning handling and completing process then people wont have learned this if they dont recognize they can control session they havent found out this marvelous marvelous fact that you can control anybodys bank better than they can below the level of clear anybody exterior to the bank can control bank far better than the guy who is inside you can run him up and down the track you can run him into things and out of things and do ahh and you get up around level 4 5 ot section and so forth you can make somebody scan himself all over the time track telepathically miles away the auditor always has greater control of the pc bank than the pc does always what do you mean you cant control the session you can make the pc go wherever you want him to go what are you waiting for the auditors cause so the auditor tells him process to run and hes delivering self determinism into the hands of the pc so having started him in that fine line he lets the pc do the recognition necessary to do the disconnect from the his bank or the other persons bank the moment it disconnects his auditor has got to recognize the end of that cycle of action which is usually by the additional cognition of the pc cognition turns up usually right on the heels of the fn it starts to fn and then you hear the cognition come out and youve got to get the exact instant where you say thats it you run pc just like you drive car the auditor is not an effect point the auditor is cause point which is bringing the pc up to cause point so thats the mechanism thats the mechanism of release well what the hells the mechanism of clear well the mechanism of clear is he doesnt mock it up more he doesnt mock anything up anymore well now what happens after clear why do you go into anything after clear then if the guy well that would be great if there was just one thetan there but there isnt just one thetan there now youve got to get him on ot2 now to take enough charge off of the bank so he doesnt plow in when he hits 3 because he starts hitting these things on 3 all hes got to do is miss and the bank will go into wing ding the body thetans of the bank will go into complete spinning screaming mess all you have to do is trip the wrong incident run incident 2 before incident 1 get the pc wheeling and dealing and hell go into freewheel which could kill the pc could kill him nothing to monkey with therefore hes now handled his own state and his next action is to take enough charge with ot2 off the case so that when he starts running these body thetans the handiest most active body thetans have been discharged down to point because ot2 is part of r6 theyre theyve been sneaked down they wont freewheel as long as you run up from up from incident 1 and incident 2 if you run north of that and all of ot2 is north of that its closer to pt see so you discharge it and when you throw it into 3 he wont freewheel that is to say he doesnt automatically start going through the composite group incident of all of these body thetans do you follow there is nothing much to it it its very simple you you take the you take the jolt out of that portion of r6 with the materials of ot2 which would cause by overcharge its too charged up the composite mass of body thetans who all of sudden start freewheeling through r6 cause theyve all been in r6 on this planet the vast majority of them have and then you can do 3 and you can do 3 very safely but at the time youve done 3 remember that this character has now been plowing into body thetans and hes started to wonder whether or not he isnt mocking something up because hes got bunch of automatic pictures and theres things mocking up against these things and things things womp womp and what he starts doing then is start copying their copies theyll make copies of the physical universe and then hell copy their copies and then hell have the masses of body thetans hell make the copies of body thetan masses and hes so damned used to having there things that he feels weird without any mass in so he starts mocking up some mass lot of wild things can happen but he blows these left right and center and then you rehab him and then it all goes back quietly into place now as you move on up the lines you get to 7 you get to 8 and youre taking away any slightest faintest obsessive create that might exist and youre taking away old obsessive postulatingness and lot of other odds and ends of little mechanisms that you may not have looked too closely in the teeth that are the woof and warp and composite of the thetan now so what are your mechanisms of release and what are the mechanisms of clearing we know the individual is simply mocking it up himself well therefore its very simple all hed have to do is cognite hes mocking it up himself and hed go clear theres nothing to that yeah thats the trick man hes got to cognite on it himself you start telling him he is and thats why you dont see that cognition put out as an end product you start telling him that that is the end product and god damn ive seen several of them do it they come around and say well bla bla and bla everybody knows that im mocking it up myself yeah i know im mocking it up myself the guys mad you know blaaaa he looks like something psychiatrist put out yeah i know im mocking it up myself and you say thats good do you have any pictures and so on oh yeah lots of pictures are you mocking those up those are automatic pictures the cognition is being used as an evaluation and you could actually prep check the cognition if it goes off too badly that is if hes mocking it up himself and you prep check him anyway thatd be very very weird thing to do but it could be done you dont find very many cases in this state you find quite different theres different composite to this character he didnt find any on 3 and you break out your little violin and you say it may be so we do not know your story sounds so queer we hate like hell to doubt your word but it dont go here the truth of the matter is the person has this lifetime severe physical injury which has jammed several body thetans together so that they dont answer up they dont answer up and theyre impacted or pushed in or all one severe physical crash bang will cause an individual to find very few or none at all the remedy for it is run this lifetime engram well somebodys gonna say well why what do you tell him but if you let the guy go out of this lifetime why hes hes running engrams of his own someplace or another that hasnt anything to do with his existing situation his existing situation is very simple situation where simply lot of body thetans all think theyre one body thetan and thats the primary mistake body thetans make and the proper cure for that along with rehabs and getting in the lower grades very often you find the lower grades madly out on such cases as well as this its not always true but you very often find them very badly out and you move them up along the line you find this lifetime injuries this lifetime injuries or circumstances certainly which made engrams that pushed it all together and then then all of sudden you can run 3 run some of the phenomena of 3 you you find this quite common there is such thing as somebody with body thetans forget it it doesnt exist but you will find the lower grades are out now this kind of phenomenon can exist that doing the lower ot sections the guy blew lot of body thetans and then you can find that moment when he blew lot of body thetans actually they all took off but the common incident of body thetans is of course incident 1 the next common incident is incident 2 incident 1 is the basic but incident 2 is not necessarily true of every thetan because incident 2 doesnt isnt in the bank of those thetans who were elsewhere who were elsewhere 75 million years ago and there are few of them also there were few who were here who didnt get it and so incident 2 is not that general but its sufficiently general that sometimes requires that now incident 1 is that common incident of occurrence which tends to knit together all body thetans into the kooky idea theyre all one there is also another incident on the track which implants them to believe theyre all one and body thetans are not all one life is not all one by long way life is composed of individuals it requires certain amount of effort to stay in the time stream at this period of time of this universe now therefore the mechanisms release have to do with these factors and at the lower grades the individual is so composited that he thinks he is one individual and he very often hears little voices and so on but he doesnt let this bother him too much thats just natural and as you come up the line as you bring him up the line why he of course gets closer and closer to this phenomenon very often on the clearing course and so on people will encounter body thetans and body thetans will start to blow and you cant get into the ot sections without something happening about body thetans i dont wish to be invalidative of anybody around hearing this who didnt find any one of two things shouldve one of two things should be done in such case his earlier auditing ought to be explored for blowing lot of thetans he may have occluded this and the other one if he still isnt flying on it the other one is severe injury in this lifetime whereby the body thetans and he and the body are have in common savage physical experience of some kind or another which makes them all group and makes the group into one being those are the two actions which are taken in theory but these are the mechanisms of release and these are the mechanisms of clearing now those are the mechanisms youre handling ant those are the things youre handling and if you know those mechanisms well you can do an awful lot you dont go squirreling around on the edges of it because the thing which handles them is standard tech and there isnt much else that handles them and it handles them case after case one person right after the other it completely removes the differences between css there are different cases there are cases different than any other cases there arent peculiar cases but i can tell you this i can tell you this that person who does not come up through the grades does not hit the phenomenon he doesnt hit the release points of the upper grades if he hasnt been through the lower grades for instance if somebody didnt really go into 2 ot2 hes not likely to be able to come very close to 3 see if he didnt go clear on the clearing course why its very unlikely hell go anyplace else if he didnt do his r6ew correctly he isnt likely to go clear do you follow its tracking back tracking back question here somebody asking somebody something or other very complex question on the subject of going clear or not going clear about rehab of power after person is clear now the law is you dont rehab power after person is clear you do not do it the reason you do not do it is the person all too often falls on his head but the operative word here is whats got this person puzzled is the word clear if the person went clear on the clearing course and you rehabbed or indicated anything that was out on power or anything of that sort whatsoever he would be in trouble at once but the operative word is clear person who didnt go clear on the clearing course and didnt go release on r6ew probably has something wrong with his power and if theres nothing wrong with his power he will go release on r6ew and clear on the clearing course if he didnt go release on r6ew if he gave bunch of false attests and so forth and didnt go clear on the clearing course why then there is something wrong with his power but if his power was alright he undoubtedly went release on r6ew and undoubtedly went clear on the clearing course i mean its not question that you wouldnt puzzle much about so that if person was on the clearing course and couldnt go clear you could of course go back and rehab the power because it isnt clear you know i mean simple all of these things are very simple theyre all straight think so when youre trying to audit case that doesnt want to be audited he is stuck into some protest or resistance and you make him as is it and if you havent at that moment put him on meter you wont see the moment when it releases and go on arguing with the guy because youre liable to be incensed so it is an auditing session he will go release on the subject and be auditable and then walk himself right back into it and plow himself in again unless you see that he went fn on it so you dont ever go along on the preconceived notion this is another rule of standard tech dont continue to hold the same idea of the persons character cs must never continue to hold his concept of the pc which was formed at some other level of the pcs case and you will find that pcs get reputations well everybody who was maintaining and keeping the pcs reputations up the line doesnt believe auditing works so this pc was complete dog when he was level 0 he just managed to get squeaked by it and he would have required 18 dozen reviews and he was just having an awful time and so on and then the case supervisor gets this pc when he gets up along the line to about grade iv and he right away he will make one horrible mistake if he does not realize the persons released from that state or he wouldnt have gotten to iv so either the person was run to iv or the person was not run to iv if the person is still this kind of case and is now grade iv then god damn it nobody ever ran him up to grade iv do you follow so you do that by confirm or rehab his grades up to iv now they will either rehab or theyve got to be run and if they wont rehab then theyve got to be run elementary sometimes you start to rehab some grade like iii or something like that and the ta starts up like mad well you have to make out what the hell that was probably iii was overrun at the time the moment of release was there and now ill give you piece of stuff out of 7 in actual fact it is not standard action but what happened was is he was audited on that with his ruds out piece out of 7 is you can get the ruds in on any situation anywhere in the past thats piece out of 7 thats not standard tech in repairs but you can get the ruds in on any action of the past anytime you can put all the sessions ruds in on it now its very remarkable to see this occur because the thing will blow suddenly some former instance will blow which was resistive in the past in other words the person was living with his ruds out now the weird part of it is is the reason for it wouldnt run let us say something like that at the time it was run its now giving you rising ta and going bad and so on you know that there are still some ruds out on this case and some auditor was kidding himself someplace so what you have to do is fly the needle and you make it your business to fly the needle now you go back and try to rehabilitate iv and oddly enough itll rehabilitate most mysterious thing you ever saw actually if you noticed your own auditors reports you put ruds in prior to the time iv was run iv was run let us say in 1965 if you were running down chain of arc breaks you found one in 1959 when you found the arc break in 1959 you took it out from underneath the running of iv in 1965 you actually put some ruds in in the 1965 session so it will now run or rehabilitate if it doesnt rehabilitate you can now run it most mysterious think you ever saw in your life but you have to know this operative principle you guys go around and start running some of the odd bits i tell you out of 7 and 8 and so on youll probably get your brains blown out not by but these are very very rough levels ah but ill just give you some of the data i know where the ceiling is now exactly you see at 8 and the retrospect of what goes together from that has to do with the repair of cases the operation of the mind and so forth so i can tell you that this fellow is still stuck in having lost the battle of waterloo he was not napoleon he was the cavalry commander who ran all of that cavalry into the sunken road so that infantry could march across the top of it or something bodies in there by the ton something like this and you just cant seem to run this damned incident he hes got all these bodies stacked up there just there and so on well one of the ways of freeing the whole thing up is put his rudiments in for that day hell blow he had missed withhold from napoleon this is not procedure not procedure that is advised im just telling you what can happen so that you just getting ruds in then always follow the only procedure for getting ruds in and there is problems solutions counterproblems what are the postulates squirrel nonsense upset bleeglebloggle yik yik yik to get in ptp and missed withhold or any of those it is always continuously always forever only in standard tech that if it didnt clear you get the earlier similar one now if it didnt clear it was either an earlier similar one or there was false read you dont however ask for another earlier arc break that is real crocky thats asking the case to whole case to run on arc breaks because you havent said similar so you invite him off to the side panels that youre not trying to clear up you got an earlier arc break well thats really clown thats really clown question really clown because of course hes got an earlier arc break he actually has by actual computation enough earlier arc breaks to make the moon astronomical laboratorys computer go crazy it couldnt write the number you can always find an earlier arc break and if you dont know this principle then you will never get the ruds in so what have you got here youve got an earlier similar incident or an earlier similar arc break or you have an earlier similar ptp is there an earlier similar missed withhold always always same chain same chain pc same chain please earlier please good thank you same chain same chain same chain earlier please thank you now its either an earlier incident on the same chain or its false read somebody has said he had one when he didnt have and its continued to read so you check for false read or you check for an earlier similar one you dont always check for the false read because that would be damn bore and waste of time thats why standard tech doesnt consist of rote procedures when you put nickel in the slot then the record arm comes over and goes down zzzzzt and and then the record turns around and plays methuselah comes again you got to know what youre doing so the pc you say do you have an arc break you know do you have an arc break somebodys asking for the exact question by which you ask for an arc break im going to have him write an assortment of questions by which you ask for an arc break as system not to punish him but to show him that the principle of asking for an arc break is what were talking about not the english language the principle the principle you ask some five year old kid for an arc break who never heard of the term arc break youre liable to get read on misunderstood and then youve had it right you have to know what is this question arc break you have to be able to say upset is there an upset with communication you know or an upset with your affections for people or you got to know what youre doing so you can talk it that isnt driving you off the line of standard tech youre asking do you have an arc break and it reads and the pc looks at that moment you say has anyone ever said you had an arc break when you didnt yes ah yeah of yeah oh one time one time this auditor still he always asked for an arc break and i couldnt clear this arc break and i used to think scientology didnt work because i could never clear up this arc break and id keep telling him about the arc break and he kept auditing and never and babbaababa wooom boom i just realized that i didnt have an arc break with joe and you say good thank you we will now run grade ii your actual action is your needle is floating thank you very much we will now run ii alright now the pc said ohhh you got read on ptp huh sigh well honest to god its damn near that exaggerated how the hell i have to tell an auditor that it must be false read someplace just testifies that the auditor whos reading this kind of thing doesnt know what the hell it is its an evaluation the question is an evaluation of some time in the past somebody has said you know now the reverse happens but only once in blue moon this is once in blue moon that the reverse can happen well do you have present time problem well thats clean thats funny why well i was sitting here worrying about my wife alright on that question has anything been suppressed oh yeah well ive always had to suppress this problem and so forth its always been terrific worry to ive been suppressing it for years well good enough alright anything been suppressed thats clean alright do you have present time problem people have invalidated the fact that he had present time problem some auditor has actually gone so far as maybe to ball him out for having present time problem theres two sides of it and one is eval and one is inval so the evalinval always occurs but it has different workings you have to know evalinval well false read false read now you could actually have situation where have you never had have you ever had noread on this when you did have oh yeah lots of times you can get that reverse situation so the net result of this is is you run it back to an earlier similar similar situation you all of sudden get behind in time the zone or area where he was audited without ruds and the area will now rehab so thats why you always fly needle youve done it now after youve flown the needle on ruds what the hell are you doing trying to fly the needle on ruds if you fly kite youve flown kite if the needle is floating it is floating there isnt anything else you can do that gets it floating but youre on the subject line youre on subject line and you can float needle on any specific zone of action how is it you can fly needle on the three questions of 5a one right after the other getting it broader and broader and broader well theyre on three different primary points of thetan interest but theyre three different points of interest now lets get lets do five s and ds in row i dont care with what question and the pc collapses why its all on the same subject him being suppressed him being suppressed or suppressing somebody its on the subject of suppression and its just like asking the question has anything been suppressed getting floating needle and then saying good has anything been suppressed now what happens the exact mechanism lets look at the exact mechanism here has anything been suppressed floating needle now you say what has happened here now hes stopped thinking the thought which has kept him connected to or kept him making up certain mass now hes stopped thinking that thought for moment because hes got it gone or its in view or hes stated it and now you ask the question again you have now told him that he has not thought the thought which disconnected him so he now goes and looks for thought to think that will disconnect him and doing that he reconnects himself and the more you do this the higher the ta goes because the more mass he makes up trying to find something to find trying to make something to find something in you got it so this kind of sequence has begun so every time you overrun you put him back in to doing it again because youve invalidated that he has stopped doing it how long will person stay release personll stay released until such time as he overruns it if you cut the pcs comm what the hell is he gonna do the needle floats hes about to tell you i just remembered i killed my motherinlaw you know something like that and you he said gee i needle floats you say thats it you havent got the end of process phenomena hooked up with the floating needle hooked up with the general thing see and you know what the pc does he says duh dih ok yeah and he goes onto the the next subject but it doesnt float so well and so on and then he goes out and every friend hes got he gets rid of this thought you know funny thing in this session session i just had in there funny thing i i just said id occluded it totally i killed my motherinlaw you know occluded it and hell tell joe and bill and pete and oscar and mazie and so on and so on how often how long do you think this thing is going to stand up its gonna overrun and very quickly because you didnt let him finish the corm cycle but how long is the comm cycle well the comm cycle is as long as its necessary to immediately get rid of that exact realization and that is the exact length of the comm cycle and it is not so many inches on an auditors report and how long is that well its just as long as it lists list is list as long as it has the item on it how long is piece of string piece of string is as long as from the distance from one end to the other end and it is the middle part of the string and that is the length of the string got it well when i see as case supervisor one and one half columns of cognition after the fn i know the auditor has just about as much control over this session as he has of the evolutions of pluto see control control on the session he also has judgment with regard to finish of comm cycle also his meter reading is out also also also also so i i come down on it so the auditor who chops the comm is gonna get the fn overrun right away as soon as the session has ended and the auditor who overruns it has already overrun it and sort of invalidated it and youll see that an auditor can invite itsa one of the ways an auditor invites itsa is to be silent person says my gods i just remembered never remembered it before i never remembered it before i killed my motherinlaw what do you know god thats funny occluded the whole thing yeah i occluded the whole thing ah yeah the auditors sitting there the auditors sitting there now the pc for sure got to explain why this is important why this is cognition so the auditor didnt acknowledge it thats all and he didnt acknowledge it with his face or his voice or any other damn thing see he didnt acknowledge it and so hell get an overrun so when you see column and half after the fn explaining why it is all you know that the auditors trs are out and you look similarly you know when he cuts the pcs comm the pc has got an fn but theres statement well either the auditors admin is out or he laughter so you see the case supervisor knows all the sensitivity to the cycle of action the sensitivity to the cycle of action now youve got problem then in the administration of the process over and beyond the actual asking of auditing questions youve got the administration and you see the administration before you in the folder and was it really delivered so the case supervisor is always operating against the question mark of the auditors trs were the auditors trs good did the auditor actually give good session presence because actually bad auditor session presence can make an apparent gain not be gain the out trs didnt actually end the cycle of action they overran it or under ran it and it may be that the auditor was just too lazy to write it down or the auditor wrote it down falsely or the auditor copied his report afterwards to make it look good or something like that so as case supervisor you always have an unlimited number of very low conditions for any falsification abbreviation or otherwise on an auditing report the falsification or misrepresentation on an auditing report then becomes deathly deadly because it denies the case supervisor the information necessary to handle the case and you if you are out there case supervising and you have level grade class ii auditor something like this and this class ii auditor is busy auditing pcs in an hgc youre going to think right away that its absolutely vital that we train him up in the entirety of class viii before we let him audit anybody oh my god he ought to be strangled look how bad it is and you go over to the academy and you try to get them to teach class viii course and so forth and the guy doesnt even know the name of the subject yet hes got body of information to correct or go through or anything else hes just ignorant so you are very careful about what pcs he audits and youll find out that its quite remarkable the gains he will get and you in your case supervision can guide him right straight back onto the straight and narrow you can you can train him up so he does it now you probably need your nickel in the slot the record reaches over the arm goes over and presses this needle on and tune runs off but the best thing you do with case like this is yeah as fast as possible you get him on up through and you get him through the whole body of information on class vi course and you push him up through and you get yourself class viii but you cant in actual fact in fortnight make class viii auditors out of all these guys but you sure as hell can make it an awful deadly deadly deadly deadly deadly for him to make any false statement or any alteration on an auditors report and thats the thing which you have to teach him not the class viii course you say were very glad to have you auditing in the hgc theres only one thing you should know about auditing in the hgc this is the form of the session this is how session is written down any variation from this or any falsification of session data and so forth and youre hanged otherwise than that were friends this is the high crime this is the high crime around here because that is the one thing that case supervisor cant do too much about now he knows it has happened when his pc turns up in review and hes sick and when he turns up in big ethics order so case supervisor always watches the review requests and the ethics orders then he can judge the quality of the auditing which is being delivered and he can go back and find out those sessions which have been falsely reported now the basis of auditing the basis of auditing is this basic mechanism about the mind the key out the key out he stops making it for now he disconnects from the being who is making it for now thats release he might think it again or something like that and then hes gonna do it again he wont do it as seriously the bulk of the charge on it has gone so it wont be as serious as before but he can key in so the mechanism of key out and key in is everything youre handling up to r6ew then he has the cognition that hes making it and then you only have to worry about other things making things and then thats handled on 2 by taking charge off and then on 3 now when he finally gets around to what the think is and how come he does this in the first place and so forth youre in the zone of ot8 ot8 is the total explanation of why how come whats it all about and the beginning of the line is the beginning of the line is that they are not all built the same way some are two peanut whistle some are 44000 horsepower thetans are not all of the same strength and theyre not equal and theyre not all the same being and theres thetans who would really sweat at it to run one foot of grasshopper and other thetans that couldnt possibly scale themselves down to leaving the empire state building standing if they leaned on it different sizes for some peculiar reason what would be more peculiar is if they were all the same horsepower and the same size but the net result of all of this is is theyre all pretty strong actually when you get them to straighten out and it begins at the lowest level with the same thing that it ends with at the highest level youre auditing the same being or collection of beings except at the highest level youre starting to audit the dynamics and then you audit it back so that an individual is an individual despite the dynamics and so forth the same guy from the bird who comes in to the session and he says to you i dont want to be processed he says it with look and otherwise now thats the thought and what youre trying to do is disconnect that thought so that he can be processed so you audit him very smoothly from there on out and he doesnt think the thought again i dont want to be processed so he goes right on up through the roof very nicely and very smoothly and hes just the same as every other thetan he might have different horsepower and he may have different companions in his skull but he operates the same way and he responds to the same laws and there is difference there is difference there is definitely difference in his reactions and that is the thing basically which youre handling the guy is thinking thought which mocks up or hes mocking up something hes mocking up something and thinking thought and when you clip the thing which makes him stop doing that without at the same time stopping him on his own volition that is to say in answering the question then at that moment you get floating needle its making him think the right thought to disconnect very simple thats standard tech and it runs all the way up now you think then there are millions of ways to do that surprise surprise surprise i dont think there are fifty techniques i dont think there are fifty processes fifty would be stating it very largely i havent counted them i havent counted them the processes are the same all the way from rehab of former states of release to somebody who has never been audited straight on through to ot8 nowhere along the line is there different technology employed and it doesnt amount to fifty processes it just has different targets the targets shift the processes are differently worded the action is uniform youre doing the same thing all the way you bring him up to point of where he knows he was mocking it up and doesnt mock it up until he mocks it up and says hes mocking it up you begin at an unawareness he is totally unaware of the fact that he is mocking it up and you disconnect him from mocking it up at that moment and he isnt even aware of that he just knows he feels good and then its just up and up and up until he gets to the clearing course youve brought him up enough stair steps until he becomes aware of the fact that he is or isnt mocking it up and this time its the whole bank he says what the hell im mocking the whole thing up huh what do you know alright from that point on he is not really yet aware of the fact that there are other things around mocking it up and not being aware that other things are around mocking it up he can get into many puzzles he sometimes goes out of his head he thinks ill go pick up another body he thinks this he thinks that he thinks something else and hes liable to get into very severe trouble picking up another body because therere all kinds of things being mocked up in that body anywhere he looks somethings going to be mocked up so hes going to get into hell of puzzle unless he goes up through the remaining ot sections and then when he gets clear on up to the top and hes beautiful hes all straightened out boy is he straight wow he can steer it not too well but he can steer it and then he has to handle the the subject of think not mocking up but the subject of think what is he thinking what something happens and he thinks well thats you know its the reactive think that youre handling then but anyhow youll see that when you get to it anyway i just wanted to tell you this is the same band and it goes from the guy who doesnt even want to be audited up to the guy whos as free as bird and uses the empire state building to pick his teeth same set of processes same standard tech and we got it all and therefore i am inviting you kindly persuasively gently ferociously to use it and to understand it and not go off the edge of it into the nevernever land that connects him all up again thank you
