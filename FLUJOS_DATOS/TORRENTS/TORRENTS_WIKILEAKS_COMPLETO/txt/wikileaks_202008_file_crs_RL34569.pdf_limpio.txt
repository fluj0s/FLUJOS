indian health and safety from fy2008 through fy2013 the senate adopted samdt 5076 to s 2731 the basis for the substitute amendment to hr 5501 and samdt 5084 which amended samdt 5076 these amendments added language that requires an emergency plan to address the law enforcement water and health care needs of indian tribes and directs the expenditure of the funds for particular purposes30 critics of the 50 billion and 48 billion authorization levels argued that it would be fiscally irresponsible to spend such levels in light of us military operations in iraq and afghanistan near economic recession in the united states and questions about the absorptive capacity of recipient countries some analysts suggested that increased diseasespecific funding in the foreign operations appropriations would drain available funding from other aid priorities in developing countries such as agriculture assistance and private sector growth others opposed increased funding because they did not want to expand current pepfar activities to support additional focus countries and to fund activities not directly related to aids critics of high spending levels 29 according to congressional

countries and to extend pepfar funds to support health care infrastructure as well as to enhance nutrition and feeding programs31 for example senators who placed hold on hr 5501 and s 2731 had stated that the bills would transform targeted and accountable 15 billion dollar aids program into an unaccountable unspecified 50 billion development program32 proponents of the authorization level argued that access to hivaids prevention treatment and care for all would require greater resources as result debate among bill advocates focused on where the dollars should be spent and what priorities the increased funding should support some urged congress to consider further definition of tuberculosis authorities and targets improved coordination of tuberculosis activities with hivaids activities in areas of coinfection and strengthened reporting requirements for tuberculosis backers of the increased authorization argued that the next stage in fighting aids t uberculosis and malaria must occur alongside the strengthening of health systems they argued that these activities must be integrated with related development efforts in order to ensure the sustainability of efforts to fight the three diseases some opponents used the congressional budget offi ces cbo cost estimates to justify lower authorization funding level cbo estimated that implementing either hr 5501 or s 2731 which was the bill from which language for the senatepassed version of hr 5501 was drawn would cost 35 billion from fy2009 through fy2013 and that most of the additional amounts of authorized funding would be spent by fy2018 33 some argued that the cbo cost estimates assumed that outlays will follow historical spending patterns for existing programs and did not reflect the proposed increases in authorization levels for tuberculosis and malaria spending and for the us contribution to the global fund g9g149g152g139g138g149g561g15g138g149g138g155g146g138g561g5g152g152g155g141g146g151g138g157g152g155g561 both

announced in june 2005 and has been operational since fy2006 pmi is located at usaid some observers opposed diseasespecific approach they argued that it ignored the interconnected nature of health care challenges and in resourcepoor countries it would create competition for limited human capacity such as doctors public health specialists and us program managers supporters believed pmi would focus attention on malaria which is major killer in subsaharan africa and some parts of asia others contended that directed efforts on specific diseases should occur simultaneously with efforts to build health capacity and infrastructure while they applauded the initial emphasis on hivaids which helped to build health system capacity in resourcepoor settings observers contended that the next stage of disease res ponse under pepfar should integrate efforts to combat hivaids with the provision of basic healthcare and the prevention of childhood illness some urged congress to consider questions relate d to the establishment of pmi including how pmi should coordinate its activities with pepfar the further definition of authorities over the three diseases in the leadership act the possibility of competing priorities between pmi and pepfar especially where they operate in the sa focus countries and the implications of different initiative timetables for strategic planning

representative luis fortuño introduced hr 848 bill to amend the state department basic authorities act of 1956 to authorize assistance to combat hivaids in certain countries in the caribbean the bill would add antigua and barbuda the bahamas barbados belize dominica grenada jamaica montserrat saint kitts and nevis saint vincent and the grenadines saint lucia suriname trinidad and tobago and the dominican republic to the list of focus countries when introduced hr 5501 proposed adding vietnam as focus country as well as those countries listed in hr 848 representative betty mccollum proposed adding malawi swaziland and lesotho to the list of focus countries in hr 5501 through hamdt 975 which was adopted while the housepassed version of hr 5501 would have added these additional focus countries the senate version proposed adding only vietnam as focus country vietnam has been focus country in practice since 2004 at the direction of president bush this language would have updated the list of 14 focus countries that was included in the leadership act the new language in the senatepassed version also specified that in designating additional focus countries priority shall be given to those countries in which there is high prevalence of hiv or risk of significantly increasing incidence of hiv within the general population and inadequate financial means within the country some observers questioned why the abovenamed countries were selected particularly since ogac did not put forth these countries for consideration proponents of the addition of these new focus countries argued that the designation would direct more hivaids funding to these areas debate about the focus countries list also centered on how authorized funds in excess of the presidents 30 billion pepfar reauthorization proposal would be distributed across pepfar countries it was not clear whether the proposed newlydesignated focus countries would have received more support than they did previously or whether they would have been funded at higher levels than nonfocus countries for hivaids activities some would have liked the final reauthorization bill to clarify this issue

rates of new infectionshave been growing in east asia and oceania while incidence rates appeared to have stabilized in the caribbean they also argued that prevalence ratesthe percentages of given populations that are infected with hivaidshave been growing in eastern europe and central asia while prevalence rates in the caribbean appeared to have stabilized and in some countries have even declined35 as new infections worldwide continued to outpace the numbers of infected persons placed on treatment others asserted that more complex analysis of need should be used in naming focus countries still others argued that focus countries should longer be used to apportion funding and that distribution of funds should be based on country needs and recipient countries access to other funding sources for hivaids programs g5g152g150g153g138g140g157g156g561g160g146g157g145g561g20g142g140g146g153g146g142g151g157g561g5g152g158g151g157g155g146g142g156g561 some observers expressed concern about the l ongterm commitment that pepfar may require particularly in the focus countries as an alternative to adding focus countries some suggested using compacts between the us government and pepfarrecipient governments to clearly outline the scope and terms of us involvement in aids prevention treatment and care and to elicit recipient government involvement ownership and investment supporters asserted that compacts may have been helpful in outlining expectations for broader development efforts and investments that have been shown to have significant impact on health some compacts for example might have included an agreement that aid recipient countries would reform property laws and inheritance laws such reforms have been shown to reduce the vulnerability of widows and orphans to hiv infection by providing them with greater financial security 36 the senate passed version of hr 5501 supported this idea stating that compacts and framework agreements were one mechanism to promote the transition from an emergency to public health and development approach to hivaids and could be tailored to local circumstances to promote host government commitment to deeper integration of hivaids services into health systems contribute to the health systems overall and enhance sustainability 37 the language required that costsharing assurances from pepfarrecipient governments and transition strategies be included in compacts the housepassed version of hr 5501 did not include similar language

directives of 20 for hiv prevention activities 15 for hivaids care activities and 10 for orphans and vulnerable children ovc activities but it did not include the spending directive for hivaids treatment the senatepassed version ma intained the spending directive for ovc and modified the spending directives for treatment and care by requiring that over half of bilateral hivaids assistance be spent on treatment care and nutritional and food support for hivaidsinfected people it did not include th funding distribution guidelines and spending directives for hivaids prevention both versions

justify any decision to spend less than 50 of prevention funds on behavioral change programs including abstinence and be faithful activities in any pepfar recipient country with generalized epidemic there was considerable debate about the effectiveness of congressional spending directives some observed that the spending directives limited focus country teams ability to tailor budgets to local hiv transmission patterns38 critics contended that the spending directives also complicated efforts to address the specific nature of the hivaids epidemic in each country hivaids rates among the focus countries ranged from 1 to over 33 the current and proposed focus countries had epidemics that varied in nature and prevalance some epidemics were concentrated among drug users or prostitutes while others were spread throughout the population some argued that congress might consider eliminating some or all prevention treatment and care spending directives to promote operational planning that was responsive to the nature of the epidemic in each country and reflected the cost of implementation in that area the government accountability office gao found that the spending restrictions did not account for the costs of particular hivaids activities that may vary from country to country or for changes in costs over time 39 some encouraged congress to maintain its spendi ng directives particularly those related to orphans and vulnerable children ovc supporters cited gao report that stated that without the spending directive programs for ovc might not have been protected 40 others stressed the importance of the spending directive that requires at least 55 of hivaids funds be spent on hivaids treatment to maintaining support for the purchase and distribution of antiretroviral

that one alternative to spending directives was to allow us staff in pepfar focus countries to set annual program objectives for prevention treatment and care that in turn would be added up to become the fiveyear country prevention treatment and care objectives these then would have been totaled across countries to calculate the us global program objectives for these program areas at the time of consideration of hr 5501 ogac determined five year country prevention treatment and care goals for the 15 focus countries and then us staff in pepfar focus countries set annual program objectives with the goal of reaching fi veyear country goals but with consideration for the challenges of the countrys hivaids ep idemic ogac then calculated global program objectives by adding up the fiveyear country targets44 some supporters of program targets being determined entirely by us staff in pepfar focus countries contended that country teams have the greatest awareness of each countrys needs and should establish prevention treatment and care targets however some pepfar country team members expressed concern about difficulties country teams might face in reaching consensus about such targets45 critics of program targets being determined this way asserted that congress could specify global targets as way of guiding policy implementation and priorities without hampering the ability of countrybased teams to respond flexibly to incountry realities and to coordinate with national health plans they pointed to language in both versions of hr 5501 as examples both bills proposed establishing target for prevention of mother to child hiv transmission pmtct activities that at least 80 of pregnant women would be reached in affected countries by 2013 46 the senate version also proposed setting target that the proportion of children receiving care and treatment would be proportionate to their numbers within the population of hivinfected individuals in each country by 2013 while the housepassed version of hr 5501 proposed setting target requiring that by 2013 up to 15 of those receiving treatment and care must be children

spending directives and program targets was closely related to debate about how to prioritize or balance hivaids prevention treatment and care activities some experts maintained that prevention should remain focus of global efforts because there is cure for aids at this time and preventing new infections is the only way to stop the epidemic in the long term in 2001 the general assembly adopted the declaration of commitment on hivaids which stated that prevention must be the mainstay of our response 47 some organizations such as the bill and melinda gates foundation nd the global aids prevention

epidemics and to prevent millions of new infections48 on the other hand some contended that focusing on prevention and neglecting treatment and care would ignore the economic and social impacts of the disease on those already infected on the children and families of infected persons and on countries with high prevalence rates some asserted that treatment and care were investments in hope and stability preventing children from being orphaned and people from suffering the ravages of the disease when treatment to prolong life and improve its quality is available some argued that treatment costs were dropping very rapidly for not only firstline treatment regimens but also secondline antiretroviral therapies trend that was expected to continue as treatmen t expanded to cover more infected people in low and middle income countries and as more international donors negotiated for lower prices 49 others maintained that combating hivaids required combination of prevention treatment

care system in those countries this included collaboration with us postsecondary educational institutions including historically black colleges and universities57 the senatepassed version included similar language the senate version of hr 5501 also proposed requiring the us strategy to combat global aids to situate united states efforts to combat hivaids tuberculosis and malaria within the broader united states global health and development agenda establishing roadmap to link investments in specific disease programs to the broader goals of strengthening health systems and infrastructure and to integrate and coordinate hivaids tuberculosis or malaria programs with other health or development programs as appropriate this language required greater strategic planning across us global health and development programs to coordinate efforts across program areas some health experts were concerned about the single disease approach to global health and how it focused limited resources in high burden countries on one disease while they contended the overall health infrastructure and workforces in resourcepoor countries minimally improved some also were concerned about the possible long term implications of the increased funding levels if the funds were spent on treatment and care of individuals who are infected with aids one study pointed out that treatment of infected individuals is lifelong commitment and that treatment itself prolongs that length of time it estimated that if scaleup of treatment continued at the historical rate since fy2004 and drug prices and treatment costs remained the same maintenance of treatment funding levels would necessitate either 20 increase in total us overseas development assistance by fy2016 or reallocation of 20 of the current overseas development assistance budget of 23 billion to aids treatment funding alone it argued this might raise questions about how funding for other global health programs and development efforts might be adversely affected 58 supporters of language that addressed issues of coordination of us global health and development programs with diseasespecific initiatives like pepfar and pmi argued that the more comprehensive development of health infrastructure and training of health workforces in these areas would increase the effectiveness of pepfar and other singledisease programs and decrease the need for diseasespecific efforts in the future by building local capacity to address disease and basic health critics argued that ch investment was outside the scope of pepfar and would distract from the programs focus on hivaids g10g11g24g550g3g11g6g21g561g3g140g157g146g159g146g157g146g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g16g158g157g155g146g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g156g561 both
