software intersects several other issues including but not limited to the development of homeland security and egovernment initiatives improving government information technology management practices strengthening comput er security and protecting intellectual property rights currently the debate over open source software often revolves primarily around information security and intellectual property rights however issues related to cost and quality are often raised as well open source software refers to comput er program whose source code or programming instructions is made available to the gene ral public to be improved or modified as the user wishes some examples of open source software include the linux operating system and apache web server software in contrast closed source or proprietary programs are those whose source code is not made available and can only be altered by the softwa re manufacturer in the case of closed source software updates to program are usually distributed in the form of patch or as new version of the program that the user can install but not alter some examples of closed source software include micros oft word and corel wordperfect the majority of software produc ts most commonly used such as operating systems word processing programs nd databases are closed source programs for proponents open source software is often viewed as means to reduce an organizations dependence on the softwa re products of few companies while possibly improving the security and stability of ones computing infrastructure for critics open source software is often viewed as threat to intellectual property rights with unproven cost and quality benefits so far there ppear to be systematic analyses available that have conclusively compared closed source to open source software on the issue of security in prac tice computer security is highly dependent on how an application is configured maintained and monitored similarly the costs of implementing an open source solution ar dependent upon factors such as the cost of acquiring the hardwaresof tware investments in traini ng for it personnel and end users maintenance and support costs and the resources re quired to convert data and applications to work in the new com puting environment consequently some computer experts suggest that it is not po ssible to conclude th at either open source or closed source software is inherently more secure or more cost efficient at this time there appears to be centralized accounting of open source software throughout the fe deral government howeve r the growing emphasis on improved information security and critical infrastructure protection overall will likely be an influential factor in future decisions to implement open source solutions the rapidly changing computer environment may also foster the use of combination of open source and closed source applications rather than creating need to choose one option at the exclusion

majority of software products most commonly used such as operating systems word processing prog rams and databases are closed source programs although open source software has been attracting renewed attention recently its origins date back to the development of arpanet in the late 1960s during this time the individuals and universities that composed the small network of programmers often worked collaboratively sharing source code as means to build their knowledge base5 more recently open source software has been seen by some observers as an alternative to the influence of few large software

the more we ll known open source programs is linux an operating system developed in the 1990s by linus torvalds finnish programmer now working for an information technology company in the united states while linux holds small share of the operating system market compared to microsoft windows and is not widely used in the federal government some agencies have begun trial demonstrations in limited settings6 for example the national security agency has been working with volunteer programmers to create new version of linux called securityenhanced linux seli nux in an attempt to develop tools and applications that could be used to impr ove the security of government computer systems7 leading organizations in the open source software community although the open source software community is loosely organized two primary organizations are identified as leaders in advocating standards and definitions one is the free software foundation fsf founded in 1985 and dedicated to promoting computer users right to use study copy modify and redistribute computer programs8 by free software fsf means that the user should be allowed to alter improve andor redistribute version of software program either gratis or for fee using this interpretation fsf does not suggest that software should necessarily be costfr ee the second major organization is the open source initiative osi9

12although sometimes used as derogatory term by critics of proprietary software the philosophy behind the concept of security through obscurity is that security is enhanced if flaws are hidden from view and not publicized until solution can be made available 13a trojan horse program is destructive so ftware program that appears as benign application one example is program that is described as an

practi ces strengthening computer security and protecting inte llectual property rights cu rrently the debate over open source software often revol ves primarily around security and intellectual property rights however issues related to cost and quality are often raised as well information security some critics of open source software suggest that it is less secure than proprietary or closed source software becau it allows potential hacker to search the source code to discover and exploit fl aws some observers suggest that the security through obscurity principle that accompanies closed source software enhances security by making it more diffi cult for potential flaws to be discovered and exploited12 concerns have also been raised regarding the possibility of trojan horse programs13 being introduced into computing environment through the downloading and use of open source software whose provenance may not be entirely clear in contrast advocates for open source so ftware suggest that it may be less prone to security flaws due to the peerreview nature of open source software development this allows the source code to be scrutinized simultaneously by wide audience of individuals who bring different perspectives and may test the software under variety of conditions supporters of open source soft ware suggest this approach can generate faster response to security problems and minimize the potential of trojan horse programs14 so far there appear to be systematic analyses available that have conclusively compared closed source to open source softwa re on the issue of security in practice computer security is highly dependent on how the user andor administrator configures maintains and monitors the application consequently some computer security experts

the ability to make changes to the source code 17there are many open source licenses currently in use some are more general in nature designed to be easily adopted by anyone veloping open source software while others are more specific created by particular company or organization collection of some of the most well known licenses can be found at httpwwwopensourceorglicenses 18for more complete explanation of this concept see http wwwgnuorgli censesgplfaqhtmlgplinproprietarysystem 19in this example the editor program could be one that executes text commands to complete tasks while the shell program provides gr aphical interface with menus to allow the user to complete these same tasks without knowin g the text commands so the editor program could be closed source program used by people with strong knowledge of text commands the shell program could be an open source program developed later to help less knowledgeable users to complete the same task s the editor can work independently of the shell and as such the editor can be distribut ed with the shell prog ram without having its source code included source software is inherently more secure15 however this viewpoint may change as additional research is carried out intellectual property rights the implications of open source software for intellectual property rights continue to evolve while open source software gene rally provides users with greater freedoms than closed source software16 open source software is usually distributed with some form of licensing agreement17 that details the conditions under which user may use make changes and redistribute the source code critics argue that open source software threatens intellectual property rights because any software that incorporates open source code must be freel redistributed at cost while one of the underlying principles of open source software is the unrestricted redistribu tion of source code distinction is made between software that incorporates open source code into its program and programs that work with open source software for example the general public license gpl drafted by the free software foundation is one open source agreement the gpl requires that entitie s using open source code must upon further distributing that code or subsequent modifi cations of that code either provide copy of the source code or offer to give any thir d party copy of the source code however the gpl allows user to include an open source program with closed source program without providing the source code for the closed source program provided the two programs are functionally separate18 such as in the case of an editor program that works with shell program19 in contrast to the concerns raised regarding the potential threats to intellectual property rights some observers suggest that the increased use of patents as compared to copyrights or trade secrets by tec hnology companies to protect online business methods such as oneclick shopping customer referral affiliate programs and buyer driven ecommerce could hinder the futu re development of open source softwarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31627crs5 20a service pack is an

flaws eweek 30 september 2002 http wwweweekcomar ticle2 0395956222600asp 22in recent years as interest in open source software has become more widespread some software vendors have begun to sell commercia l versions of popular open source programs such as linux which can include access to vendor provided support and service two examples of such companies include red hat httpwwwredhatcom and the sco group formerly known as caldera international httpwwwscocom under this scenario technology companies could choose to license patented business methods and technologies only to organiza tions for use in clos ed source software this in turn could affect the type of soft ware that could effec tively be developed as an open source product as compared to closed source product quality related to the issue of security some supporters of open source software argue that the potentially large number of progra mmers contributing to the development of an open source program can contribute to higher quality produc t with fewer bugs because it is more likely an error will be discovered before it b ecomes major problem in addition some observers suggest that open source organizations generally react quickly when problem is discovered and use small software patches to fix specific problem potentially limiting unanticipated side effects these observers contrast this approach with that of software companies who may wish to wait and release multiple patches together in single service pack20 while the use of service packs can be more convenient and efficient than having to inst all numerous patches individually service packs can sometimes cause new problems due to the simultaneous introduction of several unc oordinated changes to the software program21 in contrast some critics c ite the lack of formal ve ndor or technical support for open source software that is not commercia lly distributed since open source software is developed by community of users it often does not have dedicated technical support team that will respond to troubleshoo ting inquiries on fixed schedule where company or agency relies on the proper f unctioning of the software to carry out mission critical tasks vendor support can play an important role in the event of mishap related to the technical support c oncerns some observers suggest that open source software is not as reliable as th closed source or commercial alternatives because there is identifiable company or organization whose profits andor reputation is dependent upon the prope r functioning of the software22 s w i t h security there does not seem to be any conclusive study comparing quality moreover with both types of software continually evolving and quality being somewhat subjective measure firm conclusi on may be possible cost the costs associated with using open source software compared to proprietary software is dependent upon num ber of factors including the cost of acquiring thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31627crs6 23 while many open source software programs can be acquired for free commercially distributed versions of these progra ms are also sometimes available 24presidents information technology advisory committee panel on open source continuednecessary hardware and software23 investments in training for information technology personnel and end users ma intenance and support costs and the resources required to convert data and appli cations to work in the new computing environment calculating these costs also referred to as the total cost of ownership tco is unique to each organization and application some observers suggest that by utiliz ing the community of unpaid programmers and users that grows around particular pr oduct open source software carries lower costs than closed source software by pot entially decreasing the number of inhouse information technology professionals n eeded to support the software and by eliminating the need for costly service contracts offered by proprietary software developers the availability of community support may also offer the flexibility of allowing the adopting organization to decide if and when it will upgrade to new version of particular soft ware program in contrast commercial software vendors usually discontinue support of older programs some time after new versions are introduced which leaves organizations to d ecide whether or not to continue using unsupported software or to incur the cost s of upgrading to new version on the other hand organizations that dopt open source software in part due to the ability to customize the software for their particular needs will still need to either maintain an adequate level of internal information technology personnel or outsource these responsibilities on contract basis similarly many of the most popularly used programs in business and government such as word processing spreadsheets databases and email are signed to work with particular operating system such as windows so if an organization decides to switch to an alternative operating system such as linux it may also have to adopt other new programs requiring additional employee training and support implications for government use of open source software although there is increasing interest in federal government use of open source software the extent to which the use of these applications will continue to grow remains to be seen in an october 2000 re port on the use of open source software for high performance computing the presid ents information technology advisory committee pitac recommended that the fe deral government should aggressively encourage the development of open source so ftware for high end computing the report also recommended that the federal government examine its procurement processes as they relate to open source soft ware in addition the report suggested that there was need to analyze open source licensing agreements with an ultimate goal of agreeing upon single common licensi ng agreement for open source software applications24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31627crs7 24continued software for high end computing october 2000

circumstances these include assessing the size talent and organization of the supporting community examining the market demand for the open source product in questi on conducting riskbenefit analysis and comparing the long term costs of available options25 in an october 2002 mitre report on the use of open source software in the department of defense dod concluded that free and ope n source software plays more critical role in the dod than has generally been recognized it identified 115 open source applications and 251 examples of their use within the dod the report stated that open source software plays an especially significant role in the areas of infrastructure support softwa re development security and research the reports authors made three reco mmendation regarding dod po licies toward open source software they included creating generally recognized as safe open source software list as it regards information security and reliability developing generic infrastructure development security and re search policies to promote the broader and effective use of open source software and encouraging the use of open source software to promote product diversity to reduce the dependence on single software product26 in addition to defenserela ted purposes it has been wi dely reported that other agencies making some use of open source applications include national

data intensive applications for homeland security and egovernment will likely be an influential factor in future decisions on implementing open source solutions the rapidly changing computer

buyer of information technology products and services in the world the choices made by the federal government could have larger impact on th future growth or decline of open source software overall30 use of open source software by other governments the use of open source software by government agencies is growing issue in other countries as well in some countries governments have been taking an active role in encouraging the growth of open source software such initiatives have included proposals to either require the considera tion or even mandate the purchase of open source software solutions for government t echnology projects the rationale for such proposals can vary widely in some count ries open source softwa re is seen as an inexpensive alternative for promoting it projects on limited budgets for example in brazil president luiz inacio lula da silvas administration has suggested that the licensing fees associated with proprietary software are unsustainable economically for its government to develop its technolog ical infrastructure wh ile also dedicating resources to improve its economic situation31 in thailand the government supported the development of linux tle thailanguag version of linux as part of its effort to increase citizen ownership of peoples notebook computers32 in other cases pro open source software policies are viewed as means to promote the development of domestic software industry and reduce dependence on foreign companies for both economic and national security reasons for example in september 2003 the governments of china south korea
