meter data instant reads shsbc 148 renumbered 162 part i lecture given on 24 may 1962 based on the modern level zero cassettes it was not not included in the older preclearsound cassettes and has not been checked against older versions thank you well im glad to be in your midst actually i enjoy lecturing to you i do and last night enjoyed giving session i thought that was the most you know you saw lay couple of eggs with this pc here earlier you know and remember the earlier sessions were not particularly productive of any vast gain pc didnt go downhill or anything and last night why you see i just got the idea that id better show you how to do some fishing and fumbling and you might not have noticed what it did it might have been all something or other all i did was let the meter wave until it ticked and i just steered the pc on to double tick i just set out to clean up dirty needle and actually in that hour made stage of cleaning it up and we got some of the stuff cleaned off it and what do you know it was right on his goal line you dont mind my mentioning it it was right on his goal line and everything was fine and you notice i didnt go out of this lifetime i didnt even go back into his childhood nothing i held him securely anchored in the last three years remember see that well thats steering the pc thats just fish and fumble you can clear up some of the most remarkable things particularly if youre aided and assisted by the fact that the pc has meter pattern to start with but there was something very tricky last night that you might have missed and that was just this and nothing more was the handling of the stuck picture pc has stuck picture pc complains about stuck picture you find session in which picture was first found get the missed withhold off of that session see dont you go running that engram because its stuck picture so obviously it wont run well enough of that im going to talk about the meter now whats the date 25th audience 24th fourth audience 24th well what are you doing in the 24th i was in the 25th well ill come back to the 24th all right its the first lecture saint hill special briefing course 24th may 62 we have lecture about the emeter once there was cat and he went sniffing along corridors in the open cracks below auditingroom doors heh heh heh and after being baffled for very long time he became very wise cat and out of all this we have single plea use the emeter i know that seems like lot to ask but if you use it itll treat you right and if you misuse it wrong once again we have complete breakdown in progress that occurred here in september of 1961 whereby everybody fashionably was reading the emeter crosseyed with the rudiments wildly out and everybody was plowing into the ground and we have come again into that particular period now till recently i have talked to you scoldishly and ive said why dont you make your pcs look good remember well ill tell you your pcs dont look good because youre not reading an emeter thats all its gross auditing error simple factual horrible to contemplate but true it isnt the way you are holding your little finger in session it isnt the fact that your thumb is insufficiently callused on the tone arm it isnt any one of thousand things it isnt because you dont have command of model session it isnt because of something weird or wonderful in the pc its just that youre not reading an emeter thats all now that sounds horrible but i dont think this applies to all of you it couldnt but it must apply in some degree to all of you because i dont see anybody listening to this lecture three feet off his chair today all you have to do is just exactly what you have to do you dont have to do anything fancy and that is very very rough thing to get through to you we actually are there as far as technology is concerned been there for some time but been improving improving improving little bits little bits little bits but do you know i dont know thing today that you could audit on somebody that wouldnt produce remarkable gain see i dont know anything were using that wouldnt produce remarkable gain on the pc and i caught you out this way i audit pc with exactly what youre using he shines you audit pc and i get an instructor to check it and your rudiments are all out how could your rudiments be out it isnt that youre not asking the exact proper question oh youre asking the right question but the needle goes over hits the pin bends blue smoke comes out of the meter connection the sensitivity knob becomes incandescent and you say thats clear and go on to the next question and thats all thats happening honest honest i plead with you now i know you think you arent doing it but fred was telling in the break up there he says you know he said i had to practice quite while in practical and ive suddenly realized i was just not seeing instant reads and all of sudden i started to see them there is some kind of an oddball phenomenon that goes this way your eyesight shuts off thats the only way i can explain it now what shuts off your ruddy eyesight what shuts it off so i had to ask myself this embarrassing question did we know what made an auditor turn off when he turned the meter on do we know that and up till last night we didnt so i had to figure out what happened well of course i had the data but i had to assemble it and so i can give you this cheerful information you can stop looking as though i have just beaten you because i havent just beaten you you see if i hadnt confidence in you why i wouldnt even try but few weeks ago i took look at you all and i realized that the gray sunken cheek the thick and muddy eye the dragging of oneself up the stairs was not being caused by your late hours or lack of food or anything else but must somehow or another be caused by the auditing and i started on campaign at that time to locate what was wrong now actually i wasnt trying to look for anything i was just looking to see what was there this is always good idea when you are looking for something dont make up your mind like the psychologist that you know the something you are looking for before you look its very remarkable you can look across whole beach of white pebbles for white pebble dont you see and never find one if youve already specified that in order to find white pebble it has to be black you see or something odd like this the thing to do is just to go down to the beach and look and not even look for white pebble just look and see whats there thats always very good in research the ford foundation i think its 100 million dollars month i think thats the value of the research as done by the ford foundation about 100 million dollars oh well thats an exaggeration its actually 100 million dollars worth minute because of course they get place if the ford foundations research along these various lines was to be chalked up in value why it couldnt be you see because they havent gotten anyplace actually the ford foundation was founded at the exactly the same day did you know this of the first hubbard dianetic research foundation for exactly the same purposes to discover the basics of human life and the mind its fascinating and there they are and its cost them since that time several billion dollars and they recently few years ago just after they investigated hasi in phoenix arizona they sent representative down and he gave report of some kind or another they wrote letter to an enquirer that they had ceased to investigate in that particular field now out of that we didnt know quite what to imply but we whipped them but the idea is that fantastic sums can be spent in research by taking records and compiling records and comparing records to records and the next thing when you get through youve got some records they make nice bonfires you can toast weenies over them but to date this type of research which does all the lookingness on via through symbols you know were going to mathematically compute it all see weve got white tree in front of us so were going to mathematically compute as to whether or not white tree can exist and then we figure out that it cant and we walk away see and thats very commonly the fate of research who was it hegel or hume or hegel i think it was it was some such bird somebody or other had up and looked through telescope and had found the eighth or ninth planet or eighth planet thats it and somebody like hegel i think it was said couldnt exist because the perfect number was seven and for several years nobody would admit that it existed all they had to do was train telescope on it but it couldnt exist because the perfect number was seven therefore there couldnt be more than seven planets in this system thats whats known as looking at the figures you see not looking at anything else so all of this kind of thing i start narrowing it down now the first observation was you didnt glow see im always looking and this one i found see you didnt glow that was obviously fact there was nobody glowing to prove it youre in the basement arent you here were still using coal see thats enough see proves itself doesnt it so if you want some mathematical computation to go along with it ill just throw that one in you see so from that i made couple of assignments not necessarily sneakily i really did just make these assignments you see and the assignments i made was 1 i gave an auditor list of questions prepcheck questions to be cleaned on pc and i gave another auditor list of questions that had already been asked to check over whether or not they were live the best way to repair case you see on prepcheck is to pick up all the questions left alive and clean them thats the best thing to do hohoho hohoho i also got some rudiments checked by your auditing supervisor and i was coordinating tone arm against out rudiments and one of the earlier discoveries on this when the rudiment is out the tone arm she dont move important fact thats new fact if the rudiments are out tone arm action that applies to anything all right i went ahead then and you saw the results last night of one of these people i checked out this is not necessarily derogatory to the auditors who did this theres point in you going out and blowing your brains out because well just have to pick you up in the next life and clear you again see nobody is being condemnatory on this particular line but it is indicative of something and the thing its indicative of is somebody wasnt reading the meter because im absolutely sure absolutely sure that the auditor checked those questions but they didnt read right something something see now further discovery of this i find out that the auditor believed the meter did not react and that there was some belief present that tr 1 must be out that the auditor isnt delivering the question hard enough you see to the pc or hasnt enough control over the pc to make the meter register see that could enter in you see and lot of other things you can explain this dozen ways i actually dont buy any of that i think the meter reacted and it wasnt observed that was just as simple as that lets take the gross auditing error just as gross auditing error not lot of mathematical figurefigure over alongside of the thing lets not try to figure out why particularly on that basis lets not say the meter didnt operate and the pc didnt operate because look this has been several widely scattered pcs which picked up immediately afterwards one of them by an instructor he could cheerfully strangle the pc could that instructor couldnt possibly have anything with that pc but an arc break and every single one of them reacted but we cant attribute it to some other mechanism except just this he was alookin at the meter and the meter wobbled the needle went bap and the auditor didnt do thing about it the auditor didnt see it thats the only available explanation because other people hostile to the pc in the pcs estimation found the meter operating for them do you think its easy to sit up in front of that tv camera it isnt man not for pc not easy at all takes quite bit as an auditor to hold him in and you saw those questions falling off the pin but those questions had just been checked over and some statement was made that they were mostly clear now afterwards we found out although theyd been stated mostly clear at first the auditor said that not all of them were however there was one there that the auditor had said was clear that was not clear on my test see well that wipes it out the things were reacting in other words in other words something was happening with the meter and it was not observed and listen to you see crossing this bridge right now youre going to cross this bridge hm theres hardly one here that isnt going to cross this bridge sooner or later youre going to stand there speechless whether in the hgc or an academy or with somebody whos helping you out as an auditor or something of the sort i dont care where its going to be youre going to cross this same barrier and youre going to say mrs glutz is not doing better did you notice the blood dripping out of both her eyes when she left the session today and the auditor will say whether student or staff auditor or whoever itll be see will say well yes but shes just very difficult pc shes very difficult and if you dont know what to do at that point you yourself will go figure it all out mathematically the thing to do is to get ahold of the pc and take look at the pc thats your first thing and the pc isnt better see thats good enough with modern processes the pc isnt better the pc does not look better therefore somebody isnt reading the meter bing bing something you wait youll be on this hot seat and youll get mrs glutz and youll put her down in chair and you will hand her the cans and you will say well now lets see now now let see you just had session now in that session did you tell any halftruth untruth tone arm action did you try to impress the auditor did you try to damage anyone theres sense going on checking it because the tone arm is now at 70 and youll turn around to this auditor and you will say hey mike hey hey hey bud what the hell what goes on hell say well they were all in when she left the session and you you idiot may fall for it and youre liable to say but then what might it have been might it be that his tr 1 is bad or actually that the pc is so arc broke that it doesnt read on the meter for that auditor or is it the fact that they were clear at that moment for him but not for or do they have mutual withholds between themselves which are then coming out because i am checking you know you can just figure yourself crazy now this is the one you want to figure the meter wobbled and the auditor was looking out the window dont figure it any other way because if you do figure it any other way you will miss its cure thing to cure is not necessarily the auditors eyesight how can an auditor get in that condition by invalidating the meter of course an auditor can go stoneblind on meter now how does this come about the auditor is audited by an auditor who is stoneblind just exactly how do we get this chain reaction see hes sitting there early in his career minding his own business and his auditor says to hiin do you have present time problem and he thinks oh my god if i dont pay the rent by two oclock im going to be thrown out you see and he can just feel this thing seethe you know and the other auditor the auditor whos across from him says thank you thats clear huh he says you know that says that didnt register you understand he couldnt see the dial so he doesnt know whether it doesnt register or not he makes the assumption that it didnt register didnt register see feels like present time problem to i guess the emeter is well all right and ill just he just kind of suppresses it and goes through the session gritting his teeth next session the night before see he was on drinking bout with this guys girlfriend see or something like that whatever it was it doesnt matter since the last session have you done anything or something like this that youre withholding see oh boy he says man when he gets this i dont khow whether i can get this withhold off or not think ohooooor i can just imagine him going out and buying sound truck and driving up and down the streets you see with this particular withhold because thats what they always do with hot withholds you see well therefore at time will i you know but if i sit here real quietly and dont breathe at this moment as he asks the question be all right and the auditor looks at him and says thats clear and the guy says whooh boy that was lucky man whooh got away with that and this happens often enough to point where guy gets the idea that meters dont read see all it requires is for one auditor auditing another auditor to make one error be looking elsewhere when the meter bangs just requires one of these and you start this chain going you think the meter didnt read and this is very invalidative to the meter you think meters dont read thats where that comes in well of course that happens while youre in session and youre kind of non compos mentis at the time or too interested in withholding what youre withholding or something like that you see to go into this thing deeply and so you close that one out thats total suppression you forget it and it lays the most beautiful chain in you ever heard of you know it should have read and it didnt read therefore the meter is good but your assumption is the incorrect assumption so it lasts in space which is meter didnt read that is lie the meter read and as any lie itll hang up and it builds whole chain up with somebody who is audited this way builds an enormous chain the way you clear that chain is you just prepcheck the question has any auditor ever failed to find meter read on you that you thought should have reacted that gets the unknowns out of it because thats the most likely area of unknown even though its kind of motivatorish its actually neither an overt nor motivator its just hanging in space but its quite unknown because it happened in the middle of the session while the pc was very interested in other things see so its quick one one of the ways the ancient medicine man operated i actually at one time or another have studied in this particular field i remember about 1930 i was very disgusted i did some study in north america on the subject of becoming an indian medicine man one of the fine ways to go about it is to learn how to scream and if you can let off good scream see thats got sawtoothed edges that is twice as loud as any psychos scream see just good totalvolume scream you can stand close to somebody scream suddenly utter command phrase and then continue your scream itll go in as total implant that is crude and savage way of implanting but very effective this is your old medicine man make terrific amount of noise noise for second and utter command phrase like you are pig see interrupt the scream at that point and then start it again at exactly the same pitch that you stopped it and go on and finish the scream the person who heard this scream is unaware of its ever having been interrupted and after the session will look at you attentively and say oink really will i mean this is quite effective quite effective there would be many ways to go about it you could take pistol and put somebody in sudden terror and shoot past his face and then stop shooting for moment and say something to him and then shoot the other three shots you see hed never have any idea that you ever said anything it goes into an unknownness and makes compulsion this is probably how the ancient magician enchanted things possibly princes have turned into deer in the forest if you took period in the magic universe when thetans were still capable of mocking up their own bodies and you pulled some shocking stunt on the person and sandwiched them in there that you are now deer why hed cease to mock up the prince and start mocking up deer dont you see and he would be an enchanted deer that would be how enchantments were accomplished i mean the mechanism of enchantment is cruder than that so when you lay something in like hellish invalidation of the meter the person is so involved in their own thinkthink and worried you see about something or other already very submerged and very withholdy they get further withhold on top of the darn thing just as though they were being screamed at you see theyre with meter doesnt work and then meter doesnt work but they dont know that except they cant read meters see how you could do it to somebody but actually it wouldnt be just that motivator that made this thing come true im afraid for any prince to get enchanted im afraid in the former life when he was magician he ran into prince and committed an overt which was actually motivator and i think thats how it all got mixed up he did the enchantment and somebody in front of him turned into deer to hang the guy with his own enchantment and then of course walked around the other side of the tree and became prince again see youd have to haste an incident of that particular kind the guy commits an overt that he thinks is an overt that is actually motivator but he doesnt know it is in order to get some such goofiness started in other words pc is to some degree at an auditors mercy and when an auditor does something weird makes some evaluative remark the pc might be fogged up at that kind of an instant and if its too bad poohie it isnt that your auditing on long range is going to do anything providing you eventually get rid of the persons gpm because all of this hangs up on the gpm when you eventually blow the gpm itll blow all the rest of it dont you see so therefore you have to audit in such way as to not impede the pc from getting clear it isnt that you can actually hurt pc you understand but the stuff is laying in against the aberrations and the gpm see and you got to audit pc so that the gpm is nor thoroughly restimulated and so at the other end he goes clear and the gpm blows to pieces got it and then all the auditing and everything else comes off but in the meantime if you do rough job of auditing because the pc is in rough state why of course you get these implantations inadvertently quite inadvertent you have to be careful what you say to pc who is in session as you know very well psychiatry by the way we find psychiatry hard to understand because the psychiatrist is always doing something on goal line that we dont understand we say we have goal line i ask all of you about this what your private opinion of why you audit pc is concerned but its uniformly to do something for the pc help him out something like that you see you all had that idea actually psychiatry doesnt have that idea in treating patient they are not trying to make the patient better or cure insanity or anything like that they have entirely different goal lines so you find them incomprehensible by the way in doing 3ga routine 3ga goals assessment technique of gpm processing all the people who are incomprehensible are the people who would not want your goal those are the true incomprehensibles of this universe you just cant understand them and of course you stop and think of president of the united states who wants to be piccolo player or something like that youd have hard time understanding his foreign policy youd think he was being inefficient in running the nation whereas he knows hes being efficient in running the nation he is handing out enormous sums of money to disabled piccolo players you see or something like this so he knows how to mn nation he is president so he can go to concerts see and that helps out its comprehensible this would be the way most nations are run supposing by the way you got all the heads of state there are in the world that cause all this upset and misery and got them down the line and actually did goals assessment on each one of them i imagine it would be terribly revelatory it would be kick man i mean you wouldnt believe it god the reasons they want to be president or king or commissar generalissimo well this goal line that the individual has is quite important hes trying to get clear and things that cross against it are all those things which we classify as auditing errors you see hes apparently being batted back on the subject of his goal well actually smooth auditing is designed not to bat his goal back see and thats the definition of whats right and wrong in an auditing session now that doesnt mean specifically we have to know what his goal is or anything else we just dont impede him on going forward see so the things that impede him we delete from the session and we get some incomprehensible like do you have present time problem yes the individual does have present time problem oh my god you know its an antisocial present time problem or something of the sort and he really doesnt want to fess up to it and hes right in the line of having to make horrible admission of some kind or another and the auditor says thats clear well of course he wanted to get rid of his present time problem was his basic goal and he didnt get chance to get rid of it so youve gone across his goal line and youve laid one in and that one that comes in is the meter doesnt work and he inevitably will make that conclusion at that moment its actually very upsetting if you go back and analyze the thing and go over this you sit there very upset youre saying to yourself my god its good thing i got away with that withhold thank god i didnt have to get off that withhold its what youre thinking kind of analytically you know whoa oh boy would that have been embarrassing this girl auditor and oh gee so happy i didnt get off have to get off the withhold you know she said it was clear i dont think it was clear hour and half later hes getting audited all this time you see what the hell was the matter with the emeter you know well he has to come to the conclusion it didnt work see the conclusion is automatically the response is the emeter doesnt work thats whats laid in he knows it should react it didnt react so therefore what should react doesnt react so therefore it doesnt react and theres quite an upset about that ive seen this myself ive had an arc break something like this and the auditor wouldnt register but i would on the meter in other words i could ask myself the question do i have present time problem the meter would go plang you see and the auditor would ask do you have present time problem it would sit there absolutely motionless it was quite interesting ive actually seen meter myself see now with the auditor i said well now come on now lets look at this lets look at this damn thing you see heres weird phenomenon the auditor asked the question reaction i asked the question reaction see i was holding the cans fantastic so the meter can be arc broke out of existence but even so the shock in not seeing the meter operate was quite something considerable shock involved in that operation you know she asked question do you have present time doesnt operate i ask the question do i have present time problem it operates what the hell is going on here see i just couldnt believe it you know just stoneyeyed disbelief dahhhh already have good subjective reality on it quite shock patched up the arc break of course the meter operated for the auditor wasnt anything more to it than that i even remember the time and date of this because i studied this little bit further and then found out that meter could be inoperative in the process of an arc break but youd have to arc break the living daylights out of the pc before you got to this phenomena and i dont believe we really reached this phenomena that meter by the way i dont think was tuned to sensitivity 16 i think it was at low sensitivity i think it still would have read one way or the other but it was quite shock to meter gets invalidated at the same time the pc is arc broke now the next time this person is auditing it sweeps it reacts perhaps minorly because his rudiments are already kind of queasy and the pc is halfway arc broke he gets reaction he doesnt believe it when he sees it you could stack these up to point where an auditor would simply be stoneblind on the meter hed just never see reaction thats all or hed try to explain the reaction which is the same thing you see you got one going right now which is very laughable you know all about this and yet ive had despatch about it and somebody else has had despatch about it today and that is do you take the reading during the sentence ahh this is just silly if you ask yourself what the hell what is reading which you get during the sentence its reading on the various words in the sentence not on the sense of the sentence so of course you ignore it theres prior read you ignore it theres latent read you ignore it the only read you read is the instant read bang if you dont get an instant read and you want to be sure try it again you saw one last night when i was auditing you saw prior read now you didnt see buy it i said well well check it and there it went that time it fired but we were getting some kind of random read random needles are apt to read almost anyplace but they wont ordinarily read two times running accidentally do you see now you only buy an instant read just lay that in with iron man instant read actually there is actually time period at all between the receipt of your question and the response from the reactive mind if theres any time period it is consumed electronically might be an electronic lag ive said half and fifth and tenth and im just trying to give you an idea of small amount of time i was studying it the other day and i found out it was zero time its actually zero time plus the electronic lag that electronic lag is pretty darn pretty darn instantaneous unless your meter is damped and to your eye you cant really detect any lag thats the only thing you pay any attention to theres only one other time when you use any other kind of read you never use prior read you never use late read except this one there is one exception and that is when youre helping the pc by steering youre steering the pcs thinkingness you saw do it last night on very broad scale fish and fumble very very broad i was practically sitting there waiting for the needle to hit on something so i could ask the pc what he was thinking about you see and then youve asked question youve got an instant read youve asked him what it is and moment later you see that instant read repeated but this time as needle pattern you see you see the same read so you say what was that see whats that and so on thats steering see so it doesnt matter whether you steer it in fish and fumble just sit there and wait for the guy to react on something and say what were you looking at at that moment you see that that that thats just steering it doesnt matter whether you do it after youve got the instant read or without any instant read you could use meter in that fashion it doesnt tell you anything you just want to steer the pcs attention to something and he oh well that that oh well i keep seeing this stuck picture uh thats what that is it wouldnt matter what the that was or what his withhold was its just steering its the only time you ever use anything but an instant read your instant read is never prior it never happens before the end of the sentence these must be singleclause sentences it never happens except at the end of the sentence the end of the word now you can say have you ever damaged anyone and get you have and the person is all arc broke on havingness see have clink you do you know you nearly reacts on all pcs clink damaged clank see someone tick oh you could say to yourself where the hell am i well just ignore all that earlier stuff see just ignore the lot see just and if youre not sure say ill repeat that have you ever damaged someone and clang youll get your instant read right on the end of someone its right exactly its just as the tail of the comes up youll get the instant read particularly on second repeat because you kind of have worn groove see you want to take question apart youll get have what about have youd be real idiot to do this see but what abouthave oh i dont know well what was that oh well that was the havingness session i had today the auditor said it was my process because it kept tightening the needle all right you all right whats that that that that that well i dont know it must be listing we keep putting you down on the list all right fine fine damaged yeah whats that that that well i dont know what that is that that well what am i supposed to be answering just that uh that but what am i supposed to be answering well just that thats all idiocy reigns dont you see thats this is your prior read just ignore the basketful see to hell with them same as latent you wouldnt do anything with latent read well dont do anything with prior read when does read become prior well i would say anything up to noninstantaneousness before you ended the sentence and when does read become latent any noninstantaneousness after you have ended the sentence i mean its just as idiotic as that i mean were actually defining cheese knife or something like that crazy i mean that its so easy to read that you could keep missing it you see you dont have to compartment the question any more to amount to hill of beans ask it two or three times if youre not sure what it is it all of sudden will straighten out and read you see youre actually talking to thought to the reactive bank most of you make this fantastic mistake you think the pc analytically can influence the meter and he cannot absolutely impossible he can do it on via by thinking of something that he knows auditors always call on him see he remembers session in which he had missed withhold that nobody has ever pulled see so he could actually go about this kind of weird one every time they ask him about something he could think of that session you see and hed get reaction but there must have been an unknown in the session see he could notknow enough about it you see so that hed get reaction by thinking of something that he knew he didnt know anything about he could get reaction thats as close as he can get to it and do you know it always has lag you know it will always give you latent read because the guy has to sit there and think about the session and the time it takes him to think analytically about the session gives you latent read now an instant read cant ever go through the analytical mind and doesnt it goes straight to the reactive mind straight as bullet see the reactive mind by definition is something that has never been timed something that is still happening something that is always now and its alwaysnowness deletes all time and that is why you get an instant read theres time in the reactive mind which is what is wrong with it so of course it reads reactively now and you think the pc knows the answer to what just flicked the needle now look he cant move the needle analytically so how the hell could he know it see there must be an unknown on anything that goes flick i dont care whether its dirty needle or anything else of course you ask him if he has present time problem and he knows hes got present time problem he got reminded of it you see just at that moment terrific unknowns in this present time problem its the unknowns that fire see if something is not unknown to the pc it wont fire which is the other denominator of the reactive mind it is caldron of unknowns which exist in now always so you ask the pc something its because you only get reactive response the needle will not react you sit there prepchecking somebody you could get very impatient about it but it sure makes the pc think if he sees his auditor getting little bit crowding him and he kind of runs and he thinks and grinds and he looks and that sort of thin the auditor can steer him around and say whats that why does the auditor have to steer him its because he doesnt know what it is try this on pc someday if you dont like him if youve just been given bad session by him yourself or something like that try this on him say uh have i missed withhold on you in this session and the pc suddenly feels funny because you see he feels the surge just as you get electronically the surge on the meter you see so he feels this surge and he kind of knows yes you know you say well what was it you know what was it dont help him out just sit there and he finally says well i cant find i dont know what it is uh and so forth you say you know what it is tell dont help him out dont steer him you can go on like this for hours but the pc is kind of looking around you know and you see flick you say that that hes looking at table hes looking at picture of table where the hell did that come from you know hahhahhah that the auditor says its picture of table well of course it develops little bit he sees little bit more of it oh oh oh the missed withhold oh oh oh yes i was that he recognizes what the table is its the table on which the emeter sits he was thinking that the thing was awfully creaky and he didnt say anything about it to the auditor and it springs to view and all of sudden you havent got reaction anymore why havent you got reaction because its known so the more unknown underpinnings you have on something the less reaction i mean the more reaction youve got you understand and the less unknown there is there the less reaction so magnitude of action i beg your pardon consistency of action not really magnitude but consistency of action is determined by consistency of unknown and its immediacy in present time so of course you can get goal and the goal will go bang bang bang bang well you dont know what the hell the goal is sitting in thats how that goal fires we dont know the mass that surrounds it hows it stay in place what is all of it what life did we lead how come we got into that you know all kinds of questions like this and yet the thing will still fire on the emeter you say the goal bing see the goal bing bing bing say it every time bing bing bing you say what is the goal to the pc and the pc can tell you what the goal is of course that ought to wash out shouldnt it uhuh bing bing bingbing thats why you have to audit them see its firing proposition all right now this unknownness can get buried in you can bury unknownness in the middle of an auditing session you can sandwich it in just like the screaming witch doctor they got one down in south africa yeah or mostly central africa they walk around not having seen it in south africa they kind of chased it out underneath the brush i guess but get horsetail switch for flies fill it full of fleas shake it all over somebody and while hes trying to brush them off say something to him thats version of that thats implantation magic the russians being rather asiatic do this consistently and continually guy is enroute to questioning chamber and woman dentist with forceps and so forth steps out of hidden door in the hall and examines his teeth and disappears through the same door shatters him where the hell was she from you know what is going on typical modern russian tactic boy these russians they go around this way you know this was what pavlov taught them i dont think he had to teach them very hard for some of them i notice they made terrific bid for popularity tonight fifteenyearold boy swam across the river to get into west berlin tonight so they put from the commie side seven bullets in him mobs of people watching this and they took him to the hospital with bullet in his lungs and in critical condition their bids for popularity are really marvelous to behold they probably think its the thing to do you know but they do these surprising things see they do sudden surprise in the middle of an action that makes an implant dont give them credit for being smart on this its probably dramatization because they dont do anything with it you see you knowing that figuring out and lets see how could we use this politically oh well easy well have this guy well play some beethoven and well have some soft perfume in the room and lying on soft couch and well play some beethoven see and under the table out of sight why we will have the moscow airraidwarning siren the biggest one and just as hes all relaxed and listening to this thing you see we will press this button stop pressing the button and say you are communist and start pressing the button again guy would walk out hed tell everybody he was communist wed have done the trick since communist is more or less robot anyhow i mean you could apply these things intelligently the russians dont you know it takes them seventy days to brainwash and they only get 22 percent isnt that interesting you know they only get 22 percent i think this is marvelous you know why do they try why do they try but this all comes under the heading of that sort of thing something that is invalidated secretly or privately bang like that in guys mind what is it its sort of interesting you go over this itll make more sense when you get these things checked off because it wouldnt take very long to check these things off you can go on and check it over of course on more of an overt proposition just talking about getting rid of this meter blindness as an auditor have you ever deliberately ignored significant meter response when i first looked at that question i thought my god i just had emeters all over in front of my face i wrote the question down all of sudden this morning i was sitting there looking at emeters and i was willing to swear that i must have done it just every session for just moment just having thought the thought i must have done this every session you know i just must have ignored significant meter responses so i just sat there forced myself to remember exactly when they were they amounted to exactly three one of them on you i said i would take up the rudiments question in the middle of the prepcheck session in other words i said are you willing to talk to about your difficulties so i said we wont bother with it now because were gonna take it another guy i checked out criminal and i couldnt clear it and didnt believe the meter and the guy ran away with the crown jewels afterwards you know some such comparable action and an early one i asked somebody question and i got response an immediate and direct response on the question and couldnt and didnt follow it up and never developed it and boy was that fraught with havoc and there are only three think of the thousands of hours ive audited there were three and they had stacked up enough to give an automaticity of meters meters meters meters meters meters meters meters meters meters meters my god i saw meters going this way and that way get the idea i mean they had it stacked right in see of course the obvious one have you ever invalidated an emeter and then another obvious one as preclear have you ever successfully persuaded an auditor the meter was wrong thats more hazarding it but i know there are few who have and then have you ever attempted to invalidate meter read in order to keep something secret and i know some pcs have done that but you notice in each case it says or any version thereof or any version thereof or any version thereof and so forth so youd have to fool around with it and get the thing clear i dont mean to invalidate or make you believe that you are going blind and cant see anymore or something like that but the alternative is is youre just plain wicked and you arent that either the mistakes which could be made are youre just not seeing the meter bang see you think that its swinging all the time anyway and you dont quite see the change of pace your eye isnt educated to seeing the change of pace thats all that would be one another thing before you investigate this thing and before you investigate your pc youve already got him so arc broke that the meter wont read at all see its your tr 1 just is not responding on the pc because of the arc break and the other one would be some confusion about what is an instant read just what is one well of course you see one you see one last night suzie was calling off for you just any read that came along naturally she was giving you read practice and some of you took it that she was calling them all reads and thought she should have only been calling the instant read ill stop that why she can call just instant reads next time you will see these things read its the educated eye this is the grossest auditing error there is it is the hardest one to put across nobody is trying to make you guilty particularly well i have got some ways and means by which you can feel easier about it and i dont say that all of you are doing it and i dont say that all of you are doing it always but theres enough of it being done so that those pcs which i have checked out or had checked out in the last few weeks have been found to not they werent clean on whatever was being asked not only werent clean on the meter but werent clean physiologically on the questions you see there are other ways to watch you ask pc question and he goes zuuhmm nyah and uhh and huhhuh and blushes and squirms and honest its as good as an instant read you get all those reactions of one kind or another of course you add it up observation observation thats the whole thing the ability to look i have always been trying to teach you how to look here is direction to look here is an instrument with which to look and if i ever will just teach you just to look and to see what you are looking at without any interference or interpretation or anything else well i probably would have made greater philosophic splash than any philosopher weve had on this planet dont you see so this is the toughest one to get anybody to do is just to observe thats the tough one see dont feel too bad just work on it get practiced up all of sudden youll be right in there pitching okay remember once upon time somebody delivered thing and they said it was an electropsychometer and jim and i sat up most of the night trying to find out what it did and it was actually week or two before i found out that it read on the needle so youre in good company thank you
