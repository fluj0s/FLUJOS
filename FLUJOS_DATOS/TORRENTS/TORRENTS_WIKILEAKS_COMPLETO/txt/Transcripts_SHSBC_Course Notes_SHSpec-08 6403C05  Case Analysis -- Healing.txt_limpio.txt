6403c05 shspec8 case analysis healing ian tampion audited pcs on tv for the benefit of the victoria legislature at some hearings in australia this is the ultimate tvd the legislators were very interested lrh has started running his goals plot the research activities have left holes in his bank there are about 350 different goals series in sets of 42 since the same things went in over and over if you run one too deeply you can drop through into the next series you also get awful somatics if you do this the goals series are consecutive and it just goes in over and over again with different gpms same line plot same goal series they just go on and on so if you run out one you are convinced that you couldnt possibly have run it out because it is sitting on one of the same gpms of an earlier series so it looks like all the goals are still alive there so if you run one too deep you fall through into an earlier goals series so you can leave bpc by going on to the earlier one which gives you bad somatics youve got 42 goals in series for total of 15000 gpms they get bigger and bigger as you go back early track ris are about the size of mountain if you dont get the first pt series right the pc will go into sad effect of great magnitude with great speed it will take only four or five seconds from where where you found the wrong gpm to start from to the toboggan this can happen because you may well not have completed the current series only some of the 42goal series closest to pt is formed because the current series has not yet been completed therefore it is easy to fall back into the next series also the pt gpm itself is truncated so you can get the first actual goal but it is hard to get the first actual gpm everyone has the same actual line plot in common we learned our lesson well before the track began the consequences of running these gpms out of order and with wrong line plots are pretty horrendous which is why we are not broadly releasing the line plots incidentally there are 2d goals on the actual gpm line plot as far as lrh has been able to tell there are plenty of implant goals on the 2d however case analysis tells you how to become healing wizard and upset the ama man has real tradition of healing there is lot of charlatanism the ama is into plumbing not healing anyway of course doctors are necessary like plumbers they never reveal their stats or not often enough you hear that 600 people have received kidney transplants what you dont hear is that all of them were dead within two years previous attempts to heal overts have consisted of things like calling for repentance this is not an adequate process man got healing closely associated with structure and became successful where structure is concerned he knew nothing of disease infection may or may not have to do with bacteria there are too many variables to say for sure the fact that you can see the bugs under microscope is insufficient lrh has found that infection many be the result of gpm healing is done by the body the doctor merely arranged the parts so that they could go back together and hoped that the individual would do the rest until you have solved the problem of how the individual influences his own healing process you can do nothing broadly about healing so the healing professions have tended to be monopolists or frauds the modern medicos and psychiatrists have gone towards monopoly they have also made research lucrative profession but they tend to keep the door shut on real search into healing by others not part of their club authority has become fact in courtrooms we dont communicate with the medicos not so much because they are evil as because they have certain stylized ways of thinking into which we do not fit they use research as way of raising money which is another incomprehensible we would have been incomprehensible anyway because we have gone forward on the basis that there is such thing as truth and that using what we know of it we can help our fellow man our real goals as scientologists are unreal to the public so there has to be bridge we do want some way to bridge in to the fellow on the street healing can be part of the lower part of such bridge because it is real to people freedom from psychosomatic illness is something that we can produce easily at lower levels even though healing isnt our main interest this makes the monopolists attack us the second thing that we need to know about healing is if you are going to heal heal dont heal in order to _______ you would gain great acceptance in community if you worked on that avoiding or handling the attacks of the monopolists and escaping the wrath of the frauds if you do go in for healing someone make sure that you also teach him little and broaden his horizon beyond his goal of getting rid of his lumbosis you do have technology for healing any chronic disease or illness provided that you can read meter and keep the auditing comm cycle going chronic disease is disease that exceeds its expected duration but dont assume that because you can see that someone is sick from something you should heal it to say what someone is suffering from is very adventurous the persons mental mechanisms can bring about and perpetuate virtually anything actually all illness is psychosomatic even broken bones it shows poor judgement to put ones body in position where its bones can be broken after all the genus of psychosomatic illness is in suggestion the hypnotic variety and suggestion comes down to postulation nothing can be suggested to the individual with any effect that he has not earlier postulated himself thus an overt would be to key in something that the person had already postulated for himself the person must have willed the destruction of bodies before he could get his body in bad shape it really isnt what has happened to person that brings about psychosomatic illness it is what the person is willing to have happen eg to another but it is neither possible nor necessary to trace psychosomatic illness back to the individuals basic intention to have it to cure psychosomatic illness though all psychosomatic illnesses are selfcaused and stem from early thetan postulates the keyin of such an illness can be otherdetermined he doesnt have to have keyin to make his postulates come true but when one of his early postulates sometimes mysteriously materializes in the physical universe and he doesnt know anything about it it is necessary for something else around him to key it in he did it himself and knew he did but if it is happening and he doesnt now know that he did it himself it must be the result of keyin hypnotism for instance is merely keyin of persons earlier postulates cf hcob 10aug73 pts handling to keep an environment calm you must be careful of what gets keyed in for instance war environment is restimulative enough to cause the keying in of lot of brutality thetan is unbelievably numerously prepostulated with 15000 gpms each containing 16 ris with locks galore there is lots to be keyed in so when you heal psychosomatics you are not dealing with the thetans basic postulations unless you are auditing at levels v and vi below level v basic postulates are out of reach of the thetan they are neither necessary nor possible to use in handling psychosomatic illness it is fortunate that you dont require them here are the steps in the formation of psychosomatic illness 1 the thetan postulates it ie he postulates that it could be done or that it could happen this was trillenia ago probably 2 then he did it to someone else 3 then he could and did have it keyed in on himself and he got the experience the keyin could be anything it could be something quite mild symbol for instance step 1would be taken up at level vi if anywhere but trying to handle illness at level vi is too restimulative someone who is sick is probably not up to any part of it and you dont do level vi partially anyway handling step 2 getting the basic overt on the track is equally matter of going way back and is therefore probably impossibly difficult to get at but you can easily handle step 3 picking up the keyin in pt which is some tiny motivator or small overt that keys in the big overt and you can make the person well by using it to cure somebody find the most recent keyin that you can get your hands on or the latest overt on that subject again cf hcob 10aug63 pts handling dont try to heal with heroic methods take care of the keyins even though you know correctly that there is far far more behind it you want the lightest keyin that you can approach by the nature of the case you wont be able to reach that big postulate until the case as whole is up to level vi try to pick up the keyin that is as close to present time as you can get not as far back as you get if the recent keyin is too heavy to confront eg if it is something three lifetimes ago you can even pick up the keyin of the keyin go easy use feather duster the lightest of methods is what succeeds in healing curing bunions is not the same game as restoring to being his full powers but it is useful skill and very lightlylightly one you are not trying to get to basic the heroic measures indulged in by desperate doctors are just physical dramatizations of needless search for basic cutting out the brain to handle things is the effort to arrive at prime postulate dramatized as physical action the mystery is how something can be keyed out but it can and it heals the pc to do so he is likely to get the somatic back when he gets up to level vi but there you will be running it out
