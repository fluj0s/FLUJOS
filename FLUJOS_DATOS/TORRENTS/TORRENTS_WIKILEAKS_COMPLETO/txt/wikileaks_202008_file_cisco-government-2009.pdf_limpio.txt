many different interpretations of the exact number the ones on this slide are ciscos call on market size based on all the research later slides will validate but if you read only one analyst report it could be different number the point on this is the market is big growth started to rebound in cy05 and is projected to grow over the next decade later slides give more detail on this point big changes governments have traditionally been slower adopters of technology they an now catching up and it is changing all aspects of the network and communication capabilities security is very important since governments exist to support citizens their security is always paramount in todays society the threats are much different then 10 years ago when we use to worry about random mugging or burglary now people are worried about terrorism governments understand this and are focusing on security in much different way the bottom of this slide is list of the high level areas that mayors governors or

and can deep research can be accessed on wwwharvardedu jorgenson has been analyzing the impact that technology on productivity from highlevel this graph shows how the adoption and use of networking technology has significant impact on worker productivity it is important to understand that the number may seem small 1 etc but if you apply this year on year the impact becomes very significant overall government is in the middle or low end of the spectrum on how much they benefit from tech there are couple of reasons they have been slower in the adoption compared to more aggressive verticals like finance who have more money gov excl edu means all government without education government edu is specific to schools and government enterprise is more on the state level the main point of this slide is that the adoption of network technology does have significant impact on increasing productivity or value added growth in generic sense and verticals that adopt technology benefit more then the laggards governments have the potential to improve productivity and value added growth if they utilize technology 2006 cisco systems inc all rights reservedpresentation_idscr10 2007 cisco

correlationict usage and global competitiveness source the global information technology report 20042005 world economic forum what is the networked readiness index the networked readiness index or nri defines how prepared country is to take advantage of developments in information and communications technology governments regulators and businesses believe that ict is critical for the development and competitiveness of nations it is based upon the following premises there are three important stakeholders individuals businesses and governments there is general macroeconomic and regulatory environment for ict the degree of usage of ict by the three stakeholders is linked to their degrees of readiness to use and benefit from ict how is it calculated two types of data were used soft data gathered from questionnaires managed by the world economic forum as part of their research for the global competitiveness report and hard data which is driven by statistics collected by international multilateral agencies such as the world bank and itu the soft data is critical in determining the opinion of the decision makers and influencers who are intimately familiar with nations economy and ict usage the hard data captures fundamental elements related to the development of infrastructure human capital and ict what is the difference between networked readiness and the global competitiveness index the global competitiveness index measures economies potential to achieve sustained economic growth it divides nations into stages of development based on gdp per capita the networked readiness index measures how successful economies are in exploiting developments in ict comparison of both indices suggests tight correlation as the networked readiness of nations increase so does the global competitiveness index gci is there link between gdp and networked readiness there is one single measure to calculate networked readiness including gdp but countries with comparatively low gdp do see their nri score increase rapidly with small increases of gdp the effect of increasing gdp on the nri scores appears less pronounced on countries with higher gdp per capita other factors become relevant to the score so as technology vendor perhaps its not surprising that i would make strong link from ict usage and productivity however productivity is key indicator in measuring economic development cisco uses it other business leaders use it as i am sure you do in making decisions on issues such as fiscal policy wages and interest rates this graph is from the networked readiness index which measures how prepared country is to take advantage of developments in information and communications technology and measures individuals businesses and governments ive highlighted few countries including france canada note correlations are proportions rather than percentage r88 ask better question we all know there are impediments to this accelerating growth of ict we all know it is difficult we all know there are obstacles lets look at some other research which has been done share best practices for solutions its people its us we can be transformative in our

programming or access to backend systems of vcrs and dvd players and separate video conferencing network based on expensive dedicated leased lines yet another video monitoring network provides video feeds of buildings and hallwaysand of course there is the intercom network for overhead paging and bells lastly they have some type of outdoor rf type system with hand held radios for public safety and public works the total at least six different networkssix wiring runs six management systems and multiple experts to operate them this means much more complexity in management maintenance and

foundation components industry leading routers switches optical and security solutions that form the basis of secure intelligent network foundation value provides the reliability adaptability and resiliency to connect people across the community to vital information and resources reliability protects network from outages service degradation at peak loads and security threats as the network scales to support user demandadaptability supports voice video and data with the ability to introduce new service and application capabilities via wires and wireless secure integrated security across all levels of network from the core to the end user benefits allows governments to extend the reach of rich government resources to the entire community while reducing operational costs and increasing service effectiveness built in security at all levels provides security strategy for both todays network and tomorrows growth enables all advanced communications capabilities across the organization it all starts with the secure ip foundation one major difference that you will see is that this communication system begins with your data network your data network is the core to offering all the various types of communications we discussed it can provide voice services video services and collaboration services both via your wired network and your wireless network 2006 cisco systems inc all

visibility more difficult to manage higher tcosimplified environment tighter integration tighter security greater visibility easier to deploy manage lower tco the benefits of such systems approach are compelling to illustrate lets take look at the car analogy if we look back 25 years the automobile industry was perfect example of trying to solve problem of highway safety with point product approach remember when seat belts were an option abs systems were an expensive third party extra and there was integration of air bags crumple zones and seatbelts the result was higher traffic fatality rates fast forward to today and we have an integrated security system on cars that is both less expensive and much more effective there are many compelling benefits to such systems approach when compared to pointsolution strategies first an systems greatly simplifies the environment and by providing inherently tighter integration provides tighter security set of disparate and disconnected security devices will never be able to provide the same level of security that can be achieved through an integrated solution which combines existing infrastructure devices with embedded security solutions security devices that have and understand native network intelligence and actualized security policy in collaborative and adaptive security system such system will always provide greater risk reduction than any individual product regardless of features or performance additionally as systems approach sdn also provides greater visibility of your endtoend security enabling improved security management and policy control systems approach is also much easier to deploy as you can see simplification is strategic approach to security and ultimately leads to higher tco 2006 cisco systems inc

only deployed in parts of the infrastructure like the perimeter the evolution of these threats has made it clear that solutions based defenses are required that security needs to be an adjective not
