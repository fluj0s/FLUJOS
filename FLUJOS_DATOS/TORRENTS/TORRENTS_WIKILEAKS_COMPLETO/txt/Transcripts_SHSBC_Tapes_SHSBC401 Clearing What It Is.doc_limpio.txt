clearing what it is lecture given on 3 september 1964 thank you whats the date audience third of september third of september ad 14 saint hill special briefing course i had bunch of things to talk to you about but my mail line has been hitting so hard in the last few minutes that im bit discombobulated and so forth there is storm going on in london at the present moment and it was protest by the director of prom reg of the use of the word clear in certainty magazine and she carefully went around to the staff and collected all the entheta that everybody was saying on staff on this particular word well frankly if you went back and used the technology of 1958 you could make clear you wouldnt make 100 percent job of the line dont you see but something on the order of 50 percent or something like that and theyd stay that way nicely and some of them would stay that way for years now the point im making on the situation is standard term which originally came out of the field of adding machines im actually talking to you now about pe and that sort of thing and ill gradually remember what i was going to talk to you about in the field of adding machines there is button that says clear and thats what clear means and thats fairly antique definition because it probablyit goes back in dianeticsit goes back to dianetics evolution of science which predates book one of course and the example is given in that and it goes back to the invention of adding machines which is quite previous to dianetics and scientology so this is an old term thats actually what clear means its the clear which is written on the button on an adding machine now lets just become factual about the definitions here and lets say exactly what they are now why is that there well in the world of electronic computers they sometimes have solder trouble this gives you anotheranother viewpoint of the same problem they have solder trouble theres these tremendous numbers of circuits that they build up inside of one of their computers and these circuits are extremely complex and when somebody gets in there with soldering iron occasionally to fix in new transistor or something of the sort why theyll drop drop of solder or something you see well the second he does that he will add some figure into all the computations all the computations will now have this additive figure because its shortcircuited with drop of solder you see and so that when you say how far is it to the moon this will give you the answer but then multiplies or subtracts this soldered figure so it never comes up with the right answer now in plain mechanical adding machines you can do this very very easily this is not computerlets get back moremore elementary on plain ordinary gardenvariety adding machine used in every accounts office anyplace in the worldexcept the abacus but i imagine you can make the same mistake on the abacusyes you can youve just got through adding up yesterdays receipts and then you start to add up todays receipts and you never push the clear button you never push that clear button and pull the handle down twice if you dont believe it try it sometime on an adding machine you get the most remarkable answers see youve added this all up and now youve still got total unseen in the machine so when you reach over here and pull the lever put another figure on it and add it it just keeps adding this total only you dont notice that its adding the total into the whole line becauseuntil you are clear down to the end of it so you have added yesterdays receipts you see and that figure is still lurking in the machine uncleared and now you start to add up todays receipts and you get yesterdays receipts and todays receipts in the total so the answer you see if there wasnt clearing in it was cumulative answer which depended on some old data modifying the present time answer now the mind when it has an old experience will add that data into its current experience and it keeps coming up with wrong answers professor looks at some college student with slight twitch of the eye and this girl says he has winked at and dust got in his eye at that minute you see he has now winked at so there is nothing i can do now but quit school and you say well thats crazy its perfectly correct answer according to that computer because she was assaulted when she was ten by fellow who winked at her first and it messed her up considerably you see so to prevent this experience from occurring she adds the old experience into this new experience and gets really wrong answer well she actually is incapable of observing the new experience because shes still got the old experience you see so she cant come up with the right answer to this situation which is some dust got in his eye this would never occur to her it must be very meaningful that he winked at her and this means of course she is going to be assaulted and this means of course she is going to get messed up like mad and therefore she is going to have to leave school thats the only answer to the situation and you say well thats silly thats outrageous well thats because she is not cleared on the subject of winks do you see male voice yah so where she still has lurking datum which is an aberrated datumand what people have never gotten i suppose is this word aberrated it means nuts have you got it i love thesome peoples evaluation of this particular thing because its well he worries little bit when he gets broke so therefore hes aberrated oh people worry when they get broke see he is not aberrated on it it means nuts see this guys shoes in the morning are found to be where the left onethe right one is where the left one is and the left one is where the right one is they are crossed so their toes go out slightly so he looks at this situation alongside of his bed and has nervous breakdown thats aberrated see people are not operating in the degree of the uncleared datum see theyre going out here and saying well sunlight when it shines in my eyes hurts my eyes so therefore i must be aberrated on the subject of sunlight now thats not aberrated thats not aberrated thatsmight be peculiar in degree or something but thatthats aberration its much worse than this the guy is walking along in the dark and his eyes hurt because of the bright lights he sees in them thats nuts he doesnt know where theyre coming from theres source for these lights he goes around worrying about it he finally decides wrong answer because he is not cleared on the subject that martians keep landing in front of him all the time hes nuts now that is datum that needs to be cleared the girl with the aberration on the subject of every time she sees mans eye twitch she has to leave college or somethingthats interfering with her life like mad and that is the datum that needs to be cleared and clear wouldnt have those it doesnt add in yesterdays totals into completely wrong answer for today do you follow thats all clear is now it also happens that when person is very very aberrated and i hate to have to say very verylets just call it aberrated because that is the missing word here as well as clearwhen person is aberrated he cant remember thing nothing along some given line of action now this girl whosethe professor winked at her and she has to leave school cant remember where it happened what class she is in when she enrolled in that class shed have to think for long time before shed finally even come up with subject dont you see its where did she put her textbooks you know anything connected with that her memory stinks do you follow it shesusually goes down the hall to this particular classroom and goes into the wrong classroom do you get the idea in other words she cannot remember on this particular subject and as far as being able to remember the subject itself shes going to flunk her finals man she is going to flunk them memory bad on that particular subject have you got it lousy oh she can remember everything else she can remember letters from her girlfriends and she can remember this and she can remember childhood she can remember all sorts of things but anything connected with this classroom she cant remember this thing is buried she doesnt even remember the assault on her when she was ten this islittle gimmick is what made freud famous just this one little tiny gimmickthat if you could get somebody to remember what had happened to them they were better now she doesnt even remember thatthe assault on her when she was ten much less what the subject or class or anything else is about that its associated with in other words its motionpicture screen with projector film and audience that is memory on this given subject memory is not broad condition everybody is going around saying my memory is bad my memory is good he has good memory he has bad memory bull nobodys memory works that even nobodys memory works that evenly it doesnt work that badly and it doesnt work that goodly memory is not uniform condition its as spotty as leopard this fellow he can remember oh man you ask himyou ask him now what were the dimensions of the last building you built oh he says that was 975 feet wide and the bricks were 3 14 inches above the cantles and blahblahblahwoofwulf and the roof poles were so forth and we put 316 inch you know reinforcement in the ruddy rods you know he goes on and on and on hes walking warewarehousenotnotnot hes walking memory hes warehouse of memories you see on the subject and you say what did you have for dinner and he says well i dont know i dont know what i had for dinner what did you have for breakfast oh god dont ask that thats too long ago thats hours ago see on the subject of food hes dead blank on the subject of figures and construction and that sort of thing man hes running racehorse and thats people thats the way they are and the worse off they are the less they can remember and now if you got total blank you would simply get the condition known as unconsciousness or amnesia and that is simply the culmination of all the helddown fives eventually adding up to total wipeout but that is the extreme condition and you cant even talk to that bloke he cant even open his eyes much less see anybody wink so it actually from the worlds standpoint doesnt matter much whether this fellow can remember or not remember observe or not observe because hes not even there so it isnt question of memory its question of notness he is not memory is not past is not present is not dont you see everything is not not there there isnt any well you could get culmination of adding up all his bad memories into totality of bad memory but would you have at that moment normal human being you would not have normal human being you wouldnt have human being youd just have lump of meat see so to say somebody has ahas bad memory on what its an incomplete statement if you said somebody has amnesia yes you could say well all right that is total bad memory but of course you cant even classify it as memory because hes not even there to remember its gone dog that were talking about now so memory is not an even condition people remember some things well and remember some things badly now if you wanted to improve somebodys memory youd also have to say on what see the guy sayssets goal for the sessioni want to improve my memory well all right he set it for the session and you are an auditor and this is his session and youre not going to argue with him let him make mistake its his mistake but if you were handling this sensibly you would have to ask the remainingi mean dont say that you should do this in session you know but i mean in investigating the situation you would have to say improve your memory on what now you would have something to work on wouldnt you but up to the moment when he doesnt add the on what you dont have anything to work on and youre left with this complete lie that memory is an evenness dont you see memory is an even goodness or badness or memory as whole subject can be improved oh memory as whole subject could only be improvedyes wholeas whole subject it could be improved but only by stressing the particularities on which his memory is bad and then if you kept picking up each thing on which his memory was bad having asked this burning question improve your memory on what you would now get an answer like well improve my memory forforfor names well any particular names yes girls names i just dont seem to be able to rememberi meet agnes and i think she is bessie aluuuriuuur you know bhuuuul horrible well man youre right on the track of that button called clear because it goes handinglove just as the helddown five in the electronics machine that is held down there with piece of solder just as yesterdays total receipts are being added in unobserved why so he doesnt observe that zone or area where quote his memory is bad and that is where he is aberrated you couldnt ask for nicer little set of scales by which to measure somebodys nuttiness he says i want to improve my memory you say what do you want to improve in memory i want to improve my memory on names any particular name yeah i want to improve my memory on girls names now you as the auditor have something to run down and youd run it down and youd find somenow lets go into dianeticsyoud find some traumatic experience traumatic was word invented to bedevil medical students some painful experience of some kind or another that is buried not in the subconsciousthere is subconscious for anything to get buried inits just buried in the guy himself it is an occlusion to use big word on you occlusion to occlude to slam the door in the face of to close the window quickly in the front of you know to drop the blind occlude it is not there that window he cant look out of that backtrack he cant look into thats gone and sitting on it will be nuttiness and it will be good big nuttiness its not little bitty nuttiness and sometimeshe doesnt even know hes got this nuttiness or he wouldnt have it see itsit will be something on the order of if doors are half open its bad luck and all day long people will be mad at him thats sane isnt it hes got it added up into wont be an even flow of time or something see he can explain it to you but once he starts explaining it its gone dog his memory starts opening up on it at once all you have to do is turn spotlight on this thing all you have to do is start looking at the machine and find out where the figure is held down where the five is held down all youve got to do is just monkey with it little bit and it starts to clear and every time you can find someplace where somebody is off the beam you will also findthese facts all go togetheryou will find someplace where somebody cant remember he got bum datum painful past experience see these are all of the same family of stuff see hes got painful area there that hurts him to look at so of course that gives him bad memory on that particular subject and this gives him wrong answers in present time its just fact wrong answers all the time youll find out hell take irrational decisions consistently and continuously if you ask him to design door for house why hed fix up something cat could get through but man couldnt you know there would be something nutty on this subject this thing though would appear at first glance to be very hard to locate because it has so many locks it has so many appended associated experiences things that are like it and its just great big pileup of stuffa great big pileup of stuff well you start removing these things and you start getting down to the core of this thing and all of sudden we find the traumatic experience of some kind or another we find with it the big overt and we know now the misunderstood word and when weve got this thing unpiled why it flies apart like clock that baby has just slopped hammer to see it goes blonnnngg thats the end of that aberration he couldnt get it back if he tried all of sudden when he thinks it doesnt get stopped by the clock see in there or something hewe thinkhe starts thinking on this subject he sees door and the door is half open you see well formerly the door half open meant soandso and soandso and meant soandso and soandso and soandso and so forth and therefore he shouldnt probably go through the door because of so on and its very bad luck to have such thing and so on and the onlythe only thing for it to do was to count the number of steps he had taken to the door and then walk the steps backwards you say what the hell was this all about well thats whats the matter with it its what the hell is this all about you see the one thing which iswhich is true about these things is their sum total answer is incomprehensible the horrible thing youre watching inin the field of psychiatry is them trying to make sense out of the incomprehensible well you dont make sense out of the incomprehensible you find out what caused the incomprehensible you dontdont enter it on the wrong side and say well lets see how does this all add up how does this all add up now lets see what does he really mean well he doesnt mean nothing man he just means hes got wrong answer he means hes nuts i mean thats all you have to understand about it we dont care what this birds chattering aboutwe dont have towe dont have to do anything about it at all you see its just bleahhhh and so forth and you step backwards in order to open door but if you didnt do that and something or other and he feels depressed and blue all the time because doors are usually halfopen somebody is trying to add this up you see on the other side of the ledger hes trying to add this up this way lets see now he probably has something to do and there is probably something in all of man that has to do with square shapes excite complex you cant add these things up into general behavior because its just this birds aberration you see thathes just nuts that way that doesnt mean there is anybody else in the world crazy on the subject of doors halfopen dont you see but this guy is well all you have to understand about it is is the guy doesnt understand it see if you could just understand that itsthat its not necessary to understand what the hell hes talking about all youve got to find out is what lets enter it on the other side now and lets say what started all of this where did this come from and of course youre going to get forty or fifty weirdsounding things come off of this one thing and we find out that when he was four or five years old or something like that why it was he who let off the brakes of the family car and ran over his baby brother and the reason his baby brother has been crippled ever since and doors sort of add into this in some wild and peculiar way that heyou know he had to open the door or something and youll find out it is some phrase in the engram like you know open the door and get at him quick you know or something like that or hes got stuck picture of halfopen ear door or something like that see but thatsthats how it explains is whats the original experience that is the cause of this bird being aberrated or nuts on this particular subject so that he cant remember on the subject so that he cant think on the subject so that he cant get right answers on the subject so that he is around the bend on this particular subject you got it you know nobody is totally crazy nobody is totally crazy the wildest madman in the insane asylum is not totally crazy and this has got everybody bugged everybody else goes crazy on this datum see they say well craziness should be state insanity should be general state here we got again this thing ive just gave you of memory see insanity should be general state and we havewe have magistrates sitting there in their motheaten wigs you know and these fellows are saying now mr sawbrain the local psychiatrist is now going to give us an opinion as to whether or not somebody is sane or insane and so after few gibblings and dribblings and so forth mr sawbrain gets up and says i certify your honor he is insane hes ahes kleptotosis skidabuff ruffboof and thethe psychiatrist then had made his pronunciamento so the man is legally insane ahh what kind of comedy sideshow is this thing because nobody is totally insane even the girl in the catatonic schiz state if you could get her to open one eye is liable to ask for glass of water well thats not aan insane request dont you see so it isnt an insane act but man with his thirst for totalities his thirst for allnesswhich you should recognize as just desire to identify with and with and everything is its just total identification you see has to have even in his legal systems thing called insane there is nobody insane there is such thing as total insanity so therefore there couldnt be such thing as an insane state he would have to be insane on some subject or he would have to be insane in some area or field of endeavor or action and its just that the rest of the sentence is missing this man is insane is actually this kind of sentence an incomplete sentence that requires the dotdotdot on the end of it to show that it is incomplete this man is insane dotdotdot they have never finished the sentence this man is insane on the subject of women this man is insane on the subject of the state this man is insane on the subject of green cheese but if they knew that much about insanity they could cure it because what ive given you here is of course the missing link in the scientific research area and it is in the definition of their terms which is there is state called general insanity and they always are trying to dream up new names for this sort of thing they call them schizophrenics and they call them this and they call them that and paranoids theyre trying to get this broad pervasive label and theyre so interested in getting new term to put on this thing that they frankly have never asked what theyre trying to label and if they would just realize that they just havent completed their sentence they would have opened door to cure all they had to do was complete their own sentence dont you see this fellow is dancing around in straw skirt and whereas this wouldnt be particularly odd looking in hollywood this strawskirt dancing if it were taking place in boston would be cause for comment somebody would notice well it isnt even the environmental difference the guy was nuts whether he was in hollywood or boston but in boston they have this sort of thing called conduct or reserved conduct or unseemly conduct they inherited it from cotton mather and the other jokers that were back there way back when anyway we get ahold of this bird see psychiatrist says this man is insane incomplete statement see hes goinghe should have said this man is insane dotdotdot your position would have been to open the cure for this fellow and an understanding of the situation on what subject would be your innocent remark well that of course blows up the whole field that opens the doors to cure he is insane on what subject the psychiatrist says exhibitionism ah thats not subject thats condition that doesnt say exhibitionism all right hethats not good enough that doesnt give you anything to go home on whats he insane on on what subject lets finish out the sentence here well they would have to observe the fellow for few minutes to find out what was going on before they could finish the sentence and that would force them to observe the patient and evenand at that point they would find out that there arent any similarities in insanity so you cant classify insanity so we observe him for few minutes and he kept saying boolaboola oogaooga boolaboola ugaooga and we find out what hes insane on now we find out thatwhy we saywe say why are you saying boolaboola ugaooga and he says well you have to this is the south seas you idiot well hes insane because he thinks he is in the south seas well now weve got the door open hey bud please explain to why you are in the south seas oh man we are carving away on this aberration now with axes see we are going to town on this sort of thing we dont have to cut up his brain because the aberration is being cut up which is the proper target and we find out finallywe find out finally that this bird is stuck in movie someplace that he has observed and so forth and we find out he has thwarted ambition in some particular character and we find out that in order to accomplish that ambition he committed fantastic overt act at some time he stole whopping great big piece of money in order to go to hollywood and be in the movies and he was never caught but he didnt get to hollywood and get in the movies either and he didnt go off the rockers on this particular subject until hed found out that the person hed stolen the money from had as result gone broke and committed suicide too much overt now the gray walls start to move close to this individual and he doesnt quite know what all this adds up to but we have now traumatic experience we get off the overt and he all of sudden doesnt have all this nonsense going on we carve it down it would take adroit auditing you couldnt do it in the absence of the discipline of auditing you see you would have to have that right on the groove otherwise youd never get the data youd never carve it back hed never be able to blow any locks you cant just stand over fellow saying that isnt whats wrong with you its something else wrong with you you realize dont you that youre an exhibitionist rafraf rahrahrah they dont blow locks when you do that in other words it takes the discipline of auditing to have carved down to that now what would we have accomplished at the final end of that line we would have found out the overt we would have found out the basic experience with regard to it we probably would have found little bit of an underlying experience of some kind or another wed find failure to understand something or other and when we got all of this up he would longer be dancing around in the streets in hula skirt saying uggooolaboolabua and thatswhat have we done then hed also be able to remember that period of his life and when you said motion pictures to him he didnt instantly go and get his hula skirt and jump out in the middle of the street and go ugaboola boolaboolaboola so the right answer to hula skirt he finds out was not jumping out into the street and going ugaboola boolaboola or the right answer to motion picturesthe right answer to motion pictures is sit and look at them and now he sees motion picture he sits and looks at it take drunkard this fellow is drinking to escape or he is drinking to this or he is drinking to that but i dont think hes really drinking to anything i think hes drinking now lets go it the other way too thatthere weve got an overelaborated explanation hes got total solution to how to get through life you drink see but you wouldnt even know whether he had it as total solution or it was symptom of something else or it was something else lying on something else until you carved into it and asked him what this was all about all right now you say hes insane on the subject of what and you finally find out hes insane on the subject of liquor when he gets enougha glass of liquor in front of him he has to empty it and when the glass of liquor is empty he has to fill it now you start pushing this back again and you may find it at two years old while hes lying in his crib youyou may find the wildest piece of stuff see drink your milk drink your milk drink it up drink it up maybe the kids got temperature of 115 see drink your milk drink it up youve got to drink it now its good for you to drink it you know youd better drink it up drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink so he could drinkdrinkdrinkdrinkdrinkdrinkdrink the solution to all of existence drink well this fellow cant remember his home life and he cant remember his mother and he cant remember the names of little children and he cant remember this well you start scouting down this line someplace or another and you find out he cant remember what his memory is poor on and then if youve got the channelnow you as scientologist know that its very beneficial to get pc cogniting all cognition is is return of memory the reason why cognition is so very very beneficial to the person is because you are on the track where his memory is occluded and so therefore you are in the process of clearing something its quite elementary the pc cognites when his memory is returning if you are on an area where the pc is cogniting you must therefore be on an area where the pc was aberrated you must therefore be tracking fia helddown five if the pc never cognites you arent tracking down any five that the pc has got held down i mean its as elementary as that it isnt particular kind of pc that cognites and some pcs cognite and some pcs dont cognite this is not true what is true is when you are tracking down an area of where the person is unclear you are going down an occlusion area the person cant remember on that chain and when you start cutting into that area why he all of sudden remembers and we call it cognition he has ideas and he puts the thing together and he has realizations and hewe give it the general blanket title of cognition well if youre not going down that track in other words if youre not processing what the pc has to have processed why you of course are not going to get any cognitions and you know very well processing pc who isnt cogniting is waste of time it would also be waste of time to process pc who isnt aberrated but if you are processing somebody you ought to be processing what theyre aberrated on you have to finish the sentence in other words the guy says well what do you wantwhatswhat is your general goal in processing well my general goal in processing is to get bigger well now if youre going to get anyplace on this thing youre going to have to keep your ears open all right good hes got general goal and hes going to get bigger all right thats fine lets buy that for little while and that sort of thing but remember that this was an oddsounding goal so were going to press this thing were going to push it were going to push it little more i dont care whether you say why or when or what or anything else lets push it and all of sudden we are going to find out well you see im very tiny are you this fellow is six foot two see all right youre very tiny well you just slid off of the rational being didnt you over into the ditch here someplace the guy is six foot two and hes complaining because he is very tiny well if you were to say well how big should you be oh well i ought to be at least normal size well good whats normal size six foot two and the reason you dont find these aberrations in people youre not looking for anything thats nutty see you are all the time prospecting for something that is normal you can always find the normal people are far more normal than they are crazy something like somebody sent you out to look for red rock in whole desert full of gray rocks and you keep coming back and you say well i found gray rock and i found gray rock and i found sure you found gray rock you idiot the place is full of them anybody can find gray rock how about finding red rock well maybe they dont exist why maybe they dont exist look for them anyhow you know why i think it exists because your pcyour pc doesnt look good so i think there must be red rock around there someplace all right well letsill go out and find it all of sudden if you reallyif you really know your business youll pick up red rock you know and youll say my god red rock you know you hug it to your bosom oh youyou want to be normally tall well all right well how big is normally tall six foot two now you have to be enough of an auditor not to say incredulously at this minute but you idiot you are six feet two now youve found yourself red rock see in sea of gray rocks see you could find any quantity of gray rocks dont bother with them you see just handle gray rocks until you see there is one edge sticking up of something that might be red rock and then you follow that on down now you dig for this red rock and you find this fellow not only is not six feet two and is not normal size but hes only three years old marvelous well you try to plot it youreyoure going toyoure going to be in trouble you startwhat we used to call writing scriptyou try to write this guys script for him you could never guess these corners because they are just totally aberrated see thats the trouble with them they dont go in logical sequence and you suffer from the fact as an auditor that you are not getting logical sequence so you try to hang it up together so its logical and of course the reason he is crazy on that particular subject is it is not logical and never will be not till the sun perishes in the sky will that be logical so theres point in being logical about it your attitude is you want to be informed and youll eventually find out all about it now if you know your business real sharp and with this new technology on the subject of overts and words in definitions and so forth youre going to run it back to some traumatic experience of some kind or another where word was grossly misdefined where word was really knocked in the head youre going to run it back so you know what youre trying to run it back to you know what he doesnt understand you know where youre trying to get to and you all of sudden would be able to put your finger on this and the guy says do you know ive always he tells you now see do you know ive always thought of myself as being three years old and you know im not i just realized that huh thats funny isnt it how beingi dont know you know therethere must have been something happenedthatthat would make think that sort of thing i wonder what it could be help him out keep him talking keep him plowing keep your meter running lets just see if we can find this and all of suddenyou see hes going in on the top of the thing to that degreeyou all of sudden findfind this wild bit of business he had always thought of himself as little fellow and he had to go on thinking of himself as little fellow because of some weird wild reason andand the wordthe word fellow is misdefined it meansit means splendid being or something see and it means that some ally always referred to him as little fellow and hes got it firmly fixed in his skull one way or the otherwith overts and withholds and nonsense all mixed uphes got it firmly fixed in his skull that if he goes on being little fellow then everybody will like him and he will be all right and he can get away with it and see and he can live but actually little fellow doesnt mean what he thinks little fellow does mean but it does mean it but it doesnt mean it and all of sudden he gets this thing all straightened out and you watch that button come up on the adding machine now he can think on this subject of size he can get the proper answers on the subject of sizes he can get the proper answers on the subject of his relationship with other people he can get proper answers with regard to children he can get proper answers on anything associated with that particular subject and on that subject he is cleared what does clear mean it means on any given subject not nuts anymore on any given subject not nuts anymore expand the definition on any given subject where the person has been pretty confounded cottonpicking nuts he is not now nuts i dont know how to make it any plainer without introducing more complicated words this fellow is nowyou would have to put it into framework of relationship on the subject of children this man is clear that would be an interesting attitude but then that would be perfect accurate one now when youve got majority of these points plowed up on the individual so that there are great obvious ones around on which he is nuts you would then have person that you could bend the terminology around and call clear which would only however be short for cleared person or cleared ability to think now were right down to rock bottom when we are talking about this sort of thing now when we talk of clearing the basic business of an auditor on the subject of clearing would use any technique or any technology which located i mean any scientology technology none of the rest of them will which located areas of aberrationthat would be the selectionlocated areas of aberration in the being areas of aberration in the being not tried to determine whether he was sane or insane or something of the sort and then which followed those areas down until the individual recognized an earlier causation for this condition and the nature of aberration is such that he actually couldnt put it back together again if you gave him mortar sticks stones and psychiatrist he couldnt go nuts on that subject again if he tried so talk about the instability or the impermanence of clear is nonsense the person who has been alleviated on one particular area cant really make himself crazy on that area again he has an awful time because hes now not only got the thing gone which was being very tenuously held together by some horrendous series of mishaps and oddball circumstances you see the chances of becoming aberrated this way were very slight to begin with you see and it happened that all the right conditions existed for his particular temperament at any givenat some given moment and they all came together at that moment why the exact combination necessary to produce this condition occurred now by the time youve gotten back and chipped few pieces off that why that all starts to fly apart well he cant put that back together again because hed have to have new experience of some kind of similar accidentals and just the odds are against it occurring you see now he also has the education of having been crazy on it and that is the real thing that defeats it he knows he has been nuts on it so then when he sees himself leaning toward condition where this condition might occur again and so forth he already preunderstands what might happen to him and it doesnt happen do you see so having had it is like being indoctrinated or vaccinated or something of the sort see inoculated or vaccinated well heshes got himselfhes got himself now ahe couldnt go nuts on that subject again if he tried all right the state of aof really cleared up alcoholic somebody had really worked with an alcoholic and cleared him all up well just the way ive been talking about processing you see using this type of system approach man that guy trying to become an alcoholic again would be awouldhe would be laughing thing i mean hed be very laughable object you know trying to lets see i guess i will be drunkard you know well liquor doesnt any longer have the same effect on him that it did dont you see and liquor believe has different effects on different people so this sloppy degradation that he always used to experience so deliciously and all that sort of thing that doesnt occur anymore you know it isnt that he doesnt get drunk he can probably get drunk or something of the sort but it doesnt have the same effects and he wouldhe couldhe could probably sit there and pour down the hooch by the tumblerful and maybe nothing would happen at all this would be very very horrible dont you see you wouldnt want to become an alcoholic again but im just giving you the reverse side of the coin that if he did hed have hard time to so talk about the instability of clear well person having to talk about how stable clears are is simply being driven to the wall of having to make statement without being able to explain the mechanics of the subject matter and hes having to make loose statement just to satisfy somebodys curiosity and thats very dangerous thing to do the actual facts of the case areis once person has been cleared on any given subject he hasnt got prayer of getting that way again so on subject on which an individual has been cleared he is not only stable he is unrecurrable it aint going to happen again now how clear can you get oh i dont know im sure you dont know but i can tell you that its not in the fieldtotal clearing does not happen to be in the field up to iv it doesnt happen to lie in that field or sphere of processing it requires new skills and the state reached is not state of being unaberrated on certain given subjects the state reached is cause over matter energy space time life and form and so forth which is the state of ot so the final state attainable is not state of clear but the state of total causation its different subject see youyouin the middle of aof flight you are all of sudden sayinghaving to say well this is total absolute well they are not only unobtainable in this particular case there is total absolute because it isnt the way it goes the reason it doesnt go that way is person has to have mind in order to become aberrated in that mind you see and clearing is something that applies to the mind clearing also applies to the individual in relationship to his mind or his mental abilities and clearing is subject which is very very very precisely related to finite state of existence my name is joe i live at 64 elm street in peoria on the planet earth at this corner of the universe and i happen to be news vendor this is finite existence you see labelable finite existence the ability to survive and to handle normal what you would call average sort of environment in other words were now talking in the realm of man is being who is inhabiting universe and we are not talking about anything unusual or anything remarkable or anything else were talking about being were talking about mind were talking about thinking were talking about experience and of course were assuming that it happens in the universe across span of time were assumwere assuming it happens from present time moment to present time moment to present time moment to pocketapocketa pocketapocketa pocketapocketa time track wereyou know that existence is going forward were talking about an existence in which one goes home and eats soup at six oclock you get the idea were talking about living well we have run fresh out of that subject when we go above this level and try to make clear into an absolute we just go fresh out of it because from that point on you dont clear you get all the side effects of clearing but youre off in different direction you are not trying to fix this guy up so he can think youre not trying to fix this guy so he can exso he can suffer or react what youreyoure not trying to even fix him up so he can remember youre trying to fix this guy upwell youre not even trying to fix this guy up do you understand and the final product that you wind up with has relationship whatsoever to fixedup guy it is total resumption of beingness at total causation and it doesnt take place necessarily any longer in the physical universe and it doesnt necessarily at all take place in finite time the final product that you are aiming for and to try to call this clear is impossible unless youve now bent the whole terms of clear all the way around backwards and said as escaped from or sidestepped from or something or other or if you treatedwell you just have to bend the term so creaky yeah we cleared him of living in the universe see it sounds kind of weird see so youve got to go off on different tack so clearing is an assist to finitemeaning within limitsexistence which just means that itsa guy is living thats all now bunch of people who have been indoctrinated in the world of religion or spiritualism or something are going to try to bend these two things together and they are going to take the supernatural or the unnatural or the totality of existence or the infinite mind in an infinite book or something like this and they are going to bend all these things together and try to wobble it up against the normalcy of existence or something and wow thats how they got tangled up in the first place man doesnt leap from state of total aberration to state of total divinity because of three flicks of prayer wheel its road that must be walked and its long road and the earliest part of that road is totally involved with the environment in which he finds himself the girl next door the cars restaurants theaters bosses economy and so forth and theyre all walked in that world and if he walks long enough in that world and if he graduates himself up along the line and he gets cleared of more and more of these aberrations and he is more and more free the gradient scale breaks down only at this point when he tries for his next goal he is going for broke he is going right on out dont you see he is longer walking in the finite existence now hes running things called gpms they are intimately associated with what makes mind how come he does all these things why is he on time track you see its handling different kind of problem and the people dont consider this normal let point that out an individual to have time at all would not be considered normal dont you see youre talking in different framework so how you could explain this framework lord knows if you tried to explain it on the basis of were going to clear him totally or something like that i dont know what youre talking about because clearing is finite existence of fixing the individual up so that he can get proper answers in proper world thats thethats the place where it belongs and thats about all there is to it now if were going to pull the bigthe big medicine drum out you know and were going towere going to bow down before the altars of godhelpus and figure out exactly what is mans relation to the cosmos what is mans relation to divinity what is the exact nature of this universe why were propounding philosophical questions that hes never even come within kicking distance of and most of the questions he hasnt even asked you look in vain for philosophy of whats man doing on time track you dont find it why he hasnt even gotten up that high now weve got different thing now weve got different thing now actually we have to shift gears and at this point we can longer strip away from the being just strip away strip away and shed and so forth weve got an individual who will appear as an individual now and through his understandings of what is around him and his exact handling of the masses and significance in his immediate vicinity dont you see and his gradual emergence and cognition of whats going on were knocking out his whole concept of existence and were replacing it with wha total knowingness of existence and that individual is merging toward causation not being cleared this individual is going to the point where he causes the past not cleared of the past the aberrations which youre taking away from in r6 are not timed aberrations thats what makes them very rough they are not something which when you date them on the meter they go away try dating gpm on meter some day it dates now very perfectly it isnt something that happened in the year 2681 bc or something see thats quite different than athan athan an implant something that happened within the universe you can date an implant and iti dont care if you know the line plot or not it will go bizzzz youve put on the time track in other words youve fit the thing in relationship to time well you fit it in against the gpms in relationship to time and of course you get some very interesting things occurring you get any engram or experience such as we are talking about when we are talking about clearing and you only have to date it and it will tend to just go bizzz you find the exact experience you are looking for and date itbizzzz pc wouldnt have prayer getting the thing back yeah but wheres this time come from that you are dating it in do i make my point that we are in an entirely different field now we are asking the question of where does the time come from that you are dating the clearing in ah well now youre in the field of r6 youre in the field of ot you are in the field of recreation of the individual youre in the field of the individual rising up toward total cause it is very very long and arduous road even then it is not short road we can sit there and run gpms my god and run more gpms my god and runyou dont run out of them very fast and you raise your head and look around at the existence in which you find yourself still surrounded and so forth and you reorient yourself bit and move up the line and one day you happen to notice accidentally that you are moving much faster than you ordinarily would move you just notice it in passing because it doesnt bother you somebody who lived around you consistently and observed you consistently from normal viewpoint and so forth would notice one christawful difference if youll pardon the french but you wouldnt even notice see you say well thats funny thing i dont think ive been worried about that for the last two or three months thats very odd but i was able to finish up that job in fifteen minutes you know and it used to take all evening to do that you know just fleeting idea you know comparison so on little lock blew or something like that he paid further attention to it the individual is coming back up to where he is more causative over the universe hes less worried about what the universe is doing to him and so he doesnt add it uphe ceases to add it up to selfprogress do you get the idea see hes longer looking at it in this particular field im just trying to give you that theres separation point here where you walk from the finite universe and start into the infinite the world of total philosophy the world of total beingness the approaches towell not only whether did the chicken or the egg come first but who thought up the question which came first the chicken or the egg see youre off into another line now we are going for broke now people who are interested in clearing are normally interested in their physical condition they are interested in their mental responses they are interested in their behavior pattern in its relationship to other human beings they are interested in accomplishing finite goals in the physical universe such as how do i keep my job how can i better my economics theyre interested in this particular field of course person going up the other track if he hasnt totally followed clearing track and so forth is still interested in those things too perhaps not as absorbedly but still quite interested but people are only interested in that who are very interested in clearing this is subject which takes that area in hand now we get long run of this thing and we take some guy who is gibbering screaming mess in some insane asylum and were going to take off enough separateunderstand separateaberrations off of him were notyou see as long as we approach this as anas an all subject were going to lose this guy is insane and we are going to return sanity to him that is why you just cant take that little old needle and stick it into the bottle and get three ergs worth of lepidus guk 652 and squirt it in his gluteus maximus and have him all of sudden be in perfect condition and so forth its perhaps beautiful dream but its very batty one and it shows that there is understanding of what theyre up against at all see were going to take this bird and there he is gibbering inside the gates and were going to take up separate aberrations the ones that we can contact the ones that he could free himself of and one by one shake these things down we are going to see that his general state improves that is probably what makes people believe that he is being generally made saner you see hes not generally being made saner hes being cleared of separate and distinct areas of aberration now we could also say that his memory is improving but whatthat leads us again into culdesac we should say he can now remember in certain definite specific areas and wereweve made bettera better approach and this fellow eventually is risen up to point of where hes only worried about the bedbugs which are biting him all night long except nobody can find them and we finally even get that one traced back and this was the symptom that landed him in the insane asylum in the first place so now suddenly people pronounce him sane youactually you couldnt ever have said he was totally insane and he is certainly long way from totally sane now he just isnt worried about these bedbugs anymore anywaythat doesnt make him sane you are not sane because you dont worry about bedbugs you get the point so there would be sense in making general statement about the bird but lets say now he isnt any longer dangerous to society so we can let him loose all right now that guy has got long long road to walk man that roadthat road is very hard road to look down even with great big signal spyglass youyou have to look down with lot of power on that glass just to begin to see the vanishing point of that road you wouldnt ever see the gates at the other end of it youve got to walk down that road and hebecause he had lot longer to walk than anybody else now instead of just abandoning this fellow and saying he is now sane so were not going to worry about him if you were going to carry him on up the line you would have to continue clearing his aberrations and it would just be the process of finding an area on which he was bit rahhh and run this back and find out what was the cause of that and knock that one out and square that up and now lets find another area where he is gluuup and lets locate the basic causation on that and lets walk him down this road and all of sudden this guy is flying well someplace along this line he ceases to be interested in becoming clear of his past somewhere along the line he ceases to be interested in this and he begins to be very sincerely not on an unreality but he begins to be sincerely interested in causation personal individual causation what is his relationship and responsibility in regard to the physical universewith regard to the physical universe whats his relationship to the physical universe what is his relationship to other people exactly where is he going now you can also go nuts in this direction and think you are god or something of the sort but that would only happen if you were still inside the gates so you start thinking in these other terms and immediately there is another road it isnt this infinite road that walks endlessly to distant and neverapproachable horizon see it is another road and its actually shorter road but it is shorter in terms of is it closer to alpha centauri you see or beta centauri see its still long road but it happens to be finite road in its turn only its nowyou see clearing now became almost an infinite road because actually youve gotten to point of where the individual could recognize his basic gpms he could recognize where these things came from and that sort of thing well theres point in clearing him because you see ordinary clearing procedures wont touch him so clearing at that point ceases all right now you walk over here into the long road of running gpms and theres plenty of them and theres lots of tricks in them and you have your ups and downs and so forth and now you actually dont start noticing your tremendous forward progress your progress is probably two or three hundred times per unit of auditing time what it was under clearing but person is interested in different things so he doesnt pay much attention to the forward progress he very soon gets over the idea of wanting to blow out the electric light wondering if he could and short circuiting things like this he very soon gets over it he gets more seriousminded about the situation because it becomes more real to him it becomes more natural to him and he walks on up the line he stops worrying about other people getting to be ots and all kinds of little oddball things fall away and hes got thehes got an end of trail in view its finite it doesnt lai mean it doesnt go on forever but there is your road see these are roads which we are taking and they are not one road dont you see one has to do with processing somebody within the limits of time and experience and it has the deletional aspects of looking for things whichthat delete you have to delete from the individual in order to make him get right answers in existence you see and you are looking for those specific things and you are diagnosing them in certain ways and youre running them down youve got different approach now you can strip away gpms pow pow pow but theres lots of them you longer have this same approach to auditing your auditing character changes the individuals reaction to auditing changes lot of these things shift you could still take somebody who is running that road and you can put them back on clearing again you can do various things well isnt that interesting that you can shift them from one of these processes back to another one the odd part of it is is after he has started on the ot road you cant shift him back too much or too far or his meter jams it isnt whether or not he likes it or not but youre liable to shift him back over onto finite clearing and he has already exceeded this and what youll do is in trying to give him finite clearing he simply collides with the next gpm and it jams the meter in other words the only thing that is dominant or able to influence this case now is gpm and the locks are all on top of gpms theyre not any longer on top of traumatic or life experiences these are different actions well now as far as clear is concerned lets go back to where we started out if you leave yesterdays total on the adding machine without ever understanding it or cleaning it up youre going to have hell of time getting the right answer today the wrong answer is going to add into every line the button on the machine called clear thats where we get the term clear thats what clearing is all about why anybody should go into violent fit because we have mentioned clear in national magazine and somebody saying oh hes going to start that again yes he is hes going to find the person that said that and he is going to start it again well now that gives you an idea of the approach to the definition of word and how much can go awry and how upset people can get over the definition of word now actually trying to explain the definition of word without the technology required in the explanation can only be done in the field of allegory and you can only go so far in the field of allegory without getting into hell of lot of trouble so i invite you to use all the allegory you want right up to the point you find yourself drowning on the subject and then to shift gears and get down to brass tacks but you cant get in too much trouble trying to explain this if you really understand what it is but it takes lot of understanding the term in the first place is not an elevated term its good lousy mesty typewriter mechanic type of term you know its corny clear you can see the guy now on the bench all covered with grease and so forth and he keeps yanking the lever of this thing and the damn thing wont clear actually you are in the same boots in much cleaner and more elevated position when you keep looking at the pc and the pc keeps saying but my father beat and beat and beat but you cant ever locate one single moment when his father ever beat him but my father just beat day and night day and night day and night morning noon and night my father beat and my father beat and my father beat and that is all you can get out of this pc well you feel like yanking his lever hard and you cant find any entrance point on the thing well you must be looking to some point that isnt an entrance point on the subject of clearing anything thats what you have to decide after while because it isnt going anywhere and you werent clearing anything so you sure better find something that you can clear and thats what generally defeats the auditor when he approaches this subject of clearing is he gets his pc into some area that either doesnt have to be clearedthe pc is already sane in that areaor the pc has leaped into some area which is not about to be cleared theres some interim area in between those two that is approachable and the auditor unable to find this gets desperate and says there is such thing as clearing you cant clear there are clears nothing could ever be cleared see he gets desperate but his only error is that on the one side he may have been looking for something that didnt need clearing and on the other side of the thing he may have been looking so deep into this case that he is not about to produce relief of anything of the sort he is not on track then that is going to produce relief and that doesnt mean that necessarily the aberration was too big or it was too small or it was too this or too that also it might not exist it may be just advertising of another aberration and then he is defeated of course also when he tries to get too logical about whats wrong with pc if he tries to take how logical the pcs reactions are or illogical they are and make them logical by some sequence of events which he himself is explaining hell almost always be wrong about the pc almost always because you see he is describing something that is nutty and of course what makes it nutty is it doesnt make sense and the auditor sitting there trying to make it make sense is going to be wrong because it is nutty see im going to leave my husband because he is brute and he goes out every night with strange women and the auditor all of sudden can find real infidelity on the part of the husband as matter of fact little bit of checkup finds out this pc has been telling this to other auditors the husband is pretty desperate about this situation because his wife keeps saying this all the time husband hasnt been out of the house for fifteen years well now you can just see you now sit there and try to figurefigurefigure out now why is this girl doing that well thats the wrong approach thats totally the wrong approach all you have to do is recognize that she is not clear on the subject of husbands because she is getting wrong answers wrong answers she isnt clear all right whats the helddown five well of course the thing that parallels helddown five of course is bad recollection of that particular area so we could just improve recollection of the area see we could use other approaches on the subject of husbands well actuallyactually old creative processing you know wasnt that bad it was just because it bit pc here or there and so forth when theyd get into the big gpm on the subject you could actually have her mock up two husbands for short while or something and something is going to change dont you see but youve got to work on the subject of the datum shes got in wrong either by improving her memory on the subject or by clarifying her view on the subject or getting her to recall subject or i dont know call the husband and have her reach and withdraw from him for while it doesnt matter what youre doing youve got to open up this track and youve got several lines by which you could open up the track and you keep trying to open up the track sooner or later the pc is all of sudden going to start cogniting you find out it wasnt quite husbands it was homeshomes thats the one that is making sense now the pc starts cogniting homes you know its stay home and go away from home and the husband goes away from home and its home see but home was always present in the pcs statements too only you never heard it see ah well homes well lets get down to brass tacks now on the subject of homes well how many homes have you had thsuhduhbvow rememberrememberremember dadada homes oh my god yes i mustve lived in forty fifty i didnt have any home when i was little boy boohoohoo now we get the missemantic of house all of sudden house and theres some misdefinition and incomprehension on the word house and its all in backwards and its all upsidedown it doesnt make any sense and it hasnt got anything to do with anything and that suddenly pulls out of the lineup and house was in there with the wrong association and upset and so forth and so forth and that wasthen caused traumatic experience after the fact on the subject of house and homes and then caused building aberration on the subject of house and homes dont you see and then caused lots of overts on the subject of home and then caused justification of the overts on the subject of home and then caused tremendous necessity for motivators on the subject of home and the motivators turned out to be the husband the only person around the homethe home never kicks you in the shins but husbands can be made to do so so now weve got the thing all untangled it all goes up the line and everythinglife goes along beautifully after that you see how it worked out but it just worked out by you getting in there any way you could to ventilate this particular area and move it back by any type of processand you have many of them and it winds up at the other end you have now cleared this person on the subject of husbands houses and homes but dont be too upset if you find out next month that youve also got to clear the person on the subject of family this was separate one but if they had one that was that crazy that close then they were pretty plowed in when you first came along see they had lots of them because the closer the association between two distinct areas of aberration the closer they are found to be together why the more of them the person has its quantitative you dont have big aberrations and small aberrations its lots of aberrations and not many aberrations you got it the violence of the aberration is usually pretty violent and the nuttiness is very nutty but it isnt even necessarily dramatic or interesting thats another thing that is upsetting to auditors sometimes theyre sitting there with their tongue hanging out to find the blood at the other end of this thing because maybe they found out it caused near murder and then they find out that it had merely to do with being hit over the head with gin bottle when they were two because it fell off the sideboard and theytheyits like waiting for the other shoe to drop you know that was the total incident the pc is trying to make more out of it and so forth you know drunken father drunken mother we find out suddenly neither one of them ever drank much and we finally find this gin bottle falling off the sideboard there issomething happened and it will be very anticlimactic sometimes sometimes it goes quite in the reverse youre following down this line that the person just doesnt like to see threads around and that sort of thing and you suddenly run yourself into great big juicy murder its quite unpredictable because its crazy and its crazy because its not susceptible to comprehension and the person cant add it up because it isnt comprehensible but you can findtoday find the source of it and plow it up and throw it away so you can clear and clearing is permanent thats all okay audience yes thank you
