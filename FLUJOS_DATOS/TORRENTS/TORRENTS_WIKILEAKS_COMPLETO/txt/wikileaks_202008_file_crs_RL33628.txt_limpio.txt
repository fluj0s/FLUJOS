of development assistance provided by the united states and other donors to help developing countries participate in and benefit from global trade in addition to helping developing countries negotiate and implement trade agreements tcb includes development assistance for agricultural development customs administration business training physical infrastructure development financial sector development and labor and environmental standards some experts believe that tcb is necessary for developing countries to adjust to trade liberalization and achieve tradeled economic growth in fy2007 the united states obligated about 14 billion in tcb worldwide the us agency for international development usaid funds and implements the majority of us tcb programs in fy2005 the millennium challenge corporation mcc began to fund tcb activities and in fy2006 and fy2007 it overtook usaid as the agency with the highest tcb obligations other agencies also provide tcb including the us department of agriculture the department of commerce the treasury department the department of labor and the us trade and development agency ustda the united states also contributes to multilateral funds for tcb and it contributes to multilateral development banks such as the world bank which also provide tcb programs congress has played key role in tcb by providing funding through appropriations legislation in the 109th congress the house passed measure to create trade capacity enhancement fund in the 2007 foreign operations appropriations bill hr 5522 but this measure was not included in the senate bill the 110th congress directed the administration to use at least 550 million of foreign aid appropriations for tcb in the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 pl 110161 tcb may become key part of the 110th congress discussions on potential free trade agreements ftas with developing countries renewal of trade promotion authority tpa and us involvement in the doha round of wto negotiations the 110th congress may also be interested in using tcb to increase the effectiveness of trade preference programs initiated through legislation such as the african growth and opportunity act agoa in the past congress has passed legislation restricting the use of foreign assistance for certain activities promoting trade in developing countries while tcb generally has tradepromoting motivations any resulting increased import competition could also raise congressional concern this report describes trade capacity building and discusses the history of tcb in foreign assistance it also provides an

commitments of trtatcb by donor for selected donors 24 trade capacity building foreign assistance for trade and development introduction trade capacity building tcb can be broadly defined as development assistance aimed at helping countries build the physical human and institutional capacity to participate in global trade it includes assistance to negotiate implement and benefit from trade agreements such as agreements within the world trade organization wto and regional and bilateral free trade agreements many experts consider tcb to be vital for developing countries to benefit from trade liberalization and to participate actively in the global economy in turn trade liberalization and participation in the global economy are considered important factors in promoting economic growth and poverty reduction this report examines key issues in tcb provides an overview of us and international tcb programs and explores congressional involvement in tcb tcb is provided by bilateral donors such as the united states the european commission individual european countries and japan korea and canada multilateral institutions such as the world bank the interamerican development bank idb the world trade organization wto and the united nations also provide tcb direct recipients of tcb include government ministries customs officials business owners local nongovernmental organizations ngos and farmers tcb can take the form of workshops onthejob training data collection feasibility studies infrastructure upgrades and efficiency improvements in procedures ideally developing countries incorporate tcb needs in their national development plans and tcb programs are planned in partnership between recipient and donor countries the us government provides tcb assistance to developing countries worldwide on bilateral basis and through contributions to multilateral organizations and established global tcb trust funds the us agency for international development usaid has historically provided the bulk of us tcb assistance but other agencies such as the us department of agriculture usda us department of commerce and us trade and development agency ustda also provide such assistance the millennium challenge corporation mcc first provided tcb assistance in fy2005 and in fy2006 and fy2007 its tcb funding obligations surpassed those of usaid us tcb is not currently discrete line item with its own budget it is funded through several different initiatives within usaid and other agencies in fy2007 us government agencies reported obligating nearly 14 billion to tcb of which over 1 billion was obligated by the mcc and crs2 usaid1 according to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the united states allocated about 25 of its total official development assistance oda to tcb between 2002 and 20052 interest in tcb has grown in the donor community both in the united states and abroad as developing countries become more involved in trade negotiations trade capacity becomes higher priority issue for them and for donors developing countries from every region have entered free trade agreement fta negotiations with the united states or the european union they have also been heavily engaged in the doha round of wto negotiations in order to conclude the doha round and other trade negotiations developing country needs may require consideration and that may include additional resources for tcb congress has several policy interests in tcb first tcb may be included in some potential free trade agreements ftas the united states has concluded fta negotiations with some developing countries and congress may be asked to consider implementing legislation for these potential ftas congress also appropriates funds for tcb through usaid and other budgets congress may play role in oversight of tcb programs to ensure effectiveness and adherence to us interests tcb is also considered compliment to us trade preference programs such as the african growth and opportunity act agoa which congress oversees finally tcb is provided to developing countries through their participation in the wto and has been topic of discussion in the doha development agenda dda round of negotiations3 congress may consider implementing legislation for wto agreement and tcb could be important in that discussion defining trade capacity building there is set definition of tcb in trade and development public policy discourse narrow definition of tcb might include only assistance directly related to trade agreements such as assistance to negotiate and implement such agreements however tcb is usually defined more broadly to include all types of development assistance that directly affect countrys capacity to participate in trade this broader definition of tcb is assumed for the purpose of this report see the box on page 4 for elaboration on the various areas of tcb assistance the assistance contained within the broad definition of tcb includes addressing the regulatory environment for business trade and investment supplyside constraints such as low productive and entrepreneurial capacity and inadequate physical infrastructure such as transport and storage facilities the goals of tcb include overcoming adjustment costs from liberalized trade offsetting high implementation costs of trade 1 data was selfreported by us government agencies and can be found on the us trade capacity building database website httpqesdbusaidgovtcbindexhtml 2 aid for trade at glance 2007 1st global review organization

negotiations the doha development agenda by ian fergusson crs3 agreements offsetting preference erosion from multilateral liberalization offsetting lost tariff revenue improving negotiating capacity and addressing supplyside constraints that make it difficult for developing countries to compete in world markets4 risk of defining tcb too broadly is that almost any assistance activity can be loosely defined as tcb there are many areas of assistance that focus on domestic policy and capacity issues in developing country for example business regulatory regimes but also have direct consequences for trade however there are other areas of assistance such as providing training to local microenterprises that are not likely to engage in international trade where the linkage to trade is often not clear in some cases two similar projects in different countries can be similarly described on paper but may be implemented with different objectives in mind one project may be strongly traderelated while another may not qualify strongly as tcb this poses problem when examining the aggregate tcb data it is useful to know the total amounts of tcb assistance provided to different countries for summary purposes but this data should be viewed as an inexact estimate of tcb rather than as definitive tool for measuring tcb assistance trade capacity building has some synonyms it is also referred to as aid for trade or traderelated technical assistance trta especially within the context of the wto some distinctions can be made between these terms but since there is agreement on them they are treated as interchangeable within this report categories of tcb most developing countries lack the physical institutional or human capacity to participate effectively in world trade physical capacity includes infrastructure essential to trade such as ports roads and storage facilities institutional capacity refers to the business and trade policy environment in addition to the strength of the financial sector institutional capacity relates to the existence of effective administrative and regulatory regimes including property rights and formal business registration procedures human capacity refers to the technical competence of individuals such as government officials entrepreneurs and producers to contribute to international trade the box on the following page breaks down further the different categories of tcb 4 international lawyers and economists against poverty ileap aid for trade why and how crs4 areas of tcb assistance trade facilitation improving the efficiency of international trade flows through reducing the costs and time required for goods to cross borders mainly achieved through simplification and harmonization of fees and procedures customs

definitions on the usaid tcb database website crs5 why trade capacity building trade capacity building is based on the premise that trade liberalization leads to economic growth for both developed and developing countries but developing countries do not have the capacity to achieve tradeled economic growth without assistance on more basic level tcb assumes that donors can have an impact on trade capacity in developing countries tcb is often cited as an important complement to market access which is believed to be necessary but insufficient for developing countries to increase participation in trade other reasons given for tcb are to offset preference erosion and the adjustment costs of trade liberalization market access may be insufficient increased market access through preferential treatment trade agreements and other programs may not be sufficient to increase developing countries participation in international trade beginning with the generalized system of preferences gsp5 in the 1970s the united states and other developed countries have provided increased market access to products from developing countries through trade preference programs trade preference programs provide dutyfree andor quotafree access to certain products from certain developing countries with stated limitations such as rules of origin despite the gsp and other trade preference programs such as the african growth and opportunity act agoa6 most developing countries have not substantially increased their trade globally or with the united states perhaps more importantly many developing countries have not diversified their exports out of primary commodities low income developing countries have faired the worst between 1990 and 2003 low income developing countries only increased their share of the global market for nonoil trade by one half percentage point and least developed countries ldc have only maintained their market share during the same time period middle income countries increased their market share by about 14 percentage points7 few exceptions have occurred in countries that have attracted investments in textile and apparel manufacturing some critics blame the lack of trade growth on the preference programs themselves arguing that the rules of origin are too stringent or that the programs exclude products in which developing countries have competitive advantage8 also the temporary nature of preference programs may add greater uncertainty to an already risky business environment discouraging both foreign and domestic 5 see crs report 97389 generalized system of preferences by william h cooper 6 agoa pl 106200 was signed into law in 2000 see crs report rl31772 us trade and investment relationship with subsaharan africa the african growth and opportunity

november 2005 8 bernard hoekman and susan prowse policy responses to preference erosion from aid as trade to aid for trade presented at the international symposium preference erosion impacts and policy responses geneva june 1314 2005 crs6 investment other experts believe that trade capacity is more important factor than any of the above it is broadly accepted that many developing countries have not benefitted from market access opportunities because of inadequate knowledge of these opportunities noncompetitive production capacity lack of the necessary exporting infrastructure inability to meet prevailing standards in high value export markets and being crowded out of some markets by domestic support and export subsidies of developed countries9 this view is not new 1980 congressional budget office cbo report found that actual exports depend on the ability of the economy to produce competitively and preferences of the sort granted by gsp may not be sufficient to compensate for the differences in competitiveness among countries or between us producers and those in developing countries10 trade preference erosion trade preference erosion is concern in the few countries where preference programs have had significant impact such as in lesotho and bangladesh where booming apparel industries have increased incomes and employment trade preference erosion may cause decline in the emerging apparel industries in these and other countries because as trade liberalization occurs their margin of preference is reduced11 the margin of preference is the difference between the cost of the duty andor quota for most favored nation mfn exporters and the developing country exporters receiving preferential treatment with reduced margin of preference the developing countries may longer be competitive with more developed lowercost producers such as china this prospect has prompted certain developing country wto members to oppose tariff reductions in certain goods on the basis that it would diminish their preferences tcb may mitigate the effects of trade preference erosion by helping developing countries to increase their competitiveness in the industries in question and diversify into other areas some observers consider it to be more politically feasible than monetary compensation which has been proposed by some developing countries as possible solution adjustment costs the united states and other donors may provide tcb to help developing country economies overcome adjustment costs and facilitate smooth transition to liberalized trade adjustment costs occur when certain sectors of the economy are negatively affected by trade liberalization even though the economy as whole may benefit through increased growth trade may cause decreased production in the least efficient sectors of the economy and increased production in the more efficient sectors during the transition period land labor and capital resources that had been 9 international lawyers and

development window into the issues world bank november 2005 crs7 employed in the least productive sectors may become idle this translates to land and capital investments losing value and workers becoming unemployed as production increases in the more efficient sectors of the economy throughout the transition workers may find new jobs and other resources are expected to regain value as they are put to use in growth sectors in developing countries this transition period can be especially slow and difficult and may never really end certain regions especially in rural areas may not attract new industries to replace employment opportunities lost from the less efficient sectors therefore tcb aims to help developing countries cope with this dislocation the historical context for tcb the development community was skeptical about using trade as vehicle for economic growth and development in the 1960s and 1970s at the time import substitution industrialization isi where developing countries limited imports of manufactured products to foster domestic manufacturing sector was the prevailing theory in trade and development aid was used to support industrialization and not to foster trade in the 1980s after the apparent failure of isi policies there was shift in mainstream development thinking to the view that removing barriers to trade and other market distortions would foster growth as the expected gains from trade and economic reforms did not materialize another shift in development thought took place in the late 1990s the development agenda changed its focus to strengthening institutions that support markets and tradeled growth development experts recognized that liberalized trade was necessary but not sufficient for increased growth and poverty reduction12 at the same time capacity development became popular term during the 1990s reflecting the need for demanddriven assistance as opposed to assistance imposed from outside and based primarily on what donors were willing and able to provide13 tcb grew from these ideas about trade and development since the beginning of us development assistance in the 1950s us development programs have had elements of what we now refer to as tcb assistance the types of tcb assistance provided from agricultural development to transportation infrastructure have changed based on the evolving focus of overall us development assistance the composition and focus of such assistance over the last 60 years have been determined mainly by changes in us foreign policy prevailing theories of development and domestic administrative realities14 12 eric miller achievements and challenges of trade capacity building practitioners analysis of the cafta process and its lessons for the multilateral system occasional

tcb emerged as concept in us development assistance parlance around 1999 even though many of the programs included in tcb had been ongoing for years before tcb the terms used for similar assistance were generally technical assistance or technical cooperation the development of tcb as concept brought some changes to the planning and implementation of tcb programs in the past these programs were conceived as general economic development programs and not necessarily formed with wider trade agenda in mind more importantly capacity building relies on partnership with beneficiaries involving variety of actors including government private sector and nongovernmental organizations ngos15 tcb programs are also meant to be planned in coordination with trade policy with tcb on the agenda trade officials both in the united states and in developing countries may have greater influence on development policy than they did previously overview of us bilateral trade capacity building according to the usaid trade capacity building database16 us government agencies obligated 14 billion in tcb assistance worldwide in fy2007 tcb is funded through variety of us agencies and budgets and includes variety of programs from agricultural development to wto accession the united states began tracking its tcb assistance in 1999 and according to the tcb database it climbed steadily every year until fy2006 from 370 million in 1999 to 14 billion in 2006 and 2007 it is possible that this apparent fourfold increase over seven years is partly due to greater reporting of tcb assistance by the responsible agencies as well as an inclination to include more activities within the definition of tcb however there has also been increased interest in tcb which may have led to greater funding for more programs from fy1999 to fy2005 usaid funded the majority of tcb assistance in 2005 it funded 52 of total us government tcb assistance about 66 in 2004 and around 70 in previous years in fy2006 the mcc became the largest us government funder of tcb with 6103 million or 44 of total us tcb as compared to 4731 million from usaid in fy2007 the mcc funded even more tcb 7754 million or 55 of total

integrated framework if preference programs and performance measures figure 4 below shows breakdown of the different agencies shares of tcb funding in 2005 some agencies implement tcb funded by other agencies so figure 5 which illustrates tcb assistance implementation rather than funding shows slightly wider distribution of tcb implementation across agencies for example the department of labor and the department of agriculture both fund their own programs and implement tcb activities funded by other agencies such as usaid and the state department this interagency cooperation is an example of agencies coordinating their activities through the interagency group the other category represents greater share of tcb program implementation because many agencies with relatively small tcb programs are funded by other agencies low level of tcb funding by particular agency may not be indicative of inconsequential involvement in tcb some important tcb programs require less funding than others infrastructure development is inherently more expensive and workshops are less expensive one us government office with significant role in tcb is not included in the us tcb database that is ustr which

httpqesdbcdieorgtcbindexhtml the fact that tcb is provided by many different us government agencies has been cited as both an advantage and source of concern on the advantage side more agency involvement means greater support from wider pool of expertise and funding options in some cases expertise is at least as important as funding and it can be helpful to have us regulatory agencies understand tcb objectives one example of this benefit is the us department of agricultures animal and plant health inspection service aphis aphis is primarily regulatory agency with the responsibility of protecting us agriculture from foreign pests and diseases obtaining clearance from aphis has been notoriously difficult for agricultural producers from developing countries some have argued that bringing aphis into tcb has not only benefitted developing countries by providing additional expertise but has raised awareness of this problem within aphis the issue of regulatory agencies providing tcb has raised some concerns some observers caution that the mission of regulatory trade agencies generally to protect the united states from potentially harmful imports conflicts with that of tcb generally to encourage imports from developing countries this conflict of interest may result in either ineffective tcb or protection or both the other major concern about the variety of us government agencies in tcb is that it can be difficult to coordinate activities across the agencies crs14 table 2 selected us agencies with tcb programs fy2006 and fy2007 tcb implementation agency in millions

core strategies of usaid the usaid strategy for tcb is laid out in its march 2003 document building trade capacity in the developing world according to this strategy document the agencys goal is to increase the number of developing and transition countries that are harnessing global economic crs15 forces to accelerate growth and increase incomes usaid aims to achieve this goal by supporting participation in trade negotiations implementation of trade agreements and economic responsiveness to trade liberalization the majority of usaid tcb programs focus on improving economic responsiveness to trade liberalization projects in this area include strengthening commercial laws and trade related services in the public sector as well as working with businesses and industries in the private sector to overcome supplyside constraints such as access to finance meeting international market standards and obtaining market information as the united states enters into more fta negotiations with developing countries usaid will likely respond to greater demand for assistance with participation in trade negotiations and implementation of trade agreements usaid plans funds and implements tcb activities at both the agency and country levels at the agency level usaid targets tcb assistance toward countries where governments are committed to reform and openness or where such governments are emerging especially ldcs when targeted in this way projects are expected to have the greatest impact on incomes at the country level individual country needs vary greatly and usaid field missions reportedly have the flexibility to respond to these individual tcb needs in planning their tcb assistance usaid field missions aim to consider wide range of local trade and investment factors and take

oecd maintain database of worldwide tcb activities including multilateral and bilateral efforts the world trade organization trade capacity building is commonly referred to as aid for trade and traderelated technical assistance trta within the wto technical assistance is an important aspect of the wto because many developing country members need assistance in understanding negotiating and implementing wto agreements developed countries have an incentive to provide such assistance because it helps ensure that developing country members understand the negotiated agreements and that they are able and willing to implement them it may also encourage developing countries to reach agreement in multilateral trade negotiations such as the doha round the wto provides tcb funded through its membersupported doha development agenda dda global trust fund and through the separate integrated framework if which the wto participates in along with five other multilateral institutions from january 2005 to september 2007 total contributions to the trust fund were about 47 million since the launch of the doha round the united states has contributed nearly 6 million to this fund its most recent contribution was 1 million in april 2006 the wto also serves as forum for donors to hold each other accountable on tcb and for developing countries to participate in the discussions at the hong kong ministerial in december 2005 the united states pledged to double its spending on tcb to 27 billion by 2010 and other donors made similar pledges the wto is working with the oecd to monitor tcb globally in order to provide an incentive for donors and developing countries to improve its effectiveness as part of this effort the united states and other member donor countries submit reports of bilateral tcb assistance to the wto which are then compiled and presented in joint wtooecd doha development agenda trade capacity building database18 technical assistance is also discussed as part of the wto negotiations technical assistance that is specifically related to the various negotiating areas such as trade facilitation is discussed in the individual negotiating groups in some negotiating areas developing countries are explicitly not held responsible for upholding agreements that they do not have the capacity to implement unless they are provided with adequate technical assistance discussions of crosscutting issues related to technical assistance such as whether to create new fund for trta take 18 available at httptcbdbwtoorgindexasplangeng crs22 place in the committee on trade and development and within the newly formed aid for trade task force the key objectives of the wtos technical cooperation and training include enhancing beneficiary countries capacity to 1 address trade policy issues 2 incorporate trade into national development and poverty reduction plans 3 participate more fully in the multilateral trade system 4 adjust to wto rules and disciplines and implement obligations and 5 exercise the rights of wto membership19 the wto delivers trta in the form of courses seminars workshops and conferences in the past critics have contended that the wto provides too much superficial training to too many individuals perhaps in response to this criticism the wto drastically reduced the number of its trta activities from 462 for 12000 participants in 2005 to 206 activities for 7400 participants in 2006 in 2002 the wto reached an estimated 16000 individuals through trta20 the wto provided 159 million in trtatcb assistance in 200521 aid for trade initiative the wto aid for trade task force was established at the december 2005 hong kong ministerial conference it was tasked with making recommendations to the wto general council on how to operationalize aid for trade and how it might contribute most effectively to the dda the task force released its recommendations at meeting of the wto general council on july 27 2006 the same meeting where the general council agreed to suspend the doha round of negotiations despite the suspension of wto negotiations the task force recommended that countries continue to provide aid for trade and that its recommendations still be implemented they made this recommendation with the caveat that aid for trade cannot be substitute for the development benefits that will result from successful conclusion to the dda particularly on market access22 at the october 2006 general council meeting wto members reportedly agreed to endorse the recommendations of the task force23 the recommendations of the task force include guidance on financing defining and overcoming some of the challenges associated with aid for trade the task force recommends that aid for trade should be guided by the paris declaration on aid effectiveness which focuses on key principles of country ownership donor coordination aligning aid to national development strategies and monitoring and evaluation the task force

ldcs to integrate trade issues into their national development strategies two key goals of the if are to better coordinate aid for trade globally and within countries donor coordination and to integrate aid for trade with general development assistance objectives six international institutions collaborate on the if including the world bank the wto the international monetary fund imf the international trade center itc the united nations conference on trade and development unctad and the united nations development program undp the if is funded by an if trust fund composed of voluntary contributions from multilateral and bilateral donors total contributions to this trust fund equaled 497 million as of march 2007 of which the united states contributed 800000 the first stage of the if process is the development of diagnostic for trade integration study dtis which is lengthy study on an individual country identifying constraints to trade sectors with the greatest export potential and an action plan for integrating the country into the global trading system the dtis is produced collaboratively by beneficiary country government officials economists from international institutions and experts from bilateral donor countries including the united states the dtis includes an action plan which is supposed to be integrated into the countrys national development strategy as part of the if process the national development strategy is usually the countrys poverty reduction strategy paper prsp which is developed in partnership with the world bank and imf bilateral donors are expected to provide tcb to implement each countrys action plan but small activities may be initially funded by the if trust fund according to the wto 47 of the ifs budget has been used toward diagnostic activities and 53 has gone toward implementing priority assistance activities critics of the if have said that it could be more effective if it included funding to implement more of the action plan rather than leave the bulk of implementation funding up to bilateral donors the if steering committee is reportedly in the process of implementing the enhanced integrated framework which would raise extra money for more ifimplemented activities other concerns raised about the if pertain to whether developing country officials and citizens are as involved in preparing the studies as they could be also some observers believe that the if should be extended to all developing country wto members and not just ldcs as of november 2007 fortyfive ldcs were at different stages of the if

on trade capacity building congress has passed appropriations legislation providing funds and guidance for trade capacity building other legislation passed by congress may restrict the provision of tcb either by limiting which countries can receive certain types of funding or by limiting the types of activities in which foreign assistance may be provided tcb appropriations funds are appropriated for tcb within the state and foreign operations appropriations act the 110th congress directed the administration to use at least 550 million of foreign aid appropriations for tcb in the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 pl 110161 this amount must come from the following foreign aid accounts development assistance da economic support fund esf assistance for eastern europe and baltic states andean counterdrug programs and assistance for the independent states of the former soviet union but does not include tcb from the mcc there has been slow and steady increase in funds allocated by congress to tcb this way in 2006 congress recommended that crs26 at least 522 million should be made available for tcb assistance of which 40 million 20 million from da and 20 million from esf were to be used for labor and capacity building activities relating to drcafta in previous years congress has designated somewhat lower amounts for tcb assistance tcb was first included in foreign operations appropriations in the fy2003 appropriations with total allocation of not less than 452 million 159 million from da and 25 million from the us trade and development agency tda in fy2004 the total allocation was not less than 503 million of which 190 million from da and in fy2005 the total was 507 million of which 194 million from da in fy2005 there was also an earmark of 20 million from esf to support tcb activities regarding labor and environment in the caftadr countries in the 109th congress the house version of the fy2007 foreign operations export financing and related programs appropriations bill hr 5522 would have included the creation of trade capacity enhancement fund in the amount of 522 million and an office of the director of trade capacity enhancement within usaid this new office would have been responsible for usaids tcb programs as well as coordinating governmentwide tcb programs of all us agencies these changes in the funding and management of tcb would have represented an initiative to make tcb higher priority they also prompted concerns about restricting the administrations flexibility to allocate foreign aid and draining resources from other foreign assistance priorities the senate version of the bill did not include this new fund or office and neither did any of the 2007 continuing resolution bills legislative limitations on tcb in the mid1980s congress passed legislation restricting the use of foreign development assistance programs in response to problems in the us farm economy some observers maintain that usaid developed policies that were more restrictive than necessary as result of the agencys sensitivity to congressional criticism27 one widely cited legislative restriction on usaids traderelated activities is known as the bumpers amendment which was first introduced in the urgent supplemental appropriations act of 1986 section 209 of pl 99349 the bumpers amendment states that us development assistance funds may be used for agricultural development activities for commodity that would compete with commodity grown or produced in the united states there are two exceptions to the bumpers amendment 1 where the activity is designed to increase food security in developing countries and it would not have significant impact in the export of agricultural commodities to the united states and 2 in the case of research activity intended primarily to benefit american producers usaid officials have cited the bumpers amendment as restricting tcb assistance in agriculture for example in the provision of assistance to west african cotton farmers 27 trade associations and foreign aid us commodity and industry interests and aid trade development activities agricultural policy analysis project phase ii january 1991 abt associates sponsored by the us agency for international development crs27 in addition to restrictions on agricultural assistance there are other restrictions on us foreign assistance that affect tcb assistance one such restriction originating in the fy1993 foreign operations appropriations section 599 of pl 102391 prohibits funds to be used as financial incentive for us firm to relocate outside of the united states to establish or develop an export processing zone epz in foreign country or for any project that would contribute to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights28 other restrictions affect aid to particular countries such as in the nethercutt amendment pl 109102 section 574 which restricts esf assistance to countries that are party to the international criminal court icc and have not signed an article 98 agreement29 these statutory restrictions are catalogued and summarized by usaid30 policy issues motivations for trade capacity building trade capacity building is generally regarded as an activity taken on by the united states and other donors for altruistic purposes to help developing countries benefit from trade and achieve poverty reduction there are other possible motivations for tcb that are not as altruistic one possible motivation is to create markets for us exports tcb might achieve this objective indirectly by increasing developing countries incomes which would in turn would allow developing countries to import more goods from the united states tcb can more directly create markets for us exports by influencing developing countries policies such as technical standards to be more open to us goods and by promoting development in sectors that would likely require imports of intermediate products and capital goods from the united states the us exportimport bank facilitates this process by providing loans to businesses in developing countries to import american capital goods such as factory equipment another possible motivation for providing tcb is to gain the cooperation of developing countries in trade negotiations both bilateral and multilateral by helping trade officials in developing countries understand the technical aspects of an agreement they are more likely to complete negotiations and implement the agreement developing countries are also more likely to be agreeable in negotiations if they expect to receive assistance in implementing the agreement an example of 28 this legislation developed out of controversy where usaid had allegedly funded epzs and other incentives for us businesses to relocate overseas see crs report 92931 f foreign aids role in private sector promotion in developing countries the controversy over the us agency for international development by erin day archived available from the author 29 an article 98 agreement prevents the icc from proceeding against us personnel present in that country see crs report rl31495 us policy regarding the international criminal court by jennifer k elsea 30 see fy2007 statutory checklists an additional help for ads chapter 202 usaid revision date 452007 responsible office gc file name 202sac_040507_cd47 crs28 this can be found in the trade facilitation negotiations of the wto doha round at first developing countries did not want trade facilitation to be part of the round at all however once they started receiving technical assistance in trade facilitation and technical assistance became part of the trade facilitation negotiations the negotiations moved along more easily than other negotiating areas also technical assistance in trade facilitation caused some countries to make unilateral trade facilitation reforms without any obligation under wto agreement critics of us trade policy contend that tcb may be used to deflect attention from failure of the united states and other donor countries to adopt propoor trade reform they point to high us tariffs on imports produced by developing countries and tradedistorting agricultural subsidies other critics believe that us tcb is influenced more by political objectives than development goals they note that iraq was the thirdlargest recipient of us tcb funds in 2005 after honduras and nicaragua which both received the majority of their tcb assistance from the millennium challenge corporation some observers have also questioned whether the administration uses tcb as way to influence developing country trade policies without going through the trade negotiations process conflicting interests trade capacity building may conflict with some perceived us interests building the negotiating capacity of developing countries may make reaching agreement easier but it might also help them to negotiate more aggressively against us positions also assisting developing countries to be more competitive in world markets may help them to compete against us businesses however the same argument can be made for the benefits of increased competition through tcb as through trade liberalization increased competition tends to increase firm productivity and may benefit both consumers and workers through decreased consumer prices and increased wages as in trade liberalization however the benefits and losses associated with increased competition can be unevenly distributed in the economy causing some regions and industries to suffer losses of jobs and incomes disproportionately although one major difference with general trade liberalization is that most tcb recipients are poor countries that are not likely to provide major competition to us business exceptions to this difference may be found in few major agricultural and textile producers who receive tcb assistance challenges for trade capacity building one major challenge for tcb as an area of foreign assistance is to coordinate assistance with the trade policy agenda and to effectively integrate tcb assistance and trade into developing countries national development strategies changing trade policies such as reducing trade barriers through free trade agreement fta may require new types of assistance to help developing countries benefit from trade in this way trade is not an end in itself but tool for development to fully utilize trade as tool for development it also needs to be considered in all aspects of development planning economic and social policies that have been considered separately from trade in the past may have an effect on countrys competitiveness and ability to benefit from trade therefore policymakers should have an appreciation for possible crs29 trade implications when they are making development plans one possible challenge in integrating trade with development planning is that national development strategies are typically planned on relatively long timeframe through processes such as the poverty reduction strategy paper prsp31 while trade needs can change more quickly as result there may be tension between responding to changing trade needs and long term development planning another major challenge for tcb is international donor coordination tcb assistance is provided by wide range of donors in multitude of sectors and there has been some overlap and duplication among donors this overlap and duplication of efforts is not only wasteful but it can cause confusion and make programs less effective demanddriven tcb assistance where donors provide assistance based on the strategies and requests of recipient governments has inherent benefits and may help facilitate donor coordination for tcb assistance to be demanddriven recipients need to be proactive in assessing and communicating their needs and donors need to orient their assistance around those stated needs one example of this has been in the tcb provided alongside the caftadr negotiations where there was close communication between usaid ustr and the recipient governments in the context of the negotiations32 there is concern that some tcb recipient countries may lack the capacity to assess and prioritize their needs which would hinder achieving demanddriven assistance tcb recipients have complained that they lack the capacity to coordinate the assistance they receive from various donors it is especially difficult when the assistance comes in the form of multiple shortterm projects rather than long term strategy that is coordinated with national development plans some steps toward international donor coordination have reportedly been taken notably through the oecd and the wto donor coordination has been hampered because donor countries and organizations generally prefer to take credit for their efforts and they tend to have different strategies and mechanisms for planning and implementing foreign assistance this leads to assistance being supplydriven that is driven by what donor countries are able and willing to provide according to experts assistance must be driven by the partner countrys own needs goals and strategies to be effective rather than being driven by the donor countrys administrative priorities33 oecd members agreed to implement this principle of foreign aid in the paris declaration on aid effectiveness34 31 the prsp is national development strategy designed in partnership with the beneficiary country the world bank and the international monetary fund imf 32 for

multilateral system occasional paper 32 inter american development bank october 2005 33 organization for economic cooperation and development the development dimension aid for trade making it effective july 2006 34 oecd the paris declaration on aid effectiveness march 2 2005 crs30 evaluating the effectiveness of tcb is another challenge the us government accountability office gao issued report in february 2005 which determined that the united states government does not effectively monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of tcb programs it recommended that usaid and ustr work together to develop strategy in consultation with other us agencies that provide tcb for evaluating tcb effectiveness35 ustr and usaid have responded to this recommendation and are reportedly in the process of developing evaluation mechanisms measuring the effectiveness of tcb can be difficult because meaningful indicators are not readily available changes in trade volumes and other high level indicators are not necessarily attributable to tcb trade volumes respond to many factors of which tcb is just one and not as significant in the short term as economic factors such as commodity price fluctuations lower level indicators such as the number of people trained in wto negotiations may be entirely attributable to tcb but they do not say much about the effects of such training according to the oecd the most measurable and positive outcome of tcb has been in the awareness of wto issues participation in the doha round negotiations and the development of national policy dialogue on trade among the various stakeholders in business government and civil society the oecd finds that where this dialogue has been most robust tcb has been most effective36 this finding may be key in developing framework for evaluating tcb an ongoing challenge for us tcb is that it is just one area in which the united states provides development assistance and it must compete with other priorities for limited resources some of these other development priorities involve responding to emergencies where lives are at stake such as aid in response to natural disasters conflict situations and severe health concerns it may be difficult to argue for funding for tcb when other areas of assistance are needed to help people survive tcb may not directly save lives but it could in the long term reduce countries vulnerability in dire situations by helping to increase incomes and reduce poverty 35 us government accountability office foreign assistance us trade capacity building extensive but its
