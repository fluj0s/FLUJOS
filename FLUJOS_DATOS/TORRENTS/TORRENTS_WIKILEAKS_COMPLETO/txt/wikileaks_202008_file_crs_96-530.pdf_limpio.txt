background the impetus for adopting additional provi sions concerning the loss or forfeiture by members of congress of th eir federal pensions appears to be the convictions and guilty pleas of members

allegations legislative history the senate passed ethics and l obbying reform legislation s 1 110th congress on january 18 2007 which included an amendment dealing with the loss of members pension for the violation of several criminal provisions of federal law17 this earlier version of s 1 would have amended the current provisions of the hiss act to add additional crimes to the current list of

provide that any former member of c ongress who while member had engaged in conduct that results in the conviction for one of several criminal offenses will lose all of the creditable service toward

other creditable federal service time such as if one had been an executive bran ch employee or had military pension that person could receive the annuity paymen ts resulting from that noncongressional federal service thus the 2007 changes to the pension laws work in somewhat different way than the hiss act where conviction of one of the national security offenses listed in that act would result in

contribution is forfeited only upon forfeiture under subchapter ii of chap ter 83 of title 5 of the united states code which is the citation for the socalled hiss act24 since members would be losing only creditable service for congressional pension annuities under the provisions of pl 110 81 and not under the hiss act which is not amended by the new legi slation and provision in the new legislation requires such forfeiture it would appear that members would be entitled to all of the contributions and proceeds in their personal thrift savings plans25 spouse and dependent children when former member loses his or her pension annuity normally the former memb ers spouse and dependent children are also deprived of that retirement income to alleviate the potential for hardship in certain

the target of and motivation for the legislative changes in the pension pr ovisions for members of congress may be certain infamous cases of official misconduct by former members of congress who continue to receive substantial government pensions even after corruption convictions any new legislation adopted by congress could apply prospectively only it would not be able to apply as

imprisonment but also to include the loss of ones federal pension annuities for the commission of those particular crimes legislation which attempts to increase the penalty for acts which were committed before the enactment of that legislation would raise serious c onstitutional issues concerning ex post facto laws the constitution at article i section 9 clause 3 states an express limitation upon congress that bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed prohibited ex post facto law is one that makes criminal an action which when engaged in was innocent under the law or as explained by the supreme court in 1798 every law that changes the punishment and inflicts greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when committed is prohibited ex post facto law27 chief justice marshall explained simply and clearly that an ex post facto law is one which renders an act punishable in manner in which it was not punishable when it was committed28 although congress may not increase the penalty or punishment for an act afterthefact that is for conduct that s already occurred the court has allowed certain legislation that it deemed to be regulatory rather than punitive in nature and intent which did in fact affect the righ ts or property of i ndividuals based on pre enactment conduct29 however regarding specifically the pensions of federal officers and employees lower federal court in th celebrated alger hiss case found that the hiss act was if applied re troactively to deny alger hiss his pension punitive in nature and not regulatory30 and was therefore prohib ited ex post facto law adopted by congress after hiss had engaged in the subject conduct the question before us is not whethe r hiss or strasburger are good or bad men nor is it whether we would grant them annuities if we had unfettered discretion in the matter the question is simply whether the constitution permits congress to deprive them of their annuities by retroactive penal legislation we conclude that it does not we hold that as applied retroactively to the plaintiffs the challenged statute is penal cannot be sustained as regulation and is invalid as an ex post facto law prohibited by the constitution31 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96530crs9 32 zucker v united states 758 f2d 637 fed cir 1985 cert denied 474 us 842 1985 walton v cotton 19 how 60 us 355 358 1857

contract principlesit would therefore appear from the judicial precedents that the application of any provision to deny pension to one w ho was member of congress or congressional employee for the commission of crime deemed to be felony under federal or state law could be prospective only the law could apply to criminal conduct engaged in from the time of the enactment of that provision forward but could not apply under the ex post facto cl ause of the constitution to deprive former members of congress or cong ressional staff of their pens ions for the conviction of crimes that occurred prior to the enactment of the proposed legislation contracts there have been questions raised as to whether the change in the annuity provisions of fede ral retirement law for members of congress who are convicted of certain crimes would incu r problems concerning the sanctity of contracts as to any future annuity payments affected even those earned or expected prior to the commission of the particular crime in question judicial precedents have provided clear indicati on that future annuity payments to be provided by the government for its officer s employees veterans or others do not create current property right or interest in such future payments but rather create mere expectancy or government fostered expectation that may be modified revoked or suspended by the authority gr anting it through subsequent legislation32 that is as specifically found by federa l courts even where there has been compulsory contribution to retirement or pension fund the employee has vested right in it until the particular event happens upon which the money or part of it is to be paid33 and thus pension granted by th government confers right which cannot be revised modified or r ecalled by subseque nt legislation34 there would thus appear to be violation or abroga tion of any specific contract by increasing the penalties for the violations of certain specific crimes to include forfeiture or partial forfeiture of anticipated federal annuity payments even those future benefits that had accrued or for which credit had been earned prior to the commission of the crime35 it should be noted that the current provisions of the socalled hiss act originally adopted in 1954 ope rate in the manner questione d federal officers or employees annuity payments even those that were credited to him or her or earned over the course of many year s may be forfeited upon the subsequenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96530crs10 36 as to the employee contributions to and earning s in the thrift

the employee and managed and invested on the employees behalf conf report 606 99th cong 2nd sess 137 1986 as to the thrift savings plan moneys the conferees stated the employee owns it and it cannot

is selfexecuting and does not require specifically stated delayed effective date this constitutional provision does not prohibit the enactment of law that would change the compensation for services of member during the current c ongress but rather states that law so enacted shall take effect until an election of representatives has intervened38 even if the new pension law were found to vary the compensation for the services of member the constitutional provision merely provides that the law would not take effect until after the next election39 retired member of congress who

members in part based on the f act that claim regarding pensions must fail because 1 the amendment does not cover pensions and 2 congressman shaffer sic can not present ripe case involving pension based injury to himself 54 fsupp2d at 1025committed an offense newly covered under the law while member after the passage of the new law40 who had committed such offense during the congress adopting such legislation 110th congress and who sought to have his or her pension annuities not diminished by forfeiting creditable service could thus raise the 27th amendment defense and in the event that court agrees with the interpretation that the law had varied the compensation for the services of the senators and representatives during this current congress the court could then find that the loss of creditable service would not take effect until after the next election there is however an underlying question as to whether the 27th amendment would apply in any event to change in the pension laws applicable to former members of congress the 27th amendment expressly applies only to compensation for the services of senators or representatives as noted by the sponsor of the provision james madison and in the states ratifying the provision the intent of the constitutional restriction was to prevent current members from obtaining the particular benefit of increasing their own salaries41 it thus might be argued that the provision appears to apply to salaries or fees as compensation for services as opposed to future nnuity or pensi on or other such potential retirement benefits provided only upon certain contingencies to those who are former members of congress42 in case dealing with proce dural standing issue dismissing challenge under the 27th amendment to the automatic

oneill 534 us 992 2001 the decisions of th district court nd court of appeals dealt with lack of standing and injury to plaintiffsthe twentyseventh amendment does not deal with congressional pensions plaintiffs cite authority that indi cates congressional pensions fall under the twentyseventh amendment 43 there is thus substantial question as to wh ether future pension to be granted to former member of congress only upon certain qualifying contingencies eg age and years of service is compensation to current member as contemplated by the 27th amendment in any event this issue will be mooted and will longer be relevantafter the end of the 110 th congress
