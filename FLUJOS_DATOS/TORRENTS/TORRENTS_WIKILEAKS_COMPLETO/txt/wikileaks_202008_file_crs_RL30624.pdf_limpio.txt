proposed replacement for the a6e began in 1991 but was also terminated the principal alternative to the fa18e f was modest upgrade of the f14 large twoseat fighter designed in the 1960s with potential airtosurface attack capabilities some observers describe the fa18ef as an upgraded and larger version of the fa18cd with increased range and payload capacity and more space and weight for future

program replacing rapidly aging fa18cd hornet combat aircraft2 it has been employed in conflicts in afghanistan and iraq and is currently in full rate production principal issues surrounding th program relate to the total number of super hornets to be procured and how th is might affect other aviation programs background the decision to undertake the fa18ef super hornet program was made during period of great turbulence in na vy aviation modernization when the navy was struggling to identify and implement the best way to modernize its aging fleet of f14 fighters and a6e attack aircraft the a12 program stealthy replacement to the a6e was terminated in january 1991 the afx program another proposed replacement for the a6e began in 1991 but wa s also terminated efforts to develop carrierbased naval version of the air fo rces f22 advanced tactical fighter were abandoned in 1991 and proposals for carriercapable version of the air forces f117 were never endorsed by navy leadership in the midst of these program starts and stops the principal alternative to the fa18ef major upgrade of the fa18 smaller one or twoseat strikefighter designed in the 1970s as lowercost suppl ement to the f14 was modest upgrade of the f14 large twoseat fighte r designed in the 1960s with potential airtosurface attack capabilities proponents of the fa18ef argued that upgrading the fa18 to take over the f14s airtoair combat mission would co st less in procur ement and operating expenses than upgrading the f14 to take over the fa18s airtosurface attack mission some also argued that the f14s longrange air defense mission known as the outer air battle will be less important in the postcold war era when naval aircraft are expected to be used at shorter ranges in littoral offshore operations inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30624crs2 thirdworld scenarios competing upgrade options were proposed for both the f14 and the fa18 in 1992 the house nd senate armed services

procurement of another 20 aircraft on april 3 1998 the defense departments quadrennial defense review qdr of may 19 1997 recommended reducing procurement of fa18efs from 1000 aircraft to 548 with the possibility of buying up to 785 if th joint strike fighter jsf program were delayed or if the aircraft were too expensive compared to the fa18ef secretary cohen stated that he hoped this change in the program would set up creative tension between the contractors produc ing the jsf and the fa18ef the qdr also recommended reducing the maximum nnual production rate to 48 aircraft these recommendations

late to the total number of super hornets to be procured number of super hornets to be procured like other dod tactical aviation prog rams eg f22a rah66 jsf the planned number of fa18ef super hornets to be procured has fluctuated over time the current plan is to procure 494 ef mode ls about half of th originally planned quantity several factors could influence whether the planned procurement number continues to decrease or holds steady the department of the navy has recently implemented tactical aviation integration plan which has reduced the planned number of super hornets and f35s to be procured and fielded if this inte gration of navy and marine corps aviation appears successful some may argue for furthe r reductions in these aircraft further in the future the successful fielding of naval unmanned aerial vehicles uavs for both surveillance and strike missions could compete with manned navy aircraft for deck space the most discussed factor however influencing the potential purchase of super hornets is the f35 programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30624crs9 the navy and marine corps are both pla nning on procuring variants of the f35 jsf this aircraft is expected to be operational between 2012 and 2013 some argue that the jsf will be clearly more capable aircraft it will be stealthy employ advanced integrated avionics the most modern agile electronically scanned array aesa radars and is hoped to be cheaper to procure and opera than the super hornet jsf proponents also argue that the f35 will field and that the fa18ef lacks advanced computing and communications capabilities that enable tomorrows combat aircraft to fully participate in high speed collaborative targeting sharing and receiving targeting information from othe r sources appears central jsf proponents argue to effectively engaging challenging targets improved enemy air defenses suggest that the navy field these kinds of strike fighter attributes quickly if it is to remain survivable and relevant on tomorrows battlefield in addition to these operational attributes the jsf is hoped to be less expensiv to procure and to operate than the super hornet jsf advocates argue that the fa18ef program should be truncated and that more resources should be invested in the js f program it makes little sense they say to continue purchasing two ty pes of aircraft that perform essentially the same role especially when one is clearly superi or the super hornet is compromise program jsf proponents say designed to fill the void left by the cancelled a12 it isnt as good fighter aircraft as the f14 tomcat nor it as good an attack aircraft as was the a6e intruder the fa18 versus jsf debate received more fuel when in the late winter and early spring of the fy2009 legislative cycl both air force and department of the navy don officials testified that they were facing projected fighter gap because of high combat aircraft utilization rates in afghanistan and iraq legacy air forces a10s f15s f16s fa18s were wearing out faster than previously predicted while new aircra ft procurement eg f22a f35 fa18ef remained steady or had declined at its worst don fficials projected ficit of more than 90 aircraft in fy2017fy2020 one way to address the projected potential fighter shortfall would be to purchase more f15s f16s fa18efs and f22s all of which are still in production the navy reportedly is consider ing procuring 69 more super ho rnets to close the fighter gap this option might be cheaper than purchasing more f35s although these aircraft are less capable than the f35 additional purchases of these aircraft however especially if at the f35s expense could raise f35 unit cost and potentially alienate fo reign partners who are already concerned about cost growth in the jsf program the ease with which the us air forces have dominated its recent military opponents eg kosovo afghanistan iraq sugge st that the current inventory of f 14s and fa18cds will continue to be effective until the jsf is fielded much can be saved by truncating the super hornet nd buying the jsf in even greater numbers acting dod acquisition chief michael wynne reportedly suggested that

purchase in favor of the jsf could be considered if dod had to reduce its tactical avia tion procurement budget25 while the navy looks forward to the jsfs eventual deployment fa18ef proponents point out that it is still in deve lopment and there is guarantee that it will be fielded on time many aviation programs such as the c17 globemaster rah66 comanche and the v22 osprey took much longer to develop and procure than planned the fa18ef is bird in the hand its supporters say and its rapid and continued procurement is essential to executing the navys current and evolving military strategy in 2006 navy leaders and the senate arme d services committee supported the purchase of additional super hornets in its markup of the fy2007 defense authorization bill the committee noted the navy will confront sizeable gap in aircraft inventory as older fa18ad hornets retire before the aircraft carrier variant of the joint strike fighter jsf is availablethe magnitude of the probl em and the procurement cost to avoid shortfall in the carrier air wing forc structure is entirely dependent on when the navy determines that its fa18acs ar at the end of their service lifethe committee recommends that the navy consider buying additional fa18efs to mitigate the known shortfall while allowi ng the navy to transition to the jsf as soon as feasible26 super hornet advocates argue that while the jsf will be valuable contribution to the navy inventory its capabilities complement the fa18ef rather than supercede it it is not clear that stealth technology is required immediately and stealthy aircraft have not proven invulnerable in recent conflicts also to maintain its stealthy signature the jsf must carry its weapons inte rnally which limits its payload proponents of the fa18ef acknowledge that the plane lacks some of the f14ds mission capabilities speed and allweather attack capability and the a6es rangepayload but they argue that adva nces in weapons and targeting capabilities make up for these shortcomings further they argue the super hornet offers considerable upgrade potential modernizing the fa18ef with software programmable radios computers and othe r networking equipment is relatively straightforward proponents argue congressional action the bush administrations fy2009 budget requested 43139 million 43 billion for fa18 aircraft congressional
