eligible students can receive up to 750 in their first year of undergraduate education and maximum of 1300 during their second year of study although students must be eligible for pell grant the amount of the ac grant is not influenced by the amount of the recipients pell grant award the pell grant is still considered to be the foundation to which other assistance is added however the amount of the ac grant other student aid and resources and the amount of the expected family contribution combined cannot exceed the recipients total cost of attendance12 furthermore in the event that the aggregate amount students are eligible to receive exceeds the appropriation the amount of the awards shall be ratably reduced policy issues in the weeks following the enactment of the deficit reduction act of 2005 and the establishment of the academic competitiveness grant program many policymakers and education officials criticized the program many argued that authorizing the secretary to determine what was deemed rigorous significantly expanded the federal role in high school curriculum and policymaking in addition to this issue many supporters of alternative education programs such as vocational education programs and homeschooling were opposed to any program eligibility criteria that would disqualify these students simply because the secretary did not recognize the program as being rigorous the following section presents brief analysis of each of these issues expanding the federal role there has been considerable concern expressed regarding the possible expansion of the federal role in high school 11 continued jsptabfunding 12 for additional information about the federal student aid need analysis system including the expected family contribution and cost of attendance see crs report rl33266 federal student aid need analysis system background description and legislative action by charmaine mercer crs5 curriculum and policymaking13 specifically many policymakers and education officials have expressed concern about the secretarys authority to recognize rigorous secondary school curriculum many policy groups contend that allowing the secretary to determine what constitutes rigor is essentially granting the federal government the authority to evaluate the curricular decisions of state and local officials14 several governors reportedly responded by writing letter to the secretary expressing their support for the new program however they cautioned the secretary against overextending the federal role governors will be concerned if any regulations or attempts are made to federalize highschool curricula including the creation of federal definition of rigor15 in response to concerns about the program representative boehner and senator enzi wrote letter to secretary spellings stating some concern has arisen that this initiative will allow the secretary to become involved in establishing high school curriculum we want to be very clear this was neither the intention nor the effect of the language in this bill the secretarys only role in this process is to recognize that states or local educational agencies or other schools including private charter and home schools have in fact established what they consider to be rigorous coursework requirement not only does the language in this bill not give the secretary any authority to establish curriculum we assert that federal law prohibits this16 section 103 of the department of education organization act specifically prohibits the secretary from exercising direction supervision or control over the curriculum of any educational institution school or school system as previously discussed in the dear colleague letter dated may 2 2006 the secretary issued guidance stating that she has intention of determining what constitutes rigorous high school program in recognizing these programs i will respect the authority of each individual state to set graduation requirements and i will follow the laws directive prohibiting the department from mandating directing or controlling state or local curricula programs of instruction academic achievement standards or assessments i will conduct thorough and transparent review and will be consulting with external stakeholders to aid in this process17 alternative education programs many supporters of alternative education programs such as vocational education concurrent enrollment and home schooling are apprehensive about the policy guidance being developed for the ac grant program most of the concern stems from these programs being viewed as non rigorous because they are alternatives to traditional high school curriculum 13 see anne k walters and stephen burd education department races to set up student grant program without clear mandate chronicle of higher education apr 21 2006 14 see the gift colleges dont want doug lederman insidehigheredcom the article is available at

letter see httpwwwifapedgovdpclettersattachments gen0608attachpdf crs6 however with the exception of concurrent enrollment programs discussed below the program guidance does not appear to disqualify students who pursue either vocational education or those who are homeschooled from being eligible for an ac grant as long as they complete the course work for an advanced or honors diploma or pursue one of the options previously discussed students who live in state that does not offer an advanced or honors diploma program and does not participate in the ssi program or who do not complete either ap or ib courses and the respective exam could demonstrate their completion of rigorous secondary school program by completing set of courses that are comparable to the ssi program to become eligible to receive the ac grant concurrent enrollment programs concurrent enrollment programs are programs that enable high schoolaged students who have not received high school diploma to take collegelevel courses and receive college credit18 in many of these programs the students are also enrolled in high school and seeking high school diploma thus the phrase concurrent enrollment19 the eligibility criteria for the ac grant program do not permit students who have previously enrolled in an undergraduate program to receive grant thus under the guidance issued students who are concurrently enrolled in both high school and college program may not be eligible for an ac grant however supporters of these programs including the national governors association nga disagree with this interpretation of the act they maintain that the purpose of the ac grant program is to encourage students to pursue rigorous courses that prepare them for college which is the same purpose of concurrent enrollment programs in letter to the secretary the nga wrote governors are deeply concerned that the us department of education has indicated that for legal reasons dual enrollees or dual credit students will not be eligible for ac grants this interpretation is contradictory and inconsistent with the basic intent of the program dual enrollees are public private or home school high school students who are pursuing rigorous secondary program of study while obtaining collegelevel credit that also counts towards high school graduation dual enrollment programs offer students an opportunity to pursue challenging courses that may not be available at their high school or for those without access to advanced placement or international baccalaureate courses lastly many dual enrollees do not pay tuition to the institution of higher education nor are these students enrolled in program of undergraduate education or degree granting program20 david bergeron director of policy and budget development office of postsecondary education indicated that taking few classes would be permissible however the student could not be admitted into an undergraduate program and be 18 concurrent enrollment programs are also frequently referred to as dual enrollment andor dual credit programs 19 for additional information about concurrent enrollment programs see crs report rs21898 concurrent enrollment programs by charmaine mercer 20 the full text of the letter is available at httpwwwngaorgportalsitengamenuitem cb6e7818b34088d18a278110501010a0vgnextoidfef0611fcfe3b010vgnvcm1000001 a01010arcrd crs7 eligible for an ac grant21 because concurrent enrollment programs are diverse in their makeup it appears as though concurrent enrollment programs that do not require students to be admitted into postsecondary academic program could be recognized as rigorous programs the guidance issued by the secretary indicated that if state wanted to establish an alternative rigorous program to be recognized by the secretary the program needed to be submitted by june 1 2006 for the 20062007 award year22 21 the comments were made at webinar webbased seminar hosted by the american association of collegiate registrars and admissions officers on may 11 2006 the archive of the presentation is available at httpwebinaraacraoorg 22 the plan should describe how completion of the program will ensure that students will be exposed to rigorous secondary program that will prepare them for college in addition it should also contain evidence that state university in the states system will consider students collegeready if they complete the program finally the program must be reviewed by the governor state educational agency and other higher education officials states desiring to submit plans for the 20072008 award year should submit plans to the secretary later than nov 1 2006 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33457
