devices ieds than uparmored hmmwvs dods decision not to procure mrap iis mrap logistical and readiness concerns and mrap rollover accidents could be potential policy issues for congressional consideration this report will be updated background mraps are family of vehicles produced by variety of domestic and international companies that generally incorporate vshaped hull and armor plating designed to provide protection against mines and improvised explosive devices ieds dod is procuring three types of mraps1 these include category i vehicles capable of carrying up to 7 personnel and intended for urban operations category ii vehicles capable of carrying up to 11 personnel and intended for variety of missions such as supporting security convoy escort troop or cargo transport medical explosive ordnance disposal or combat engineer operations and category iii vehicles intended to be used primarily to clear mines and ieds which are capable of carrying up to 13 personnel the army and marines first employed mraps in limited numbers in iraq and afghanistan in 2003 primarily for route clearance and explosive ordnance disposal eod operations these route clearance mraps quickly gained reputation for providing superior protection for their crews and some suggested that mraps might be better alternative for transporting troops in combat than uparmored hmmwvs 1 us

entire order would be sent to afghanistan these additional mraps will likely be the 9ton rg31 category i mraps the smallest version which is said to be better suited for afghanistans unimproved roads and rugged terrain about 600 of the almost 800 mraps currently in afghanistan are rg 31s dod is increasing the numbers of mraps being sent to afghanistan due to increasing attacks by insurgents

possibility of not being included in the 1600vehicle order for the army mrap program officials stated that the mrap ii program would continue as currently planned15 in july 2008 dod officials decided not to purchase the 30ton mrap iis after spending more than 25 million and one year to develop them supposedly because of mobility and safety issues16 lighter mraps to be procured17 dods final order of 787 mraps may include lighter and shorter mrap version to address rollover accidents and to improve mobility the pentagon is said to be studying engineering change proposals that will increase the mraps stability while preserving survivability these lighter mraps would carry fewer passengers and crews but shorter and lighter mrap could make mraps little easier for drivers to handle and increase the vehicles ability to negotiate different types of terrain commanders in the field have reported that current mrap versions have difficulties operating in urban or dense environments and on unimproved roads and in cross country operations mrap funding httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22707 according to dod there was procurement or development funding requested for fy2009 as the mrap acquisition objective would be achieved with fy2008 funds18 on may 22 2008 the senate approved an amended version of hr 2642 supplemental appropriation act for 2008 appropriating 17 billion for mraps19 in addition to mrap procurement these funds included funding for the ballistic testing sustainment and transport of mraps and the committee also directed the secretary of defense to include future mrap funding requests in the presidents budget request starting in fy201020 on july 3 2008 the pentagon comptroller notified congress that dod intended to transfer 1737 billion out of its fy2008 mrap

general dynamics bae systems defense daily july 18 2008 crs5 mrap operational concerns mrap logistical and readiness issues at the program level gao notes that operating maintaining and sustaining fleet of 15000 fielded vehicles by at least five different vendors could present significant challenges22 in order to address this concern the army is trying to pure fleet its mraps in afghanistan by acquiring the rg31 variant from single vendor because afghanistan does not have the mrap logistical support infrastructure that is available to us forces in iraq this is considered prudent strategy by many another concern is that at present much of the mrap maintenance is being performed by contractors as dod adjusts its longterm maintenance strategy so that maintenance will be performed by military personnel during this transition period it is possible that there might be contractor maintenance shortages in iraq and afghanistan it was recently reported that one in five mraps in iraq were out of service which correlates to an 80 readiness rate primarily due to lack of repair parts23 the pentagon has disputed this claim and maintains that its operational readiness rate for mraps in iraq is almost 9224 sufficient repair parts may also be readiness concern in iraq and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22707 afghanistan as dod admits it is trying to catch up in terms of mrap repair parts25 in the past shortages of heavy duty transmissions engines axles and tires have been cited as mrap readiness issues mrap rollovers the deaths of three us army special forces soldiers in afghanistan on june 29 2008 when their rg31 mrap rolled over into river has renewed concerns about the high risk of mrap rollover26 more than half of accidents involving mraps since november 2007 have been rollovers and nearly 75 of these rollovers occurred in rural areas pentagon officials maintain that rollover risks are greatest in afghanistan where terrain makes movement more difficult and it was also noted roads and road shoulders in the region do not meet us standards and can collapse under the weight of mraps particularly when the road is above grade the mraps high center of gravity weight and height further compound the rollover issue there have also been reports that the mraps height including antennae have resulted in it striking power lines which could result in electrocutions 22 us government

andrew scutro mrap dangers army times july 14 2008 pp 89 crs6 potential issues for congress dods decision to not acquire mrap iis there are potential issues associated with dods decision to not acquire mrap iis does this decision end any further development of mrap iis or is the program on hold dod was said to have spent more than 25 million on the mrap ii before its july 2008 decision did anything result from the expenditure of this 25 million that will benefit the mrap program as whole or is the money essentially lost will engineer change proposals for current production models of mraps that address efps be as effective as the proposed mrap ii designs are there other potential or emerging threats that might be better addressed by mrap ii designs mrap logistics and readiness gao has expressed concern that operating maintaining and sustaining fleet of 15000 fielded vehicles by at least five different vendors could present significant challenges27 while dod contends that there is degree of commonality between mraps from various vendors there are likely considerable logistics and maintenance issues resulting from the mixed mrap fleet these issues could have significant readiness and cost issues that congress might wish httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22707 to review with dod while dods longterm goal is to transition from contractor to military maintenance for mraps contractors are presently responsible for the majority of mrap maintenance activities are there sufficient contractors in iraq and afghanistan to support the evergrowing mrap fleets is the quality and availability of contractor mrap maintenance comparable to military maintenance and is this significant factor in mrap readiness dod is currently catching up in terms of acquiring and stockpiling mrap repair parts is this shortage function of funding the ability of the respective mrap manufacturers to produce sufficient stocks of repair parts of programmatic priorities or combination of factors mrap rollovers28 primarily in response to mrap rollovers dod is exploring design modifications and modifying driver training another possible solution might be to impose operational restrictions on mraps which could further limit their tactical utility dod is putting its emphasis on improving driver training it is possible that the mrap rollover problem may be predominately function of basic mrap design and the current operational environment and less function of driver training and skill if modifying mrap design proves to be significant mitigating factor in mrap rollovers is it possible to modify the thousands of deployed mraps and those already manufactured and in the mrap pipeline if these mraps can be modified what are the associated funding issues if these mraps can not be appreciably modified this could result in two categories of mraps those prone to rollovers and newer safer models this situation could result operational limitations for the various models and perceived inequities for those soldiers that operate and are transported in the more rolloverprone mraps 27 us government accountability office gao report subject rapid acquisition of mine resistant
