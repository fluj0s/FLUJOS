1 frequently asked questions the researchers will update this file periodically in response to questions regarding the study of practices at us catholic health systems active in texas 2000 2003 the study may be found at wwwwikileaksorgwikicatholic_hospitals_betray_mission the frequently asked questionspdf will be periodically updated and users are encouraged to check for updates on the wwwwikileaksorgwikisterilization_and_abortion_practices_in_texas_catholic_hospitals site questions from readers may be submitted via the discussion group pages on the webs ites or sent to presssunshinepressorg q1 the researchers are anonymous why should the data be treated with credibility a1 it should be treated with credibility because wikileaksorg is respected j ournalistic website and follows established protocols when it refrains from revealing its sources fewer than 01 of documents that pass initial editorial review fail subsequent analysis the patient records in the tchxls file come directly from the state of texas public use data files anyone questioning the veracity of the data need only contact the texas information collection center to obtain the data this will admittedly cost money beginning in 2002 all patient records include unique identi fiers this makes it even easier for individual patient records to be examined as stated in the methodology section of the study some fields in the records such as patient charges were omitted from the tchxls file since they are not relevant to the study every icd9cm diagnost ic and procedure code for each patient has been included records were selected for inclusion in the file if they had diagnostic or procedure code that the researchers considered violation or possible violation of the cath olic hospital directives please review the data samplepdf for clearer understanding of the records q2 why are there so many documents posted on the sterilization_and_abortion_practices_in_texas_catholic_hospitals site and what would be the best or der in which to read them a2 the first two zip files contain all the documents listed under contents both zip files are identical and are available at two different sites in case one of the sites becomes temporarily unavailable it is suggested that readers first completely read the wikileaks article catholic hospitals betray mission this describes the study of the us catholic ho spital systems active in texas completed by the medical research group pdf of this article catholic hospitalspdf is the first item listed under contents two additional files related to the article are tchxls and tch xlsdata samplepdf tchxls is an excel workbooks that contains the patient records in the study and various ways of viewing and analyzing them tch xlsdata samplepdf is file that gives simple visual explanation of the organization of the patient data it is suggested that the user view the data sample prior to downloading and reviewing the tchxls file the pdf files tch xxxpdf are sim ply printouts of the various worksheets in the tchxls and redundant for the reader who is able to view the excel file 2 the next group of files under contents contains the files created by an independent group who reviewed the material and created docume nts which were sent to the press various interested organizations and members of the catholic church hierarchy regarding the study these files which the user may wish to read next are distribution memopdf mediareview summarypdf mediareview narrative2pdf q3 can the researchers answer questions about remarks in the review narrative or re view summary a3 the researchers are responsible for the data in tchxls ex cel file the pdf files which contain copies of the tchxls worksheets and for cooperating with the wikileaks press for the text of catholic hosp itals betray mission article on wwwwikileaks org the researchers cannot speak for the reviewers the files prepared by the independent reviewers whic h have link to them in the article are posted on wwwwikileaksorgwikisterilization_and_abortion_prac tices_in_texas_catholic_hospitals they are distribution memopdf mediareview summarypdf mediareview narrative2pdf q4 why do the researchers consider all v252 diagnostic codes to indicate sterilization that violates the catholic directives erd 53 a4 the v252 diagnostic code is very precise in the icd 9cm guidelines all diagnostic codes p receded by v are provided to deal with occasions when circumstances other than disease or injury represented by codes 001 999 are recorded as diagnosis or problem v25 specifically represents case of contraceptive management v252 further specifies that contraceptive management is to be achieved through sterilization by means of the interruption of the vas derens or fallopian tubes the accompanying procedural codes will in given case show what specific procedure was used to interrupt the vas deferens or the fallopian tubes the fact that particular patient with v252 might also be noted in the diagnostic codes to have hypertension liver disease diabetes many children multiple c sections cancer hiv stds etc does not justify sterilization at catholic hospital interrupting the fallopian tubes will not treat any of these conditions some of which are not even true pathologies and in fact is being done to prevent future pregnancy such procedure is prohibited in l cases this is not matter of opinion of the researchers or of debate within the catholic church admittedly many catholic hospitals and the catholic health association have worked with ethicists for decades who have held contrary opinions but the ca tholic church has insisted these 3 opinions may not be used at catholic hospitals the vatican has been very clear about this and has publicly condemned such false opinions in 1976 and again in 1993 the 1993 document by the congregation for the doctrine f the faith answers very specific questions regarding medical procedures resulting in sterilization it states q 1when the uterus becomes so seriously injured eg during delivery or caesarian section so as to render medically indicated even its total removal hysterectomy in order to counter an immediate serious threat to the life r health of the mother is it licit to perform such procedure notwithstanding the permanent sterility which will result for the woman r affirmative q 2when the uterus eg as result of previous caesarian sections is in state such that while not constituting in itself present risk to the life or health of the woman nevertheless is foreseeably incapable of carrying future pregnancy to term without danger to the mother danger which in some cases could be serious is it licit to remove the uterus hysterectomy in order to prevent possible future danger deriving from conception r negative q 3in the same situation as in 2 is it licit to substitute tubal ligation also called uterine isolation for the hysterectomy since the same end would be attained of averting the risks of possible pregnancy by means of procedure which is much simpler for the doctor and less serious for the woman and since in addition in some cases the ensuing sterility might be reversible r negat ive explanation in the first case the hysterectomy is licit because it has directly therapeutic character even though it may be foreseen that permanent sterility will result in fact it is the pathological condition of the uterus eg hemorrhage which cannot be stopped by other means which makes its removal medically indicated the removal of the organ has as its aim therefore the curtailing of serious present danger to the woman independent of possible future pregnancy from the moral poi nt of view the cases of hysterectomy and uterine isolation in the circumstances described in 2 and 3 are different these fall into the moral category of direct sterilization which in the congregation of the doctrine of the faiths document quaecum sterilizatio aas lxviii 1976 738 740 1 is defined as an action whose sole immediate effect is to render the generative faculty incapable of procreation and the same document continues it direct sterilization is absolutely forbidden according to the teaching of the church even when it is motivated by subjectively right intention of curing or preventing physical or psychological ill effect which is foreseen or feared as result of 4 pregnancy in point of fact the uterus as scribed in 2 does not constitute in and of itself any present danger to the woman indeed the proposal to substitute uterine isolation for hysterectomy under the same conditions shows precisely that the uterus in and of itself does not pose patholo gical problem for the woman therefore the described procedures do not have properly therapeutic character but are aimed in themselves at rendering sterile future sexual acts freely chosen the end of avoiding risks to the mother deriving from possib pregnancy is thus pursued by means of direct sterilization in itself always morally illicit while other ways which are morally licit remain open to free choice the contrary opinion which considers the interventions described in 2 and 3 as in direct sterilizations licit under certain conditions cannot be regarded as valid and may not be followed in catholic hospitals during an audience granted to the undersigned prefect the sovereign pontiff john paul ii approved these responses adopted in an ordinary session of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and ordered them to be published rome at the congregation for the doctrine of the faith the 31st of july 1993 joseph card ratzinger prefect alberto bovone titular archbishop of caesarea in numidia secretary the ntire document is available online at
