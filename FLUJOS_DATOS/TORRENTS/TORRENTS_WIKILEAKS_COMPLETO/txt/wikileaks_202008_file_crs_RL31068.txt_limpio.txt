specialist in american national government government and finance division suspension of budget enforcement procedures during low economic growth summary on april 30 2008 the bureau of economic analysis of the department of commerce announced that two consecutive quarters of less than 1 growth in the gross domestic product gdp recently had occurred 06 growth for both the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 in the past the principal budget enforcement laws provided for the suspension of selected budget enforcement procedures because of low economic growth eg at least two consecutive quarters of gdp growth below 1 or negative growth or war with regard to low economic growth suspension procedure set forth in the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended would have been triggered automatically by the issuance of lowgrowth report by the congressional budget office cbo under the suspension procedure certain budget enforcement procedures would have been suspended if congress and the president enacted suspension resolution action on suspension was required in the senate but was optional in the house during the years that these suspension provisions were available the united states was in period of sustained low economic growth only twice in late 1990early 1991 and in late 2001early 2002 cbo issued lowgrowth reports three times in 1991 but in each instance measure to suspend enforcement procedures was defeated in the senate by wide margin more recently cbo issued lowgrowth reports on october 31 2001 and on january 30 2002 in each instance the senate budget committee reported unfavorably suspension resolution that subsequently was defeated on the floor the senate rejected sjres 28 on november 13 2001 by vote of 199 and rejected sjres 31 on february 14 2002 by voice vote suspension resolutions were enacted although the senate considered and rejected total of five such measures in the 102nd and 107th congresses the house did not consider any suspension resolutions under this procedure in 2008 any determination by cbo of low economic growth would not lead to the issuance of lowgrowth report by the agency or house or senate consideration of suspension resolution because the suspension procedure in the 1985 balanced budget act expired on september 30 2006 while this procedure longer may be used to suspend budget enforcement procedures the house and senate may employ other common techniques to waive the procedures on billbybill basis on february 13 2008 for example president george w bush signed the economic stimulus act of 2008 pl 110185 into law the act increases the deficits for fy2008 and fy2009 by total of 168 billion the house passed the bill on january 29 2008 under the suspension of the rules procedure which requires twothirds affirmative vote by vote of 38535 the senate passed the measure on february 6 2008 employing various procedural devices to expedite its consideration and

growth for both the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 20081 the announcement confirmed an economic downturn that had prompted congress and the president to enact stimulus legislation on february 13 2008 pl 110185 the economic stimulus act of 2008 and congress to consider additional stimulus proposals in the past the principal budget enforcement laws provided for the suspension of selected budget enforcement procedures because of low economic growth eg at least two consecutive quarters of gdp growth below 1 or negative growth or war in the case of war certain enforcement procedures would have been suspended automatically upon the enactment of declaration of war2 with regard to low economic growth suspension procedure set forth in the balanced budget and emergency

procedures would have been suspended if congress and the president enacted suspension resolution action on suspension was required in the senate but was optional in the house the last two instances during which the united states was in period of sustained low economic growth occurred toward the end of calendar year 1990 and the beginning of calendar year 1991 and toward the end of calendar year 2001 and the beginning of calendar year 2002 in those two instances the suspension procedure in the 1985 balanced budget act was activated suspension resolutions were enacted although the senate

twothirds affirmative vote by vote of 38535 by securing more than the necessary twothirds vote the house effectively waived any budget enforcement procedures that could have impeded consideration of the measure the senate passed the measure on february 6 2008 employing various procedural devices to expedite its consideration such as unanimous consent agreement regarding the motion to proceed to consideration of the bill and waiver of budget enforcement rules by means of an emergency designation in section 301 of the act4 this report provides information on budget enforcement procedures in effect through september 30 2006 the means for suspending them due to low economic growth and the historical record regarding this matter budget enforcement procedures in past years federal budget policies have been enforced under two major statutes the congressional budget act of 1974 and the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 19855 budget enforcement procedures under the 1974 congressional budget act are for the most part permanent and ongoing whereas the key budget enforcement procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act effectively expired in late 20026 while several efforts have been made to extend the procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act they have not been successful 3 joint committee on taxation estimated budget effects of the economic stimulus act of 2008 as passed by the house of representatives and the senate on february 7 2008 jcx1708 february 8 2008 4 section 301 of the act 122 stat 622 states for purposes of senate enforcement all provisions of this act are designated as emergency requirements and necessary to meet emergency needs pursuant to section 204 of sconres 21 110th congress the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008 5 these statutes have been amended several times over the years by such laws as the budget enforcement act of 1990 the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 the budget enforcement act of 1997 and the transportation equity act for the 21st century for more information on these statutes and their subsequent amendment see crs report rl30795 general management laws compendium clinton t

of the payasyougo paygo requirement for fy2003 and later years by robert keith certain other procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act remained in effect until september 30 2006 crs3 congressional budget act of 1974 the 1974 congressional budget act title iix of pl 93344 as amended provides for the adoption by congress of an annual concurrent resolution on the budget the budget resolution recommends the total level of revenues spending the surplus or deficit and the public debt for each year covering at least fiveyear period spending for each fiscal year is distributed among the functional categories of the budget such as national defense agriculture and transportation in addition total spending is allocated to each of the house and senate committees with jurisdiction over discretionary or direct spending the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide their spending allocations by subcommittee if the house and senate wish to compel their committees to develop legislation conforming existing revenue direct spending or debtlimit law to budget resolution policies they may include reconciliation directives in the budget resolution so instructing the appropriate committees reconciliation submissions from committees usually are consolidated into an omnibus bill that is considered under expedited procedures enforcement of budget resolution policies occurs as individual revenue and spending measures including any required reconciliation legislation are considered points of order established in different provisions of the 1974 congressional budget act allow members to object to legislation that would violate budget resolution policies unless the points of order are waived or set aside7 balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 the 1985 balanced budget act title ii of pl 99177 as amended by the budget enforcement act of 1990 and other laws established adjustable limits on discretionary spending and subjected direct spending and revenue legislation to payasyougo paygo requirement under the paygo requirement direct spending and revenue legislation enacted for fiscal year could not in the net incur deficit on multiyear paygo scorecard the discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement were enforced by sequestration procedure involving largely acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs8 sequestration was triggered shortly after the end of congressional session if the director of the office of management and budget omb estimated in sequestration report that one or more of the discretionary spending categories would be breached or the paygo requirement would be violated section 254 of the 1985 balanced budget act required the president to issue sequestration order carrying out any spending reductions identified by the omb director as being necessary to eliminate spending limit breach or paygo violation 7 for more information on points of order under the 1974 act see crs report 97865 points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturno 8 more detailed explanation of sequestration is presented in crs report rl31137 sequestration procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act by robert keith crs4 suspension of procedures budget enforcement procedures under the 1974 and 1985 acts generally have tended over the years to restrict the consideration of legislation that would create or worsen deficit in times of economic downturn such as recession or low growth the federal government may wish to pursue stimulative fiscal policy entailing increases in spending or reductions in revenue some antirecessionary features of the federal budget are automatic due to the design of permanent laws eg spending for unemployment compensation and welfare benefits rise and payroll tax revenues fall as workers lose their jobs but congress may choose to augment these features by enacting legislation to further increase spending or cut taxes the suspension procedures discussed here are intended to allow congress to set aside in single action key procedural roadblocks that could stymie the quick enactment of spending and revenue legislation needed to deal with serious economic downturn five budget enforcement procedures in the 1974 and 1985 acts were subject to suspension due to low economic growth see table 1 suspension would have occurred upon the issuance of lowgrowth report by cbo and the subsequent enactment into law of suspension resolution pursuant to section 258 of the 1985 balanced budget act9 section 258a provided for the development and consideration of suspension resolution section 258b indicated the specific budget enforcement procedures suspended upon the enactment of suspension resolution and section 258c provided for the restoration of the procedures four of the mechanisms involved points of order under the congressional budget process against legislation that violated 1 the spending ceilings or revenue floors in the budget resolution and in the senate only social security surpluses or deficits 2 committee allocations and subdivisions of spending made under the budget resolution 3 deficitneutral requirement for amendments offered to reconciliation bills and 4 in the senate only the discretionary spending limits established under statute these four pointoforder provisions form the core of substantive enforcement of the budget resolution nonetheless there are many other points of order established under the 1974 act and their operation is unaffected by determination of low economic growth some of these points of order pertain to timing or jurisdictional issues eg section 303a bars the consideration of spending or revenue legislation for fiscal year until the budget resolution for that fiscal year has been adopted and section 306 bars the consideration of legislation changing the budget process unless it has been reported or discharged from the budget committee but some also deal with substantive enforcement issues in addition 9 the current section originated as section 254 of the 1985 act 99 stat 10781080 and was renumbered and modified by section 13101f of the budget enforcement act of 1990 104 stat 1388593 through 595 it is codified at 2 usc 907a in its original form the section also provided for the suspension of pointoforder provisions in section 301i and 304b of the 1974 act however these pointoforder provisions later were dropped from the 1974 act and the reference to them in the suspension procedures was dropped as well crs5 budget enforcement procedures such as the senates paygo rule may be included in annual budget resolutions the fifth procedural mechanism subject to suspension during period of low economic growth was the sequestration process under the 1985 balanced budget act which enforced the discretionary spending limits and the statutory paygo requirement table 1 budget enforcement mechanisms subject to suspension due to low economic growth requirement source 1 cost of legislation may not exceed committee section 302f of the 1974 allocations and subdivisions of spending under congressional budget act the budget resolution 2 amendments to reconciliation measures must section 310d of the 1974 be deficitneutral congressional budget act 3 cost of legislation may not violate spending section 311a of the 1974 ceilings or revenue floors in the budget congressional budget act resolution and in the senate only social security surpluses or deficits 4 cost of legislation in the senate only may not section 312b of the 1974 exceed the discretionary spending limits congressional budget act established under statute 5 presidential sequestration order providing section 254 of the 1985 for largely acrosstheboard spending cuts in balanced budget act nonexempt programs must be issued if annual appropriations exceed the statutory limits on discretionary spending or the net effect of direct spending and revenue legislation enacted for the fiscal year leads to deficit on the paygo scorecard cbo lowgrowth report under section 258 of the 1985 balanced budget act the responsibility for notifying congress of actual or estimated low economic growth rested with cbo specifically cbo was required to inform congress if actual real economic growth was less than 1 or estimated real economic growth was projected to be negative crs6 under section 254 i10 of the 1985 balanced budget act cbo was required to notify congress at any time if either of two situations occurred 1 cbo or omb estimated two consecutive quarters of real economic growth ie economic growth adjusted to remove the effects of inflation less than zero during the six quarter period consisting of the most recently completed quarter the current quarter and the four ensuing quarters or 2 the commerce department indicated in its advance preliminary or final reports of actual real economic growth that real economic growth was less than 1 for the most recently reported quarter and the quarter before that consequently any one of three different agencies could have prepared determinations of low economic growth but it was cbos responsibility alone to transmit that information to congress for purposes of triggering suspension resolution section 254 i was silent regarding the form of the cbo notification in the past it had taken the form of letter from the cbo director to the speaker of the house and the president of the senate the cbo lowgrowth report sometimes was inserted the into the congressional record by the senate majority leader upon his introduction of suspension resolution and sometimes has been printed as house document suspension resolution section 258a of the 1985 act set forth procedures for the development and consideration of suspension resolution the issuance of lowgrowth report by cbo triggered the introduction of suspension resolution the senate majority leader was required to introduce the legislation but such action was optional for the house majority leader suspension resolution had to be drafted in accordance with the form prescribed in section 258a2 the box below provides an example of the text of suspension resolution upon its introduction by the majority leader suspension resolution was referred in the senate to the budget committee and in the house to the appropriate committees which presumably could have included the budget and rules committees the committees had to report the resolution to their respective houses within five days without amendment if committee did not report suspension resolution within five days it was automatically discharged and the resolution was placed on the appropriate calendar 10 section 258 mistakenly referred to cbo lowgrowth report issued under section 254j of the 1985 act not section 254i section 254j formerly dealt with cbo lowgrowth reports but section 10206 of the budget enforcement act of 1997 111 stat 704 renumbered the paragraphs in section 254 without also changing the reference in section 258 to be consistent the revised section 254j dealt with ombs use of economic and technical assumptions in sequestration reports crs7 example of suspension resolution sjres 28 107th congress joint resolution suspending certain provisions of law pursuant to section 258a2 of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 resolved by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that the congress declares that the conditions specified in section 254i of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 are met and the implementation of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 chapter 11 of title 31 united states code and part c of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 are modified as described in section 258b of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 in the senate vote on final passage of suspension resolution had to occur within five days of session after it had been reported or discharged11 the suspension resolution was considered to be privileged measure and section 258a4 set forth several procedures to expedite its consideration including limitation of five hours for debate and bar against offering any amendments although section 258a did not provide any similar procedures to expedite floor consideration in the house the house routinely employs special rules reported by the house rules committee or other devices to expedite the consideration of legislation the second house to act on suspension resolution was required at the time of the vote on final passage to consider the measure passed by the other body accordingly assuming that amendments had been added passage of the suspension resolution by the second body would have caused it to be sent directly to the president for his approval without the need for conference specific enforcement procedures subject to suspension section 258 b of the 1985 act indicated the specific enforcement procedures that were to be suspended upon the enactment of suspension resolution these five procedures are discussed in more detail below 11 under senate precedents the chair would call for vote on the suspension resolution by midnight of the fifth day if the senate had not already taken this action this matter is discussed in us congress senate committee on the budget budget process law annotated 1993 edition by william g dauster senate print 10349 washington october 1993 pages 623625 crs8 section 302f section 302 of the 1974 congressional budget act provides for the allocation to committees of the aggregate spending levels in the budget resolution the house and senate appropriations committees in turn subdivide their total spending allocations among their subcommittees this process allows the spending policies in the budget resolution to be enforced as individual bills particularly the annual appropriations acts are considered section 302f generally prohibits the consideration of legislation that would violate committee spending allocation or subdivision sections 310d1 and 2 section 310 of the 1974 act sets forth budget reconciliation procedures under reconciliation budget resolution may include directives to house and senate committees to recommend changes in direct spending and revenue laws in order to bring direct spending and revenue levels into conformity with budget resolution policies the recommendations of the instructed committees usually are incorporated into an omnibus reconciliation bill which is considered under expedited procedures sections 310d1 and 2 generally prohibit amendments to reconciliation measures considered in the house and senate respectively that are not deficit neutral section 311a section 311a of the 1974 act generally prohibits the consideration of budgetary measures that would violate the aggregate levels in the budget resolution ie total budget authority outlays and revenues violations would occur if the legislation was expected to cause spending to exceed the ceilings or revenues to fall below the floors section 311a also prohibits in the senate only the consideration of legislation that would decrease social security surpluses or increase social security deficits relative to such levels as set forth in the budget resolution the house uses different enforcement mechanism independent of the 1974 act to protect the social security balances section 312b1 section 312b1 of the 1974 act provides for point of order in the senate against the consideration of any measure that would cause the discretionary spending limits established under section 251 of the 1985 balanced budget act as adjusted to be exceeded comparable point of order in the senate was first established in law in 1990 as part of temporary title of the 1974 act title vi budget agreement enforcement provisions12 title vi was repealed by the budget enforcement act of 1997 but the senate pointoforder provision was incorporated into the 1974 act as section 312b113 section 258b in indicating the specific enforcement mechanisms that are suspended includes an outdated reference to title vi of the 1974 act however when the senate point of order was added to section 312 in 1997 provision for its 12 the provision was section 601b as added by section 13111 of the budget enforcement act of 1990 104 stat 1388602 and 603 13 the budget enforcement act of 1997 was title x of pl 10533 the balanced budget act of 1997 section 10118 111 stat 695 repealed title vi of the 1974 act and section 10113 111 stat 687688 incorporated the senate pointoforder provision crs9 suspension upon the enactment of suspension resolution under section 258 of the 1985 act was included as section 312b2 part c of the 1985 balanced budget act as stated previously the 1985 balanced budget act as amended by the budget enforcement act of 1990 and other laws established discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement enforced by sequestration section 254 of the 1985 act required omb to issue sequestration reports at least three times year preview report in conjunction with the submission of the presidents budget early in the session an update report in august and final report within 15 days after congressional session ended cbo issued sequestration reports as well but they were advisory only any sequester under the discretionary spending limits the paygo requirement or both would have occurred shortly after the final omb report was issued in addition withinsession sequester under the discretionary spending limits could have been required during the following session but prior to july 1 if the enactment of supplemental appropriations measure caused violation of the discretionary spending limits section 258b would have precluded the subsequent issuance of any sequestration report or any sequestration order for example if suspension resolution were enacted in late in year eg 2001 but before the end of the congressional session the issuance of ombs final sequestration report for the pertinent fiscal year eg fy2002 would have been prevented and sequester for that year could have occurred similarly there would have been sequestration reports or sequester for the following fiscal year eg fy2003 the enactment of suspension resolution would not however have canceled sequestration order that already had been issued 31 usc 1103 section 258b also would have suspended another provision of law 31 usc 1103 which generally states congresss commitment to the goal of avoiding deficits14 however this reference probably is mistaken another provision of title 31 31 usc 1105f required the presidents annual budget submission to comply with the deficit targets established in the 1985 balanced budget act this requirement was terminated several years later when the use of deficit targets was abandoned presumably the drafters of section 258b had intended to refer to section 1105f not section 1103 in any event section 1103 does not contain any enforcement mechanism merely policy exhortation restoration of enforcement procedures section 258c of the 1985 balanced budget act provided for the restoration of budget enforcement procedures following period of suspension under the section enforcement procedures were restored automatically for the first fiscal year beginning at least 12 months after the enactment of suspension resolution using the previous example if suspension resolution were enacted in late 2001 but before the end of the congressional session budget enforcement procedures would be suspended for fy2002fy2003 and restored for fy2004 14 this provision is sometimes referred to as the byrd amendment after its sponsor senator harry f byrd jr of virginia crs10 record of experience during the years that the procedures for suspending budget enforcement provisions were available the united states was in period of sustained low economic growth only twice toward the end of calendar year 1990 and the beginning of calendar year 1991 and toward the end of calendar year 2001 and the beginning of calendar year 2002 in 1991 cbo issued lowgrowth reports three times and the senate considered but failed to pass three suspension resolutions the house did not take any actions under the suspension procedures that year cbo did not issue lowgrowth reports for any other years until 2001 on october 31 2001 cbo issued its fourth lowgrowth report senator tom daschle the majority leader introduced suspension resolution sjres 28 on november 2 which the senate rejected on november 13 on january 30 2002 cbo issued its fifth and final lowgrowth report majority leader daschle introduced suspension resolution sjres 31 on february 7 which the senate rejected on february 14 the house did not consider suspension resolution in either instance15 senate actions taken in 1991 2001 and 2002 are summarized in table 2 and discussed in more detail below table 2 senate action on suspension resolutions date cbo report resolution date congress submitted number

voice as table 2 shows the senate strongly rejected each of the four suspension resolutions determined by rollcall vote by an average margin of 494 although the house and senate did not suspended budget enforcement mechanisms under the low growth suspension procedure they have effectively suspended them in the past on casebycase basis in some instances the house and senate took advantage of features in current enforcement procedures that allow some flexibility in their application such as by designating certain spending to be emergency requirements or waived points of order under the 1974 congressional budget act in other cases 15 see nussle says house should not consider resolution suspending budget enforcement by bud newman bna daily report for executives 217 tuesday november 13 2001 page g1 crs11 special provisions were enacted that intervened in the normal operation of the budget enforcement procedures to prevent sequester that otherwise would have occurred such as by instructing the omb director to set paygo balances to zero16 sjres 44 102nd congress on january 23 1991 cbo director robert reischauer submitted lowgrowth report to congress according to the report both cbo and omb projected real economic growth to be less than zero for the quarter that had just ended the last quarter of calendar year 1990 and the current quarter the first quarter of 1991 that same day senate majority leader george mitchell introduced the required suspension resolution sjres 4417 sjres 44 was referred to the senate budget committee which ordered it reported without written report unfavorably on january 24 by vote of 210 before consideration of sjres 44 began on january 31 the senate agreed by unanimous consent to reduce the debate limitation from five hours to two hours during senate debate on the measure senators james sasser and pete domenici the chairman and ranking member respectively of the budget committee and other senators spoke in opposition to the suspension resolution18 they expressed their reluctance to suspend procedures needed to enforce the bipartisan budget agreement embodied in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 reached only three months earlier further they pointed out that many economists expected the recession to be mild and over by midyear even without any legislative action by congress if necessary they maintained fiscally stimulative legislation could be accommodated by designating spending increases or revenue reductions to be emergency requirements thus exempting them from enforcement procedures additionally they pointed to the need to avoid actions that could cause further uncertainty regarding the economy while the united states was engaged in hostilities with iraq under operation desert storm another argument raised against the suspension resolution was that the issue would be revisited if the recession proved to be longer and deeper than projected at that time sustained low growth would require that cbo issue another report in the next quarter giving the senate another opportunity to consider suspension resolution after short debate the senate rejected sjres 44 by vote of 297 16 for detailed discussion of this subject see crs report rl31155 techniques for preventing budget sequester by robert keith 17 see the congressional record of january 23 1991 at pages 21282129 for majority leader

consent majority of senators spoke in opposition to the suspension resolution including chairman sasser and ranking member domenici of the budget committee although concerns were expressed about the length of the recession statements that budget enforcement should not be abandoned were reiterated largely for the same reasons as before later that day the senate rejected the measure by vote of 592

of the senators including chairman sasser and ranking member domenici of the budget committee spoke against passage of the suspension resolution although the recession had persisted for months they stated its depth had adhered to recent projections which showed the recession coming to an end in the near term several senators dissented from this view arguing in particular that spending needed to be increased sharply for extended unemployment benefits and other emerging priorities chairman sasser maintained that the emergency designation feature of the budget enforcement procedures allowed the necessary flexibility to provide spending increases for high priority items without abandoning budget discipline altogether when we crafted the budget law we understood the limitations of the suspension mechanism suspension would be only last resort and we understood that there had to be an interim remedy between the extremes there had to be remedy between absolute chaos if we suspend and absolute immobility if nothing is done in time of economic distress and the interim remedy that was fashioned was called emergency designation safety valve if you will designed for onetime spending to alleviate sudden and unforeseen problems 23 the senate rejected sjres 186 on september 19 by vote of 888 sjres 28 107th congress on october 31 2001 cbo issued its fourth lowgrowth report cbo director

wednesday november 14 2001 page g8 crs14 commented on the need to enact legislation stimulating the weakened economy and responding to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 but argued that longterm fiscal discipline should not be undermined in acting on such measures he stated the suspension resolution would have us decide now in one fell swoop whether to suspend budget enforcement for the next 2 years i think it is very important that everybody understand what would happen if we went against the recommendation of the budget committee and threw out these budget procedures there would be protections special protections for fiscal discipline for the next 2 years i think such blanket waiver would be most unwise we will be much better off if we continue to look at each bill and amendment individually and retain the ability to invoke budget enforcement procedures against those that threaten our longterm fiscal discipline this is fundamental way we protect the integrity of the trust funds of social security and medicare for the long term26 senator phil gramm spoke in favor of not suspending budget enforcement procedures arguing that they were needed to thwart pending efforts to spend more than the 40 billion in emergency spending that congress had agreed to in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks there seems now to be mad rush to force feed the president into spending money27 representative jim nussle chairman of the house budget committee recommended in letter to house majority leader richard armey that the house not consider suspension resolution he wrote i believe the congress should avail itself of other tools to permit the consideration of the stimulus package and other terroristrelated legislation under existing law the congress can effectively exempt legislation from budget controls by designating it as an emergency it can also selectively waive components of the budget resolution to permit consideration of specific bills28 the house did not consider suspension resolution in connection with the fourth cbo lowgrowth report sjres 31 107th congress the congressional budget office issued its fifth lowgrowth report on january 30

consent debate time first was reduced to 30 minutes but then was yielded back altogether and senators spoke on the merits of the measure ranking member domenici of the budget committee inserted brief statement into the congressional record in the statement he cited recent indicators of an increasingly positive economic outlook bipartisan interest in maintaining budget enforcement procedures and the flexibility to waive the procedures when necessary as reasons to reject the suspension resolution the tools of fiscal discipline must be contained so we can convey to the american public and the markets that we are keeping an eye not only on the current challenges we face but also those longer term challenges we must maintain the provisions of the budget act that provide us with that future discipline and we must deal with both tax and spending legislation today while waiving the budget act on case by case basis as needed31 30 see the congressional record of february 7 2002 at page s497
