kouchners visit to iraq classified by political ministercouncelor josiah rosenblatt for reaso ns 14 b d 1 c summary french fm kouchners visit to iraq allowed france to reengage meaningfully with wide range of iraqi political and confessionalethnic leaders and left kouchner moved by the extent of destruction in that country the french mfa told us august 24 that kouchner and his staff are still reflecting over the visit as they decide how to follow up kouchners interlocutors received his message of solidarity and desire to help with appreciation kouchner also took pains to dissociate his visit from the usg and denied any link to the meeting in maine between presidents bush and sarkozy the mfa denies kouchner formally offered to organize dialogue among iraqis and believes the press has exaggerated the importance of some public musing on kouchners part france will reach out to the eu in support of new multilateral initiative the mfa expects to be in touch with the usg as well although it may wait to see how things play out in washington in response to the petraeus report the contours of french thinking should be clearer by the time of the unga which will be coincidence given kouchners desire to place the at the head of multinational effort for iraqi reconstruction one concrete result of the visit was kouchners decision to proceed with stalled plans to establish french embassy office in irbil for budget and other administrative reasons however it is unclear when it will be set up end summary 2 c french mfa iraq desk officer olivier masseret provided readout august 24 of fm kouchners visit to iraq august 1921 his main points number of which have been made in the press included the visit was entirely at kouchners initiative and was in way tied to the meeting in maine between presidents bush and sarkozy masseret recalled kouchners longstanding ties to kurdish leader and current former president of iraq jalal talabani who had been pressing kouchner to visit since kouchner became foreign minister making it clear that the visit in way occurred at the request of the us or in furtherance of us policies was something kouchner stressed with each of his interlocutors masseret complained that it has been hard to shake the press from the false but understandable impression that presidents bush and sarkozy had discussed or approved the visit when they met in maine kouchner also carried with him copy of an editorial he wrote before the march 2003 invasion entitled neither saddam nor war to correct the misimpression that kouchner had supported us military force to remove saddam hussein kouchners jampacked schedule included meetings with nearly every political leader and just about every confessional grouping masseret indicated that kouchner knew he had some work to do rebuilding frances image this included dispelling the notion that france still harbors some nostalgia for the days when iraqs sunnis dominated the political scene masseret sought to correct the misimpression that kouchner only had contacts among kurds to say that this visit revealed to many for the first time that he was well known in all the major ethnic and confessional groups iraqi leaders responded well to kouchners core message of solidarity with the iraqi peoples suffering readiness to listen and help and commitment to turning the page in the iraqifrench relationship there was some grousing about frances policy under president chirac but even that seemed pro forma if anything according to masseret the angriest sentiment iraqis expressed was that france had waited so long after saddam husseins fall to reengage meaningfully if anything impressed kouchner it was the absolute devastation that marked iraq in all spheres especially the economic and social this fueled kouchners view as expressed publicly that iraqs ongoing crisis was not merely national tragedy but catastrophe whose already dramatic regional implications are only increasing masseret said it may seem simplistic but the visit was an eyeopening and moving experience for kouchner in particular the plight of iraqs christians touched kouchner because of the escalating persecution they seem to face comment this was point kouchner made in an interview on one of the nightly national newscasts end comment 3 c kouchner and his staff are now reflecting on the visit and trying to figure out what to make frances focus and how best to rally european and other international support masseret dismissed press speculation about paris 00003534 002 of 002 possible frenchhosted gathering of iraqi leaders along the lines of the intralebanese dialogue kouchner initiated he explained that kouchner did muse to reporters that france would be open to creating safe space for competing factions to meet but it was more concrete than that he denied that kouchner made the offer in his various meetings and agreed that president talabanis rejection of such an initiative effectively took it off the table at least for now the bottom line for kouchner masseret continued was that anything france does add real value and not appear to another case of france off on its own pursuing objectives that had other buyin 4 c masseret spoke of the angle which is symbolically and ideologically important to kouchner as reported in the media masseret spoke of kouchners insistence on arriving in baghdad exactly four years after the bombing of the compound that killed his friend sergio mello and many former colleagues from kouchners days directing efforts in kosovo kouchner further insisted that his first official act in bagdhad be the laying of wreath at the site of the bombing to honor the fallen it was not clear to masseret how the will fit into kouchners thinking but press reports were right to highlight the key role he will want it to play in any concerted multilateral effort 5 c how europe will fit into french ideas for the way forward in iraq is central aspect of evolving french thinking masseret would not comment on press reports of tepid responses by many of kouchners eu colleagues in response to his encouragement that they follow his lead europe however will be key should france seek to mobilize more robust presence and effort in iraq although there are plans just yet france will seek an appropriate eu ministerial to discuss increased and concerted support for iraq masseret said that kouchner will need to convince his colleagues that this is not just another instance of france going off on its own but something that has implications for eu interests in the middle east 6 c working with the us is another subject under discussion masseret said that kouchner wants to consult with the secretary as he did august 24 on regular basis but preserve frances independence this includes its ability to speak its mind when and as it deems necessary agreeing that the visit arguably transformed the iraq issue from being subject of disagreement to one about which we could have useful dialogue the mfa will probably not have recommendations on what to say to the us until the current reflection period ends while not saying how long that might last he surmised that france will be ready to talk to us and others about iraq on the margins of the unga in late september noting the release of the petraeus report in midseptember masseret expected it would inform french thinking not merely for its content but also for its impact on us policy afterward 7 c one area of usfrench cooperation masseret praised effusively was the outstanding help provided for kouchners visit by baghdad deputy polcouns rob waller on oneyear tdy from his job as paris nea watcher his role was vital in ensuring coordination of security and other logistical arrangements comment the acting director of the mfas equivalent to our nea bureau echoed this point in separate encounter 8 c as final note masseret confirmed tentative press reporting that the mfa is now committed to the idea of opening an embassy office in irbil he elaborated that it would be lightly staffed sort of french presence post and not expected to handle consular duties too few french citizens in northern iraq desire to take on visa work in irbil when asked about the timeframe masseret was vague citing budgetary and other administrative issues that needed to be worked out another problem arose after kouchner started informing his interlocutors of the office in irbil as shia contacts pressed for similar office in basra for balance kouchner made vague commitment to do what he could but masseret stated the security situation in basra at the moment clearly ruled that idea out of the question please visit paris classified website at
