r4 auditing lecture given on 26 november 1963 thank you well thank you is that because i havent seen you in so long all right this is the what of what audience twentysixth november twentysixth of november how did it get to be that well saint hill special briefing course well were very glad youre here youre just in time to be launched for saturn some people are very clever some people are very clever and arrive right on the spot at the exact moment necessary to resolve the case and the new students have been of course they dont have the oldtimers clawandpawthroughitall uncertainty will we ever make it will ron make it is it possible well i see weve shifted again to well i guess that wasnt so good you know scientology dianetics in the last thirteen years now we got it pretty well taped these days too well so the romance has now gone out of it we can take somebody now by the nape of the neck off the street and bit by bit and edge by edge and level by level push him right straight through out the top beyond any target man ever dreamed of the techniques are all there it doesnt mean that as you hit the top level that it isnt awe used to have tightwire walk across the grand canyon that we used to use as an example you know well actually the tightwire is little bit of an overstatement in the matter thatsthats putting it up too high actually its busted spider thread across the top of the grand canyon there are going to be some people even good auditors who get up there and walk around for quite while trying to get their big toe on the edge of it see the levels that you see as they come up the line all look very confident and theyre all very fine till you get to the highest level and there the best trained pcthe best trained pc reaches with his ballet slipper for the near edge of that spider thread you see and goes over and grabs hold of the small cedar tree five hundred feet down and climbs back up again laboriously gets to the edge at that moment the auditor inadvertently steps on his fingers this sequence of dramatic events continue for some time until he is safely out over the middle of the canyon with nothing below him and the roaring water thousands of feet down and at that pointat that point he gets wrong goal the umbrella collapses on him dont you see and hes lefted there in suspended animation the only way he can possibly make it is his case shape is now sufficiently good that he can maintain suspended animation in empty space it isnt that itit isnt that it isnt frightening and it isnt that it isnt spectacular he just happens to be able to do it at this particular point i know ive seen them now until you get bank to spit you see and to spit hasthis is an alleged gpm for to spithas thirtytwo items in it you see without any of them having reached up to the crossover see none of theseall the items on the terminal side are still in favor of the goalthis is quite remarkableif they are in favor of anything and they have certain things like blacksmiths forges you see and so on well you maybe could tie that in to spit and that sort of thing thats fine and they have world war ii and catastrophe and my mothers handkerchief and well thats probably connected with it in some particular fashion and barrel organs well steam calliope you might be able to see it you see but barrel organ after whileafter all and so on and the oppterms that these things solve are such things as the constitution clouds clouds that might possibly make it you see the ocean that might possibly make it too and so forth library books we cant quite see how that connects and we look at these things and well say well theres something you can conclude about this that something has either been overlisted or underlisted or its an implant gpm or its only an actual goal or or or or or in other words there are about eight things you can conclude that would be wrong and you have to conclude that its at least one of those eight or its simply that the auditor is finding far too many items for that bank you know bank usually runs from twenty to twentyfour items and somewhere in the vicinity of ten to twelve items from the bottom youve reached the crossover and the itemsterminals above that point are longer for the goal they are against it on gradient so we see all kinds of wild things and if we dont know our business why there it is well we got an impression from this that it is long road and that it is complex road and that its very difficult the most difficult end of it however is finding the present time gpm thats the most difficult end of it and of course at that point we find the auditor the least experienced the pc the least experienced and the hardest part of that to find is the existing latest terminal of the present time gpm which of course is not the top terminal its just how far up this bank has gotten dont you see and to find that terminal then becomes the touchiest trickiest piece of auditing ever done and this is being done by wholly inexperienced pc and it is being done by an auditor who is just getting his feet wet particularly with this pc the hardest part of it is practically the beginning of it and this operates as quite an effective barout however it is resolvable the funny part of it is that you cant mess up right item or right sequence now by that i dont mean that you cant get items in wrong places or gpms in juxtapositions which you can but even though you list and list and cross list and suppress and get wrong items and everything else the funny part of it is the actual bank is still there ready to be run out when somebody hits the happy combination you cannot wreck case you can only kill pc thats something for you to console yourself with after he gets back from the between lives areathey arent able to wreck the case either dont you seeand he picks up another body why somebody will be able to audit him just as before they will find the bank little scrambled but they can go through it and get what it is this is very remarkable the only thing that doesnt disappear is the incorrect item the improperly worded goal the wrong goal these thingsthese things dont disappear as matter of fact they tend to appear which is another thing that adds some misery to the passage they tend to appear if you find goal on somebody to have big ears i swear his ears would start growing if its wrong goal if you see somebody dramatizing an item that was found yesterday thats very sure proof that it was wrong item the validation of wrong item tends more than anything else to throw it into the behavior pattern of the pc which is quite interesting somebody has an item to be mean or gpm let us say to be mean it happens to be wrong goal but its been validated like mad and he believes implicitly and the auditor believes implicitly that this happens to be correct rendition and by george that pc will get mean thats way of testing it out because you see when youve found right one it ceases to have power of making the pc dramatize and when you find wrong one and say its right it is now possessed of power to make the pc dramatize an unimportant point but little side commentary its just something that makes the way little more arduous we find goal to be tired and it happens to be justjust goal its only goal its not an actual gpm at all and we find this thing to be tired and its found just at the end of the pcs intensive and he goes for week now before he gets audited again and during that entire week he will be completely exhausted and hell know what it is its that goal that is making him this way and this consoles him and so on however in the first few minutes of play of the following intensive the goal is discovered not to list the rr turns off something catastrophic occurs and somebody finds that this is not right goal and they go ahead and continue the list and null it down and find the right goal for the list and to be tired has nothing whatsoever to do with it at that point the pc tends to cease to be tired now if we had found the gpmthe correct gpm to be tired and it was the right gpm then some of the pcs feelings of tiredness would vanish he wouldnt get more tired hed get less tired this is just side commentary and chitchat that im giving you here its just the way is arduous you can believe the most horrible things about yourself for while you know you do this list and you get this goal and its supposed to be the pt gpm you see to be thief and this is ladled out to you as the real mccoy you see and you look at that and you say well i know its degrading but i should accept it and i shouldnt keep insisting on high tone gpm and it probably is my gpm and i realize that and ii did steal some sugar once and just explain it you see and go around feeling very degraded and so forth and sort of restraining stealing things you know and then all of sudden it turns out that that happens to be wrong gpm you see actually the right one was to be saint something like this you see and maybe that was wrong too but if that was wrong then youd go around for the next week or two you see with growing halo but i it was right you would cease to be so saintly in other words you get the reduction of aberration with correctness and you get an additive aberration with uncorrectness now that doesnt mean that this is very disturbing or aberrative but it does tend to upset somebody and youll see this happening and that simply adds some more danger to the line the killing power of gpm is not to be questioned you get gpm wrapped too thoroughly around somebodys neck and you can kill him deader than mackerel i might as well tell that here between us girls and boys it takes some real doing it would be awful lousy auditing it would have to be absolutely incredible you would have had to audit the fellow with his rr off for whole intensive youd had to shove the items down his throat with thud and disarrange all the gpms in the bank practically and drop them in front of him when they should have been behind him on the track youd have to make some colossal blunders that oneone would really have to work at to accomplish this but the end product is you could knock off body with it that merely adds to the difficulties im just cheering you up long ago you got audited beautifully through your lumbosis now you havent had lumbosis for just years until you get into the second gpm and an item which is an incorrect itemthe auditor didnt take the first one on the list that fell but made something else read and goes five items beyond it pain suddenly turns on boy have you got lumbosis you got lumbosis you never heard of before this is more lumbosis than you ever dreamed of because anything you got rid of in early auditing is going to be found again just to cheer you up now actually its only wrong ri that gives you somatics only wrong gpm that gives you the somatics and the creaks this is quite interesting right gpm or correct gpmof course with this one proviso that on gpm you can get sufficient invalidation of it it will act like wrong goal and give somebody the creaks or somatics you understand that you could actually make right one act like wrong one well with that slight proviso gpm which is correct gpm and item ever turns on any pain of any kind whatsoever if found in proper sequence they only turn on heat they do not turn on sen they do not turn on pain they only turn on heat great swelling waves of heat globular radiant waves of heat and thats properly found item in proper sequence nothing but heat pain this is so much true that if you find pain on an item you unload you hit the silk gracefully and with swan dive that is the end of that you go back and find out where you erred you will normally find that the item two or three back of you on the line plottwo or three items backstill reads if it still reads the list it came off of was improperly done that is to say theres higher item usually on that list that was the right item the auditor overshot the right item found the wrong item naturally as you try to oppose that item it will continue to read you will thereafter usually get nothing but wrong items for the remainder of the bank thats cheerful isnt it one of your awarenesses will turn up on the fact the pc turns on pain that means youve got wrong item right there which is unlikely or an item which you have had just before was wrong probably it was an earlier item on the list from which the wrong item came that was the right item its already been listed its sitting right there dont continue lists these days for heavens sakes try to make the earlier item read if these rules dont follow you are not auditing right gpm that is all you are just doing only goal or youre getting locks on an implant gpm theres something wrong with the gpm if these rules dont apply this is very precise material there are only few elements to handle these elements we are getting together to show you in terms of actual model form the new students are very very lucky theyll be trained from scratch in this particular technology there are only certain objects in the mind and they can only get disarranged in certain ways and only certain things can go wrong with the mind and actually those things are not significances but masses significance poof poof who cares its the mass its the mass that counts and these masses are in different shapes sizes with different names behaviors and sequences and its all very simple theres not very much to it but youd be surprised how much complexity can come out of four or five different kinds of items i mean different kinds of objects in the mind and you just get variety endless variety out of the thing and every once in while why you slip from grace as an auditor and omit something from your patter you forget to ask about implant gpms you know youll start saying is this thethis the gpm you know and wraabow and it reads and you run it and nothing works right and ooooh my and you get about ten items later and yousuddenly it dawns on you that this thing isnt following any sequence anybody ever heard of theres pains turning on in the pc the thing is going all wrong your needles kind of getting stuck up it isnt too bad but it just seems to be sour and nothing seems to be able to get into proper sequence and that sort of thing and you brightly do an examination of it again and you remember that you didnt ask if it was an implant gpm uuuuuuh and you ask it now and you get beautiful blowdown and that is the end of that then of course you can have an implant gpm and an actual gpm which have the same name have the same goal there are several like this any pc is common enough to pick up one of these because of course implant gpms are designed on the actual bank except theythis might be of historical interest to youthey really didnt know what an actual bank was composed of they knew it had goals and they knew it had ris but thats all they knew about it so obviously they never cleared anybody because those items oppose and actual gpm items solve quite remarkable they knew the goals opposed and so theythen they presupposed that the items opposed and they dont and so they could just have messed everybody up like fire drill if they had known that other little piece of technology they didnt know it so now we have these beautiful implant gpms that student auditors can practice on and i think it was very nice of them to provide us with practice material so that people can see what rocket reads look like and see what patterns look like and that sort of thing the difference is of course that in an implant gpm you always have to use oppose and in an actual gpm it is solved only goals oppose each other in actual gpms goals always oppose items always solve so item lists always contain the word solve goals lists always contain the word oppose and never any other way i wont look at anybody just now so as to be accusative but ive seen this violated lately items opposeimplant gpm distinguishes an implant gpm from an actual gpm i think it is quite amusing they didnt know in an actual gpm the items always solve always solve who or what would solve caterwump its very seldom statement of goal but sometimes too might occur in the item wording like well of course as silly as going too far but you can actually have wanting to get out see and it might occur in gpm you see that has nothing about to get out in it you know gpm to not be bothered see and it contains this item wanting to get out somewhere on your goals list this pc is going to write down to get out difficult dont you see hes going to put on this list and its liable to get read when the whole thing is all charged up because items read on the burden of the whole charge of everything dont you see so you get wanting to get out which tends to give you something that looks like goal to get out well its worse than that sometimes lock item will have goal wording as part of it i had one myself wantingnot wanting to find fault and the goal read is to find fault three telegraph poles and what was left of ronnie later we found out it was an ri not goal to find fault see i was perfectly willing to say well all i do is find fault and thats i mean that fits my personality you know trying to degrade degrade to fit myself into this thing and i got more and more nattery and more and more naggy you see and then we finally find out it was just an ri and that was the end of that interesting butso there is the source of goal and the source of trouble sometimes you have the tag end of an item that will give you read like its goal thats rare but it does occur the most trouble youll get into and the most horrible thing that can occur to anybody is this implant gpm and actual gpm which are the same goal and you pick up an ri out of the implant gpm and you use it to solve dont you see and you get the pc running the implant on the track of the implant gpm thinking you are running the actual gpm while you were doing it and youll get items like somebody or something with goal to spit see well of course there are suchyou dont have items like that in an actual gpm you dont have these somebodys and the goal to and all of that thats just implant stuff see they didnt know what they were doing fortunately because if they had really known what they were doing they would have put those banks together so they did exactly what banks do and brother you couldnt have pried pc apart with crowbar that would have made it ten times as hard but its rough enough you sometimes will take an actual gpm ri or something like this get over into the implant gpm and the rr shuts off oh marvelous now youve got rr so it couldnt have been an implant actual gpm the rr shuts off because that isnt the wording of the implant gpm exactly see something like that lets say you have an actual gpm to be big man see actual gpm and youve got an implant gpm well to be mean or something but theres something about couple of these words you see that hang up on each other dont you know and you find the pc over here running on the implant track and the rr shuts off so you say well there is actual gpm to be big man because the guys implantthe guys rr shut off so that proves there was actual gpm here so well abandon it i dont know how many sessions later somebody gets bright enough to realize the pc was simply misplaced on the track that leave you little bit adrift well its very simple youre supposed to be running down this aisle you see with the pc and actually youve gotten an item for which you dont have goal accidentally from some implant so you then follow this item listing that so you overlist go around corner jump out of the actual gpm see and go over into this implant gpm youre now running in the zone and area of that implant gpm guys rr shuts off so you say to be big manthere cant be an actual goal there because thethe rr shut off sure test that theres goal isnt it well its sure test up to that point then you throw it all away you see thats the usual thing throw it all away dump it all overboard get rid of it and start anew and eightyninepage goals list later you still havent found the guys goal naturally it was the right goal pc was just being run in the wrong place oh you got lot of fun ahead of you im just trying to paint bright sunny cheerful picture here this is rough stuff im not kidding you but there are rules there are rules and those rules take you through and the thing is all figured out and the only thing that wrecks you on these ruleswell its like its the first fall on the list almost invariable almost never otherwise than the first fall on the list and this if your pc is in session at all is usually the first and last item of the list but its certainly the first nice fall on the list the first fall on the list actually and factually that if the pcs running any kind of shape at all why thats the way these things start to fall into place first fall on the list you call it back to the pc and it doesnt read you maybe list little bit further you get some charge off or something like this go back and try to make that first fall read again just because it didnt read is reason it wont go back there and chew away at it unburden it little bit try and list little bit further and so forth and all of sudden youre staring at this firstyou got another read oh boy something reads beautifully and you try to give it to the pc and theres something wrong about this thing and you go backtracking and read that first fall again and work it over real good nine times out of ten it all of sudden caves in great big surge great big disintegrating rocket read blow on down and so forth and you say brightly is that your item yeah why didnt you give it to in the first place on this item has anything been suppressed all right thank you thats your item crash another great big read you know you cant be convinced that it all doesnt run off easily you think the auditor shouldnt have to work for living see you say all right lets just list and list until we see great big blowdown and big fall and then lets take that item and give it to the pc and then hes in illinois and then hes in another bank and then hes doing an implant gpm item and then heshesand so on and hes getting kind of weird looking and the creaks are turning on in all directions and somebody gets hold of it and they see this big beautiful item that you got it went just like that on him bang you just had him put down one two three items just like that and that third item just went booom and you know thorough full loads wonderful you know just gorgeous except you just got through missing three ris of course when you oppose that because youve skipped some ris instantly you will skip into another gpm its just like sending somebody off with rocket miss an ri the item that you get after that might be in the bank youre listing in but it goes phheeeeuuuu your next list chicago get the idea thats how you jump from bank to bank thats how pcs are made to jump from bank to bank missing an ri well it was pretty hard at first to find out where this rr really lived on this list and that was difficult because we were using oppose thinking it was on the same pattern as an implant gpm when it isnt soon as we got to using solve the dangerous item is the first one on the list because sometimes the pc is saying oh pcs saying well i hadi had some good cognitions on that and so forth and the auditors sitting here and hes getting his paper ready dont you see and the pc all of sudden without any pause of breath or anything like this or any word of warning says guttersnipes oh guttersnipes yes yes heres your question who or what and so on and you go ahead and list it you didnt see guttersnipes on the meter when he said it you didnt see it so you go on down you get ten or twelveitem list and nothings falling and you try to get it into shape and you know so you null the whole list and you go down guttersnipe fluhuhuhuhuhhuhgo down to the end of the thing and you get this big blowing item down here at the end you say thats obviously the pcs item first fall on the list number ten first fall on the list obvious there it is fell easily and it read right away and the pc apparently happy all right who or what wouldand this thing is crab apples you seeall right who or what would solve crab apples you see oh somebody or something with goal to eat sabahbahbabahbah babauhhuhbahbahbahbahbahand oh lets hit couple of more actual gpms carom off couple of engrams you see and do corner billiard you see off the helatrobus and we come up with the item scavengers mm sounds good pc says all right so all right lets oppose scavengers now see all right who or what would scavengers solve would be your next question well its the absence of eating good implant item the starvation starving people those who are starving nice implant item that reads good see nice oh thatsthats honey thats honey thats good big beautiful read blowdown oh yeah yeah show the instructor you know it blew down i mean there it is were all set you see we got this starvation starvation all right who or what would solve starvation to run away running away beings who run away those who run away somebody or something that runs away oh that reads that reads it doesnt read somebody or something that runs away im sorry it didnt read the upper one the first fall that read it doesnt read well lets see now somebody or something that okay give some more items now who or what would solve starvation oh cooks restaurants somebody or something with the goal to eat somebody or something with goal to eat here ill null this we got an itemwe got an item list here you know its now got twenty items on it now i got twentyfive items on it when we go back nothing reads youre trying to get this thing to read and it wont read where are we were nowhere man what happened who pulled the rug out pcs starting to say where did you learn how to audit you know starting to pull this line well i told you little while ago that the item was actually eating well and so forth and you didnt listen to and so forth and oooooooh well of course the actual action that you undertake is traceable back to that list on which guttersnipes occurred now you go back to that you go back to that list and you read the item that you took off of it ten down see you read that item and its got read on it it goes cltskcltsk you read it and it goes cltsk what does that mean that doesnt mean it hasnt been opposed that is never what it means that never is underscored as in implants never means it is unopposed i dont care if it rocket reads and stands up on its tail and barks see it has nothing to do with it hasnt been listed against see you say well i found the right item i found the right item is ticking but i havent then properly opposed it so thats why its still ticking and thats wrong cut your throat because thats never right hanever dont ever go daydreaming on this man if after youve done down the list what would now be on the line plot even though its still on your list i dont care if it ticks if it rocket reads or if it blows smoke out of the meter we dont care what is the quality of read it only means one thing the item list it came off of is incorrect in that you took the wrong item off the list you understand its an incorrect action and that item that ticks is always improper for that location its not the next item to it its not the item it came from thats improper its it its very simple one to remember it sends up little red flag and waves it and it ticks or it rocket reads or it blows up the meter we dont care what that item is wrong now the proper thing to do you see would have been just scrub all the rest of this stuff and get back there on that line plot and read the items you found and you get back hereyou get back here to crab apples and it goes clank well you took the list offtake the list off which you got crab apples the list off which you got crab apples understand go earlier on that list and roll up your sleeves and go to work because almost invariable theres an earlier item on that list its almost invariable that an earlier item on that list went undetected by you and in this particular example im giving you its guttersnipes which was written down when the auditor wasnt watching and so forth and there it is and you read guttersnipes and it doesnt say thing now its real good and stuck you see youve put wrong item in its place so its got it good and scrunched now it would have been tough enough to make this thing read in the first place but youve now unloaded an item where it belongs now this could be true of any of the ten itany of the nine items which preceded crab apples it could be true of any one of those items how you going to make that read it requires nothing but genius so wrap it up and just do it youve got to make one of them read only after you have totally convinced that none of them can be made to read in any way shape or form do you ever extend that list any at all and that man extension of list is last resort in modern ot auditing thats the last resort that is just i dont know its sort of like throwing in the sponge youll usually find out that the item was so burdened that it didnt read well but now that youve gotten the other item off of it and so forth you go back and read it and it now will read and blow down almost always earlier than the wrong item was located on the list youve got ten items on the list the wrong item was number ten its almost invariablyso i never pay any attention to any other circumstances its items one to nine on that list its one of those items of course if youre smart cookie you never miss fall youve got builtin periscope into your eyeball by which you can see the fall of the meter even while youre arranging the papers and the pc said something and the meter falls i carry this to considerable extent ill hear the pc talking about something and i will keep one eye slanted slightly on the meter and when i get that and the pc says thingswhy i saw one the other day walking fast the pc said i was walking fast and i noticed that walking fast gave an instant rocket read and i used it as crossverification of the bank we were walking into thats right the goal was to be fast the pc had offered it up as something else so i was able to correct the bank through my inspection of what the pc was chattering about you can also go far astray on this the pc suddenly conceives something or other is his next goal or the next oppterm or something of this character and he says something with regard to it and it tends to rocket read and if you bought it right there at that moment without further inspection youd probably get yourself into lot of trouble and some because youll get yourself in enough trouble you see by whensometimes you buy them after inspection and theyre still haywire see youve gotyou get it into enough trouble with the ordinary methods without being extraordinary you dont have to work to get into trouble at auditing to ot at all its just sitting there at every bend of the trail its all over the place see as youre crossing grand canyon if it isnt meteors why its boiling water splashing from below dont you see and if it isnt that its hurricane winds suddenly springing up and if the hurricane wind isnt bad enough it happens to be blowing anvils that day you see you always look for these things so actually you dont have to be original to make trouble because you see theres plenty of trouble there with the most ordinary textbook methods all right well there you seenow youre four items later pcs got two more three more banks chewed in of course youre just going to go back and continue the list thats going to solve the whole thing but the pcs sort of nattery and arc broke and youve had some session arc breaks and hes got some overts now on the session and he isnt running so well and he isnt cogniting now nicely and so forth and he wont start cogniting again until you get out of the little disturbed area that you had him in then he starts cogniting again heat is harder to get off and so forth but these goofs occur i got halfway down bank the other night in pc imagine it ten items deep gorgeous ten items running like startled gazelle and all of sudden guuhhere was list and it was getting longer i couldnt get anything to read and that list was getting longer well i dont exactly subscribe to the school that pcs are better off for having suffered i dont subscribe to that school thats an old school of opera you know you couldnt sing unless you had suffered you know and i dont think thats true of pcs so as soon as i noticed that list getting bit overlong i became cynical concerning the line plot that we already had and went chasing back up that line plot again just reading each item in sequence not reading them backwards but reading them in the sequence that they were found always try to read items in the sequence they were found always try to read goals in the sequence they were listed do it in the sequence they were put down or found and youll find out there was much less disturbance sometimes you can make somebodys bank go creaky by reading backwards or suddenly jumping back from late item to an early item you know and the pcguy goes creak because they still have location in space anyway so i went chasing back up the bank and ill be of gun if it wasnt the third oppterm i just absolutely was willing to spit ballpoints yaaaaaaoow there it sat the third oppterm the third one and here i was at ten ill be of monkey it was sitting there i call it tick it was saying very nicely tick oh you drunk skunk i said uuuh huuuuh so i fished the list out former session list and i fished the list out and went earlier on the list and sure enough it was earlier on the list it was up at the top the danger point of the list is always the first item on whether thats goals list or an items list its always the danger point it had been missed i had read it but it couldnt be made to read i think there was some other little conditions concerning the thing been an upset or somesome little minor additional thing oh i remember what it was it wasit had been left that way between intensives and so the item had been sort of gummed up with the period of waiting in between so it didnt list very nicely it wasnt actually falling nicely as the pc listed and it didnt start falling nicely until it got down to about the fourth item well youre not very critical when you see that the fourth item fell when called to the pc blew down very nicely pc was happy with it everything solved in all directions and it listed very well and apparently stayed in the bank and everything was happy and cheerful from there on out youre not very critical of it you see you go and buy the thing but it was ticking and i found the earlier item was i think number one on that list aaaah i beg your pardon i beg your pardon ive just given you piece of misinformation i just remembered it utterly it was the item just above it and the pc had added the item that i found and that was when i learned that items with pain on themi had been noticing this beforethe item had momentary pain on it when given to the pc it wasnt the third item it was the fourth it was the list from the third item that was in error all right thats beside the point it was simply earlier on the list by one item heartbreaking of course that took the line plot and that was it he now only had three items on the line plot i put the fourth item on the line plot that i had gotten in and just proceeded straight from there i didnt try to sell the pc any of these other items you never give the pc anything dont give the pc thing that theyve had before just scrap it from there on man thats it finish you sit there you think youve got ten items in the bank and suddenly you have three items in the bank the fallroof falls in just like that now you dont have ten items in the bank you dont have maybe some of those items will come up later and the pc will put them on the list and maybe they will all line up later but only if the pc put them back on the list again sometimes an auditor probably will be seen kind of shoving the line plot at the pc saying dont you want some of these items there theres some nice items there you have nice items there and so forth mmmmmm you want to arc break pc try it because theyre probably all out of scramble in sequence and anything else and usually theyre mostly locks the pc just launches off at that longthat wrong item he just launches off into locks and he gets nothing but locks and other bank items after that and so forth and then he may freakily through another double mistake double back into the bank and actually get an actual ri and then for two or three items it runs straight you see but then it goes out of the bank again because you got the bypassed charge and so you cantyou dont know which ones of those things are straight so you can do nothing with any of them so you just take off where you corrected and proceed from there and if youre very very lucky and if you said your sunday school lessons very well and stayed out of dallas youll getyoull get yourself situation there where the pc will suddenly put pair back on the list say oh yes thats railroad locomotives and drunk engineers they belong there oh thats where they belong yeah oh thats where they belong yeah thats right but its only in the course of listing and you write them down on the new list there arejustjust go on writing on your new list just as though he never heard of them before thats what mistake on an item means and thats how you correct and thats where you straighten them out and thats how you hold it in line it is adroit an item list of two items should be regarded as moving into the zone of overlisted items are usually overlisted goals lists are almost always underlisted goals lists are almost never completealmost never theyre so arduous you take such pity on the pc you break it off one way or the other and they just never get complete list and the pc will add few goals and you null those and the pc adds few goals and you null those and you just cant find the pcs goal and you add few goals and you null those and you add few goals and finally you get down one for one the pc will add goal you read the goal back and you say that doesnt read and the pc adds goal you read the goal back you say it doesnt read echo metering whatever the pc says you say it and look at it on the meter actually thats about the grimmest thing that can happen and you know why its grim because the goal with complete list may have been five or six number five or six on the list way up at the beginning the moral of this storythe moral of this story is to do complete list before you null it that is the moral and in view of the fact thats almost impossible to guarantee when you dont find it on your extended list at once renull the whole cottonpicking early list you should always be terribly thorough on goals lists goals list is an arduous mean vicious mechanical clanking proposition it is done what goal went up hahaha oh that goal went up haha wawawawawa wawawawawawa wawawawawawa thats with fall with the rr with the tick with the fall with the blowdown watching the tone arm watching the tone arm over here does the tone arm have motion left in it finally we get down to tone arm motion now we begin to watch for the last fall on the list and we finally find the last fall on the list and then we go fifty beyond it we go not fortynine not thirtyeight not fiftyseven we go fifty five0 how big is fall fall is distinguishable read that might be the fall of goal you will find that if you continue list beyond that fifty flat point with ta that you start roughing up the pcs needle the pc starts listing himself off that section or area of the time track and starts listing himself into other areas and you start crimping up the bank and other evils set in so goals list is complete when you have totally run out of tano ta action and fifty beyond the last decentlooking fall on the list finished goals list has very smooth beautiful completelooking needle nothing goes off on it nothing man i mean that thing is just flowing just dry smooth as little river of butter and when you null it complete list just goes smooth as river of butter theres nothing in at all but the pcs goal and that rocket reads like startled gazelle pow and when you get to it you just check couple of more falls on the list to make sure you havent got two rocket reads on that list and you give the pc the goal it is bad policy to continue nulling the goals list for the next three or four sessions after you have found the pcs goal that is not good policy it puts certain amount of strain on things actually it invalidates the pcs goal you can always tell if the pcs goal is on the list not by standing and chanting at the meter is this goal on the list is this complete list is this an inc i wouldnt give you two nickelsman i wouldnt give you any communist money for the value of question like is this list complete ive just never seen the question correct see i dont care whether it reads or it doesnt read ive just gotten to point now where i know what questions will ouijaboard and what questions wont and that one wont ouijaboard is the goal on the list is the goal not on the list hehbahhehbehthaa i dont know will the united states be here long will the united states not be here long silly questions see everybody knows whats going to happen to it it wont be here long obviously now there is way of telling not unless they get some cops there is way of telling there is way of telling is this pc in relaxed arc broken frame of mind thats about the first test seem happy when you finished the goals list when pc refuses to list you usually only have to put in suppress and the pc goes on listing you dont even have to tell him to go on listing you see his stopping listing and his nattering have nothing to do with that but when you finally finish this list the pc seem calm seem happy relaxed is that needle flowing nicely the last few goals that went on the list did they disturb the needle in the slightest or did they just leave that needle completely smooth when he said them nothing happened these are all tests and very very important one has pc got heat did some heat come off start coming off is this list kind of blowy is the pc getting heat now somewhere did heat turn on on this list not pain heat some heat turn on man if some heat turned on that goal is on that list that right there you can go to it at once bark bark bark and there itll be reading beautifully now thats what complete goals list actually looks like those questions were all answered one way or the other but if he didnt turn on heat it still doesnt invalidate the list now what youll run into sometimes on nulling goals list i should remark on because its quite amazing and mad violate audit with moving tone arm you know saying things to the pc while the tone arm is moving you see do things while the tone arm is moving you see thats violation of basic auditing and of course lot of violations of basic auditing gets you into trouble in doing these upper level processes in fact it all requires basic auditing which is long smoothyou know you dont even notice it the auditor and the pc dont even notice the basic auditing thats in progress thats the best kind of basic auditing to occur and when you get this long smooth list and the pcs had heat youve got another little hurdle that just makes life just little bit interesting and id better tell you about this because youre going to run into it sometime youre going to be totally baffled it isnt seldom that you run into it you run into it quite frequently as you start the pc the pcs getting more and more ot dont you see and his meters reading easier and easier and easier and this phenomenon turns on better and better and better youre auditing while the tone arm is moving in other words youve started nulling the list see bark bark bark and all of sudden you see big surges start off of this thing you see and surges go off of this thing tone arms blowing around here and so forth well i dont particularly stop and twiddle my thumbs just because thisi go on and null the list because you could waste an awful lot of time doing something like that dont you see nevertheless its violation of basic auditing to befor the auditor to be acting while the tone arm is moving and this is the kind of silliness which now occurs if you violate that if youre not awfully slippery and youre for sure going to violate it because youre not going to sit there when you get to this level of auditing for half an hour waiting for some tone arm action to disappear before you give the pc his goal see he will finally arc break on you any vocal impingement on the pc causes rocket read and man if you dont know that youre going to be in more trouble now let give you the exact statement any vocal impingement on the pc may give you rocket read thats very accurate and most of them do so you say anything to the pc like you read him the next goal and of course it appears to rocket read and you read him the next goal and it appears to rocket read and you read him the next goal and it appears to rocket read or youve got goal and it appears to rocket read and you go down the line five more and it appears to rocket read so you say youve got two rocket reading items on this list so therefore this is only true you know when youre getting this blowdown youve already seen this meter blowing around and the pc has had heat those things are vitally necessary before this other phenomena that i am telling you about takes place this doesnt take place unless youve had heat see on the thing and you say well theres two rocket reading goals on the list lets extend the list two rocket reading items on the list the rules say extend the list but you didnt have two rocket reading items on the list you had two rocket reading vocal impingements on the pc actually his bank is simply sitting there right in front of you and youre not actually hitting the pc with anything but your voice can actually impact bit of the bank and every time it impacts bit of the bank of course it blows huge surge into this meter and you say cats and youd get surge on the meter you getyour vocal impingement is whats kicking your meter and you can read this actually very directly after heat is turned on in goals list this is something to know because sooner or later before you get to be an old veteran at this youre going to arc break pc by refusing to give him his goal because everything on the list is reading at this particular time the pc can unfortunately get upset while this blowdown is going on and pc can get sufficiently upset that youre going to get the protest rocket reading so now anything you say rocket reads and any protest the pc has rocket reads and then there are occasional surges going on anyhow now you try to walk yourself through that much rocket reading and that much contradictory information now we try to do case analysis see got nice blowingdown goal see going to do case analysis see is this an implant gpm rocket read is it an actual gpm rocket read is this only goal rocket read is this just an item rocket read now sometimes it isnt that consistent so you dont notice it you say is this only goal rocket read is this an implant gpm read is this an actual gpm read ah well its only goal all right well lets check this out again is this an implant gpm rocket read is this an actual gpm rocket read is this only goal read whats going on here whats going on here see well what youre actually doing youre just bucking away at blowingdown meter and thisthis pc is throwing off charge and heat and everything else and you really shouldnt be doing anything by the basic rules of auditing your voice is then causing your own rocket read you see your voice hits his bank and if its this way and that way it either always or occasionally causes the meter to go bang and you will notice this once in while ive seen an item list failure to give pc an item on an item listand ive seen pcan item list with six items on it with the pc blowing down on the right item but the right item not spotted by the auditor with six items then reading and blowdown in progress matter what was read to the pc the pc arc broke at the same time and so not being informative pc arc broke of course because you havent given him the item how can you give the pc the item youve got six items on the list youve got six rocket reads any one of them will rocket read you cant tell which one of them is and which one of them isnt well that whole trouble and upset causes from flying into the teeth of moving tone arm trying to do case analysis locate items and that sort of thing your proper action of course is to sit quietly back and let the tone arm stop moving now youll have to do that on item finding you cant possibly afford to do it on goals lists but you have to do it on item finding you say to the pc youve got this thing reading you see pow you sayall right you sayand youve seen that the blowdown starts and so you say is that your item now you really see it read big surge see and the pcs got more confidence in it you see big surge and you got more confidence and youll see this thing blowing down youre just fool if you say thing youre just being fool youre just making trouble for yourself i mean you just must be silent at that point just be silent just keep your big yap shut dont say word and let that thing blow down now it frankly is only going to take it about thirty seconds to blow down where youre going to take your big error is waiting for ten minutes for it to finish off all of its tone arm action and of course youre just going to waste lot of auditing time doing that you want to get the major read off of that and its come down here now to lets saythis is not theyou just dont pay any attention to this numeralbut let us say it has come down to 32 see this is just an example its blown down to 32 it doesnt seem to be moving now you say all right thats your item now shut up because first you said is that your item dont you see see you say that reads is that your item let show you sequence here that reads youre saying grapevine grapevine anything on that been suppressed grapevine that reads is that your item youre going to see psssseeeeeeew more confidence because youre asking him if its his item you see oh yeah he says oh yeah thats fine i mean thats my item thats my item thats my item zooooooo this thing comes down here about 32 see you didnt say word while it was doing it hes terribly introverted he wont notice that youre being silent he isnt expecting anything to happen hes looking at this what do you know you know now its at 32 and it appears to be momentarily stable at 32 dont sit there and wait for the next halfhour to see if its going to move again or youre going to get into mess you now say to the pcyou now say to the pc thats your item good whoa good i thought that was my item see bsssoooooooooosh 28 comes down to 28 apparently stable now the pc says yeah you know all of sudden every time i get in the car and i see girl and so forth and so on i get this greatand she tells rumor or something like that i almost go mad you know and its so on but im always wanting to find out what it is and i never want to hear it and this is terrible situation ive been in and so forth and this thing is going pocketapocketapocketapocketa and youre getting tone arm motion tone arm motion here and so on and he finally shuts up youll find that by the time he shuts up your meters probably recovered thisdont pay any attention to these figures theyre just relative you see maybe recovered to 35 now if you hang around that corner drugstore and you wait around leaning against that telegraph pole you going to wrap somebody around it theres nice piece of timing its now regained the height its going to regain and youll see that meters do this they regain this higher level the tone arm actions gone out of them youve just seen the new item move into place and the old item go awaybecause the meters regained it slightly and you say all right see now were all set here that was vackety yacketyyacketyyacketyyacketa now lets blow some more charge out of this thing see you dontit doesnt have to have regained anything for you to blow this charge out but im just giving you an example you say all right would caterwumps solve grapevine watch your meter at this point man watch your meter turn on those big beautiful eyes of yours and put them right straight on that dial because you want about twoinch peeeeeew when those two items collide i dont care if hes already said it you always say it hell sometimes say well i already told you and so on werent you listening to you cut my itsa and so forth i already told you that caterwumps solve wrawrawrawrawrawra i dont cwe care what he said you always put it in we dont care if hes said it we dont care if he put in all the courtesy steps himself there is still tone arm action left on those courtesy steps put in by the auditor the auditor is still the auditor and auditing works still because of an auditor so we say all right we found this new item you say would grapevines be solved by caterwumps or would caterwumps solve grapevine which is the better wording when youve got an oppterm whichever it was or both it doesnt matter and you watch you watch and you will see those two items come together and they go psssssst and youll see about the nicest twoinch bang as they hit that you ever wanted to see not because you say one or the other of the items but because youve spoken about them coming together would it solve blah see and youll see it go boom and thats one of your basic proofs that youve got the right item when it do not do it get suppress in do little something here monkey around little bit test this over get suspicious when youve gotten suppress in ask him again just as though you havent asked him before would caterwump solve grapevines pc says oh yes and this time you see the twoinch bang you say thats fine and get off of that see now how does grapevineyour next step which follows immediately afterwards you dont have to worry much about the tone arm action you say you say in uncertain terms you say how would grapevines or how does grapevines relate to now be careful now dont you use that goal wording dont you use the goal as an ri get off of that dont say how would it grapevines relate to to eat flunk flunk flunk see because youre going to pull the goal as an ri up the bank and keep it restimulated he knows what gpm hes running let him worry about that so you say how would it relate to this gpm now he sometimes has to say to himself now lets see gpm it was to eat something like that there seems to be question in his mind itll always come true now thats not as reliable test as saying the goal that youre trying to relate it to its not as reliable but it is less kickthepcinthehead see its much easier on the pc and it restimulates the bank less and you will get another bang and another blowdown and as soon as you say how does grapevines relate to this gpmthe proper wording seehe says oh well its so and so on and so on and its up in the bank and so forth i guess its so on and so on and so on its aboutits about the third or fourth oppterm i guess and so forth yeah yeah thats what it is you all of sudden see another blowdown and youll see your needle and your needle will go peeeewsst again we blow it out with relationship then to the actual gpm mass that is your proper step at that particular point now he may have something to say and he might not have something to say there might be little more tone arm action if so you could wait it out but it would just be matter until it regained certain level soon as it regains certain level your tone armyou see your tone arms coming back up and so forth you might let it come back up bit or let it come back up have at him again with the next question see which of course is who or what would solve grapevines or something of the sort just have him with the next question list it down and youre away with the same repeat action in actual fact it takes from four to twelve minutes to ask the question list the ri get it to read back get the tone arm action off get the courtesy steps in get their tone arm action off and be ready for the next question between four and twelve minutessomewhere in that vicinity sometimes youre rolling hotter than pistol the pcs working very very good and you make up your average in the session by getting one in two minutes or something like that you see but usually your average is bit more than this and youll find your session average of once every twelve minutes is perfectly acceptable session average of one every hour i dont know what are you doing you must be going on vacations between ris something else going on here its notnot thenot what is expected just give you an idea of the expectancy if you can add up hundred andtwentyminute session of actual auditing in the session dont you see hundred and twenty minutes of actual auditing in the sessionand find that you have found ten ris in that session the pc is running well youre going very smoothly everything is moving fine and so forth dont expect this to happen when youve run into trouble youve accidentally overshot an item found wrong item youre going back up and have to repatch the bank you found yourself running wrong goal and now youve got to have right goal and the bank is all gummed up and that sort of thing this sort of thing is not expected now youre going to have to hunt and punch and grope in the dark and fall over old odd bits that youve left in the middle of the room dont you see so you wont come up to your average so good and maybe youll do very well to get one in fifteen or twenty minutes youre having rougher time of it and so forth but as soon as you get things straightened out and get out of the affected zone that had got kicked around and so forth it should fall right back to about one every twelve minutes the thing to do is to get the tone arm action off of those things you dont want those things to read anymore tone arm action is mainly caused by the discharge of energy in the form of heat on the pc those surges you dont want to get new item going before the old surges are off dont you see theres limit at which this takes place you could of course stretch this and take half an hour to let the surges all come off of the item you found ill tell you joke for the last twenty minutes of those theyre coming slowly off the new item you havent found youre not finding the surges off the old item the pc has moved into the new position in the bank and without even knowing what the ri is but having some halfdim idea and so forth of it he will continue to get surges so the surges off an item actually are those that come off in the first part of the run and down to the last courtesy step of it do you got the routine to take those are exactly the way you find those things i suppose you understand such things as crude as thisthat after youve opposed you what would the goal what would to eat oppose what goal would to eat oppose and youve got the new goal to starve to death you realize of course that youve got to oppose the ri to eat the goal as an ri to eat against the top oppterm of the new gpm you just found well that is usually fairly easy and it follows the same rules its solve question it is not an oppose question youve found the two goals on oppose see but this is now solve and you say who or what would to eat solve is your right question to get that oppterm and you normally get them in exactly the same way it actually doesnt take any more trouble and so forth but wise auditor does nice little piece of case analysis he does nice little dance around the top of that thing after hes got that all taped hes got the next goal hes checked it out and so forth hes found the two top ris hes found the top oppterm and he has found the top terminal and so forth he does not now go like fast rabbit around the track he holds hard because the top of the list is the dangerous item the most likely to be overlooked and the one youre likely to make the most mistakes on are the four top items of which the most dangerous are the top two youll find that most of your mistakes are made in the four top items of the bank but that the majority of those are made in the first two items of the bank and you want to check those out you want to run case analysis after youve found the top oppterm you found the new gpm you got that and you got its top oppterm you now got its top terminal and so forth and youre all square you want to run yourself case analysis is there anything above these things see is there any other item are these things correct see are they incorrect and youre getting some kind of equivocal reads and you cant make out what they are you should proceed cautiously because if youve got wrong goalyou could have just an actual goal or something like that but if youve got wrong goal or something like this you can get the two top onesthe top oppterm and the top terminal you can get those usually your rr doesnt start shutting downthe length of the fall doesnt start shutting downuntil you get the third item now you dont mess up pc very much by finding wrong top item and then having to find right one or find wrong goal and find its top oppterm and then discard it and then find right goal and find its top oppterm this is not going to mess up the pc to amount to anything but if you actually go so far as to find the twothe next goal the two top ris and the third and fourth ris in that new bankif it is wrong goal thats it the rr is going to go off and that needle is going to freeze that needle is just going to freeze absolutely still and nothing will fall until you start listing for goals it doesnt matter what you list now the pcs had it he has rr he has fall he has tone arm action he has nothing it just sits there with frozen zzzzzo bzzzz and he gives you something brrrr you can get nothing to fall you cant get anything to move that meter just freezes right up and believe this is hell on pc it wont kill him it wont do anything to him particularly but it sureit suresomething like taking several tablespoons full of sand raw without salt good so if youre going to find anything wrong with gpm why find it before you depart from the two top ris now that you have found those is noand that the rr has stayed onis not guarantee you can get sometimes as far as four items or even five items deep into gpm without turning off the rr if its wrong goal you can get that deep and the thing will still be reading but real sharp auditor will have seen his falls getting shorter from three inches they have become two inches from two inches they have become one inch from one inch they have become quarter of an inch and he would have to be dead asleep not to have noticed something was wrong by this time the meter locks up hes in wrong goal the ris hes finding are of course wrong theyre being dragged from some other gpms youre getting gpms dragged all over the place and all hell is breaking loose in your auditing and it is big pluperfect mess actually the number of things you can do wrong are few the elements you are handling are few the precision of the technique is great there are nothere are very few variables in this technique i dont know of any as matter of fact its something like if you have white salt shaker on the table why that means there is salt shaker on the table and if there is none on the table then there is none on the table i mean its that type of testing stuff certain things occur you could even audit this stuff by arc breaks every time you tried to do something the pc arc breaks you shouldeven you decide after while that theres something wrong with that direction you know you could evenyou could herd yourself down through this stuff with pc arc breaks little bit hard on the pc but you can do it youll notice that when you undertake such and so an action the pc is not arc broken but when you undertake any other action than that he is arc broken then you can figure out from that what is correct or incorrect about the bank every time you tell him to list more goals his arc break ceases every timehes selling you all the time that you have found his goal dont you see but hes selling you at highpitched scream see what youve already got this goal to eat youve already got this goal and there it is and i dont want you invalidating my goals all the time and everything you know the horrible things that happen with regard to this sort of thing you already got this goal and so forth and you say well were going to list few more goals and he sits there and he says uhto jump to run to ride bicycle to manicure my fingernails and so forth and so forth and you say well thats all right we dont seem to be getting any reads on this particular list lets go back and take this goal to eat well i told you all the time that the thing was the goal its the right goal i mean for christs sakescould have told you long time ago its the right goal whats and you say well when he lists goals he isnt arc broken therefore we have found wrong goal slippy see you can use an arc break to adjudicate it there are many ways of steering through it case analysisheres another tip i better give youis always done by blowdown and even then is about 50 percent reliable cases analysis is always done by blowdown dont ever believe only the needle believe the blowdown is this an actual gpm tick so what you can buy ticks anyplace any watch company has lots of ticks see theyre cheap you can get them by the barrelload it means absolutely nothing and you say is this an actual gpm pseeeeeew little blowdown on the tone arm ah yes yeah thats an actual gpm thatswe got some little confidence theres 50 percent chance that its an actual gpm maybemaybe better maybe 64 percent chance its an actual gpm not 100 percent but the blowdown gives you that chance tick gives you chance at all forget it the case analysis you should really depend on in your analysesresults that you should really depend onshould be accompanied by blowdown particularly after an arc breaky upset period you finally found something wrong and then you finally found what was right about this and you find out what was right and it goes pseeeew well youve got 64 percent chance that that was what it was see and you got 36 percent chance that it wasnt and that having accepted this you will now be in just as much soup as before if not more so but the blowdownthe blowdown is what you want to put your paws on thats what you want to have count little bit of blowdown doesnt matter whether its big blowdown or little blowdown you know but lets make sure the tone arm moves when you ask that signal question see move that tone arm with the question if you dont move the tone arm with question regard it with very jaundiced eye stuff like is this list complete i might believe it if i had halfadivision tone arm action see i say is this list complete get half division tone arm action well that particular question i think theres 30 percent chance in favor of the list being complete cynicism is the rule of the day on case analysis you do everything possible to overrule the tremendous opportunity for error in case analysis because its only as good as the pc can do its only as good as the pc can itsa and its just little bit subitsa below where the pc is actually itsaing dont you see and this also is attended by pcs skill its horrifying to realize that the only people who will ever get to be ot are class ivs thats horrifying nobody else will nobody will make it i know that sounds horrible it sounds absolutelyi saw an oldtimer look up back of here and say what what its true though youd have to practically educate guy into the whole skills of auditing before he knew where he was going his case would have to be as cleaned up as that level of case would clean 123 up case and so forth before he could head in that direction with any reliability because let tell you you took some guy who isnt educated and doesnt know whats happened to him about it you wrap him around telegraph pole you have wrapped him around it with adequate mystery to spin him he doesnt know what the hells happened to him now he has confidence in anything and so forth now im afraid youre not going to make ots out of non scientologists so it takes lot of education to bring them up to that level so your case analysis is actually as reliable as the pcs educational standards does he really know what an actual gpm is well thats the only read youre going to get is this an actual gpm clank supposing he thinks actual gpms are actually something that you implant people with so your case analysis is as reliable as the education of the pc and it is reliable as the pcs itsa now theyouit goes little bit lower than the pcs itsa but its actual fact depends on the pcs itsa because the distance between the pcs itsa and the subitsa is constant distance well thats why case analysis has to be regarded with jaundiced eye every once in while youre going to make mistake and youre going to blame case analysis and its frailties for your own errors youll forget to ask some salient question you will become so expertbecome so expert cook you see that you dont bother to light the fire or something in order to cook the beans you know some little mistake like this you forget to ask if its an actual gpm you see you just slip somewhere and then youll say see case analysis let down well case analysis will let you down often enough without assistance you dont have to help it out any all right well ive tried to give you some very factual data about the running and handling of these ot processes and you noticed today i have not been using the designation which weve been using because the designations that we have been using have become antiquated and were grouping up all auditing skills techniques technologies and levels of auditing into new groups and i found out we didnt have enough groups and so your classifications are about to go up isnt that nice now you can really swank it over people thank you
