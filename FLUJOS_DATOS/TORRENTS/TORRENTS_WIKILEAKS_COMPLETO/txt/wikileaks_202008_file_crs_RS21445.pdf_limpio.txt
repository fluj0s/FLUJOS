act on litigation management the comment period on this rule ends july 6 2004 why the market is unsettled rates too high or too low one knows what price to charge for the risk of losses due to an act of international terrorism though private comp anies have developed models for terrorism losses many express skeptic ism about their predictive capacity and all agree that determining the frequency of future us insured losses due to acts of international terrorism is guesswork that guesswork s important consequen ces for policyholders and the insurance marketplace if insurers price the risk too high then policyholders are unlikely to purchase the coverage and insu rers will have less pr emium to fund future losses for those presumably higher risk who do if insurers price the risk too low they risk insolvency and defaulting on policyholder claims private market will develop only if insurers can match each risk with price that is neither too high nor too low15 while one knows what price should be charged there is some information available about the relative price that is be ing charged for terrorism coverage after substantial increases in the aftermath of september 11 2001 prices have declined significantly for coverage in 200416 for example one source reported that premiums for terrorism coverage added to propertys overall property casualty policy averaged 10 to 30 of the policys cost in early 2003 down from 50 in late 200217 another reports that the price of terrorism cove rage is going down almost daily18 rates for lowriskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21445crs5 18

and paying claims for determining insurers and policyholders shares for auditing the program for approving settlements and for its other administrative tasks under tria and has released proposed rule on initial claims procedures alt hough some changes have been sought in the proposed rule22 treasurys preparations have not spar ked great controversy to date it is likely however that in the event of losses due to another terrorist attack on the united states such issues may become controversial other issues may arise postattack as well for example insurers expect lawsuits fro m policyholders who declined to purchase coverage for acts of terrorism alleging that they were not appropriately notified as required under tria it is also likely that th cause of terrorist sses will be an issue since tria does not cover acts of domestic terrorism and since in surance for terrorism losses under tria usually excludes nucl ear chemical or biological losses will private market develop congress was clear in enacting tria that it expects private market for terrorism insurance to develop before tria sunsets it is unclear and may remain so until the actual sunset of tria whether private market can or will velop reinsurers have re entered the market only on limited scale and prices remain high insurers themselves have reportedly made little progress toward developing any new forms of financing future losses due to terrorism23 on the other hand some know ledgeable observers do believe that private market can and will develop24 treasury officials have repeatedly stated that they do expect private market for terrorism coverage to develop and do not expect that the program will be renewed af ter it sunsets on december 31 200525httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21445crs6 25 continued bestwire june

reinsurance is available to group lif insurers and the extent to which the threat of terrorism is reducing the availability of gr oup life insurance if the current or future availability of this insurance were reduced the secretary would be empowered to then allow group life insurers to participate in the program this studys results were announced on august 15 2003 treasury conc luded from the study that group life insurance availability was not curtailed and was not likely to be curtailed in the future and thus it should not be included in the prog ram this decision disappointed many life insurers26 in addition tria required the secretary to make two reports to congress the first report due nine months afte r enactment is to be on the potential effects of acts of terrorism on the availability of life insurance and other lines of insurance including personal lines27 the act directed the secretary to consult on the study with the naic representatives of the insurance industry and other experts in the insurance field although the enactment of tria was over 17 months ago this report has yet to be delivered to congress the second repor t due by june 30 2005 must include the effectiveness of the program and the likely cap acity of the property and casualty insurance industry to offer insurance for terrorism risk after termina tion of the program and the availability and affordability of such insurance for various policyholders including railroads trucking and public transit28 for this later report the secretary must consult with other experts as needed and with polic yholders as well as th parties consulted for the first study as part of this consulta tion treasury is sending out surveys to the insurance industry to assess the rrorism risk insurance markets tria also directed the s ecretary of the treasury to determine by september 1 2004 whether to extend to the end of 2005 the requi rement that insurers must make terrorism coverage available while tria does not require the secretary to formally report to congress on the make available deter mination congressional interest in this determination is high recent hearings have been held on tria in both the house and senate in these witnesses from treasury were repeatedly remi nded of the importance of the provisions and the desire of some members of congress to see them extended acting well in advance of the september deadline the secretary indicated on june 18 2004 that these provisions would be extended through 2005
