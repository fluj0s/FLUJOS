security and rura l investment act of 2002 pl 107171 fsria was the first omni bus farm bill to explicitly include an energy title title ix the energy title authorized grants loans and loan guarantees to foster research on agriculturebased re newable energy to share development risk and to promote the adoption of renewable energy systems1 for example the us department of agricultures usdas bioenergy program sec 9006 of pl 107171 whose funding expired in fy 2006 provided direct incentives to expand actual production of bioenergy see table 2 for list of provisions in the 2002 farm bills energy title and their funding levels since enactment of the 2002 farm bill in terest in renewable energy has grown rapidly due in large part to strong ri in domestic and international petroleum prices and dramatic acceler ation in domestic biofuels production primarily corn based ethanol2 many policymakers view agricu lturebased biofuels as both catalyst for rural economic development and response to growing energy import dependence ethanol and biodiesel the two most widely used biofuels receive significant federal support in the form of tax incentives loans and grants and regulatory programs3 the 2008 farm bill became law six months after the enactment of the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa pl 110140 and many of its provisions also build on the goals of eisa4 the emphasis on facilitating production of biofuels derived from cellulosic feedst ocks reflects the goals of the renewable fuels standard rfs in eisa it include s significant expansion of the rfs to 36 billion gallons by 2022 with carveouts for biodiesel 1 billion gallons by 2012 and cellulosic ethanol 16 billion gallons by 2022 and an implicit cap on cornstarchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34130crs2

billion gallons by 2015 this rfs expansion is likely to have significant impact on the us agriculture sector5 the emphasis on cellulosic ethanol also reflects increasing concerns about the economic and environmental issues associated with cornstarchbased ethanol record high commodity prices in 2007 and 2008 combined with high energy costs have resulted in sharp increases in livesto ck feed costs export prices and domestic food price inflation for the first time an agricultural commodity is directly competing with petroleum in the market place ethanol production the profitability of which depends directly on both petroleum and corn prices accounts for about third of us corn production the increase in corn used for us ethanol production exceeds the increase in corn produced durin g the past three years today as petroleum prices rise so has demand for ethanol as substitute which in turn increases both the demand for and price of corn the food versus fuel debate intensified during the farm b ill debate as food price infl ation accelerated both in the us and globally highlighting some of the potential problems associated with replacing even small share of the nations gasoline consumption with cornbased ethanol competition for limited corn supp lies between livestock producers ethanol refiners exporters and other dom estic users have resulted in calls for at least partial waiver of the rfs in 20096 cellulosic ethanol is produced from cellulose hemicellulose or lignin which is derived from the structural material th at provides much of the mass of plants cellulosic ethanol is produced from nonfood crops and trees that can be grown on marginal land with low inputs and appear s to offer environm ental benefits over cornbased ethanol7 common sources are grasses corn stover and wood chips many of the federal programs that currently support renewable energy production in general and agriculturebas ed energy production in particular are outside the purview of usda and have legislative origins outside of the farm bill8 for example the rfs mandates the inclusi on of an increasing volume of biofuels in the national fuel supply this originated with the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 and was more recently expanded in eisa similarl the federal tax credits available to biofuels blenders and wind energy producers were initially contained inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34130crs3 9 the conference agreement on the 2008 farm bill was originally approved by the house and the senate as hr 2419 and vetoed by the president in may 2008 both chambers overrode the veto making the bill law pl 110234 however the trade title was inadvertently excluded from the enrolled bill to remedy the situation both chambers repassed the farm bill conference agreement including the trade title as hr 6124 the president vetoed the measure in june 2008 and both chambers agai n overrode the veto which made hr 6124 law pl 110246 and repealed pl 110234 the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 but have now been moved to the farm bill major energy provisions in the 2008 farm bill the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 hr 6124 enacted in june 20089 significantly expands existing programs to promote biofuels like the previous farm bill it contains distinct energy title title ix that covers wide range of energy and agricultural topi cs with extensive attention to biofuels including cornstarch based ethanol ce llulosic ethanol and biodiesel research provisions relating to renewable energy are found in title vii and tax and trade provisions are found in title xv the final 2008 farm bill keeps the structure of title ix as it was in the senate passed version of the farm bill title ix serves as substitute amendment to the 2002 farm bill title ix and consists of 3 sections the first section 9001 contains 13 new provisions which effectively repl ace the provisions of the 2002 bill see table a1 for sidebyside comparison of previous law with the energy titles from the enacted farm bill and the house an d senatepassed versions of the 2008 farm bill key biofuelsrelated pr ovisions in the enacted 2008 farm bill include emphasis on cellulosic ethanol production through new blenders tax credits promotion of ce llulosic feedstocks production feedstocks infrastructure and refinery development grants and loan guarantees for biofuels especially cellulosic research development deployment and production studies of the market and environmental impacts of increased biofuel use expansion of biofuel feedstock availability expansion of the existing bi obased marketing program to encourage federal procurem ent of biobased products support for rural energy effici ency and selfsufficiency

ethanol energy policy issues in the 2008 farm bill cellulosic ethanol the 2008 farm b ill energy title provides 1 billion in financial incentives and support to encour age the production of advanced mainly cellulosic biofuels10 grants and loan guarantees leverage industr investments in new technologies and the pr oduction of cellulosic feedstocks for instance the biomass crop assistance program supports the production of dedicated crop and forest cellulosic feedstocks and provide s incentives for harvest and post production storage and transport advanced biofuels refinery capacity c onstruction is assisted under the biorefinery program for advanced biofuels through grants and loans for the development construc tion and retrofitting of comme rcialscale refineries to produce advanced biofuels these programs are supported by increased funding for advanced biofuels research under the ag ricultural bioenergy feedstock and energy efficiency research and extension initiative and the sun grant program which support and coordinate advanced biofuels researc h extension and development between government agencies universities and research institutions currently cellulosic ethanol is not produ ced on commercial scale as of july 2008 there was one commercial scale refinery under construction two demonstration scale plants and three pilotscale plants completed there are 39 additional plants either under constr uction or in the planning stage11 industry sources expect commercial production of ce llulosic ethanol to begin in 2009 or 2010 the rfs mandates cellulosic ethanol production of 100 million gallons in 2010 tax credits and tariffs title xv of the farm bill contains provisions which extend and modify tax credits and tariffs on ethanol in keeping with the promotion of cellulosic ethanol blenders cred it of 101 per gallon applies to ethanol produced from qualifying cellulosic feedstocks this tax credit is intended to spur investment in cellulosic et hanol production the existing ethanol blenders tax credit of 054 per gallon which applies to all et hanol blended including imports falls to 045 per gallon the first year following that year in which us ethanol production and imports exceed 75 billion gallons it is expected that production and imports in 2008 will exceed 75 billion gallons and the ta x credit will be reduced beginning in 2009httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34130crs5 12 mandatory funds are authorized and provided by legislation discretionary funds must be appropriated annually the import tariff for ethanol benefits th us ethanol industry by protecting us ethanol from lower cost imports th tariff also keeps imported ethanol from benefitting from the blenders tax credit when it is blended into gasoline in the united states the tariff of 054 per gallon which was set to expire at the end of 2008 is now extended to the end of 2010 economic impacts of ethanol production the impact of increased ethanol production on agricultural and ru ral economies was subject of debate during the farm bill process as result the farm bill includes provisions requiring series of reports assessing how et hanol production may be impacting the farm economy the environment and consumer food prices among these are the comprehensive study of biofuels to be conducted by the u s department of agriculture usda the environmental pr otection agency epa the department of energy doe and the national academy of sciences and the biofuels infrastructure study by usda doe depa rtment of transportation dot and epa the biomass crop assistance pr ogram requires an assessment of the economic impacts of expanded cellulosic biomass production on local economies and infrastructures likewise the biomass re search and developm ent
