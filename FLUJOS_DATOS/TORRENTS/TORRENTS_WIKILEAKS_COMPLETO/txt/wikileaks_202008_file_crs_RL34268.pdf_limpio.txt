divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268the federal royalty and tax treatment of the hardrock mineral industry an economic analysis summary under current law the hardrock mineral industry pays royalty to the federal government for the privilege of extracting resources from federal lands this differs from the federal policy toward the coal an d oilgas industries the policy of state governments and the leasing arrangements in the private sector which often require bonus bids and an advalorem royalty on the value of the resulting output hardrock mining on acquired federal nds pays 5 royalty the current federal policy toward hardrock minerals is inconsistent with the fundamental market principle that royalty is factor payment part of the rent paid or the return to land as both marketab capital asset and input to production in general the free developmen t of federal minin g land will result in more public land developed and more minerals produced than is economically efficient another implication is that any economic rents i excess profits to resource owner above the level required to produce or supply the resource in the long run would accrue to private rather than public beneficiaries the free development regime for hardrock minerals on federal lands was created to s timulate economic deve lopment of the west and has more recently been sustained to protect the viability of the united states hardrock mineral industry and to prev ent negative economic impacts on western communities built around that industry intr oducing royalty payment system might have an adverse economic effect on hard rock mineral producers but it would also tend to increase output in the rest of th economy and promote more efficient use of national resources the hardrock mining industry generally has over the last four years been booming and any adverse i ndustry effects would tend to be mitigated the appropriate royalty system accordin g to economic principles is the ad valorem royalty based on th market value of the mineral upon extraction adjusted for any externalityrelated taxes using gross income for depletion purposes is conceptually the same as market value lthough it has practical advantages since that is the basis for producers computation of its percentage depletion allowance for tax purposes using net smelter return the ba sis for most private royalty contracts is conceptually the same as gross income although there may be differences due to deductions for costs and would require new administrative apparatus using the producers net profits as the basis would render the royalty an income tax which would be inconsistent with mainstream economic principles that royalty is part of factor payment and would likely reduce and at times totally eliminate royalty payments the us hardrock minerals i ndustry pays income taxes including the alternative minimum tax and in addition is assessed va riety of claims and patent fees in addition hardrock mining firms qualify for some special tax benefits or subsidies expensing ie current deducti on of exploration and development costs the percentage depletion allowance at rates ranging from 14 to 22 of gross income and deduction for mine closing and reclamation costs the special mining tax breaks are sufficient to lower the effective marginal tax rate slightly below that for other industries these tax rates howev er are currently much higher than the historical rates whic h were either close to zero or negative httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268contents history of the general

an economic analysis since 1872 hardrock mining on federal lands has been governed by the general mining law which allows virtually free access to open public domain lands for mineral prospecting staking claims expl oration and development and extraction without payment of royalty1 and until annual moratoria were imposed by congress starting in 1994 claimants on hardrock miner lands could take title to both the mineral rights and the land after paying to the us department of interior doi the required fee or either 2 50 or 500 per acre and after demonstrating diligent development of the mining claim proposals to reform the mining law ve been made almost from the time it was signed by president grant and throug hout its 135 year history many presidents presidents roosevelt nixon carter and clinton have endeavored to reform the law as have many in congress one of the contentious issues has been that the law makes provision for the payment of royalty on the production of the hardrock minerals from federal lands th royaltyfree treatment of the hardrock mineral industry is unlike mining arrangem ents leases on priv ate and state lands mining of the leasable energy minerals coal oil and gas on federal lands and even unlike hardrock minerals on acquired as contrasted with pu blic federal lands all of which provide for roya lty payment to the landowner2 in recent years the congress has repeat edly considered but not passed reform of the mining law including in part to require the payment of royalties in 1990 committees held several hearings on propos ed mining law reform eg on s 1126 101st congress which among other things would have imposed an 8 advalorem royalty in 1993 president clintons compre hensive economic proposal part of the state of the union address included cla ims fees and 125 advalorem royalty3 several bills were introduced in the 103rd congress to impose royalty hr 322 hr 1708 s 257 s 375 and s 775 and hearings were held in 19934 s

or assess the royalty payments the amounts paid to the landowner on the value of the mineral after it is separated or smelted from its ores the term is somewhat misleading and will be discussed in

the house in november 1993 hr 322 went to conference in 1994 but was not approved reportedly because of opposition from western lawmakers mainly over the royalty issue5 in 1995 there was an unsuccessf ul attempt to incorporate royalty as part of the fy1996 budget in its fy1998 budget proposal and again in fy2001 the clinton administration proposed 5 net smelter royalty but like previous efforts this failed6 at this writing the major reform bill in the house there is currently senate bill is hr 2262 which among other things would impose an 8 ad valorem royalty based on the value of the minerals as defined under the gross income definition of the income tax code essentially the mining firms sales revenue and use the proceeds for the cleanup of abandone d sites the 8 royalty would apply to new production production from existing minin g operations would pay 4 royalty on october 2 2007 the subcommittee on energy and minerals of the house natural resources committee held hearing on this bill substitute bill was marked up and approved by the full committee the house natural resources committee on october 237 the house approved this committee bill with minor amendments on november 1 by vote of 244 to 166 summary of the provisions of the house approved version of hr 2262 is described in the appendix to this report the comparable bill in the senate is s 2750 which also proposes an 8 royalty on new production and 4 royalty on production from existing leases8 this report analyzes the economic i ssues underlying proposals to impose royalty on hardrock locatable minerals on public domain lands9 it also discusses the federal tax treatment of the hardrock mineral industry in particular the report addresses the following questions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs3 what exactly is royalty and how does royalty differ from other rental payments or for that matter taxes were royalty imposed what would be the best way to structure such royalty should the royalty be an advalorem type ie one based on the value or price of the mineral fixed unit based royalty ie one based only on mineral output or net profits royalty ie one based on the net income or profit of the mining company if there is to be an advalorem royalty based on price or value at what stage in the mineral producin g process should value or price be measured should it be based on gross income value of the mineral at the mine or net smelter return the value at the smelter less certain deductions when does mining company produce saleable or marketable product w hose value can be measured what deductions if any should be allowed from that price what should the royalty rate be and how does congress decide what fair royalty rate is how does one balance the various c onsiderations such as efficiency and administrative considerations in deciding whether to impose royalty what would be the economic eff ects of introducing system of royalty payments and other rental payments where one did not exist would royalty harm the domestic and international competitiveness of the us hardrock mining industry finally what taxes and fees does the hardrock mineral industry pay and do they have any bearing on the question of whether to impose or the magnitude of royalty the first section of this report provide s brief history of the 1872 mining law including the mineral leasing system and royalty payment requirements for the energy minerals the second section discusses th economic rationale for the payment of royalties on hardrock minerals it 1 addresses the question of the appropriate economic basis for payment of royalties to the federal government as landowner 2 compares royalties based on market value with alternative criteria such as royalties based on gross income from depletion and net smelter return 3 examines the question of an appropriate ro yalty rate and 4 discusses some of the likely economic effects of royaltyfree provision of public lands as well as the effects of introducing royalty the fifth and final section exa mines the federal tax provisions including the three tax subsidies that affect the hardrock minerals industry as well as claims and patent fees that the industry pays note that the question of payment of royalties from hardrock mineral production on public lands is part of much broader bate relating to reform of the mining lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs4 10 for example under the patenting system fee title to mineral lands was conveyed to the mineral companies or claimants at price of either 250acre or 500acre depending on the type of claim in response to concerns about this patenting system since 1994 the congress has imposed annual moratoria on patenting via the annual department of interior appropriation bills 11 mineral is chemical element or compound that occurs naturally in the earths crust deposits of minerals that are mined are called ores 12 ely northcutt mineral titles and conce ssions the american institute of mining metallurgical and petroleum engineers inc economics of the mineral industries edward r robie editor the maple press 1964 pp 81130 13 there were also various homestead acts and land grants such as for railroads and other acts which further encouraged westward migr ation and economic development of the westof 1872 which encompasses many other i ssues such as whether public domain lands should be patented which are not addressed in this report10 history of the general mining law of 1872 the general mining law of 1872 17 stat 91 can be traced to 16th century english and spanish property and mineral rights laws and customs which as practiced in colonial america formed the basis for the granting of the rights to lands including those containing minerals including share of the minerals royalty11 one of the earliest statutes was the royal code of 1783 this spanish law became the basis for acquiring mineral rights in spanish colonies in the americas and was used to settle claims disputes also the land charters issued by england to the original thirteen colonies provided genera lly that 15th of the minerals on chartered lands were reserved for the crown12 independence for the american colonies meant that issues of land and mineral owners hip between the national government the states localities and even private individuals had to be decided several ordinances were enacted the ordinance of 1785 the land act of 1796 and the preemption act of 1841 but these did not addre ss the question of mineral royalties specifically the california gold rush of 1849 and the silver strike in nevada of 1860 caused significant westward population mig ration for the purposes of prospecting and claiming public domain lands during th is premining law period the issue of land ownership and easy and free access to fe deral lands was very controversial and fiercely debated the congress had approved severa l temporary leasing or land sales acts for gold silver lead and iron which were administered by the war department but prospectors disregarde d them trespassed ont federal lands laid their claims anyway and paid royalty to the federal government also after the civil war congressional policy became more openly geared to encouraging westward migration and the econo mic development of the west13

quartz placer deposit is an alluvial deposit of valuable mineral 17 also for some minerals the federal governme nt earlier sold the lands outright instead of leasing them and the question of royalties did not arise 18 in 1994 in response to concern about the giveaway of federal lands the congress began to impose annual moratoria via the department of interior appropriation bills on the patenting of public mineral lands 19 leshy john d testimony at the hearing on hr 2262 the hardrock mining and reclamation act of 2007 subcommittee on energy and mineral resources house committee on natural resources july 26 2007 20 for example under the coal lands act of 1873 separate claimpatent system was continuedthese practices and policies became embodi ed in two statutes that became the precursors to the general mining law of 1872 the lode law of 186614 which provided free and open access to federal lands with lode deposits for prospecting claiming and patenting and the placer act of 187015 which applied the same provisions to placer deposits16 conveyance and patenting of federal hardrock mineral lands the general mining law of 1872 approve d by president ulysses s grant on may 10 1872 was the consolidation of am ended versions of both the 1866 lode law and the 1870 placer act under this law as amended public lands with hardrock minerals metals such as gold silver copper lea d etc and nonmetals such as uranium barite and fluorspar are conveyed rather than leased for rent and royalty to the federal government as ndowner more specifically the law permits citizens and businesses to prospect for hardrock minerals on those public lands not withdrawn from mining and to file claim which gives them the right to explore develop mine and sell hardrock minerals from the claim such as gold silver platinum copper lead tin et c without paying royalty17 further up until 1994 claim holder could obtain title called patent to the land and mineral rights upon demonstrating the discove ry of economically recove rable minerals patenting basically means that the title to the land and mineral rights are c onveyed to the claimant the mineral lands become private property18 the claim holder may also claim and patent nonmineral noncontiguous lands to mill nd process the ores as noted the general mining law was enacted to promote westward migration and the economic development of the west and th land and mining rushes that followed further accelerated the great west ward settlement and expansion19 royalties on leasable minerals originally the mining law applied to all minerals but over time all but the hardrock or locatable minerals were removed from the laws purview20 beginninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs6 20 continued created for federal coal lands the law allowed the purchase of public coal land for ten to twenty dollars per acre depending upon its distance from railroad and established guidelines for staking claims for coal mines on federal lands see us department of the interior federal market value policy for federal coal leasing report of the linowes commission february 1984 21 coal royalties were not an issue prior to 1920 because with the exception of coalbearing lands in alaska federal coalbearing lands were sold rather than leased the alaska coal leasing act provided for minimum royalty of 2ton beginning in 1914 22 for discussion of the history and economic s of coal leasing policy see crs report 83 169 history and economic analysis of federal coal leasing policy by duane thompson and dennis zimmerman 23 according to 1974 coal leasing study by the council on economic priorities the doi had begun to apply advalorem royalties somewhat before 1976 see council on economic priorities leased and lost study of public and indian coal leasing in the west new york new york 1974 p 27 24 the 125 royalty has been standard practice in the oil and gas business 25 there are exceptions to this general rule for lands that are not subject to the mining act continuedin 1920 for example the mineral leasin g act of 1920 introduced leasing system for coal oil and gas and certain other minerals21 each lease was negotiated on casebycase basis and provided for both an annual rental per acre and fixed royalty of so many cents per ton22 where there is competition the minerals are alienated through bonus bidding process beginning in 1955 the mineral materials act of 1947 instituted leasing system for the non hardrock and nonenergy minerals the common and less valuable minerals such as sand and gravel for coal this system of leasing tinued until the early 1970s when the arab oil embargo and shortages of petroleum reserves focuse d attention on the vast coal deposits in the western states thus in 1976 the federal coal leasing amendments act pl 94377 was enacted which among other changes repl aced the fixed royalty with an advalorem royalty of 125 for surface mines and 8 for underground mines23 this kind of royalty payment system is now also used by the federal government in leasing oil and gas properties which typi cally are assessed ad valorem royalties ranging from between 125 and 166724 as will be discussed below under an advalorem royalty the mo st prevalent type of royalty system the royalty payments are based on the value of the mineral state governments also typically charge advalorem royalties for the extraction of locatable minerals although some tend to use the fixed roya lties finally hardrock mining on acquired federal lands as opposed to public domain lands is require d to pay royalty of 5 the royalty rates currently in effect on va rious types of minerals both leasable and locatable from federal lands are shown in table 1 thus despite the evolution of the system for paying royalties on coal oil and gas and certain other minerals the locati on system for the hardrock minerals industry involving royalty payments or an other type of rental payment has remained essentially unchanged since 187225 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs7 25 continued of 1872 such as acquired lands in these ca ses which are not frequent miners pay ad valorem rates typically ranging from 4 to 6the economics of federal royalties on public domain lands what is royalty part of the problem in deciding whethe r to assess royalty on hardrock minerals from federal lands and how to structure ch royalty is confusion over just what royalty is and what it is not economics is very clear on this royalty is factor payment part of the rent paid or the retu rn to land as both marketable capital asset and input to production it is payment ma by the renter of the land to the landowner whether private or public in voluntary exchange for the flow of services provided by that land over time as factor payment the royalty is analogous to the wage rate which is pa yment for the services of labor or the interest rate which is payment for the services of capital table 1 royalty rates

labor or interest for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs8 26 crs report rs22567 royalty relief for us deepwater oil and gas leases by marc humphries 27 there are examples of profit sharing instead of revenue sharing such as in the movie continuedservice of capital they generally must pa landowners for the services of land that contains mineral deposit the exception to this rule of course has been the case of locatable minerals on public or federal lands in the united states on which royalties are not paid in the case of mineral lands rents could be paid in various forms such as bonus bid annual rentals or royalty or in various combinations of these depending on the type of mineral and whether there is lease or not and the contractual agreement between developer of the re sources and the landowner for example under the outer continental shelf lands act of 1953 as amended the federal government leases lands for oil and gas velopment in return for bonus bid annual rents and royalties26 lease sales are conducted through compe titive bidding process and leases are awarded to the highest bidder who makes an upfront cash payment called bonus bid in order to secu re the lease annual rents range from 5 to 950 per acre with lease sizes ranging form 2500 to nearly 6000 acres and royalty rates are as noted above either 125 or 1667 these mineral rents are an attempt to cap ture the returns to the land above and beyond the returns paid to labor wages cap ital interest entrepreneurship profits and other factors and above any taxes that have to be paid to government with perfect knowledge and risks for exampl the rents resulting from mineral lands could be captured by the landowner as up front payments as the price of the mineral rights for example however min eral production like all business is risky it is difficult to know in advance of pr oduction precisely the quantity and quality of the mineral there are long lead times be tween exploration discovery and actual production and it is difficult to project wh at mineral prices will be upon production and sale these and other certainties make it risky for both the hardrock mineral producer and landowner to pr edict up front what rents would be earned by mineral lands and therefore what the mineral produ cer should pay the landowner in general the precise division between royalties or bonus bids and nnual rentals depends primarily upon how production risk is shared between landowner and mineral producer the royalty becomes way of allo wing for mineral land rents to be paid for the landowner to earn return on the land in way that simultaneously minimizes the risk of either overpayment or underpayment as land rental then an advalorem royalty protects the mineral producer against excessive royalty payments overestimation of re nts and the government ag ainst underestimation of economic rents being factor payment then royalty is not tax which is compulsory levy on individuals and businesses to finance the cost of government for the common welfare and not return to factor of production in exchange for specific services provided this is an important point one th at might be used for example to argue against proposals to impose royalty base d on net profits whic h would make the royalty more of an income tax rather than factor payment27 the distinction betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs9 27 continued business but these reflect the reality that th return to labor wages could be paid in different forms 28 in theory the demand schedule for factors of production by producer of an exhaustible resource such as hardrock minerals is based on an amount somewhat less than the value of the marginal product difference that reflects the sacrifice of future profit due to present production this causes the extractive firm to produce at an output level consistent with minimum average cost rather than the point where price equals marginal costs some economists believe the stock or reserves of hardrock minerals is so large relative to production or supply that the present value of sacrificed future profit due to present continueda tax and the rental payment also distingu ishes between the fede ral government as sovereign entity with the power to tax and as landowner or proprietor with the right to earn return on that land for the public economic implications of royaltyfree use of federal land forgoing royalty and other payments through the location system in effect means that the services of factor of production are provided free of charge in this case the services of federal land are provided free to the producer by virtue of the fact that royalty is ever collected from its use in economic terms this is comparable to the free provision of labor or capital quipment economic theory suggests that consequence of providing factor servi ces for free that would otherwise have economic value would be to di stort the allocation of resources this theory holds that if factor is provided to firm without charge too much of that factor would be hired and the output of the firm woul d exceed the socially desirable amount consequently not enough of mo re valuable good is provided from another perspective the federal government is the steward of the public lands which it holds as trustee of am erican public the development of public resources should only occur at fair market value return to the nation it is argued an implication of the location system on federal lands is that all economic surplus that may be earned by the industry in the l ong run is retained by the industry rather than allocated to society at large these profits are excess or surplus returns to resource owner above the leve l required to produce or suppl the resource ie above the normal rate of return in theory they accrue naturally to the owner of any natural resource but are not necessary to secure the continued supply of the resource only normal longrun return is necessary to ensu re such supply this is an important rationale for the payment of bonus bids and other rental payments the theory suggests that any pure economic surplus re turn from natural resource should accrue to society what would be the structure of an economically efficient and fair royalty in general the economic concept of royalty as factor payment implies that the payment should be based on the market value of the producers output whether it be hardrock minerals coal or oil and gas28 for hardrock minerals however as ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs10 28 continued production is very small so that the difference can be disregarded regardless of which solution actually applies it is the market pr ice of the mineral product that governs the demand for land and other factors of producti on see sweeney james l the economics of depletable resources review of economic studies vol44 1 36 february 1977 pp 125141 29 as is discussed below it is not always easy to define what is at the mine nor to determine when value is first defined and created in the case of hardrock mineralsfactor payment the type of royalty that most closely is intended to capture the rents from mineral lands whose future productivity cannot be precisely determined due to risk variability in output price unknown quantity and quality of mineral etc is the advalorem royalty based on the va lue or price of the mining firms output under such royalty payments are made in installments over the life of the mine rather than partially up front and the ec onomic rent is based on the amount of the mineral produced and the market value or price of the mineral at the mine29 lands producing minerals of higher quality and value gold for instance pay higher royalty amount those producing lower quality or value minerals lead for example pay lower amount it would be inconsistent with the concep t of sharing and with the concept of factor payment in competitive market for royalty to be based on other than market value minus the costs of obtaining it for example if instead of payments in kind deer or crops or precious metals the ndowner were to be paid in money one would expect him to receive the monetary equivalent of the value of the output rational landowners would not settle for less than what the deer crop or metal is worth because they could always have the deer crop or metals taken to market and sold for at least market value if they wanted less rent then presumably that would have been negotiated as smaller share ins tead of 1 deer out of 5 it would perhaps be 1 out of 6 likewise it w ould not be rational for the re nter to pay to the landowner royalty based on more than market value alternative bases fo r royalty payments although the advalorem royalty appears to be economically the most efficient type of royalty the question becomes to wh at base specifically should the royalty rate apply the aggregate value of commodity being the product of price valueunit and total output the questions are at what point can the value of mines output first be determined further since thr oughout the production stage value is added or increased at what stage does mining value end and nonmining value begin production of valuable min eral products from raw hardrock minerals eg metals such as iron copper aluminum gol d lead generally involves various stages extraction or quarrying of the raw minerals g iron ore ba uxite galena and non metals such as barite ur anium diatomite fluorspar clay calcium carbonate etc that exist in the hard formations of the earth delivery to plant or mill in order to prepare for the initial processing beneficiating or concentrating to derive an ore concentrate generally the first valuable pr oduct smelting or refi ning ie additional processing of the ore concentrate in order to derive the marketable metal or mineralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs11 30 the mining portion of the total production in volves extraction and milling mines extract the raw mineral ore and mills which are usually near the mine and are considered part of the mining operation undertake the initial processing mainly beneficiating to produce concentrated ore 31 as discussed in more detail in the last section the percentage depletion allowance is deduction for part of the mining fi rms capital costs of doing businessand the actual marketing or selling of that metal or mineral30 these production stages are shown for the typical case or mineral in figure 1 within these production stages from extraction to the first sale to manufacturers there may be various points at which there is created valuable output depending on the type of mineral nd the structure of the industry there may be several different type s of mineral products with value and it is not always clear what is mining output and what is nonmining output does the mine produce the raw mineral ore the ore concentrate or the final metal or mineral sold to wholesalers further even if the output of the mine can be determined there is the problem of what is the value or price of that output for example copper is traded in many forms that relate to different stages of processing at the mine copper may be sold as ore concentrate or precipitate this question is further complicated when the firm or industry is vertically integrated in such cases there may not actually be sale throughout the miningproductionprocessingm arketing sale stage and any price or value would have to be constructed ie estimated or derived from values further upstream when they are first determined or identified percentage depletions gross income measure of mineral value under the tax laws one measure of the value of mining output is gross income from mining as defined under the income ta x laws for purposes of determining the percentage depletion allowan ce one of several tax prefer ences or subsidies available to mining firm31 this royalty base has been suggested many times in the current and past royalty deba tes and is the base proposed in hr 2262 the main reason for suggesting this royalty base is that not only is gross income under the tax depletion rules consistent with the economic concept of an advalorem royalty but the legal and regulatory apparatus has been in place since 1932 the year that percentage figure 1 the various production phases for the typical hardrock mineralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs12 32 the idea of using the current tax definition of gross income as the basis for the royalty on locatable minerals appears to have originat ed with dr sandra l blackstone mineral lawyer and economist see blackstone sandra l royalties for locatable minerals on federal lands proposed approach statement by dr sandra l blackstone before the mineral resources development and production subcommittee of the senate committee on energy and natural resources september 13 1990 depletion first became available to the hardrock mining industry32 this would tend to reduce the costs of industry complian ce and government administration of the royalty system before discussing this royalty base in mo re detail it should be explained that the term gross income as used for purposes of percentage depletion is somewhat confusing there are two reasons for this while the term is intended to measure only sales revenue from mining operations income in the context of business generally refers to profits and not sales second the term gro ss may be misleading because it may suggest larger percentage deple tion deduction and therefore larger royalty payment than net royalty but in fact whether gross royalty base is smaller or bigger than net royalty base depends on the point in the production stage the price is measured and the deductions allowe d because value is added as mining production moves from the extraction or quarry ing state to the smeltering stage the market price if one existed would in crease throughout these stages net price such as net smelter return further downs tream would generally be greater than gross price further upstream definition of gross income from mining under internal revenue code irc 613 mining companies are allowe d depletion deduction at varying percentages based on the gross income from mining under irc 613c1 and c2 the term gross income from mining means sales revenue from the extraction of the ores or minerals from the ground nd any treatment processes necessary or incidental to the mining process specific treatment processes and also generally the costs of transporting the ores or minerals from the point of extraction to the plant or mill in which the treatment processes are applied more specifically the term mining includes not merely the extraction of the ores or minerals from the ground but also the treatment processes considered as mining described in paragraph 4 and the treatment processes necessary or incidental thereto and so much of the transportation of ores or mineral s whether or not common carrier from the point of extraction from the ground to the plant or mills in which such treatment processes are applied thereto as is not in excess of 50 miles unless the secretary of the treasury finds that the physical and other requirements are such that the ore or mineral must be transported greater distance to such plants or mills subparagraph 4 of irc 613c define s for the different categories of minerals the treatment processes that wh applied by the mine owner or operator are considered as mining meaning that the costs of such processes are included in the value or price for purposes of percentage depletionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs13 33 some metals are produced from recycled metalsin the case of iron ore

not including electrolytic deposition roasting thermal or electric smelting or refining or by substantially equivalent processes or combina tion of processes used in the separation or extraction of

secretary finds that the physical and other requirements are such that the ore or mineral must be transported greater distance to such plants or mills irc 613c2 also under subparagraph 5 of irc 613c the following treatment processes are not considered to be mining proce sses and are thus not included in gross income electrolytic deposition roasting calcining thermal or electric smelting refining polishing fine pulverization blending with other materials treatment effecting ch emical change thermal action and molding or shaping it seems fairly clear from these statutory provisions that gross income from mining is the mining companys revenue from the sale of the first marketable mineral product created as result of mining nd before any nonmining processes eg manufacturing processes such as refining or smeltering are pplied generally for most hardrock minerals extraction produces raw mineral ore which of itself has little value and is generally not marketed for most minerals after the ore is mined it is sent to mill or plant to be crus hed and ground and in some cases lead for example is beneficiated to the point that it is saleable as metal concentrate eg aluminum oxide from bauxite or coppe r concentrate from copper ore etc33 at this stage there is demand for the mineral ore concentrate as an input into the smeltingrefining process for final sale in the wholesale commodities or manufacturing markets eg gold into jewe lry copper for automobiles and pipinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs14 34 this is the average price in october 2007 on the commodities exchange see table 3 on p 29 35 copper ores may also contain gold silver and other valuable minerals which would affect the value of the ore concentrate per tonne or per lbconsider gold for example gold refiners are generally the primary market for miners raw gold is usually delivered to the refiner where it is purchased from the miner processed and refined at the point of sale to the refiner funds received are considered gross income to the miner after the milling or mining processing stage the ore concentrate has value due to the value of the mineral to be derived therefrom c opper from copper ore concentrate aluminum from aluminum oxide etc in general such ore concentrates are either sold to broker or to smelter refiner or they are tolled which means the ore is not sold but is rather sent for refiningsmelting and other processing only the mining company still owns the ore if the miners output is sold in an arms length transaction this would generally occur for certain iron ores sold by independent ie small mining companies then there is sale of the mineral and that is the actual price used to determin gross income thus under irs regulations gross income for depletion purposes is defi ned as the actual price for which the ore or mineral is sold where the taxpayer sells the ore or mineral as it emerges from the mine before application of any processe s other than mining process or any transportation or after application of only mining processes including mining transportation the price of the ore c oncentrate would depend on the wholesale price of the final metal including related metals on commodities markets and the percentage of the metal in the ore if the mining firm is an integrated producer ie it has smeltingrefining operations and also applies nonmining processes to the or concentrate before the mineral is sold there may be sale of either the raw ore or ore concentrate and hence price for the mineral firms output until the final metal gold for example is sold in the commodities markets or for use in manufacturing in these cases percentage depletion is based not on actual gross income but what is called constructive gross income ie income derived from or appr oximated by using representative market prices elsewhere in that particular market finally in cases where there is representative price from sales of the same ore concentrate the mining output in other markets then gross income from mining is estimated by multiplying gross sales by the ratio of mining to total costs or one of various other methods to estimate the price of the mining output as hypothetical example assume that the market pr ice of the final cast copper on the commodities exchanges is 360l b which is 7937metr ic tonne of pure copper34 also assume that one metric ton of copper ore concentrate contains 30 pure copper and other valuab minerals the remainin g 70 is sulfur iron and other impurities that have value35 and finally to simplify further assume that mining costs represent 75 of the total costs of producing the final pure copper then under the constructive gross income method gross income per tonne from mining operations the average sales re venue per unit from the sale of copper concentrate would be calculated as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs15 36 as with the term gross income net smelte r return is somewhat misleading because it does not really refer to return as in rate of re turn in normal business parlance rate of return refers generally to profits ie gross revenue less all costs including capital cost while net smelter return refers to net price ie gross mineral price less certain operating and processing costs but not all costs note how ever that while there is generally accepted standard definition of net smelter return in fact the precise definition and the deductions what gets subtracted from the gross smelter sales price is particular to each royalty lease contract 37 cartwright michael r mineral production

used in many private and most state royalty contracts is netsmelter return36 net smelter return is common term used in the mining industry to refer essentially to the net averag revenue per unit of the sm elted mineral product sold by the miner it is essentially an estimate of the price the miner receives or equivalently the price paid by the smelter for the or concentrate produced based on the price for the pure metal or mineral received by the refinery or smelter when it is sold in the commodities market this estimate is base d on the gross price received by the smelterrefiner for the marketable meta l eg the price on the london exchange or the chicago commodities exchange less the costs of smeltingrefining and other costs typically treatment ch arges penalties for impurities and transportation charges from the mill to the smelter according to cartright 2007 the net smelter return is the amount of money which the smelter or refinery pays the mining operator for the mineral product and is usually based on spot or current price of the mineral with deductions for the costs associated with further processing in nonmetal mines the selling price is usually fob mine site because of the transportation costs invo lved in delivering the mineral product to the buyer37 in canadian law net smelter return is defined in the same way according to barten 1993 net smelter return is the amount received by the mine or mill owner from the sale of the mineral product to the treatment plant that conver ts the output of the mill to marketable metal from the gross proceeds received

where net value is gross value less certain permitted expenses gross value will usually be defined with reference to the spot price of an average weekly or monthly spot price on specified markets for the commodity the permitted deductions will include all charges by the smelter such as smelting and refining charge as well as penalties for impurities in the ore and the cost of transportation to the smelter and insurance in some cases deductions may also be made for taxes except income taxes and depending on the nature of the commodity for marketing costs if the operator ships to its smelter charges should not exceed those that would be charged by an arms length smelter in similar circumstances39 the similarity of these definitions of net smelter return gross price less non mining costs times output to the gross inco base under the pe rcentage depletion rules is readily apparent each of the above definitions is very specific that smelter and refining charges are to be deducted just as in the ta x definition of gross income the following two examples from contracts or royalty deeds between landowner the vendor and the mining company the purchaser illustrate the legal language used in defini ng net smelter return as additional consideration for the vendor entering into this agreement the purchaser acknowledges that the claims shall be subject to royalty or charge in the amount of two percent 2 of ne t smelter returns payable to the vendor for the purpose of this clause net smelter returns shall mean the actual proceeds received by the purchaser from smelter or other

transportati on costs from the claims to the smelter or other place of sale or treatment but without any other deduction whatsoever40 for the purposes of this agreement and the payment of the net

metals including bullion or products from the claims to any mint smelter refinery or other purchaser and c related insurance on such concentrates metals including bullion or products from the claims41 thus continuing with the above hypothe tical copper example the net smelter return would be the price at which cast copper could be sold after the costs of smelting and refining the copper ore are s ubtracted so as to deduct any nonmining value using the same figures as before the market price of the final cast copper is 360lb and thus one metric tonne 2205 lbs of pure copper would be valued at 7938 however one ton of copper ore centrate contains only 30 pure copper so that the value of one tonne of that ore concentrate is 30 of that or 238142 to calculate smeltering and refining costs ssume that these are 10 or 036lb of the price of the cast copper then costs w ould be 238tonne of copper concentrate equal to 036 x 030 x 2205 the ne t smelter return would be 2143 2381 036 x 030 x 2205 multiplied by the tonnage of ore concentrate shipped to the smelterrefiner it would equal the actual or constructive sales revenue to the mining company of the ore concentrate if annual sa were 100000 metric tonnes of copper concentrate total net smelter return revenues would be 214 million at 8 the royalty on this would be 17 million note that in this example net smelter return is greater than gross income for depletion purposes and would thus yield greater royalty this is because final metal prices are high relative to smeltingrefining costs in general the higher are metals prices relative to costs in which case mineral producers earn extra or windfall profits the more net smelter returns diverge from gross income net profit royalty another royalty base that has been mentioned in the general mining law debate is net prof it here the royalty would be certain percentage of the miners net aftertax profit or income which is essentially gross revenue less all costs operating capital and tax costs for any mining company indeed for any business net profit is of c ourse less than sales revenue by the costs of doing business thus resulting in smaller royalty base from which to calculate royalty payments reducing royalty payments to the federal government might be major reason that it is supported by much of the hardrock mining industry and its supporters not only are net pr ofits notoriously variable difficult to measure and susceptible to accounting manipulations but this method could create incentives for mining companies to claim significant deductions from their income such that there would rarely be profit against which to levy the royalty thus depending upon the royalty rate this could lead not only to smaller royalty payments than either gross income or net smelter return royalty but perhaps to royalty at all some advocateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs18 43 prior to this law royalties on coal were not an issue since the federal government sold rather than leased federal coalbearing lands this policy was codified by an 1864 statute and continued as an exception to the locatable minerals policy of the general mining law of 1872 see leshy john

the rate result in even lower royalties further net profit royalty at the minemouth creates complications in allocating costs between extraction and other mining processing another effect of netpr ofit type of royalty on hard rock minerals would be to expose the federal government to the risks of an investor much like investors in stock are as owners subject to risks rather than the rewards of the much less risky status of landowner such an arrangemen t would not serve to impose the market determined factor costs royalties on the mining operations in other words if net profit were to mean net beforetax profits then the royalty would essentially operate like an income tax this would not be consistent with mainstream economic theory that royalty is not tax but factor payment the fixed royalty yet another royalty base one which is used less frequently is the royalty based on consta nt rate per unit say 5ton of mineral output ie the ore concentrate this wa s the type of royalty instituted under the mineral leasing act of 1920 the law which fi rst introduced federal leasing system including royalty for coal43 as factor payment this type of royalty makes little economic sense being equiva lent to charging fixed interest payments on capital regardless of the value of the capital loan ed being assessed on only one variable output rather than price and output it does however avoid the usual complexities associated with determining value price costs or even profits44 comparison with oil gas coal and geothermal royalties for oil gas and coal federal royalties are calculated on the gross pro ceeds or gross sales revenues from the contract sa for oil and gas this generally occurs close to the wellhead and so the contract price is used to determine gross proceeds typically for example oil and gas is sold at posted price to pipeline company and that is the price on which the royalty is based in situations where oil is not sold in an arms length transaction or is sold without contract royalties are based on various types of benchmarks such as comparable sale s or even local spotmarket oil prices adjusted for any quality differences and transportation costs in situations where the oil or gas is transported before it is sold then transportation charges are generally deducted to determine gross proceeds for royalty purposes45

international lease transactions mineral royalties are predominantly of the advalorem type with rates ranging typically from 212 depending on the country and the mineral type52 external benefits there may be conditions under which the government might not want to use the royalty rate established by the market if there are sufficient positive economic and social effects from th use of public lands for mining there might be an economic rationale for charging the mineral producer lower than market rate53 such externality arguments the stimulation of an infant industry and the development of mineral resources and the settling of the american west were apparently principal rati onale for the location system involving royalties and other rent payments established in 1872 but these arguments may not be valid in todays economy the hardrock minerals indus try is not an infant industry and there is longer need for settling the american west arguments are made that the economic stimulus to the industry resulting from royaltyfree treatment produces benefits it is argued that imposition of federal royalty on hardrock mining would damage mo st of the american hardrock industry which it is argued suffers from fierce h eavily subsidized foreign competition some argue that there is national security asp ect to subsidizing certain hardrock minerals although there is presumption that roya ltyfree treatment is the appropriate way to address these concerns it is also point ed out that damage to the industry would harm those western communities that are economically dependent upon it these arguments are contested on various grounds subsidies for hardrock mining clearly produce economic benefits to the industry receiving the subsidy and to the communities dependent upon that industr but these benefits are not external benefits that the markets are not capable of taking into account they are not market failures which may justify either tax in the case of external costs or

economic systems and all c ountries alike the use of re sources in one sector means the loss of the resource in another sector the subsidy to hardrock mining is not costless the loss of economic efficiency implies that the private benefits to the hardrock mining industry are smaller than the private costs to other sectors this suggests that removal of the subsidies would produce net welfare gain to citizens of the united states as to the national security argument there are minerals that are often referred to as strategic minerals cobalt columbium chromium manganese platinum and others54 excessive dependence upon foreig n producers of these and other economically vital minerals might pose an economic disruption or national security threat to the united states although the na ture of the relationship between imports domestic production and national security is not s imple one these arguments are similar to those made about the us pendence upon imported il and often used to justify subsidies for the domestic oil i ndustry some argue that the threat of domestic supply disruption might be better met with stockpiling of that mineral55 it seems clear also that not all hardrock minerals are of us national security concern in any event if financial subs idy for certain strategic hardrock minerals industries was appropria tax subsidy would probably be more efficient than total forgiveness of royalty payments the curre nt tax subsidies for the hardrock mineral industry are discussed in the section feder tax treatment of the hardrock mining industry below external costs there is another side to the externality concept external costs it appears that some external effects associated with hardrock mineral production economic effect s not taken into account in the normal business decisionmaking are net external costs rather than net external benefits the external costs from hardrock mineral production are the degradation of the environment and the damage to the utility of the land for other potential uses without land reclamation there would pres umably be damage to the environment which is an external cost to society this is cost that the typical profitmaximizing hardrock mineral producer does not usua lly account for in the normal business decisionmaking process consequently since the accountable business costs are lower than the real costs

use of the land this is the economic rationale for the abandoned mineland reclama tion fee under smcra the rface mining control and reclamation act56 absence of competition two other conditions might mitigate against the use of the marketdetermined royalty rate first if the market for the leasing of mineral lands between landow ners and mining companies is not competitive and second if the mining industry itself is not co mpetitive in the first case if private landowners exercise monopoly power or some other type of market power then it would be possible to extract from the mining companies higher than competitive royalty rates monopoly rates in the second case if the mining industry is concentrated and exercises market power control over prices for example it might lead to underpayment of royalties the marketdetermined royalty rates might actually be too low these are complex issues which are diffi cult to analyze much of the land from which hardrock minerals are produced is owned by the federal government which might be in position to take advantage of its power to obtain royalty payments above the competitively deter mined rates such payments combined with the bonus bids would appropriate for society the economic rents the abnormal or excess profits ie windfalls fro m the production of scarce natu ral resources in reality of course the federal government policy is just the reverse it charges royalty rate of zero which is definitely below the marketdetermined rate on the other hand much land is also privately owned or owne d by state or local governments or indian tribes which suggests that the marketdetermined royalty rates might be reliable indicator of competitive rates as to the hardrock mineral industry stru cture available data suggest that the industry both in the united states and throughout the world is somewhat concentrated hardrock mining is highly capital intensive business and large enterprises can operate more efficiently in the united states many of the mining firms are large multinational mining conglomerates five of the top ten claim holders who hold more than 16 of all cl aims on western public lands are foreign corporations internationally the hardrock mining industry is dominated by about 40 companies and the top four account fo r 35 of total market capitalization57 this would suggest that the marketdetermined royalty rate might actually be too low on balance however it might be the case th at the above two opposing forces tend to offset each other and the government would want to use the more appropriate competitive rate which would be more c onsistent with economic efficiency and social welfare than zero rate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs23 should royalties rates differ by mineral type economic theory is also unclear whethe r the same royalty rate should apply to all hardrock minerals or whether the rate should vary by type of mineral in some logical way according to some acceptabl rational criteria on the one hand variable rate is unnecessary because the ba is advalorem so the royalty amounts in absolute dollars automatically vary in proportion to mineral value more valuable minerals pay greater absolute royalties per unit table 2 gives an illustration for metals note that the royalty in column 4 is based on the gross value of the metal in the commodities markets and does not allow deductions for smeltering costs and other costs in other words the figures do not represent either net smelter returns or gross income from mining both of wh ich would be less by the amount of such costs constant royalty rate also nds to minimize both economic distortions intraindustry resource allocations among min eral types as well as administrative costs on the other hand private royalty agreements which are negotiated on case bycase basis have widely varying royalty rates these can range from 110 and differ by mineral types under one possible structure that has b een suggested the royalty rate itself would be function of it would vary positively with the minerals price column 6 of table 2 shows one hypothetical schedul of such rates beginning at 8 for platinum the most valuable metal and declining in steps of 1 percentage point to 1 for aluminum with such schedule the absolute amount of royalty payments declines even more rapidly as the value of mineral declines another possibility would be to vary the royalty rates in direct proportion to the percentage depletion rates applicable to gross income from mining as shown in table 3 such royalty rate structure would pr oduce different pattern of absolute royalty payments than either constant royalty ra or royalty rate in direct proportion to the minerals value for example lead nd zinc which qualify for 22 depletion rate would have higher ro yalty burden than gold or silver which are significantly more valuable than either lead or zinc but which qualify for 15 depletion rate effects on the mining industry introducing royalty payment system for locatable minerals could have an adverse economic and financial effect on the producers of these minerals particularly on marginal producers both average and marginal costs would increase and profits and employment in the hardrock mineral industry would decrease hardrock mineral production would be lower as marginal min closed this would also adversely affect those parts of the united states th at rely on these industries the payment of royalties combined with higher fees could also alter the competitive balance among mineral producers both domestically and internationally the competitive disadvantage that royaltypaying mineral pr oducers currently have would be lessened the hardrock mineral industry generally would be less compe titive in relation to other domestic mineral producers and with international mineral producers hardrock mineral prices would probably not increase very much because for most minerals

of imposing royalty these negative industry and regional eff ects would be natu ral and unavoidable part of the transition from policy of res ource subsidization to policy of resource neutrality as the above discussion suggest s however the policy of introducing royalty payment system for locatable minerals would be expected to have positive economic effects in other sectors the nonmining i ndustry nd in the remaining parts of the country less land would be mined and fewer us hardrock minerals would be produced and more imported than under noroyalty system but more of other highervalued commodities would be produced this would likely contribute to more economically efficient use of the nations resources which would tend to promote the welfare of society great er good for greater number of people thus the current policy of free access ie royalty forgiveness involves tradeoff policymakers choose the benefits to the hardrock mineral industry above the benefits that would accrue to anot her domestic economic sector policy of royalty or other rental payments would be more neutral it would let the markets be the arbiter of the relative size of the vari ous economic sectors and even if the health and competitiveness of the domestic hardro ck mineral industry is of sufficient concern to warrant federal subsidies there may be more economically efficient ways of providing these subsidies than the total forgiveness of factor payment revenue effects the payment of royalty to the federal government for the services from the mineral land would increase fe deral revenues lthough revenue generation is not the primary rationale for the imposition of royalty the congressional budget office has estimated the budgetary effects re venue and spending of hr 2262 the estimates are replicated in table 3 which shows both revenue effects of the 8 and 4 royalty and from the proposed higher fees61 as noted hr 2262 would establish beginning after its enactment 4 royalty on existing claims and an 8 royalty on new claims the 4 royalty on existing claims would gene rate revenues early althoug h royalties would be paid in 2008 due to provision in hr 2262 that would defer royalties during the first 12 months after enactment most of th revenues estimated under hr 2262 would come from existing claims the 8 royalty on new claims is unlikely to generate significant revenues during the forecast period 20082017 because after claim is staked it typically takes at least 10 year s for hardrock mine to begin production hr 2262 would also reauthorize and rais both the claims location fee and the annual maintenance or holding fee from 30 to 50 per claim and from 125 to 150 per claim respectively the projected revenue effects from the proposed higher fees are shown in table 3 the revenue estimates are net of federal income taxes there would be some decline in income tax revenues due to the deductibility of royalty payments and fees against business taxes also note that unde r

hardrock minerals industry is subject to the same income tax laws which apply to all other forp rofit businesses paying fe deral income payroll and other federal taxes the federal corporate income tax applies 35 rate to most corporate taxable income defi ned generally as gross reve nue sales minus interest wages the cost of purchased inputs and an allowance for depreciation reduced tax rates either 15 25 or 34 apply to smaller cor porations those earning less than 10 million of income62 in addition corporate st ockholders pay individual income taxes on their corporate source capital gains and dividends as business entities hardrock mining companies benefit from many different types of untargeted tax incentives provisi ons that are generally available to non mining businesses as well as some tax provisions specifically targeted toward mining two untargeted or ge neral tax benefits are th 199 manufacturing deduction and accelerated depreciation under i rc 199 manufacturing businesses are allowed deduction as business expense fo r specified percentage of the qualified production activitys income subject to limit of 50 of the wages paid that are allocable to the domestic production durin g the taxable year the deduction was 3 of income for 2006 is currently 6 and is scheduled to increase to 9 when fully phased in by 201063 for the domestic mining industry which includes the oil and gas industry the deduction applies to an primary product manufactured produced or extracted in whole or in significant part in the united states note that extraction is considered to be manufacturing for pur poses of this deduction which means thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs27 64 this deduction was enacted under the amer ican jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108 357 also known as the jobs bill it was originally substitute for repeal of the export tax benefits under the extraterritorial income tax exclusion which was ruled to be in violation of trade laws see crs report rl32652 the 2004 corporate tax and fsceti bill the american jobs creation act of 2004 by david l brumbaugh 65 corporations are currently taxed at 15 of the first 50000 of taxable income 25 of the taxable income from 50001 to 75000 34 of the taxable income from 75001 to 10 million and 35 of taxable income above 10 milliondomestic firms in the business of extr acting hardrock minerals from underground reservoirs or deposits qualify for the deduction64 effectively the deduction is equivalent to reduced marginal tax rate for example at the top marginal corporate tax rate of 35 which typically applies to large corporations such as hardrock mining companies the current deduction of 6 is equivalent to marginal corporate income tax rate of 329 35 x 094 rather than 3565 another untargeted or gene ral tax provision that is important to the hardrock mineral companies is accelerated depreciation the rules that determine how much business may deduct for the depreciation of its capital equipment and structures this deduction is intended to provide business reasonable allowance for the exhaustion and wear and tear ie deprecia tion of business property it is analogous to the cost depletion allowance for investment in mineral deposit as discussed below the present depreci ation treatment is known as the modified accelerated cost recovery system i rc 168 gene rally under this system assets are depreciated for regular tax purposes over specified recovery period and by applying one of the accelerated depreci ation methods prescribed for each class of property including the 200 declining balance thod the double declining balance method or the 150 declining balance method or formula the annual depreciation deduc tions are determined by applying this formula to the assigned recovery period the applicab recovery periods are prescribed for each property class mining equipment assets used in the mining quarrying milling and beneficiating of metallic and nonmetallic minerals are assigned sevenyear recovery period this system also allows producers to use depreciation method as opposed to the recovery period that max imizes the value of the deduction over time this is more advantageous than the theoretical treatment which would call for depreciation schedule based on the actual ec onomic depreciation longer recovery period and less accelerated formula which increases the tax value of the deduction or equivalently reduces the effective marginal tax rate on the income generated by the equipment given that hardrock miner producers are highly capital intensive and that the equipment used stripping shovels drills bulldozers drag lines and haulers can cost tens of millions of do llars the accelerated depreciation provision can be relatively important three special tax pref erences or subsidies in addition at the federal level ther are three special or targeted tax preferences available to the mining industr generally that are also available to hardrock mining firms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs28 expensing of mine explorat ion and development costs one important special tax break available to th hardrock mineral industry is expensing of exploration and developmen t expenditures ie the deduction in the year incurred of costs that are essentially capital in nature irc 616 and 617 before mine reaches the producing stag mining companies incur geological and geophysical or surveying and reconnai ssance investigation costs costs for ascertaining the existence and location of mine and costs for determining the quantity and quality of the deposit these include the costs of staking the claim removal of property line obstructions limited removal of overburden the removal of large amounts of overburden would indi cate that deposit may have already been found and the mine may be in different stage and limited sluicing exploration expenditures include the costs of surveying test pitting trenching drilling driving of exploration tunnels and ad its and similar types of wor k the costs of exploratory drilling to ascertain the extent of commercially marketable ores are treated by the tax law as mineral exploration cost expenditures for exploratory drilling from within producing mine to ascertain the existence of what appears on the basis of all the facts and circumstances known at the time of the expenditure to be different ore deposit are also considered exploration expenditures these types of costs are all deductible rather than capitalized expenditures made after the existence of ores or minerals in commercially marketable quantities has been disclosed are considered mine development expenditures and these also qualify for expensing treatment these are costs associated with bringing the mine to production for example the costs of constructing or sinking mine shaft or the costs of driving tunnels and galleries are development costs which may be expensed activities associated with development are building roads clearing the land and other activ ities to prepare site for the production stage there are several limitations to expensing of mine exploration and development costs first expensing applies only to domestic mines explora tion and development cost of foreign properties mu st be either depleted or amortized over 10year period using straightline amortization sec ond corporate mining companies may only expense 70 of the exploration and velopment the remaining 30 must be amortized over five years ie deduc ted evenly over 60 months irc 291 b third both exploration and development cost s must be recaptured ie taken back once the mine is opened and production co mmences for exploration expenses or when the mine is sold for development expenses recapture is accomplished by either including the amount expensed as or dinary income or by subtracting it from the percentage depletion allowance this makes it especially important for mining companies to determine when explor ation ends and velopment begins the percentage depletion allowance once mine reaches the producing stage producer may deduct certain percentage of the gross income as specified by law as an allowance for depletion th percentage depletion allowance is tax deduction against the federal income tax available to mining firm for the costs of depleting mineral reserve which is part of the total producti on costs deductible to derive net taxable income the depletion allowance or deduction is intended to give the mineral producer deduction for the deple tion of the investment in the mine tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs29 66 if the statutory depletion rate is 22 and if this were to be reduced by 20 then the effective depletion rate would be 176 22 minus 22 times 02 because the statutory rate is reduced not by the full 20 but by 20 of the excess of percentage over cost depletion the effective rate is somewhat high er than 176 the specific effective depletion rate therefore depends upon the cost depletion amountaccount for the loss deprecia tion of capital to reflect the physical and economic depletion of the mineral reserve as the mineral is being extracted ie the wasting of the asset it is analogous to the allowance for depreciation of equipment and structures and other assets that is available to all businesses in theory the depletion allowance should be based on the actual inve stment cost of the mine and the annual deduction should be based on the actual output of the mine its actual rate of depletion this is called cost depletion unlike the annual deprecia tion deduction however whic h is calculated based on taxpayers actual investment cost of the property equipment and structures recovery period corresponding to that prope rty and an annual ra of deduction over that recovery period the percentage depl etion deduction for mine is calculated as percentage of gross income annual sa revenue irrespective of the actual investment in the mineral reserve the mine that is why percentage depletion is tax subsidy preference or tax expenditure any depletion deduction in excess of cost depletion is considered by economists to be tax subsidy or incentive because the present value of the total amount deducte d typically exceeds the initial investment in other words the total amounts that can be recovered through percentage depletion generally exceed the total investment cost of the property this is true even with the netincome limitation wh ich limits the deduction to 50 of the taxable income from the mine irc 613 using cost depleti on the total cost recovered cannot exceed the actual investment in the property table 4 shows percentage deple tion rates for most minerals including hardrock minerals as this table shows the allowance is available to virtually all mineral producers except integrated oil and gas producers although the highest rates available are for the hardrock minerals percentage depletion rates range from 5 for stone and clay to 22 for uranium and beryllium most of the hardrock minerals have depletion rate of 22 and several have ither 15 or 14 rate the percentage depletion allowance is also subject to several limitations first the amount of deduction is limited to 50 of the net income essentially the net profit from the property second for iron ore and coal mined by corporations as opposed to noncorporate firms the allowance must be reduced by 20 of the excess of percentage depletion over cost depletion irc 291 this limitation was introduced by the tax equity and fis cal responsibility act of 1982 pl 97248 in effect this limitation reduces the 22 depletion rate to an effective depletion rate of between 176 and 22 depending upon the amount of cost depletion66httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs30 table 4 percentage depletion rates for minerals 22 depletion rate any if from deposits in united states the following metal ores sulfur and uranium

drainage and roofing tile flower pots and kindred productsgravel peat pumice sand scoria shale and stone except oil shale and stone described elsewhere in this table bromine calcium chloride and magnesium chloride from brine wells source internal revenue code section 613b the interaction between the percentage depletion allowance and the royalty as noted above the imposition of royalty where none existed before would increase mining firms operating costs and reduce profitability further due to the deductibility of the royalty as an operating cost of doing businesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs31 67 these calculations ignore the effects of the 50 taxable income limit on the percentage depletion allowance against the federal income tax the deduction reduces tax liability and therefore lowers the tax costs the aftertax cost of the royalty is effectively reduced however there is an important interaction between royalty and the percentage depletion allowance that limits that effect ie that increases the aftertax cost of the royalty somewhat under irc 613 royalty payments and other rental payments are deductible from gross income to determine the percentage depletion allowance this means that if royalty were to be imposed on hardrock mining from federal lands it would have the effect of s imultaneously reducing the amount of the percentage depletion deduc tion thus while the imposition of royalty would increase deductible expenses and reduce the mining companys tax liability the reduced percentage depletion allowance w ould reduce tax deductions and would raise mining firms tax liability the net effect on tax liability of these two simultaneous considerations are shown in the following equation which shows the total increase after tax burden for every dollar of royalty paid 1 r 1t r t d 2 r r t r t d3 r rt 1 d where r the royalty rate t the marginal corporate or business tax rated the applicable percentage depletion allowance rate the first term in 1 shows how the burden of royalty is reduced by its tax deductibility and the second term shows how the burden of royalty is increased by its subtraction from gross income for exam ple an 8 royalty without the gross income offset is effectively 6 royalty at 25 marginal tax rate the same royalty however is effectively 644 royalty with gross income offset if the percentage depletion allowance is 22 similarly 4 royalty without the gross income offset is effectively 3 royalty at 25 marginal tax rate the same royalty however is effectively 315 royalty with gross inco offset if the percentage depletion allowance is 15 say for gold equations 2 and 3 are the same as equation 1 expre ssed as equation 3 the effective royalty is shown as gross royalty the r term and the offset term rt d 1 so in the previous example when the gr oss royalty is 4 the revenue offset is negative 085 004 x 025 1 015 085 this shows that under current tax laws and given the current percentage pletion rates the costs of gross income deductibility of the royalty could in certain cases offset the benefits from royalty tax deductibility which for these cases is effectively equivalent to not allowing tax deductibility 67 deduction for mine closing and reclamation costs the deficit reduction act of 1984 pl 98 369 included provision that gives preferential tax treatment to the mining industry in the area of mine closing and land reclamationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs32 68 us congress joint committee print estimates of federal tax expenditures for fiscal years 20072011 prepared for the house committee on ways and means and the senate committee on finance by the staff of the joint committee on taxation september 24 2007this provision irc 468 allows mining companies to deduct the costs of mine closing and land reclamation in advance of the actual closing and reclamations ie before the occurrence of the activity giving rise to the expenses this provision is contrary to the general tax rule under both the cash method of accounting and the accrual method of accounting which state that expenses to be incurred in the future cannot be deducted currently under the cash method of accounting expenses can only be deducted when the payment is act ually made under the accrual method of accounting future expenses may be deduc ted in advance of actual payment but not in advance of the economic activity that gi ves rise to the expenses they must be deducted in the year in which the economic activity takes place revenue losses from sp ecial tax preferences the joint tax committee estimates the re venue losses from the above three special tax preferences or subsidies forma lly called tax expenditures the latest fiveyear estimates from fy20072011 are as follows 05 billion for expensing of mine exploration and development cost s 11 billion for the excess of percentage over cost depletion and 02 billion for mine reclamation reserves deduction68 thus the total revenue loss from these three pr ovisions over five years is 18 billion an average of 360 millionyear this is the amount by which the industry lowered its tax burden or conversely the loss in tax revenues to the federal government the bulk of these preferences is claimed by corporations only small share is claimed by proprietorships and partnerships alternative minimum tax there is another provision of the current irc that attempts to limit the benefits from the special tax breaks available to the mining industry and other industries the alternative minimum tax this alternative minimum tax is an additional tax on items of tax preference which are list of ten tax breaks or subsidies that have been identified as potentially able to reduce businesss or individuals tax liability to little or nothing the intent is to assure that all taxpayers individuals and businesses pay some tax which is not assured if taxpayers are able to claim lot of special tax breaks in effect the alternative minimum tax imposes an additional tax above and beyond the normal or regular in come tax on the total amount of these ten items of tax preference this is important for the mining industry because two of the ten preference items are tax breaks that are impor tant to the mining industry the excess of percentage depletion ove r cost depletion and the excess of the exploration and development cost deduction over hypothe tical deduction that would have been allowed if the costs had been amortized ratably deducted evenly over ten year period third item of tax preference that the mining firm would have to include inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34268crs33 69 us congress congre ssional budget office taxing capital income effective tax rates and approaches to reform october 2005 table 2 pp 1011its list of tax preference items is the excess of accelerated depreciation over straight line depreciation to the extent to which mining companies uses these and other items of tax preference this could trigger the minimum tax and thereby reduce the value of the special tax provisions effective tax rates these special tax preferences or s ubsidies combined with accelerated depreciation significant tax benefit for highly capital intensive business such as hardrock mining have historically resulted in relatively low effective average and marginal tax rates thus firms that mine hardrock minerals on public domain lands pay royalty and benefit from fairly significant tax subsidies for example cbo recently published study of effective tax ra tes on different types of assets and those used in mining mining and oil field machinery and mining structures such as mine shafts generally ranked fair ly low relative to assets used in other industries69
