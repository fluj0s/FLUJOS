unity party led by artashes geghamyan and the republic party led by aram sargisyan while the pro government republican party of armenia and prosperous armenia party argued that the losing parties

work ers the impeachment bloc and other opposition parties held more rallies on may 25 and june 1 to demand new election implications for armenia since president kocharyan is constitutionally limited to two terms the parties showing well in the legislative election are expected to be best poised to put forth their candidates for presidential election in 2008 the republican party of armenias strong showing places prime minister sargisyan as the front runner for president if he chooses to run8 according to analyst emil danielyan opposition parties may counter by appealing to the cynicism of many armenian s about the electoral results and by urging them to support alternativ presidential candidates9 some observers suggest that the opposition parties may again fail to cooperate and in stead put forward multiple presidential candidates fracturing the opposition vote the election also may be more significant than previous ones because the legislature has been given enhanced cons titutional powers according to some observers in calling for the election of progovernment legislat ors kocharyan warned on may 10 that it ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22675crs5 10 the constitution specifies that

the countrys citizens will suffer since the republican party of armenia increased its number of seats to nearmajority in the legislature and the opposition parties lost seats it is unlikely that the domestic and foreign policies of the gove rnment will change greatly according to many observers10 there conceivably could be some changes in some policies however as the republican party of armenia seeks to form coalition g overnment reasons for the republican party of armenia to seek coalition rather than form oneparty government include increasing its legislative support and influence in the r unup to the presidential race other spurs to forming such coalition may include the plans by the rule of law and heritage parties to use their presence in the legislature to challenge government policies rather than to repeat the failed past opposition strategy of boycotting the legislature such plans may reinforce kocharyans reported view that these parties are not constructive opposition parties and that they need to be countered by legislative coalition11 some observers warn that kocharyan as lameduck president may become less influential in armenian politics and that he and sargisyan could come to clash on personnel and policy issues in coming months other observers sugge st that both leaders who are comradesinarms of the conf lict over azerbaijans breakaway region of nagorno karabakh will coopera to achieve their future political goals which conceivably might include position for koch aryan in political party or potential sargisyan administration kocharyan and sa rgisyan may cooperate in negotiations with azerbaijan to settle the nagorno karabakh conflict possibly because sargisyan administration might have responsibility for implementing potential settlement another possible clash between sargisyan and tsarukyan may be mitigated to some degree through powersharing negotiations on forming coalition government russia appeared interested in the outcome of

president german chancellor anela merkel seemed to typify th is stance when she stated that the elections were on the whole conducted fairly freely and largely in accordance with the international commitments which armenia had entered into and that she was very much in favor of intensifying cooperation with armenia th is would breathe new life into the european neighborhood policy and the

electoral wrongdoing and prosecute people in accordance with armenian law14 armenias election may rank it with georgia as making progress in democratization in the south caucasus region according to
