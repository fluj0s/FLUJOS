donations pl 480 food for peace the 2008 farm bill changes the name of the underlying pl 480 legislation from agricultural trade development and assist ance act to food for peace act and deletes export market development as one of the objec tives of the programs this modification of objectives is intended to reflect the approach deemphasis of export market development for us agricultural commodities and more emphasis on promoting food security taken in operating the program in recent years issues addressed included policy objectives funding leve ls availability of food aid resources for nonemergency development projects and using localreg ional commodity purchases to respond more efficiently and effectively to food crises among others pl 480 title ii the 2008 farm bill amends the purposes of the title ii program to clarify that food deficits to be addressed include those resulting from manmade and natural disasters recognition that food ficits can be manmade brings the us definition of disaster more in line with the definition used by united nations agencies such as the world food program the new fa rm bill adds promotion of food security and support of sound environmenta l practices to the objectives of title ii commodity donations and requests that the administrato r of usaid brief re levant congressional committees before responding to disasters that result mostly from poorly devised or discriminatory governmental policies the new farm law also includes sense of congress declaration that in international negotiations the president shall seek commitments of higher levels of food aid from other donors sure that food aid implementing organizations be eligible to receive food aid resources based on their own needs assessments and ensure that options fo r providing food aid shall not be subject to limitation on condition that the provision of th food aid is based on needs assessments avoids disincentive effects to local production and marketing and is provided in manner that avoids disincentives to local producti on and marketing and w ith minimal potential to disrupt commercial markets this declaration reflects concern in congress with the issue of how doha round mu ltilateral trade negotiations on f ood aid could affect us food aid policy and programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22900crs3 3 the administrations farm bill food aid proposal is discussed in httpwwwusdagov documents07finalfbppdf views of many of the private voluntar organizations that use food aid for development projects are availabl at http wwwa llianceforfoodaidcom title ii funding the 2008 farm bill extends aut horization of pl 480 programs through fy2012 and sets the annual authoriza tion level for title ii at 25 billion this level of funding would be 500 million more annually than has been provided for title ii under the 2002 farm bill each fiscal year through combination of regular and supplemental appropriations but as this aut horization is discreti onary it will be up to appropriations bills to set the amount of annual title ii funding with view to providing more cash assistance to organizations private voluntary organizations pvos cooperatives intergovernment organizations that implement title ii food aid programs the farm bill increases the range of funds available for administrative and distributional expenses to between 75 and 13 of funds available each year to the program appropriations carryover and reimbur sements the range of available title ii funds for these purposes under the 2002 farm bill was 5 to 10 additionally the 2008 farm bill provides 45 million for fy2009 fy2011 to study and improve food aid quality eg eliminate spoilage minimum volume of commodities the new farm bill extends the requirement that the administrator of usaid make minimum level of 25 million metric tons mmt of commodities available each fiscal year through 2012 for distribution via title ii of that minimum not less than 1875 mmt is to be made available for non emergency development projects this mandated volume of commodities for development food aid has rare ly been met the requirement can be waived and frequently has been if the administrator of usaid determines that such quantities of commodities cannot be used eff ectively or in order to meet an emergency food security crisis safe box for nonemergency development food aid in recent years more title ii funds have been allocated to emergency relief than to nonemergency development projects in fy2007 fo r example usaid allocated 8663 million to emergency food aid and 3484 million to devel opment food aid the administration has expressed concerns about the adequacy of food aid resources to respond to emergencies while food aid organizations indicate concerns about the availability of food aid for use in development projects3 the 2008 farm bill provides for safe box for funding of nonemergency development ssistance projects under title ii the argument in favor of the safe box is that it would provide assurances to the implementing organizations pvos coops intergovernmental organizations of given level of funds with which to carry out development projects the adminis trations principal obj ection to the safe box is that it will deprive the usaid administrat or of the flexibility needed to respond to emergency food needs the new farm bill provides safe box f unding level beginning at 375 million in fy2009 ending in fy2012 at 450 milli on the mandated funding level can be waived if three criteria are satisfied 1 the president determines that an extraordinary food emergency exists 2 re sources from the bill emerson humanitarian trust see below have been exhausted and 3 the president has submitted request for

purchase followed by fieldbased projects that would purchase food commodities locally or regi onally the fieldbased projects would be funded with grants to pvos cooperatives nd intergovernmental organizations such as the world food program all of the field based projects would be evaluated by an independent third party beginni ng in 2011 the secretary of agriculture would submit report to congress on the pilot project four years after the enactment of the bill food aid consultative group the new farm bill extends to 2012 the authority for the food aid consultative group facg which

the 2008 farm bill reauthorizes the micronutrient fortification program in whic h grains and other food aid commodities may be fortified with such micronutrients as v itamin iodine iron nd folic acid it adds new legislative authority to assess and apply tec hnologies and systems to improve food aid the farm bill also eliminates limitations on the number of countries in which this program can be implemented monitoring nonemergency development projects the farm bill authorizes the use of up to 22 million annua lly to be used for the monitoring and assessment of nonemergency development food aid programs more than 8 million of these funds may be used for th famine early warning system network fewsnet but only if at least 8 milli on is provided for fewsnet from accounts appropriated under the fore ign assistance act of 19614 up to 25 million of the funds can be used to upgrade the information tec hnology systems used to monitor and assess the effectiveness of food aid pr ograms this provision is response to criticism that monitoring of such programs by usaid s been inadequate due to such factors as limited staff competitiv priorities and legal restrictions5 the usaid administrator can use these funds to employ contractor s as nonemergency food aid monitors shelfstable foods nd prepositioning the farm bill increases funding available annually from title ii funds

under costsharing arrang ement that gives preference to organizations that provide dditional funds for developing these products the new bill also reauthorizes prepositioni ng of commodities overseas and increases the funding for prepositioning to 10 million annually from 2 million annually usaid maintains that prepositioning currently at two sites new orleans and dubai united arab emirates enables it to respond more rapidly to emerge ncy food needs critics say however that the cost effectiveness of prepositioni ng has not been evaluated farmertofarmer program the 2008 farm bill reau thorizes the farmerto farmer program of voluntary technical assist ance in agriculture funded with portion of pl 480 funds the bill provides an annual fl oor level of funding for the program of 10 million and extends it through 2012 it also increases the authorization of annual appropriations for specific regions subsaha ran africa and the caribbean basin from 10 million to 15 million pl 480 title i this title of pl 480 authorizes provision of longterm low interest loans to developing countries for the purchase of us agricultural commodities the new farm bill makes some changes in the program which has not received an appropriation since 2006 to reflect food secu rity rather than market development emphasis of us food aid thus the bill strike s references in title i to recipient countries becoming commercial markets for us agricultural products and the requirement that organizations seeking funding under this title prepare and submit agricultural market development plans the bill gives title i of pl 480 previously referred to as trade and development assistance new name ec onomic assistance and food security food for progress the food for progress program ffp provi des commodities to developing countries that have made commitments to expand free enterprise in their agricultural economies the 2002 farm bill required that minimu m of 400000 mt be provided under the ffp program however not more than 40 million of commodity cr edit corporation ccc funds may be used to finance transportation of the commodities this amount effectively caps the volume of commodities that can be shipped under the program in fy2007 for example 342000 mt were shipped under ffp the 2008 farm bill conference agreement extends the program without chan ge through 2012 with the requirement that the secretary of agriculture establis h project in malawi under the ffp mcgoverndole food for education and international child nutrition the mcgoverndole food aid program pr ovides commodities and financial and technical assistance to carry out preschool and school food for ducation programs in developing countries the program is wi dely viewed as model food aid program because of the flexibility with which it provi des program components by executive order of the president the mcgoverndole prog ram is administered by the secretary of agriculture the main issues in congressiona l debate about the fu ture of the program were the manner and level of funding some argued for changing the funding from discretionary as in current law to mandatory and for ramping up funding to 300 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22900crs6 by 2012 others proposed maintaining discre tionary funding for the program with substantial increase the 2008 farm b ill reauthorizes the program through 2012 and establishes the us department of agriculture as the permanent home for the program the new law maintains funding for mcgoverndole on disc retionary basis without an increase but does authorize 84 million in ma ndatory money for the program in fy2009 to be available until expended bill emerson humanitarian trust the bill emerson humanitarian trust beht is reserve of commodities and cash that is used to meet unanticipated food aid needs or to meet food aid commitments when us domestic supplies are short the beht can hold up to 4 mmt of grains wheat rice corn sorghum in any combination but the only commodity ever held has been wheat usda has recently sold the remaining wheat in the trust about 915000 mt so that currently the beht holds only cash about 294 million the cash would be used according to usda when usaid determines it is needed for emergency food aid the 2008 farm bill reauthorizes the beht through fy2012 it removes the 4 million ton cap on commodities that can be held in the trust and allows the secretary to invest the funds from the trust in lowrisk shortterm securities or instruments so as to maximize its value the new law replaces the word replenish with the word reimburse throughout the language to reinforce the noti on that resources of the beht may be held in cash as well as commodities
