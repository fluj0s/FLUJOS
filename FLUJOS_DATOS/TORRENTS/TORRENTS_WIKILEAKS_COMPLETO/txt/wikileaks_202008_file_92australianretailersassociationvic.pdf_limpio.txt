ara has considered the national employment stand ards exposure draft and its implications on retailers both large and small overall the introduction of nes will bring greater certainty and consistency in basic employment standards 2 the aras preference is workplace environment that encourages consistency and certainty in the workplace balanced gainst the need for workplace flexibility in order to respond to demands of competitive marketplace 3 the marketplace increasingly demands that retailers p rovide seven day week service with extended daily hours of operation coupled with seasonal influences this places pressure to establish work hours regime which provides both certainty to the employee and guaran teed labour supply to the employer 4 the ara as respondent to the acci submission and is supportive of the recommendations contained within their submission 5 ara has decided to compliment the acci submission wi th specific submission highlighting those aspects of the

minimum wage 1 the discussion paper suggests that all employees wil l have the benefit of minimum wage notwithstanding that this will be matt er governed only by modern awards 4 implications for awardfree employers 11 the ara submits that many employees are in fact not covered by awards or registered workplace agreements and to have wages prescribed only by such instruments is insufficient and that the omission of such provision in the nes has potentially farre aching consequences 12 in support of this contention the ara notes tha t state wage case decisions as evidenced by the current consideration by the nsw industrial relations commission continue to be held in order to have coverage over those employees not affected by federal nimum wage decisions of the afpc or subsequently of fair work au stralia 13 past federal minimum wage case determinations have g enerally been accepted and flowed through to awardfree employers 14 the inclusion of minimum wage in the nes would bviate the need for separate jurisdictional decisions by statebased indu strial relations commissions and be one further step to creating certaint rather than confusion amongst employers and employees 4 deerw 2008 national employment standards exposure draft discussion paper 7 p1_____________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________ the australian retailers association 10 15 the inclusion of minimum wage would also be furth er evidence of move towards truly national workplace relations regi 2 in its submission to the australian fair pay commissi on on 14 march 2008 the ara strongly recommended that the afpc adjus t only the federal minimum wage or to make use of its power to reco rd differential decision and award different increase to employees i n the retail trade industry sector when compared to other industries 5 3 the absence of minimum wage provision in the nes wou ld effectively prevent fair work australia from accepting recommendation consistent with that advocated in paragraph 2 above even if just ified upon consideration of appropriate economic social and other relevant factors 4 the ara is concerned that possible consequence f omitting minimum wage provisions from the nes is that wages and other conditions contained in modern awards may be extended to traditiona lly awardfree employees notwithstanding the intentions set out in t he award modernisation request 6 5 this would confer far greater entitlement to such mployees who would otherwise be subject to the fmw as provided for under the current legislation and represent significant cost increases fo r employers in the retail sector 6 with the exception of the independent submissions made by the ara above in relation to this matter it is otherwise in general support of the positions advanced by acci 5 ara 2008 submission to the afpc 53 p15 6 award modernisation request 2008 2 p1_____________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________ the australian retailers association 11 recommendations minimum wage provisions be included in the nes to ens ure coverage for traditionally awardfree employees b minimum wage be adjusted by appropriate body such as f wa if or when justified subject to appropriate economic social and other relevant factors c rates and conditions of modern awards not to be extend ed to traditionally awardfree employees these employees will be subjected to all the rights and protections conferred upon them by the nes 2 maximum weekly hours of work 7 the discussion paper suggests that the averaging of hours of work is something that will be addressed solely within the c onfines of modern awards and will not form part of the nes itself 7 why nes should provide for averaging of hours 8 the averaging of hours is critical requirement of f lexible employment arrangements in an industry sector increasingly reliant on seasonal and changing consumer behaviour to drive demand for its s ervices and products 7 deerw 2008 national employment standards exposure draft discussion paper 49 p7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________ the australian retailers association 12 9 the retail sector is one such industry which is fur thermore compounded by high mix of casualisation and parttime employment to compliment its full time employment arrangements 10 the ara is concerned that the nes does not provide for the flexibility of averaging of hours for several reasons maximum flexibility for employers and employees 11 the preference of the ara is to include as part f the nes ability to average hours of work over period not exceeding 12 mo nths duration this will allow for maximum rostering flexibility for both employers and employees in the retail trade sector consistent with t he australian fair pay and conditions standard the standard 8 12 there would be need for the nes to prescribe add itional detail so far as the arrangement of hours is concerned as this could be matter left to negotiation between the parties via the terms of contract s of employment alternatively it could be built on through the conte nt of modern awards and workplace agreements 13 the ara acknowledges that the utilisation of 12 month averaging cycle would normally be confined to employers whose business is seasonal in nature it could also be said that the administrative burden of monitoring work cycle of this duration would indicate its utilisat ion would generally be confined to those employers who genuinely rely upon it for their survival 8 part 7 of workplace relations act 1996_____________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________ the australian retailers association 13 implications for awardfree employers 14 if the catchall preference of the ara pursuant t paragraph 11 above is not accepted then it submits that there should be scop for the averaging of hours for awardfree employees to form part of the nes in the same terms 15 if the inclusion of provision in nes for up to 12 month averaging cycles for awardfree employees is not acceptable in any form the ara submits that the ability to average hours of work must still b addressed it needs to be addressed in manner less favourable to empl oyers than terms currently applicable to awardbased employees an example of this is set out below 22 38 hour week 221 ordinary hours of work shall be an average of 38 pe r week as provided in clause 23 hours of work and rosters and clause 25 night shift fulltime and parttime employees 222 except as provided in 225 the method of implementa tion of the 38 hour week may be any one of the following 2221 shorter days that is 76 hours 2222 shorter day or days each working week 2223 shorter fortnight ie four hours off in additi on to the rostered day off 2224 fixed day off in fourweek cycle_____________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________ the australian

purposes of this award othe r than 2923 day or half day off which accrues under 2223 222 4 and 2225 shall be deemed to be unpaid 223 in each shop an assessment shall be made as to which method of implementation best suits the business and the propos shall be discussed with the employees concerned the objective bein g to reach agreement on the method of implementation 224 circumstances may arise where different methods of i mplementation of 38 hour week apply to various groups or sections f employees in the shop or establishment concerned 225 substitute days 2251 an employer with the agreement of the majority of employees concerned may substitute the day or half day an empl oyee is to take off in accordance with 2223 2224 and 222 5 for another day or half day in the case of breakdown i n machinery or failure or shortage of electric power or to meet the requirements of the business in the event of rus h orders or some other emergency situation 2252 by agreement between an employer and an employee nother day may be substituted for the day that employee is to be rostered off 9 9 sdaea victorian shops interim award 2000_____________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________ the australian retailers association 15 reasonable additional hours 16 the draft nes provisions set out number of factors for consideration to determine whether additional hours are reasonable or ot herwise and whilst these are generally acceptable in light of cu rrent and previous standards there is one area of concern 17 the ara submits the reference to any risk to employee health and safety in item 94a of the draft nes provisions should refle ct any risk to the employees health and safety to maintain consistency with the current standard and current award terms all other siderations set out focus on the employee 18 the ara is unable to see the necessity for this c hange and believes that it may widen the scope for employees to unreasonably refuse to work additional hours for reasons that have nothing to do with their own individual safety 19 to possibly allow employees to determine when the safety of other employees may be at risk in this context is inappropriate this should continue to be the responsibility of the individual employer pursuant to relevant occupational health and safety legislation_____________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________ the australian retailers association 16 question 1 page 8 should the maximum hours nes expressly provide that an mployer will not be in breach of the nes where an employee works additi onal hours of their own volition the answer is yes consistent with the intention set out in paragraph 52 of the discussion paper question 2 page 9 should the proposed maximum hours nes address the issue of unreasonable additional hours by reference to the hours normally w orked by an employee the answer is the potential benefits and drawba cks for both parties by including reference to hours normally worked would suggest its relevance is best left considered on the particulars f any given case 20 with the exception of the independent submission s made by the ara above in relation to this matter it is otherwise in general support of the positions advanced

impact upon the operational requirements of small businesses ar members have previously communicated difficulties experienced with pa rental leave entitlements where the employee and spouse are in fact employed by the same employer_____________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________ the australian retailers association 18 22 the draft nes

week threshold stri ctly based on reasonable business grounds refusal on reasonable business grounds questions 12 13 page 21 in what situations should examples of reasonable busi ness grounds be included in the proposed parental leave nes the answer is none these issues should be considered based on the particular circumstances of any given case 24 in relation to the availability of paid safe job leave under item 21 of the draft nes provisions the ara recommends this issue not be finalised at this time 25 paid parental leave is currently the subject of an inquiry before the productivity commission and it is appropriate to postp one any decisions on this matter relating to proposed nes provisions til the commissions findings are made

the australian retailers association 20 4 annual leave additional leave 27 the ara submits that the apparent reliance in the discussion paper on modern awards to define shift worker for entitlements to additional leave is of concern 10 28 whilst it is appropriate for modern awards to be able to provide this definition based on industry variables there should be definition in the proposed nes for awardfree employees so that that bot h employers and employees not bound by modern awards have clarity in rela tion to this entitlement question 15 page 28 is it appropriate for the definition of shift worker to be contained in modern awards or should the proposed annual leave nes defi ne shift worker the ara submits that it is appropriate for additional nnual leave to be addressed in modern awards given the variables associa ted with the needs of specific industries however it would also be appropriate to consider this forming part of the nes but only in respect of traditionally awardfree employees 10 ara 2008 submission to the afpc 162 p28_____________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________ the australian retailers

what types of additional rules if any might be app ropriate for inclusion in the proposed annual leave nes to address those issues the ara would not oppose the proposed base rate of pay definition under the nes however the reference under paragraph 166 of t he discussion paper to remuneration components not included in this definition should be confined only to the standard 175 annual leave loading provided for in modern awards an exception to this may be where higher shift allow ance has traditionally been payable in lieu of annual leave loading for certain industries again matter that

general issues question 24 page 30 are there any other matters that need to be taken int consideration when finalising the proposed annual leave nes the nes must allow for employer right to direct

inconsistency between the notice periods pre scribed by current awards which commonly range from between 1 to 4 weeks or mo re notice periods under current awards further vary dependin g on whether
