defense and trade division nonstrategic nuclear weapons summary during the cold war the united states and soviet union both deployed thousands of nonstrategic nuclear weapons that were intended to be used in support of troops in the field during conflict these included nuclear mines artillery short medium and longrange ballistic missiles cruise missiles and gravity bombs in contrast with the longerrange strategic nuclear weapons these weapons had lower profile in policy debates and arms control negotiations at the end of the 1980s before the demise of the soviet union each nation still had thousands of these weapons deployed with their troops in the field aboard naval vessels and on aircraft in 1991 both the united states and soviet union announced that they would withdraw most and eliminate many of their nonstrategic nuclear weapons the united states now retains approximately 1100 nonstrategic nuclear weapons with few hundred deployed with aircraft in europe and the remaining stored in the united states estimates vary but experts believe russia still has between 3000 and 8000 warheads for nonstrategic nuclear weapons in its arsenal the bush administration has not announced any further reductions in us nonstrategic nuclear weapons to the contrary it has indicated that nuclear weapons remain essential to us national security interests in addition russia has increased its reliance on nuclear weapons in its national security concept some analysts argue that russia has backed away from its commitments from 1991 and may develop and deploy new types of nonstrategic nuclear weapons analysts have identified number of issues with the continued deployment of us and russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons these include questions about the safety and security of russias weapons and the possibility that some might be lost stolen or sold to another nation or group questions about the role of these weapons in us and russian security policy and the likelihood that either nation might use these weapons in regional contingency with nonnuclear nation questions about the role that these weapons play in nato policy and whether there is continuing need for the united states to deploy these weapons at bases overseas and questions about the relationship between nonstrategic nuclear weapons and us nonproliferation policy particularly whether us policy that views these weapons as militarily useful tool might encourage other nations to acquire their own nuclear weapons or at least complicate us policy to discourage such acquisition some argue that these weapons do not create any problems and the united states should not alter its policy others however argue that the united states should reduce its reliance on these weapons and encourage russia to do the same many have suggested that the united states and russia expand efforts to cooperate on ensuring the safe and secure storage and elimination of these weapons possibly by negotiating an arms control treaty that would limit these weapons and allow for increased transparency in monitoring their deployment and elimination the second session of 110th congress may review some of these proposals this report will

status quo 23 reduce reliance on nuclear weapons 24 cooperative responses 25 nonstrategic nuclear weapons introduction during the cold war nuclear weapons were central to the us strategy of deterring soviet aggression against the united states and us allies towards this end the united states deployed wide variety of systems that could carry nuclear warheads these included nuclear mines artillery short medium and long range ballistic missiles cruise missiles and gravity bombs the united states deployed these weapons with its troops in the field aboard aircraft on surface ships on submarines and in fixed landbased launchers the united states articulated complex strategy and developed detailed operational plans that would guide the use of these weapons in the event of conflict with the soviet union and its allies most public discussions about us and soviet nuclear weapons including discussions about perceived imbalances between the two nations forces and discussions about the possible use of arms control measures to reduce the risk of nuclear war and limit or reduce the numbers of nuclear weapons have focused on longrange or strategic nuclear weapons these include longrange landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms submarinelaunched ballistic missiles slbms and heavy bombers that carry cruise missiles or gravity bombs these were the weapons that the united states and soviet union deployed so that they could threaten destruction of central military industrial and leadership facilities in the other country the weapons of global nuclear war but both nations also deployed thousands of nuclear weapons outside their own territories with their troops in the field these weapons usually had less explosive power and were deployed with launchers that would deliver them to shorter ranges than strategic nuclear weapons they were intended for use by troops on the battlefield or within the theater of battle to achieve more limited or tactical objectives these nonstrategic nuclear weapons did not completely escape public discussion or arms control debates their profile rose in the early 1980s when u s plans to deploy new cruise missiles and intermediaterange ballistic missiles in europe as part of natos nuclear strategy ignited large public protests in many nato nations their high profile returned later in the decade when the united states and soviet union signed the1987 intermediate range nuclear forces inf treaty and eliminated medium and intermediate range ballistic and cruise missiles then in 1991 president george bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev each announced that they would withdraw from deployment most of their nonstrategic nuclear weapons and eliminate many of them these 1991 announcements coming after the abortive coup in moscow in july 1991 but months before the december1991 collapse of the soviet union responded to growing concerns about the safety and security of soviet nuclear weapons at time crs2 of growing political and economic upheaval in that nation it also allowed the united states to alter its forces in response to easing tensions and the changing international security environment consequently for many in the general public these initiatives appeared to address and solve the problems associated with nonstrategic nuclear weapons moreover although the united states and russia included these weapons in some of their arms control discussions most of their arms control efforts during the rest of that decade focused on implementing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty start and negotiating deeper reductions in strategic nuclear weapons the lack of public attention did not however reflect total absence of questions or concerns about nonstrategic nuclear weapons in 1997 president clinton and russias president boris yeltsin signed framework agreement that stated they would address measures related to nonstrategic nuclear weapons in potential start iii treaty further during the 1990s outside analysts officials in the us government and many members of congress raised continuing questions about the safety and security of russias remaining nonstrategic nuclear weapons congress also sought more detailed accounting of russias weapons in legislation passed in the late 1990s analysts have also questioned the role that these weapons might play in russias evolving national security strategy the rationale for their continued deployment in the us nuclear arsenal and their relationship to us nuclear nonproliferation policy the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 also reminded people of the catastrophic consequences that might ensue if terrorists were to acquire and use nuclear weapons with continuing attention focused on the potentially insecure stock of russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons many analysts outside government have argued that the united states and russia should pursue formal arms control treaty possibly including other nuclear weapons states to reduce and eliminate these weapons these weapons have returned to the public eye in recent months in early 2007 russia threatened to withdraw from the inf treaty in response to us plans to deploy ballistic missile defense radar in the czech republic and interceptor missiles in poland1 some analysts speculated that the russian desire for relief from the inf treaty had as much to do with its growing interest in deploying new generation of mediumrange missiles as it did with the us missile defense plans some even suggested that the international community explore the possible extension of the inf treaty to other nations to address russias growing concerns with emerging missile programs2 the bush administration has not however adopted policy of reducing or eliminating nonstrategic nuclear weapons when it announced the results of its nuclear posture review in early 2002 it did not outline any changes to the us deployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons at bases in europe it stated that nato would address the future of those weapons it also did not discuss these weapons with russia during arms control negotiations in 2002 instead the strategic offensive reductions treaty moscow treaty signed in may 2003 limits only the 1 finn peter antimissile plan by us strains ties with russia washington post february 21 2007 2 ryan kevin expand or scrap missile ban angeles times october 16 2007 crs3 number of operationally deployed warheads on strategic nuclear weapons reports indicate however that the united states has redeployed and withdrawn some of its nonstrategic nuclear weapons from bases in greece germany and the united kingdom3 further after the npr the bush administration sought funding for study to determine whether the united states could modify an existing nuclear weapon to improve its capability as robust nuclear earth penetrator weapon that could attack and destroy hardened and deeply buried targets the bush administration argued that such weapon would enhance the us nuclear deterrent and improve us security by improving the us ability to hold at risk key assets of emerging adversaries however in the face of strong congressional opposition the administration reportedly withdrew its request for funding during the fy2006 authorization and appropriations process many analysts outside government and some members of congress have argued that the bush administrations policies not only ignore the potential risks from russias nonstrategic nuclear weapons but could also ignite new arms race by raising the perceived utility of nuclear weapons this report will review the debate over the implications of the administrations policy in later section it is worth noting at this point however that the bush administrations policy represents stark reversal from trends and debates during the late 1990s at that time debates in the nuclear weapons policy community focused on whether the united states should retain its relatively small arsenal of nonstrategic nuclear weapons when compared with the size of the russia arsenal or offer to reduce those weapons as part of an effort to reduce and secure the remaining russian arsenal the bush administration initially quieted discussions about nonstrategic nuclear weapons arms control and instead began to consider how the united states could maintain or enhance its own stockpile of these weapons while discouraging the acquisition of nuclear weapons by other nations in the past few years in response to the administrations emphasis on the role that us nuclear weapons can play in deterring or defeating nations armed with weapons of mass destruction and in response to requests for funding for studies on new nuclear weapons congress had begun to review and debate the administrations plans for us nuclear weapons these debates have not focused on the difference between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons or on the particular concerns that have been raised about nonstrategic nuclear weapons in the past decade instead they have explored in greater detail administration requests for funding for research into new types of nuclear weapons congress has also required that the next administration conduct new review of us nuclear weapons posture and programs in the fy2008 defense authorization bill hrept 110477 as the united states studies possible changes to its nuclear force structure that might include the deployment of new nuclear weapons nonstrategic nuclear weapons may again rise 3 kristensen hans us nuclear weapons withdrawn from the united kingdom federation of american scientists strategic security blog june 26 2008 httpwwwfasorgblogssp200806usnuclearweaponswithdrawnfromtheunited kingdomphp crs4 to higher profile congress might then pursue broader debate about nonstrategic nuclear weapons and consider further measures to either broaden or narrow the role of these weapons in us national security policy in addition congress has remained concerned about the potential risks associated with russias continuing deployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons the fy2006 defense authorization act pl109163 contained two provisions that called for further study on these weapons section 1212 mandated that the secretary of defense submit report that would determine whether increased transparency and further reductions in us and russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons are in the us national security interest section 3115 called on the secretary of energy to submit report on what steps the united states might take to bring about progress in improving the accounting for and security of russias nonstrategic nuclear weapons further hr 5017 bill to ensure implementation of the 911 commission report recommendations included provision sec 334 that called on the secretary of defense to submit report that detailed us efforts to encourage russia to provide detailed accounting of its force of nonstrategic nuclear weapons it also authorized 5 million for the us to assist russia in completing an inventory of these weapons the 109th congress did not address this bill or its components in any detail in the 110th congress hr 1 sought to ensure the implementation of the 911 commission report recommendations however in its final form pl 11053 it did not include any references to russias nonstrategic nuclear weapons this report provides basic information about us and russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons it begins with brief discussion of the differences between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons it then provides some historical background describing the numbers and types of nonstrategic nuclear weapons deployed by both nations during the cold war and in the past decade the policies that guided the deployment and prospective use of these weapons and the measures that the two sides have taken to reduce eliminate and more recently augment their forces the report reviews the issues that have been raised with regards to us and russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons essentially identifying the problems many associate with the continued deployment of these weapons it concludes with review of policy options or solutions for the preceding problems that might be explored by congress the united states russia and other nations the distinction between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons the distinction between strategic and nonstrategic also known as tactical nuclear weapons reflects the military definitions of on the one hand strategic mission and on the other hand the tactical use of nuclear weapons according to the department of defense dictionary of military terms4 strategic mission is 4 this dictionary and these definitions can be found on the dod website at httpwwwdticmildoctrinejeldoddictindexhtml crs5 directed against one or more of selected series of enemy targets with the purpose of progressive destruction and disintegration of the enemys warmaking capacity and will to make war targets include key manufacturing systems sources of raw material critical material stockpiles power systems transportation systems communication facilities and other such target systems as opposed to tactical operations strategic operations are designed to have longrange rather than immediate effect on the enemy and its military forces in contrast the tactical use of nuclear weapons is defined as the use of nuclear weapons by land sea or air forces against opposing forces supporting installations or facilities in support of operations that contribute to the accomplishment of military mission of limited scope or in support of the military commanders scheme of maneuver usually limited to the area of military operations definition by observable capabilities during the cold war it was relatively easy to distinguish between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons because each type had different capabilities that were better suited to the different missions definition by range of delivery vehicles the longrange missiles and heavy bombers deployed on us territory and missiles deployed in ballistic missile submarines had the range and destructive power to attack and destroy military industrial and leadership targets central to the soviet unions ability to prosecute the war at the same time with their large warheads and relatively limited accuracies at least during the earlier years of the cold war these weapons were not suited for attacks associated with tactical or battlefield operations nonstrategic nuclear weapons in contrast were not suited for strategic missions because they lacked the range to reach targets inside the soviet union or for soviet weapons targets inside the united states but because they were often small enough to be deployed with troops in the field or at forward bases the united states and soviet union could have used them to attack targets in the theater of the conflict or on the battlefield itself to support more limited military missions even during the cold war however the united states and russia deployed nuclear weapons that defied the standard understanding of the difference between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons for example both nations considered weapons based on their own territories that could deliver warheads to the territory of the other nation to be strategic because they had the range needed to reach targets inside the other nations territory but some early soviet submarinelaunched ballistic missiles had relatively short ie 500 mile ranges and the submarines patrolled close to us shores to ensure that the weapons could reach their strategic targets conversely in the 1980s the united states considered sealaunched cruise missiles slcms deployed on submarines or surface ships to be nonstrategic nuclear weapons but if these vessels were deployed close to soviet borders these weapons could have destroyed many of the same targets as us strategic nuclear weapons similarly us intermediaterange missiles that were deployed in europe which were considered nonstrategic by the united states could reach central strategic targets in the soviet union crs6 furthermore some weapons that had the range to reach strategic targets on the territory of the other nations could also deliver tactical nuclear weapons in support of battlefield or tactical operations soviet bombers could be equipped with nucleararmed antiship missiles us bombers could also carry antiship weapons and nuclear mines hence the range of the delivery vehicle does not always correlate with the types of targets or objectives associated with the warhead carried on that system this relationship between range and mission has become even more clouded since the end of the cold war because the united states and russia have retired many of the shorter and mediumrange delivery systems considered to be nonstrategic nuclear weapons further both nations may develop the capability to use their longerrange strategic systems to deliver warheads to full range of strategic and tactical targets even if longstanding traditions and arms control definitions weigh against this change definition by yield of warheads during the cold war the longerrange strategic delivery vehicles also tended to carry warheads with greater yields or destructive power than nonstrategic nuclear weapons smaller warheads were better suited to nonstrategic weapons because they sought to achieve more limited discrete objectives on the battlefield than did the larger strategic nuclear weapons but this distinction has also dissolved in more modern systems many us and russian heavy bombers can carry weapons of lower yields and as accuracies improved for bombs and missiles warheads with lower yields could achieve the same expected level of destruction that had required larger warheads in early generations of strategic weapons systems definition by exclusion the observable capabilities that allowed analysts to distinguish between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons during the cold war have not always been precise and may not prove to be relevant or appropriate in the future on the other hand the strategic weapons identified by these capabilities icbms slbms and heavy bombers are the only systems covered by the limits in strategic offensive arms control agreements the salt agreements signed in the 1970s the start agreements signed in the 1990s and the moscow treaty in signed in 2002 consequently an easy dividing line is one that would consider all weapons not covered by strategic arms control treaties as nonstrategic nuclear weapons this report takes this approach when reviewing the history of us and sovietrussian nonstrategic nuclear weapons and in some cases when discussing remaining stocks of nonstrategic nuclear weapons this definition will not however prove sufficient when discussing current and future issues associated with these weapons since the early 1990s the united states and russia have withdrawn from deployment most of their nonstrategic nuclear weapons and eliminated many of the shorter and mediumrange launchers for these weapons these changes are discussed in more detail below nevertheless both nations maintain roles for these weapons in their national security strategies russia has enunciated national security strategy that allows for the possible use of nuclear weapons in regional contingencies and conflicts near the periphery of russia the bush administration has also stated that the united states will maintain those capabilities in its nuclear arsenal that it might need counter the capabilities of potential adversaries the administration does not however identify whether those capabilities will be resident on strategic or nonstrategic nuclear weapons that crs7 distinction will reflect the nature of the target not the yield or delivery vehicle of the attacking warhead us and soviet nonstrategic nuclear weapons us nonstrategic nuclear weapons during the cold war throughout the cold war the united states deployed thousands of shorter range nuclear weapons with us forces based in europe japan and south korea and on ships around the world the united states maintained these deployments to extend deterrence and to defend its allies in europe and asia not only did the presence of these weapons and the presence of us forces in general increase the likelihood that the united states would come to the defense of its allies if they were attacked the weapons also could have been used on the battlefield to slow or stop the advance of the adversaries conventional forces the weapons in asia also contributed to us efforts to defend its allies there from potential threats from china and north korea strategy and doctrine in most cases these weapons were deployed to defend us allies against aggression by the soviet union and its warsaw pact allies but it did not rule out their possible use in contingencies with other adversaries in europe these weapons were part of natos strategy of flexible response under this strategy nato did not insist that it would respond to any type of attack with nuclear weapons but it maintained the capability to do so and to control escalation if nuclear weapons were used this approach was intended to convince the soviet union and warsaw pact that any conflict even one that began with conventional weapons could result in nuclear retaliation5 as the cold war drew to close nato acknowledged that it would longer maintain nuclear weapons to deter or defeat conventional attack from the soviet union and warsaw pact because the threat of simultaneous fullscale attack on all of natos european fronts has effectively been removed6 but nato documents indicated that these weapons would still play an important political role in natos strategy by ensuring uncertainty in the mind of any potential aggressor about the nature of the allies response to military aggression7 force structure throughout the cold war the united states often altered the size and structure of its nonstrategic nuclear forces in response to changing capabilities and changing threat assessments these weapons were deployed at us bases in asia and at bases on the territories of several of the nato allies contributing to natos sense of shared responsibility for the weapons

strategy of the united states white house january 1988 p 16 6 north atlantic treaty organization the alliances strategic concept nato office of information and press brussels belgium 1991 8 7 ibid 55 crs8 states began to reduce these forces in the late 1970s with the numbers of operational nonstrategic nuclear warheads declining from more than 7000 in the mid1970s to below 6000 in the 1980s to fewer than 1000 by the middle of the 1990s8 these reductions occurred for the most part because us and nato officials believed they could maintain deterrence with fewer but more modern weapons for example when the nato allies agreed in 1970 that the united states should deploy new intermediate range nuclear weapons in europe they decided to remove 1000 older nuclear weapons from europe and in 1983 in the montebello decision when the nato defense ministers approved additional weapons modernization plans they also called for further reduction of 1400 nonstrategic nuclear weapons9 these modernization programs continued through the 1980s in his 1988 annual report to congress secretary of defense caspar weinberger noted that the united states was completing the deployment of pershing ii intermediaterange ballistic missiles and groundlaunched cruise missiles in europe modernizing two types of nuclear artillery shells upgrading the lance shortrange ballistic missile continuing production of the nucleararmed version of the tomahawk sealaunches cruise missile and developing new nuclear depthstrike bomb for us naval forces10 however by the end of that decade as the warsaw pact dissolved the united states had canceled or scaled back all planned modernization programs in 1987 it also signed the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty which eliminated all us and soviet groundlaunched shorter and intermediaterange ballistic and cruise missiles11 soviet nonstrategic nuclear weapons during the cold war strategy and doctrine during the cold war the soviet union also considered nuclear weapons to be instrumental to its military strategy12 although the soviet union had pledged that it would not be the first to use nuclear weapons most western observers doubted that it would actually observe this pledge in conflict instead analysts argue that the soviet union had integrated nuclear weapons into its warfighting plans to much greater degree than the united states

analysts stressed that these weapons would be useful for both surprise attack and preemptive attack according to one russian analyst the soviet union would have used nonstrategic nuclear weapons to conduct strategic operations in the theater of war and to reinforce conventional units in large scale land and sea operations13 this would have helped the soviet union achieve success in these theaters of war and would have diverted forces of the enemy from soviet territory the soviet union reportedly began to reduce its emphasis on nuclear warfighting strategies in the mid1980s under soviet president mikhail gorbachev he reportedly believed that the use of nuclear weapons would be catastrophic nevertheless they remained key tool of deterring and fighting largescale conflict with the united states and nato force structure the soviet union produced and deployed wide range of delivery vehicles for nonstrategic nuclear weapons at different times during the period it deployed suitcase bombs nuclear mines shells for artillery short medium and intermediate ballistic missiles shortrange airdelivered missiles and gravity bombs the soviet union deployed these weapons at nearly 600 bases with some located in warsaw pact nations in eastern europe some in the nonrussian republics on the western and southern perimeter of the nation and throughout russia estimates vary but many analysts believe that in 1991 the soviet union had more than 20000 of these weapons the numbers may have been higher in the range of 25000 weapons in earlier years before the collapse of the warsaw pact14 the 1991 presidential nuclear initiatives in september and october 1991 us president george hw bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev sharply altered their nations deployments of nonstrategic nuclear weapons15 each announced unilateral but reciprocal initiatives that marked the end of many elements of their cold war nuclear arsenals us initiative on september 27 1991 us president george hw bush announced that the united states would withdraw all landbased tactical nuclear weapons those that could travel less than 300 miles from overseas bases and all sea based tactical nuclear weapons from us surface ships submarines and naval 13 ivan safranchuk tactical nuclear weapons in the modern world russian perspective in alexander brian and alistair millar editors

nonstrategic nuclear weapons obstacles and opportunities united states air force institute for national security studies july 2001 pp 273283 crs10 aircraft16 under these measures the united states began dismantling approximately 2150 warheads from the landbased delivery systems including 850 warheads for lance missiles and 1300 artillery shells it also withdrew about 500 weapons normally deployed aboard surface ships and submarines and planned to eliminate around 900 b57 depth bombs17 which had been deployed on land and at sea and the weapons for landbased naval aircraft18 furthermore in late 1991 nato decided to reduce by about half the number of weapons for nuclearcapable aircraft based in europe which led to the withdrawal of an additional 700 us airdelivered nuclear weapons the united states implemented these measures very quickly nonstrategic nuclear weapons were removed from bases in korea by the end of 1991 and europe by mid1992 the navy had withdrawn nuclear weapons from its surface ships submarines and forward bases by the mid199219 the warhead dismantlement process has moved more slowly taking most of the 1990s to complete for some weapons and with some work still to be done on others but this is due to the limits on capacity at the pantex plant in texas where the work is done the first bush administration decided to withdraw these weapons for several reasons first the threat the weapons were to deter soviet and warsaw pact attacks in europe had diminished with the collapse of the warsaw pact in 1989 further the military utility of the landbased weapons had declined as the soviet union pulled its forces eastward beyond the range of these weapons the utility of the seabased weapons had also declined as result of changes in us warfighting concepts that accompanied the end of the cold war moreover the withdrawal of the seabased weapons helped ease source of tensions between the united states and some allies such as new zealand and japan who had been uncomfortable with the possible presence of nuclear weapons during port visits by us naval forces20 the presidents announcement also responded to growing concerns among analysts about the safety and security of soviet nonstrategic nuclear weapons the soviet union had deployed thousands of these weapons at bases in remote areas of its territory and at bases outside soviet territory in eastern europe the demise of the warsaw pact and political upheaval in eastern europe generated concerns about the safety of these weapons the abortive coup in moscow in august 1991 had also caused alarms about the strength of central control over nuclear weapons inside the soviet union the us initiative was not contingent on soviet response and the 16 president bush also announced that he would remove from alert all us strategic bombers and 450 minuteman ii icbms that were to be eliminated under the start treaty he also cancelled several modernization programs for strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons 17 joshua handler in alexander and millar tactical nuclear weapons pp 2122 18 the united states maintained the capability to return seabased nuclear weapons to aircraft carriers and submarines until this policy was changed through the nuclear posture reviews of 1994 and 2001 19 joshua handler in alexander and millar tactical nuclear weapons p 22 20 see for example crisis in usnew zealand relations crs report 8592 by robert g sutter out of print for copies contact amy woolf at 2027072379 crs11 bush administration did not consult with soviet leadership prior to its public announcement but many hoped that the us initiative would provide president gorbachev with the incentive to take similar steps to withdraw and eliminate many of his nations nonstrategic nuclear weapons soviet and russian initiatives on october 5 1991 russias president gorbachev replied that he too would withdraw and eliminate nonstrategic nuclear weapons21 he stated that the soviet union would destroy all nuclear artillery ammunition and warheads for tactical missiles remove warheads for nuclear anti aircraft missiles and destroy some of them destroy all nuclear landmines and remove all naval nonstrategic weapons from submarines and surface ships and groundbased naval aviation destroying some of them estimates of the numbers of nonstrategic nuclear weapons deployed by the soviet union varied with range as great as 1500021700 nonstrategic nuclear weapons in the soviet arsenal in 199122 consequently analysts expected these measures to affect several thousand weapons russias president boris yeltsin pledged to continue implementing these measures after the soviet union collapsed at the end of 1991 he also stated that russia would destroy many of the warheads removed from nonstrategic nuclear weapons23 these included all warheads from shortrange missiles artillery and atomic demolition devices onethird of the warheads from seabased nonstrategic weapons half the warheads from airdefense interceptors and half the warheads from the air forces nonstrategic nuclear weapons reports indicate that the soviet union had begun removing nonstrategic nuclear weapons from bases outside soviet territory after the collapse of the warsaw pact and they had probably all been removed from eastern europe and the transcaucusus prior to the 1991 announcements nevertheless president gorbachevs pledge to withdraw and eliminate many of these weapons spurred their removal from other former soviet states after the collapse of the soviet union reports indicate that they had all been removed from the baltic states and central asian republics by the end of 1991 and from ukraine and belarus by midlate spring 199224 the status of nonstrategic nuclear weapons deployed on russian territory is far less certain according to some estimates the naval systems were removed from deployment by the end of 1993 but the army and air force systems remained in the field until 1996 and 199725 furthermore russia has been far slower to eliminate the warheads from these systems than has the united states with many warheads still 21 president gorbachev also addressed strategic nuclear weapons in his initiative announcing that he would remove bombers and more than 500 ballistic missiles from alert and cancelling many modernization programs 22 joshua handler in alexander and

the end of the 1990s some analysts and experts in the united states have expressed concerns about the slow pace of eliminations in russia they note that the continuing existence of these warheads along with the increasing reliance on nuclear weapons in russias national security strategy indicate that russia may reverse its pledges and reintroduce nonstrategic nuclear weapons into its deployed forces others however note that financial constraints could have slowed the elimination of these warheads or that russia decided to coordinate the elimination effort with the previouslyscheduled retirement of older weapons26 us nonstrategic nuclear weapons after the cold war strategy and doctrine nonstrategic nuclear weapons have continued to play role in us and nato policy for the united states the emphasis has shifted from strategy that emphasized the deterrence of an attack from the soviet union and its allies to one that has placed growing emphasis on the role that nuclear weapons might play in deterring or responding to regional contingencies that involved nations other than russia for example former secretary of defense perry stated that maintaining us nuclear commitments with nato and retaining the ability to deploy nuclear capabilities to meet various regional contingencies continues to be an important means for deterring aggression protecting and promoting us interests reassuring allies and friends and preventing proliferation emphasis added27 specifically the united states maintains the option to use nuclear weapons in response to attacks with conventional chemical or biological weapons for example assistant secretary of defense edward warner testified that the us capability to deliver an overwhelming rapid and devastating military response with the full range of military capabilities will remain the cornerstone of our strategy for deterring rogue nation ballistic missile and wmd proliferation threats the very existence of us strategic and theater nuclear forces backed by highly capable conventional forces should certainly give pause to any rogue leader contemplating the use of wmd against the united states its overseas deployed forces or its allies28 these statements do not indicate whether nonstrategic nuclear weapons would be used to achieve battlefield or tactical objectives or whether they would contribute to strategic missions but it remained evident throughout the 1990s that the united states continued to view these weapons as part of its national security strategy the bush administration also emphasized the

strategy and threat reduction before the senate armed services subcommittee on strategic forces april 14 1999 crs13 attacks by nations armed with chemical biological and conventional weapons stating that the united states would develop and deploy those nuclear capabilities that it would need to defeat the capabilities of any potential adversary whether or not it possessed nuclear weapons this does not by itself indicate that the united states would plan to use nonstrategic nuclear weapons however many analysts concluded from these and other comments by administration officials that the bush administration was planning for the tactical first use of nuclear weapons the bush administration has never confirmed this view and instead has indicated that it would not use nuclear weapons in anything other than the most grave circumstances for nato nonstrategic nuclear weapons have played reduced but continuing role in security policy they have been seen not only as deterrent to wide range of potential aggressors but also as an important element in natos cohesion as an alliance in the press communique released after their november 1995 meeting the members of natos defense planning committee and nuclear planning group stated that alliance solidarity common commitment and strategic unity are demonstrated through the current basing of deployable substrategic nuclear forces in europe29 nato has also reaffirmed the importance of nuclear weapons for deterrence the new strategic concept signed in april 1999 states that to protect peace and to prevent war or any kind of coercion the alliance will maintain for the foreseeable future an appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional forces nuclear weapons make unique contribution in rendering the risks of aggression against the alliance incalculable and unacceptable30 nato had also emphasized the importance of nuclear weapons in its strategy in 1997 in the founding act on mutual relations cooperation and security between the russian federation and the north atlantic treaty organization although the nato members assured russia that it had intention plan and reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members it also stated that it had need to change any aspect of natos nuclear policy and do not foresee any future need to do so emphasis added31 force structure through the late 1990s and into the bush administration the united states has maintained approximately 1100 nonstrategic nuclear weapons in its active stockpile unclassified reports indicate that of this number around 500 were airdelivered bombs deployed at bases in europe the remainder including some additional airdelivered bombs and around 320 nucleararmed sealaunched cruise missiles are held in storage areas in the

weapons to us surface ships it had retained this ability after removing the weapons under the 1991 pni it retained however its ability to restore cruise missiles to attack submarines and it did not recommend any changes in the number of airdelivered weapons deployed in europe the united states has consolidated its weapons storage sites for nonstrategic nuclear weapons it reportedly reduced the number of these facilities by over 75 between 1988 and 1994 it eliminated 2 of its 4 storage sites for sealaunched cruise missiles retaining only one facility on each coast of the united states it also reduced the number of bases in europe that store nuclear weapons from over 125 bases in the mid1980s to 10 bases in seven countries by 200033 some reports indicate that this number had declined further with the withdrawal of the weapons in greece and at ramstein air base in germany between 2001 and 2005 in addition reports indicate that the united states has also withdrawn its nuclear weapons from the raf lakenheath air base in the united kingdom34 the bush administration did not recommend any changes for us nonstrategic nuclear weapons after completing its nuclear posture review in 2001 reports indicate that it has decided to retain the capability to restore cruise missiles to attack submarines because of their ability to deploy in secret anywhere on the globe in time of crisis35 the npr also did not recommend any changes to the deployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons in europe leaving decisions about their status to the members of the nato alliance the alliance has reviewed these deployments and reaffirmed that the weapons remain an important indicator of alliance unity with the sharing of information about the weapons and sharing of responsibility for their basing serving as an important bond among the members of the alliance after completing the npr the bush administration indicated that the united states would explore the development of new types of nuclear warheads it commissioned study on the robust nuclear earth penetrator which would have been modification of an existing type of nuclear weapon36 this program was designed to improve the us capability to attack hardened and deeply buried targets the administration argued that the united states had to improve its capability to attack these types of targets because many potential adversaries have significant number of these facilities which they could use to protect valued assets such as weapons stocks and command facilities the administration did not identify these weapons as either strategic or nonstrategic such designation would likely depend on the intended target for the weapon in the event of conflict the administration also funded research into advanced concepts for nuclear weapons 33 joshua handler in alexander and millar tactical nuclear weapons pp 2325 34 kristensen hans us nuclear weapons withdrawn from the united kingdom federation of american scientists strategic security blog june 26 2008 httpwwwfasorgblogssp200806usnuclearweaponswithdrawnfromtheunited kingdomphp 35 ibid 36 congress denied funding for this study in the fy2005 omnibus appropriations act pl 108447 crs15 this program did not pursue any particular research or identify any new types of weapons for further study but many of the administrations critics believed it could be used to develop new types of low yield nuclear weapons congress eliminated funding for the advanced concepts program in fy2005 and the robust nuclear earth penetrator in fy2006 the administration and others who supported research into new earth penetrator weapon argued that by burrowing underground before exploding these weapons could not only achieve higher probability of destroying fortified targets but might also do so with lower collateral damage by exploding deeply underground according to the administration these features would increase their credibility as deterrent weapon some have also argued that new types of nuclear weapons such as highly accurate lowyield weapons could be used to attack and destroy stocks of chemical or biological weapons in their bunkers again with lower collateral damage than the larger existing types of nuclear weapons these programs critics argue that these weapons with their reduced collateral damage might be more useable than existing nuclear weapons and therefore increase the likelihood that the united states would resort to nuclear weapons during conflict they note that even with their earthpenetrating capabilities these weapons would produce horrific damage and destruction further they argue that any us attempt to make nuclear weapons appear more useable or to have greater military utility is likely to undermine us efforts to convince other nations not to acquire their own nuclear weapons the targets for these new types of weapons could be strategic in nature supporting the military or political infrastructure needed to pursue conflict or they could be more tactical in nature supporting an adversarys troops or battlefield formations therefore the question of whether these weapons would be strategic or nonstrategic would depend on future war plans and targeting options yet with the sharp decline in the numbers and types of delivery vehicles for nonstrategic warheads these weapons might be delivered by strategic delivery vehicles such as ballistic missiles or bombers regardless of their targeting objective hence the us plans for the development of new types of nuclear weapons highlight the complexities discussed above in defining and identifying nonstrategic nuclear weapons because in future scenarios it may be difficult to tell what weapon is intended to attack by the range of its delivery vehicle or the yield of its warhead russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons after the cold war strategy and doctrine russia has altered and adjusted the soviet nuclear strategy to meet its new circumstances in postcold war world it explicitly rejected the soviet unions nofirst use pledge in 1993 indicating that it viewed nuclear weapons as central feature in its military and security strategies however russia did not maintain the soviet unions view of the need for nuclear weapons to conduct surprise attacks or preemptive attacks instead it seems to view these weapons as more defensive in nature as deterrent to conventional or nuclear attack and as means to retaliate and defend itself if an attack were to occur russia revised its national security and military strategy several times during the 1990s with each successive version appearing to place greater reliance on nuclear crs16 weapons37 for example the military doctrine issued in 1997 allowed for the use of nuclear weapons in case of threat to the existence of the russian federation the doctrine published in 2000 expanded the circumstances when russia might use nuclear weapons to include attacks using weapons of mass destruction against russia or its allies as well as in response to largescale aggression utilizing conventional weapons in situations critical to the national security of the russian federation38 analysts have identified several factors that contributed to russias increasing dependence on nuclear weapons first with the demise of the soviet union and the economic upheavals of the 1990s russia longer had the means to support large and effective conventional army the conflict in chechnya highlighted for many just how weak russias conventional military forces had become russian analysts also saw emerging threats in other former soviet states along russias periphery many analysts believed that by threatening even implicitly that it might resort to nuclear weapons russia hoped it could enhance its ability to deter similar regional conflicts russias sense of vulnerability and its view that the threats to its security were increasing also stemmed from the debates over nato enlargement in the mid 1990s russia feared the growing alliance would create new challenge to russias security particularly if nato moved nuclear weapons closer to russias borders these concerns contributed to the statement that russia might use nuclear weapons if its national survival were threatened russian officials repeated many of their concerns about nato enlargement and new nuclear threats during the latest round of expansion in 2003 and 2004 finally for many in russia natos air campaign in kosovo in 1999 underlined russias growing weakness and natos increasing willingness to threaten russian interests its national security concept published in 2000 noted that the level and scope of the military threat to russia was growing it cited specifically as fundamental threat to its security the desire of some states and international associations to diminish the role of existing mechanisms for ensuring international security there are also threats in the border sphere vital task of the russian federation is to exercise deterrence to prevent aggression on any scale and nuclear or otherwise against russia and its allies consequently russia concluded that it should possess nuclear forces that are capable of guaranteeing the infliction of the desired extent of damage against any aggressor state or coalition of states in any conditions and circumstances39 the debate over the role of nuclear weapons in russias national security strategy considered both strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons with concerns focused on threats emerging around the borders of the former soviet union analysts specifically considered whether nonstrategic nuclear weapons could substitute for 37 according to alexander pikayev russian defense analyst scenarios for the possible use of nuclear weapons broadened

this debate in favor of the modernization and expansion of nonstrategic nuclear weapons in 1999 shortly after the conflict in kosovo during meeting of the kremlin security council russias president yeltsin and his security chiefs reportedly agreed that moscow should develop and deploy tactical as well as strategic nuclear weapons40 vladimir putin who was then chairman of the security council stated that president yeltsin had endorsed blueprint for the development and use of nonstrategic nuclear weapons41 many analysts in the united states interpreted this development along with questions about russias implementation of its obligations under the 1991 pni to mean that russia was walking back from its obligation to withdraw and eliminate nonstrategic nuclear weapons others drew different conclusion one russian analyst has speculated that the documents approved in 1999 focused on the development of operations plans that would allow russia to conduct limited nuclear war with strategic means in order to deter the enemy requiring the infliction of pre planned but limited damage42 specifically he argued that russia planned to seek new generation of nonstrategic or low yield warheads that could be to be delivered by strategic launchers others believe russia has also pursued the modernization of existing nonstrategic nuclear weapons and development of new nuclear warheads for shorterrange nuclear missiles concerns about russias possible reliance on non strategic nuclear weapons in regional conflicts returned in early 2007 when as was noted earlier russia threatened to withdraw from the inf treaty force structure it is extremely difficult to estimate the number of nonstrategic nuclear weapons remaining in the russia arsenal this uncertainty stems from several factors uncertainty about the number of nonstrategic nuclear weapons that the soviet union had stored and deployed in 1991 when president gorbachev announced his pni uncertainty about the pace of warhead elimination in russia and uncertainty about the whether all warheads removed from deployment are still scheduled for elimination analysts estimate that the soviet union may have deployed 1500025000 nonstrategic nuclear weapons or more in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the 1990s russian officials stated publicly that they had completed the weapons withdrawals mandated by the pnis and had proceeded to eliminate warheads at rate of 2000 per year43 however many experts doubt these statements noting that 40 martin nesirky focus nuclearpower russia wants tactical weapons

and kurt j klingenberger editors controlling nonstrategic nuclear weapons obstacles and opportunities united states air force institute for national security studies july 2001 p 17 crs18 russia probably lacked the financial and technical means to proceed this quickly in addition russian officials have offered moving deadline for this process in their public statements for example at the nuclear nonproliferation treaty review conference in 2000 russian foreign minister ivanov stated that russia was about to finish implementing its pnis but at followup meeting two years later russian officials stated that the elimination process was continuing and with adequate funding could be completed by the end of 200444 furthermore in late 2003 general yuri baluyevsky who was then the first deputy chief of staff of the russian general staff stated that russia would not destroy all of its tactical nuclear weapons that it would instead hold on to its stockpiles in response to us plans to develop new types of nuclear warheads45 many analysts and us officials interpreted this statement as sharp reversal of russias commitments under the 1991 pnis with consideration for these uncertainties analysts have estimated that russia may still have between 3000 and 8000 warheads for nonstrategic nuclear weapons with the lower number reflecting the number of deployed weapons and the higher number including those weapons that remain in central storage while some estimate that only airdelivered weapons remain operational the total amount may be split between warheads for tactical aviation naval nuclear weapons and air defense missiles with some ground forces still in the mix46 russia had also reportedly reduced the number of military bases that could deploy nonstrategic nuclear weapons by over 250 and had consolidated its storage areas for these weapons eliminating about twothirds of the 500600 facilities it had operated at the beginning of the 1990s47 changing the focus of the debate the preceding sections of this report focus exclusively on us and sovietrussian nonstrategic nuclear weapons these weapons were an integral part of the cold war standoff between the two nations the strategy and doctrine that would have guided their use and the numbers of deployed weapons both figured into calculations about the possibility that conflict between the two nations might escalate to nuclear exchange other nations including france great britain and china also had nuclear weapons but these did not affect the central conflict of the cold war in the same way as us and soviet forces 44 joshua handler in alexander and millar tactical nuclear weapons p 29 45 vladimir isachenkov us nuke development concerns russia interfax november 26 2003 46 table

weekly january 2001 pp 1617 47 joshua handler in alexander and millar tactical nuclear weapons p 30 crs19 the end of the cold war however and the changing international security environment during the 1990s renders incomplete any discussion of nonstrategic nuclear weapons that is limited to us and russian forces because both these nations maintain weapons and plans for their use the relationship between the two nations could still affect the debate about these weapons in addition russian officials have turned to these weapons as part of their response to concerns about range of us and nato policies nevertheless both these nations have looked beyond their mutual relationship when considering possible threats and responses that might include the use of nonstrategic nuclear weapons both nations have highlighted the threat of the possible use of nuclear chemical or biological weapons by other potential adversaries or nonstate actors both have indicated that they might use nuclear weapons to deter or respond to threats from other nations in addition many analysts believe that debate about nonstrategic nuclear weapons can longer focus exclusively on the us and russian arsenals even though tensions have eased in recent years with their nuclear tests in 1998 and continued animosity towards each other india and pakistan have joined the list of nations that may potentially resort to nuclear weapons in the event of conflict if measured by the range of delivery vehicles and the yield of the warheads these nations weapons could be considered to be nonstrategic but each nation could plan to use these weapons in either strategic or nonstrategic roles both nations continue to review and revise their nuclear strategies leaving many questions about the potential role for nuclear weapons in future conflicts china also has nuclear weapons with ranges and missions that could be considered nonstrategic many analysts have expressed concerns about the potential for the use of nuclear weapons in conflict over taiwan or other areas of chinas interests this report does not review the nuclear weapons programs in these nations48 however when reviewing the issues raised by problems attributed to and solutions proposed for nonstrategic nuclear weapons the report acknowledges the role played by the weapons of these other nations issues for congress although nonstrategic nuclear weapons have not held high profile in debates over national security or arms control debates the 111th congress may still address issues raised by these weapons in its discussions of us nuclear weapons policy and us nonproliferation policy analysts have identified several issues or problems associated with the continuing deployment of us and russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons they have also identified potential policy options or solutions that might resolve these problems however they do not all agree on the importance of the problems or the need for the solutions this section identifies these problems and potential solutions and reviews the contrasting opinions about them 48 for more detailed discussion of indian pakistani and chinese nuclear weapons see alexander brian and alistair millar editors tactical nuclear weapons op cit crs20 issues safety and security of russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons most analysts agree that the greatest risks from russias continued deployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons stem from potential problems with their safety and security in storage areas and possible lack of central control over their use when deployed in the field these weapons were deployed and many remain in storage at remote bases close to potential battlefields and far from the central command authority in moscow further the economic chaos in russia during the 1990s raised questions about the stability and reliability of the troops charged with monitoring and securing these weapons hence these issues raise concerns about the possibility that the weapons might be lost stolen or sold to other nations or groups seeking nuclear weapons49 russian officials acknowledged concerns about the safety and security of these weapons in the early 1990s and such concerns may have contributed to acceptance of the pnis in 1991 but russian officials deny that they have lost control over any of their nonstrategic nuclear weapons and they contend that the problems have been resolved as the weapons have been withdrawn to central storage areas50 there is public evidence from western sources about any episodes of lost sold or stolen russian nuclear weapons but concerns remain that these weapons might find their way to officials in rogue nations or nonstate actors the role of nonstrategic nuclear weapons in russias national security policy many analysts also argue that russias nonstrategic nuclear weapons pose risk to the united states its allies and others because russia has altered its national security concept and military strategies increasing its reliance on nuclear weapons some fear that russia might resort to the early use of nuclear weapons in conflict along its periphery which could lead to wider conflict and the possible involvement of troops from nato or other neighboring countries possibly drawing in new nato members some also believe that russia could threaten nato with its nonstrategic nuclear weapons because russia sees nato as threat to its security russian analysts and officials have argued that nato enlargement with the possible deployment of nuclear weapons on the territories of new nato members close to russias borders demonstrated how much nato could threaten russia others argue however that regardless of russias rhetoric russias theater nuclear weapons are not destabilizing even if modernized these weapons will not give moscow the capability to alter the strategic landscape51 further many 49 because of their size and forward basing they are especially vulnerable to theft and unauthorized use see william c potter and nikolai sokov nuclear weapons that people forget international herald tribune may 31 2000 50 russias defense minister sergei ivanov has said that russias nuclear arsenal is safe and militants could never steal an atomic bomb from the country he further noted that it is myth that russian nuclear weapons are guarded badly and weakly see russia says militant threat to nuclear arsenal reuters august 3 2004 51 robert joseph nuclear weapons and regional deterrence in larson jeffrey and kurt j klingenberger editors controlling nonstrategic nuclear weapons obstacles and continued crs21 doubt that russian weapons even with its new military strategy pose threat to nato or us allies they argue that russia would only use these weapons in response to weak performance by its conventional forces in an ongoing conflict since it would be extremely unlikely for nato to be involved in conventional conflict with russia it would be extremely unlikely for russian weapons to find targets in nato nations the role of nonstrategic nuclear weapons in us national security policy the bush administration has claimed as result of its 2001 nuclear posture review the united states has reduced its reliance on nuclear weapons by increasing the role of missile defenses and precision conventional weapons in the us deterrent posture however the administration also noted as result of the nuclear posture review that the united states would longer base the size and structure of its nuclear forces only on the russian threat instead the united states would acquire and maintain those capabilities that it needed to deter and defend against the capabilities of any nation with the potential to threaten the united states particularly if the potential adversary possesses weapons of mass destruction it noted that these new threatening capabilities could include hardened and deeply buried targets and possibly bunkers holding chemical or biological weapons it indicated that the united states would seek to develop the capabilities to destroy these types of facilities the administration has argued that its new policy is designed to enhance deterrence by giving the united states more credible tailored options in the event of conflict with nation armed with chemical biological or nuclear weapons this however presumes that the us military could identify credible scenario that included the option of using nuclear weapons this may not be possible in battlefield contingencies when us forces would be vulnerable to fallout and other nuclear effects further the use of nuclear weapons to destroy underground bunkers housing chemical or biological weapons presumes that the united states would have the exquisite intelligence needed to locate the bunkers with the agents anything less than direct precise attack could disperse more agent than it destroyed furthermore such bunkers could be built within an extensive network of tunnels using blast doors reinforced concrete and other shock absorbing techniques which would further interfere with us efforts to destroy them in addition the administrations critics argue that by tailoring its nuclear weapons to achieve specific battlefield objectives the united states would actually increase the likelihood of nuclear use rather than enhance nuclear deterrence further they note that the united states does not need new nuclear weapons to achieve its battlefield objectives it demonstrated in the early phases of the war in iraq that its conventional forces were more than capable of defeating an enemy and overthrowing regime even one with many deeply buried targets with relative ease52 therefore the demonstrated overwhelming superiority of us conventional forces rather than the 51 continued

would serve as more potent deterrent in future conflicts the role of nonstrategic nuclear weapons in nato policy and alliance strategy many analysts have questioned whether the united states needs to continue to deploy nuclear weapons in europe more than 15 years after the collapse of the warsaw pact and demise of the soviet union nato policy still views these weapons as deterrent to any potential adversary and they also serve as link among the nato nations with bases in several nations and shared responsibility for nuclear policy planning and decisionmaking but if the united states develops new nuclear warheads that can fulfill nonstrategic missions with delivery from strategic platforms such as heavy bomber the need for forward basing in europe diminishes hence some believe that the blurring of the distinction between nonstrategic and strategic delivery vehicles along with the increasing concerns about threats outside of europe have reduced the utility of forward deployed nuclear weapons some also question whether the united states and nato might benefit from the removal of these weapons from bases in europe recently an air force review of nuclear surety and security practices identified potential security concerns for us weapons stored at some bases in europe53 the problems were evident at some of the national bases where the united states stores nuclear weapons for use by the host nations own aircraft but not at us air bases in europe the review noted that host nation security at nuclearcapable units varies from country to country and that most bases do not meet dods security requirements some analysts have suggested that in response to these concerns the united states might consolidate its nuclear weapons at smaller number of bases in europe54 some argue that reducing or eliminating the deployment of us nuclear weapons in europe would not only address the air forces operational and security costs associated with their deployment but also could serve as signal to russia of natos intentions to address russias perception of the threat from nato this in turn might encourage russia to accept negotiated limits or transparency measures on its nonstrategic nuclear weapons some also believe that nato step away from these weapons would encourage russia to reduce its reliance on nonstrategic nuclear weapons the relationship between nonstrategic nuclear weapons and us nonproliferation policy the bush administration has stated that the new us nuclear posture along with the research into the development of new types of nuclear warheads contributes to

that seek these weapons the us policy deters their acquisition or deployment it also reinforces the value of the us extended deterrent to allies in europe and japan thus discouraging them from acquiring their own nuclear weapons55 critics of the administrations policy question whether the united states needs new nuclear weapons to deter the acquisition or use of wmd by other nations as was noted above they claim that us conventional weapons can achieve this objective further many analysts claim that the us policy will actually spur proliferation encouraging other countries to acquire their own wmd specifically they note that us plans and programs reinforce the view that nuclear weapons have military utility if the worlds only conventional superpower needs more nuclear weapons to maintain its security then it would be difficult for the united states to argue that other nations could not also benefit from these weapons such nations could also argue that nuclear weapons would serve their security interests consequently according to the administrations critics the united states might ignite new arms race if it pursues new types of nuclear weapons to achieve newly defined battlefield objectives56 the administration has countered this argument by noting that few nations acquire nuclear weapons in response to us nuclear programs they do so either to address their own regional security challenges or to counter us conventional superiority57 policy options status quo the bush administration and some analysts outside government argue that the united states does not have to adopt any new or different policies to address the issues raised above they argue that the 2001 nuclear posture review strengthened the us nuclear deterrent by adjusting us strategy and doctrine to address emerging rather than cold war threats they do not believe that these policy changes undermine us nonproliferation policy or that they make the use of nuclear weapons more likely in future conflicts the bush administration also has not adopted any new policies to address the potential risks created by russias continued deployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons it did not address

about these weapons in discussions with their russian counterparts however the administration appears to believe that any concerns about the safety and security of these weapons can be addressed through the ongoing cooperative threat reduction program they argue however that russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons pose military threat to stability or security for the united states or its allies and therefore require unilateral or cooperative responses from the united states58 further some argue that any reciprocal or cooperative effort to address concerns about russias nonstrategic nuclear weapons such as negotiated transparency or arms control measures could undermine us flexibility and limit us and nato options for the deployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons specifically pursuing arms control agreements on these weapons might undercut natos nuclear posture generating political pressure to withdraw the remaining weapons in addition arms control would make problematic the development of new nonstrategic nuclear weapons capabilities that may be required to deter and defend against todays threats and especially for the deterrence of rogue states armed with weapons of mass destruction59 reduce reliance on nuclear weapons many analysts believe the united states should adopt policy that reduces its reliance on nuclear weapons in general and weapons with battlefield objectives in particular the bush administration argues that its policy achieves this objective by including missile defenses and precision strike conventional weapons in its new triad of us forces and capabilities others however argue that the administrations policy actually blurs the distinction between conventional and nuclear weapons and may increase the us reliance on nuclear weapons by adding to the contingencies when the united states would consider nuclear use they argue instead that the united states should adopt first use pledge so that the united states would make it clear that it would not use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear states at present the united states does not explicitly threaten to use nuclear weapons but it also will not rule out their use supporters of the existing policy argue that this ambiguity enhances deterrence by keeping the possible prospect of nuclear attack in the adversarys calculations those who support first use pledge argue that it would reduce the perceived value of nuclear weapons indicating that they serve only as deterrent to the use of nuclear weapons by other nations many believe that this change in policy would not hinder us deterrent strategy or us security because they believe that the us nuclear deterrent is robust with thousands of deployed nuclear warheads and that us conventional forces are sufficient to address any potential or emerging 58 an official with the bush administrations national security council staff has stated that russias theater nuclear weapons even if modernized will not give moscow the capability to alter the strategic landscape he further noted that russias theater nuclear weapons are not destabilizing see robert joseph nuclear weapons and regional deterrence in larson jeffrey and

threats to us security this includes the potential need for the united states to attack hardened and deeply buried targets including those that might house chemical or biological weapons the united states could use its conventional weapons to seal off entry and exit points and to cut off communications and ventilation60 thereby sealing chemical or biological weapons in place in their underground bunkers for the duration of conflict the united states could then remove and dispose of these weapons after winning the conflict without risking dispersing them and creating fallout with nuclear attack some have also argued that if the united states and nato reduce their reliance on nuclear weapons possibly even withdrawing nonstrategic nuclear weapons from europe russia might also alter its policy others however argue that russias policy is only rhetorically linked to nato policy and with continuing concerns about weaknesses in its conventional forces russia is unlikely to respond with its own change in policy some also believe that changes in us and nato policy could affect the policies of other nations with nonstrategic nuclear weapons such as india pakistan or china by demonstrating that the united states has reduced its reliance on nuclear weapons others however point out that these nations have acquired their nuclear weapons to address their own security interests and are unlikely to alter limit their forces simply because the united states and nato have set an example of reductions cooperative responses analysts have noted that the only arms control measures affecting nonstrategic nuclear weapons the 1991 pnis do not require data exchanges and did not establish monitoring provisions so each nation can be certain that the other is adhering to its commitments they also are voluntary because they are not incorporated in formal treaty or agreement either side could reverse its commitments at any time hence the reductions under these measures may be vulnerable to disruptions in the relationship between the united states and russia those who believe that us and russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons continue to pose threat to international security either because of the prospects for loss of control over russian weapons by deliberate use by either nation or because of their symbolic value and potential to undermine nonproliferation policies argue that the united states and russia should pursue further cooperative measures to address the perceived threats from the weapons and the perceived weaknesses in the existing controls on them congress also voiced its interest in the future of these weapons section 1212 of the fy2006 defense authorization act pl 109163 calls on the secretary of defense to determine whether it is in the us national security interest to identify and develop mechanisms and procedures to implement the transparent reductions in nonstrategic nuclear weapons and to identify and develop mechanisms and procedures to implement the transparent dismantlement of excess nonstrategic nuclear weapons analysts outside government have offered several proposals for cooperative measures that might address

the nuclear weapons designed for forward deployment to enhance their security and as first step toward careful accounting for them and their eventual elimination61 this proposal is part of larger agenda that these officials have outlined as part of path toward world free of nuclear weapons other analysts have proposed number of measures that might be taken specifically to address concerns about nonstrategic nuclear weapons these include increase transparency many analysts argue that the united states and russia should at minimum provide each other with information about their numbers of nonstrategic nuclear weapons and the status ie deployed stored or awaiting dismantlement of these weapons such information might help each side to monitor the others progress in complying with the pnis it could also help resolve questions and concerns that might come up about the status of these weapons or their vulnerability to theft or misuse the united states and russia have discussed transparency measures for nuclear weapons in the past in separate forum in the early 1990s and as part of their discussions the framework for start iii treaty in the late 1990s they failed to reach agreement on either occasion russia in particular has seemed unwilling to provide even basic information about its stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear weapons some in the united states have resisted as well arguing in particular that public discussions about the numbers and locations of us nuclear weapons in europe could increase pressure on the united states to withdraw these weapons expand threat reduction assistance in the early 1990s as part of the early efforts of the cooperative threat reduction program the united states provided russia with assistance in transporting nuclear weapons back to russia from other former soviet republics it has also provided russia with assistance in improving security at its central storage facilities for nuclear weapons however much of this assistance focused on the warheads removed from strategic nuclear weapons rather than nonstrategic nuclear weapons because many nonstrategic nuclear weapons remain at remote storage areas near former deployment areas and concerns remain about security at these facilities some analysts have suggested that the united states could expand its threat reduction assistance to these sites so that it could build confidence in the safety and security of these weapons others however argue that the united states should only provide assistance at sites that support the retirement or elimination of nuclear warheads and should not provide funding for sites that can support the weapons continued deployment some have also questioned whether russia would accept assistance at these sites particularly if it were not permitted reciprocal access to us weapons storage sites russia did however recently conduct an exercise with nato observers and ctr funding to explore the vulnerability of its nuclear weapons storage sites to incursions and theft negotiate formal treaty several analysts have suggested that the united states and russia negotiate formal treaty to both codify the measures outlined in 61 george p schultz william j perry henry kissinger and sam nunn toward nuclear free world wall street journal january 15 2008 p 13 crs27 the pnis and to put further limits and restrictions on each nations nonstrategic nuclear weapons such an agreement could mandate further reduction in deployed weapons including us weapons in europe and could result in both nations reducing their reliance on these weapons in their military strategies some analysts have also argued that this treaty could be multilateral to include nations such as china india and pakistan rather than bilateral thus introducing arms control limits to the forces of other nations with nonstrategic nuclear weapons however as have been noted throughout this report the two sides would likely find it difficult to agree on definition of which weapons counted as nonstrategic nuclear weapons particularly if either nation begins to deploy warheads designed to achieve battlefield objectives on longrange or strategic delivery vehicles the issue would be further complicated by the fact that both the united states and russia hold many of these warheads in storage and some could conceivably return to deployment in relatively short amount of time to address these problems some analysts have suggested that the arms control regime count and limit all warheads stored and deployed strategic and nonstrategic etc this type of agreement would allow each side to determine for itself the size and mix of its deployed forces within the limits on total warheads62 critics argue that such limits would be extremely difficult to define and monitor making it difficult to verify compliance with warheadcontrol treaty they also note that the lack of symmetry between us and russian forces would make it extremely difficult to find common definitions and limits that addressed each nations concerns in particular because russia views us nato weapons as threat to its security it could insist on the complete removal of these weapons in exchange for less comprehensive limits on the far greater numbers of russian forces63 further the other nations with nonstrategic nuclear weapons seem unlikely at this time to be willing to join regime that would limit their capabilities analysts recognize that negotiating such an agreement would be complex and timeconsuming but it suffers from still another problem neither the russian nor us governments have expressed any interest in pursuing this path russian officials have denied that their weapons pose safety and security problem and they still consider these weapons essential to russian military strategy and national security the bush administration has also shown interest in negotiating further limits on us nuclear warheads or weapons to the contrary in the 2002 strategic offensive reductions treaty moscow treaty the united states indicated that it would only count operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads under the limits in the treaty this metric counts fewer warheads than the start treaty and far fewer 62 the only way to get real handle on nsnf security and the relationship of these weapons to strategic arms control and the real military threats they pose while maintaining some capability is the warhead control route see joseph f pilat controlling nonstrategic nuclear forces in larson jeffrey and kurt j klingenberger editors

control measures arguing that the united states must maintain the flexibility to adjust its forces and redeploy warheads to respond to changes in the international security environment nevertheless analysts who view these weapons as threat to us russian and international security maintain that circumstances could change and bilateral or multilateral treaty could address many concerns for example if the united states and nato reconsider the military utility of forward deployed nuclear weapons and as russias economy and conventional forces recover more of their stability both sides might grow more willing to accept limits on their forces if it allows for greater openness and transparency at both storage and deployment areas although it is harder to imagine other nations relinquishing their nonstrategic nuclear weapons some contend that treaty that established norm against nonstrategic nuclear weapons combined with diplomatic efforts to address security concerns could alter the perceptions of these nations as well for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32572
