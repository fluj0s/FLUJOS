israeli nuclear weapons have been uncovered by the sunday times insight team hidden beneath the negev desert the factory has been producing atomic warheads for the last 20 years now it has almost certainly begun manufacturing thermo nuclear weapons with yields big enough to destroy entire cities information about isracls capacity to manufacture the bomb come from the tes timony of mordechai vanunu 31yearold israeli who worked as nuclear technician for nearly 10 years in machon 2 top secret underground bunker built to provide the vital components necessary for weapons production at dimona the isracli_ nuclear research establishment vanunus evidence has sur prised nuclear weapons cx perts who were approached by insight to verify its accuracy because it shows that israel does not just have the atom bomb which has been long suspected but that it has become major nuclear power vanunus testimony and res which have been utinised by nuclear experts on both sides of the atlantic show that israel has devel oped the sophisticated and highly classified techniques needed to build up for midable nuclear arsenal they confirm that israel now ranks as the worlds sixth most powerful nuck wer afterameric france and china with gn arsenal far greater than than those other countries such as india pakistan and south africa which have also been suspected of developing nuclear weapons 1t has possessed its secret weapons factory for more than two decades hiding its plutonium extraction pro cesses from spy satellites and independent inspections dui ing the 1960s by burying it beneath an innocuous little used building pictured for the plant is equipped with french plutonium extracting technology which trans formed dimona from civilian research _establish ment to bomb production facility plutonium produc tion rates amount to 40 kilograms year enough to build 10 bembsin the past six years igrael has added further equipment to make components for _ thermo auclear_ devices he 26 megawatt reactor alsoputlr by the french has been expanded and is probably now operating at 150 mega watts to allow it to extract more plutonium an in genious cooling system dis guises the output the nuclear scientists sulted by the sunday times are convinced by vanunus evidence they calculate that at least 100 and as many as 200 nuclear weapons of varying destructive power have been assembled 10 times the previously s the first time in detail israels nuclear bomb plant i timated strength of israels nuclear arsenal the scientists include theodore taylor one of the worlds most experienced nuclear weapons experts he was taught by robert oppen heimer the father of the atomic bomb and worked on americas first bomb designs he later went on to head the pentagons atomic weapons test programme dr taylor the studied protographs takenbyaldermaston vanunu inside dimora and transcript of his evidence near washington dc last week he said there should longer be any doubt that israel is and for at least cade has been fullyfledged nuclear weapons slate the israeli nuclear weapons pro gramme is considerably more advanced than indicated by any previous report or conjectures of which i am aware he added that vanunus testimony was entirely the s as consistent with an_ isracli capacity to produce 10 nuclear weapons year that are significantly _ smaller lighter and more efficient than the first types of weapons developed by rus sia america britain france or china another scientist who authenticated the evidence uncovered by insight is dr frank barnaby nuclear physicist who worked at the nuclear weapons establishment in berkshire and who recently retired as the director of the swedish institute for peace research which monitors nuclear profileration as nuclear physicist says barnaby it was clear to that details he gave were scientifically accurate and clearly showed that he had not only worked on these processes but knew the tails of the techniques also the flow rates through the totally piant which he quotes ex aaly confirm the quantities of plutonium that were being made vanunu says that despite tight security he was able to stuggle camera into machon 2 and take more than 60 photographs insight dtbriefed him for four weeks atid invited barnaby to inter vitw vanunu in an attempt 10 find scientific flaws in his story his testimony is conv ig chided barnaby the assessments of taylor atd barnaby have been canfirmed by other top niclear scientists who were slbwn the pictures and taled evidence because they work in sensitive positions in bfitains atomic energy
