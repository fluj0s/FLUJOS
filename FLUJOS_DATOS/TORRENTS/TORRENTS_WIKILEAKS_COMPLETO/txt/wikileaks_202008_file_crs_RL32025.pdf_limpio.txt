broug ht about in part by damage to its oil infrastructure during the iraniraq war of the 1980s followed by multinational military response and years of multilateral economic sanctions as result of its 1990 invasion of kuwait economic stability in iraq has depended on exports of crude oil since the end of world war ii exports of oil accounted on average for 83 of iraqs annual exports from 198019 90 and virtually all exports since 1996 when international economic sanctions were imposed in au gust 1990 iraqs oil sales dropped from 102 billion in 1990 to 305 million in 1991 from 1991 to 1995 the regime of saddam hussein declined to accept unite d nations proposals seeking to permit iraq to sell limited quan tities of oil to meet the needs of its people without oil export revenues living conditions in the country deteriorated sharply in 1996 the iraqi government agreed to the establishment of united nations administered oilforfood program off th at allowed the iraqi government to export limited amounts of oil and import f ood and humanitarian supplies under close supervision on may 22 2003 the security council adopted resolution 1483 lifting all civilian trade sanctions on iraq and providing for the termination of the off since iraqs chief export product is crude oil the countrys economic future at least in the short term depends on its ability to tap into its vast oil resources according to us department of energy statistics iraq has 115 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and possi ble reserves of as much as 220 billion barrels due to years of war combined with the excesses of the hussein regime its oil potential has been largely unexplored and only 17 of 80 di scovered oil fields ve been developed despite concerns over continued insurgent activity and the

and analysis introduction iraqs involvement in world trade has va ried dramatically in the last 25 years these fluctuations have been caused in pa rt by the effects of the iraniraq war 19801988 and the influences of iraqs 1990 invasion of kuwait which led to multinational military response international economic sanctions were imposed on iraq following the invasion pursuant to united nations secur ity council resolution 6611 from 1996 until the end of the regime of saddam hussein exports and imports were closely regulated through uthorized oilforfood program off that permitted the iraqi government to sell limited quantities of oil in order meet the needs of its people for food and humanitarian supp lies the off officially terminated its operations on november 21 2003 in keeping with security council resolution 1483 many in congress and the bush administration believe that reconstructing iraq including assisting in the restoration of its economic systems is compelling us national interest this belief was empha sized in the final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the ited states informally known as the 911 commission which recommended that comprehensive us strategy to counter terrorism should include economic policies that encourage development more open societies and opportunities fo r people to improve the lives of their families and to enhance prospects for their childrens future2 the 911 commission also cautioned that if iraq becomes failed state it will go to the top of the list of places that are breeding grounds for terrorism at home3 international trade and ec onomic development are esse ntial to iraqs recovery from war from decades of repression and fro m the adverse effects of international sanctions in addition iraqs economic success at least in the short term is dependent on its ability to export crude il which accounted for 83 of all exports from 19801989 and virtually all exports ce 1996 however continuing insurgent attacks against oil facilities have kept postwar oil export flows below prewar levels extensive investment in the rehabilitation of iraqs oil facilities is also required before presanctions produc tion levels are realized and new production can be developedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32025crs2 4 middle east oil and gas exxon background series december 1984 p 12 5 the 175 billion figure is

that period are discussed s econd the report discusses the progress of largely usdriven economic development initiatives in iraq and the continued process of norma lizing iraqunited states trade relations third an appendix provides comprehens ive tables on iraqs exports imports major trading partners and regional trade background since the beginning of saddam husseins regime in 1979 distinct patterns can be seen in iraqs international trade relationship with the world that seem to track its domestic history see figure 1 p 3 the first pattern corresponds to the beginning of the iraniraq war beginning in 1980 and ending in 1988 in 1979 just prior to the war oil production had reached an lltime high of 35 mil lion barrels per day bpd decreased to 25 milli on bpd in 1980 and plummeted to less than 1 million bpd in 19834 imports during the same time period soared from about 85 billion in 1979 to about 19 billion in 1982 and 19835 some of the increase in that period may be due to imports of dualuse items with military and civilian uses commodities but such marked increase in imports might also have signaled that the government and iraqi industries were less able to produce food and goods domestically in wartime environment by 1984 imports decreased dramatically as the effects of the war caused iraqs econom to contract the cost of living rose sharply the dinar was devalued and th government and other organizations began to fall behind in payments to foreign contractors6 another period emerged after the end of the war in august 1988 when both exports and imports increased slightly until international ec onomic sanctions were imposed directly after iraqs invasion of kuwait in august 1990 between 1990 and 1997 international trade virtually collaps ed as both exports and imports hovered between 400600 million per year the third pattern in iraqs international trade begins after the implementation of the oilforfood program between december 1996 and 1998 oil exports were limited to certain levels and all exports were closely regulated by the united nations until the ending of international sancti ons in 2003 similarly imports during this time period were limited to food humanitarian and medi cal necessities imports during this period ranged from 2 to 5 billion and exports from 6 to 17 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32025crs3 7 crs report rl30472 iraq

significantly below the permitted level of exports this was due in part to frequent disputes between iraqi and officials over efforts to end illicit surcharges placed on oil exports in addition iraq sometimes unilaterally interrupted the sale of oil to protest s ecurity council policy or to challenge the united states and its allies for example iraq suspended its oil sales for the month of april

producti on from 5 to 15 per year if the oil infrastructure was not improved19 the position of the united states and its allies during the sanctions regime however was that off funds should be used

neighboring states including syria turkey and jordan and imported illicit and unapproved commodities through numerous exit and entry points along its borders major illicit trade routes were said to include an oil pipeline to syria truck routes through entry points on the jordanian and turkish borders and shi pping in the persian gulf prior to the war us officials were primarily concerned that iraq might be using these illicit revenues to purchase pr ohibited military and weaponsofmass destruction wmd technology the gao report also found however that the sanctions may have been pa rtially

raising the pump pr ice of fuel contained in jerry cans48 in addition iraqi authorities have largely gi ven up on the domestic network of product pipelines favoring the use of private tanke r trucks operated by sunni arab truckers to ferry the fuel from its oil refineries in baiji and basra this strategy has met with some success in part because the use of sunni arabs gives locals in the sunni

varied dramatically during the re gime of saddam hussein trading patterns have seemed to reflect the domestic situation in the country from the iraniraq war in the 1980s to the invasion of ku wait and the subsequent imposition of international economic sanctions currently iraqs economic future is dependent on its ability to draw on its vast oil resources these efforts are being hi ndered due to continued sabotage of oil pipelines and the weakened state of iraqs oil infrastructure which had been allowedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32025crs25 to deteriorate during the hussein regime despite concerns over the continued insurgent activity and the stability of iraqs interim government which have deterred most longterm foreign investment iraq s domestic economy is reportedly booming the economic resurgence is brought about in part by us appr opriated funds being spent on reconstruction contracts in th country and by pentup demand brought about during economic sanctions and economic repression during the hussein regime the united states has lifted most economic sanctions on iraq and the president has designated iraq as beneficiary developing country under the generalized system of preferences bush administration officials have stated that iraqs stability is compelling national interest for the united states and have expressed commitment to helping the country velop
