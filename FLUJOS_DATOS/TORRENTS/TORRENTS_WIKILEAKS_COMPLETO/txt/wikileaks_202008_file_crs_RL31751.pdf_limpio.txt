crucial to the success of any new departme nt is the initial implementation of the legislation creating it one review of the record of previous experience has suggested that in past attempts at reorganizati on serious concern with implementation is typically too little and too late14 consequently as the general accounting office gao reported new and reorganized agencies have experienced substantial startup problems delays in obtaining key officials prevented timely decisionmaking delays in obtaining needed staff impeded firstyear operations insufficient funding necessitated additional budget requests and inadequate office space contributed to inefficient handling of work load and morale problems15 thus key considerations for making the department of homeland security dhs successfully operating organization were the strategy and timetable for selecting department leaders and putting them in place connecting leader s and workers through an electronic communications network16 shifting components to the new management arrangements and putting other suppor ting administrative mechanisms into operation these considerations were complicated by the new departments considerable field operations shared res ponsibility and partnership with state and local governments as well as the privat sector and need not only to maintain continued vigilance regarding terrorist threat s but also to be continuously capable of responding effectively to terrorist inci dent president bush initially addressed implementation concerns with eo 13267 of june 20 2002 establishing transition planning office within omb to coordi nate guide and conduct transition and related planning for the new department throughout the executive branch and to work as well with congress in this regard17 the new departments statutory mandate indicated that each house of congress should review its committee structure in light of the reorganiza tion of responsibilities within the executive branch by the establishment of the department important considerations in this regard concerned the appropriation of funds for the new department and oversight of its administration and activities

to administration officials and independent experts however despite the distraction of turmoil at the top of the department its many agencies are m oving forward with their missions the turbulence

challenges dhs has taken steps to consolidate its preparedness grant programs under one component and generally has been timely in awarding first responder funds however state and local grant recipients have been slow in spending the funds and an effective grants management system is needed financial management functions provided by 19 separate service providers during fy2003 are now prov

subcommittees claim oversight or some responsibility for various us programs for combating terrorism56 in the house the presidents legislative proposal for department of homeland security was referred to 12 standing committees deemed to have some jurisdiction ove r the legislation these situations suggested that many house and senate committees and subco mmittees could conduct oversight of the administration and operations of the department of ho meland security however during its initial organization meeting when adopting new rules the house agreed to the establishment for the duration of the 108th congress of select committee on homeland security the panel whose members were appointed by the speaker had legislative authority and was mandated to revie w and study on continuing basis laws programs and government activities relating to homeland security57 some additional oversight was conducted by other hous standing committees the senate relied largely upon the committee on g overnmental affairs for oversight but this did not preclude oversight efforts by other committees on february 11 2003 the house committee on appropriations reorganized its subcommittees creating subcommittee on homeland security with jurisdiction over the agencies and programs of the new department and reconfigured subcommittee on transportation and treasury similar subcommittee reorganization occurred within the senate committee on appr opriations few weeks ter in early march 2003 the periodic authorization of the expe nditure of appropria ted funds by the department of

on homeland security received testimony from dhs deputy secretary james loy who told the panel the departments most important management task at the moment was bringing its headquarters employees scattered in 38 different places across the washington area into one location personnel who an swered directly to secretary ridge had been moving to the dhs temporary headqua rters located at the us naval security station near american university in northwest washington60 at that time proposal was reportedly being developed by the committee to reorganize dhs by moving the management directorate into the office of deputy secretary loy so that some management officials such as the cio would report directly to the deputy secretary the change proponents thought would foster better integration of the departments components the cio for exam ple would be able to more effectively forge an integrated enterprise architect ure for dhs and bette r coordinate other information technology functions the first authorization bill for the department of homeland security hr 4852 was introduced on july 19 2004 by re presentative christopher cox but an attempt to mark up the measure immediately within the select committee on homeland security stalled due to differences over how action on the measure should proceed among the provisions in the gislation for improving homeland security management and coordination among federal agencies as well as state and local governments was one reloca ting the departments management directorate to the office of the departments deputy secretary with the result that some management officials such as the cio would report directly to the deputy secretary another provision mandated an intera gency homeland security information requirements board chaired by the secretary to over see the establishment of homeland security requirements and collection management for all terrorismrelated and other homeland security information and to prioritize th collection and use of such information also in july 2004 gao recommended to congress that dhs be made subject to the requirements of the chief fina ncial officers act of 1990 which requires agencies to place
