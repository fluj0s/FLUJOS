treering and other palaeoclimatic data for defining holocene natural climate variability proposal for nerc senior research fellowship by keith r briffa executive summary i have been involved in full time research since completing my doctoral thesis in 1984 during this time i have been entirely supported through my acquisition of research grants gained in open competition i became reader at the climatic research unit in 1996 with background in ecology my primary research interests are in climatology and particularly in holocene palaeoclimatology the elucidation of the variability of climate changes and their causes during the time since the last ice age i am specialist in dendroclimatology the use of treering data for climate reconstruction i have made important contributions to the literature dealing with the statistical and methodological aspects of dendroclimatological analysis and have published numerous treering reconstructions these include widely cited papers describing summer temperature changes in north america fennoscandia western europe and siberia during the last decade i have played significant role in raising the profile of treering research to point where it is now generally recognised as vital component of international research programmes that aim to understand the nature of climate variability especially in the context of identifying anthropogenic climate change additional palaeoclimate reconstructions are badly needed to increase the global coverage in both time and space it is also necessary to explore the ways in which different palaeoclimate data should now be brought together to provide optimal datasets from which to infer changes in the earths climate over recent millennia and within which to search for the causes of this variability major focus for such work is the need to test the realism of the natural climate variability produced by general circulation models and hence aid the task of identifying human influence on climate within this proposal i offer an approach to how palaeoclimate data can be used to this end this work involves strategic goals and the need for research to address pressing issues of treering and other proxy interpretation several arising out of my recent work i will continue to produce detailed multicentury treering temperature reconstructions both regionalaverage series and detailed hemispheric maps and much longer reconstructions in several highlatitude regions spanning many thousands of years i will explore the extent to which these can be interpreted as evidence of atmospheric circulation changes and how these are linked with various forcing proxies i will explore methods of establishing realistic confidence limits on treering and other palaeoreconstructions i will investigate the reasons behind dramatic change in the sensitivity of high latitude tree growth since the 1950s and the problems this poses for empirical modelling of past temperatures finally i will use the tree ring data to derive longterm estimates of northern boreal forest biomass changes and explore the implications for carbon cycle and hence climate prediction experiments during the last 15 years i have run or coordinated number of research projects funded by the european community the uk forestry commission and nerc for the last six years i have been the coordinator of two large international collaborative projects funded under the european framework iv convention the current project involves 15 institutions working in nine countries and is scheduled to finish in february 1999 i have an international reputation for expertise in the general area of highresolution palaeoclimatology i sit on the scientific steering committee of igbp pages past global changes and i will continue to be very much involved in this and other international scientific coordination initiatives such as clivar the wcrp climate variability and predictability experiment i anticipate contributing to the next ipcc report i have recently been awarded number of small nerc and ec research grants and am very hopeful of success in larger pending nerc application this pending project will also directly address the issue of how palaeoclimate data can be used to assess the realism of natural climate variability in gcm control run experiments however none of these projects will provide with salary at this time it is not known when further european community support through the ec framework v convention will be available meanwhile my scientific commitments are significant i will be coordinating the production of major pages review of holocene climate and i am currently heading the organisation and drafting of proposal to nerc for large thematic research programme intended to link the palaeo and climate modelling communities in collaborative work over the next five years i am applying for this fellowship now in the hope of achieving some continuity of support over an extended period this will enable to better coordinate my research into these important palaeoclimaterelated areas the award of this fellowship would allow to devote future research funds to supporting other researchers significantly enhancing the scope and progress of this work in future years treering and other palaeoclimatic data for defining holocene natural climate variability proposal for nerc senior research fellowship by keith r briffa introduction this application begins with brief outline of my academic history my ability to win research funding is illustrated through the description of selection of my recent projects the general theme of my proposed fellowship research is outlined along with list of specific research topics in the sections that follow i expand on several of the major topics attempting to provide sufficient general background evidence of the links between them and details of the specific research lines that i wish to pursue space restrictions preclude an account of many technical details and many references to the background literature please note that throughout this proposal superscript numbers following citations refer to the numbered reference in the separate accompanying list of my publications reference details are given at the end of this proposal document only for those cited papers upon which i am not an author research background with degree in biological sciences i joined the climatic research unit in 1977 initially working on the assembly interpretation and geographic interrogation of published evidence for climatic changes over the last few millennia through this work i developed an interest in tree ring research my subsequent doctoral project briffa 19841 developed now established method for the spatial reconstruction of climate using tree ring principal component regression briffa et 19832 865 cook et 19942 at the same time in the early 1980s along with dr tim atkinson i helped to develop the mutual climate range mcr method that produced quantitative seasonal temperature reconstructions of british temperatures through late glacial time atkinson et 19862 briffa and atkinson 19971 from 1984 onwards i have run my own research projects these have all been concerned in some way with treering research most with climate reconstruction except for one project on treering chemistry concerned with treering dieback in an area of north wales briffa et 19891 19955 i do however maintain strong interest in climatology and have published papers concerned with uk circulation indices briffa et 19906 regional briffa and jones 19924 jones and briffa 19957 and hemispheric jones and briffa 19924 briffa and jones 19932 jones et 19975 temperature and european and british moisture changes briffa et 19943 jones et 19974 my major output however is concerned with the statistical aspects of treering chronology development and related uncertainties briffa et 19873 briffa and jones 19902 briffa and cook 19904 briffa 19953 and climate reconstruction in the last decade i have published widely cited reconstructions of climate variability in different parts of the world such as north america briffa et 19923 luckman et 19977 fennoscandia briffa et 19907 19926 western europe schweingruber et 19911 and siberia briffa et 19951 19963 in recent years i have given increasing attention to the question of interpreting these data in terms of large scale including hemispheric representations of past summer temperatures what controls them briffa et 199847 and how they can be used in climate change detection context briffa et 19962 19981 jones et 19985 it is this recent work that spawned the ideas contained in this application summary of selected relevant recent grants in recent years i have with other colleagues been awarded number of nerc and other grants i am either the principal or coprincipal investigator on all these projects in 1993 i completed nerc project concerned with the construction of multimillennial treering chronology in northern sweden gst0249b later i had small nerc grant to investigate the potential for treering work in ethiopia gr92164 and an ec grant to foster collaborative research with colleagues in chile and argentina ct930336 dg12 hsmu below are described in more detail number of relevant recently completed and forthcoming projects note that except for advance10k due to finish in early 1999 none of these provides with salary relationships between european climate and the north atlantic oscillation observations models and palaeodata with dr pd jones gr902522 this project recently completed set out to explore the realism of the simulation of the north atlantic oscillation nao within the one important gcm developed at the uk meteorological office hadley centre for climate prediction and research ie hadcm2 this research established that the model nao was well simulated both in terms of variability and in its influence on patterns of european temperature and precipitation osborn et submitted1 we also showed that the recent observed nao 1963 92 behaviour is unprecedented if the modelgenerated variability is realistic this work has led to another submission gr312107 ml21 discussed later analysis of dendrochronological variability and associated natural climates in eurasia during the last 10000 years advance10k this project is spatial and major temporal expansion of an earlier ec contract ev5yct940500 concerned with treering chronology construction and dendroclimatic reconstructions over northern eurasia during most of the holocene period with total cost of 1079992 ecu it involves 12 institutions in seven countries and is due to terminate at the end of february 1999 i am the project coordinator this project together with its predecessor represents an important stage in the development of european dendroclimatology in that it has for the first time brought together many of the european laboratories specialising in different disciplines of treeringrelated work but not necessarily with focus on climate reconstruction to screen and amalgamate the vast bulk of european data major important new collections are also underway including the construction of an extensive network of treering density data from cool moist sites around the northern hemisphere the current focus in this work is on northern siberia where many chronologies extending over hundreds of years are being assembled in special areas of northern sweden finland and western and central northern siberia very long chronologies spanning thousands of years are being built from subfossil wood these data have already yielded many publications but huge amount of potential is yet to be realised we are preparing detailed year by year maps of growing season degree days across northern eurasia for 300400 years hemispheric maps of growth anomalies showing changing regionalscale patterns of extended summer aprilsept mean conditions and their associated circulation features these data are also being amalgamated to show verylargescale mean temperature changes even representing average hemispheric conditions we have recently published briffa et 19987 quantitative evidence of the timing and magnitude of hemispheric summer cooling initiated by major explosive eruptions throughout the last 400 years these same data have yielded startling evidence of an as yet unexplained decline in the sensitivity of the growth trends to largescale temperature changes since the middle of the last century briffa et 19984 and provided preliminary evidence of major increase in the longterm productivity of northern boreal forest trees since the last century much work is required to further enhance this treering densitometric data base in the coming years and in further exploiting its enormous palaeoclimate and palaeoecological potential this will require investigation into the precedence of the changes in productivity and climate sensitivity of these data in recent times their interrelationships and of course the implications for the interpretation of past data we fully expect to receive further ec support but at present this is unlikely to be before 2000 at the earliest and may require change of emphasis perhaps towards the use of the data in specific gcm model comparison studies these issues are discussed in more detail in the following section on proposed research in situ sensitivity of tree growth to longterm co2enrichment and climatic warming and its implications for past climate reconstructions with dr d beerling gr903923 this project will run for nine months starting in early 1999 it was designed to exploit unique opportunity to investigate the individual effects of increased co2 levels and raised temperatures on the ringwidth and ringdensities of mature pine and birch trees that have grown in an experimental greenhouse for five years as part of the climex experiment at risdalheia s norway besides statistical comparisons of the experimental tree growth rates and climate responses before and after the experiment comparison will be made with trees in the surrounding region the experimental treegrowth responses to different co2 and temperature treatments will be compared with measured leaf gas exchange and modelled productivity responses for corresponding years to assess the translation of leafscale to wholetree growth effects highresolution holocene climate and forcing hihol this project was formulated by and submitted for consideration to the scientific steering committee ssc of igbp pages in june 1998 the concept is state of the art review of highresolution climate variability throughout the holocene it will incorporate reviews of different palaeodata reviews of potential forcing histories that can be established with equal dating accuracy review of latest relevant modelling experiments and concept synthesis in which established thinking about climate change and variability and prospects and problems arising out of the above synthesis are reassessed world leaders in various disciplines including many of the pages ssc will be tasked with organising authoritative reviews based on submissions from active researchers within their communities these submissions and reviews will form the basis of review workshop to be held in late 1999 where existing concepts of holocene climate and its variability and the links with forcing will be reassessed this reassessment will provide the input to the final synthesis section in what will then become holocene special review scheduled for publication by arnold in 2000 the first tranche of funding to support travel costs has been provided by pages i am coordinating the project and will be applying to the us national science foundation for further support this will be demanding but very exciting undertaking and the product will be milestone in our understanding of highresolution holocene climates multimillennial treering chronologies in highlatitude siberia reconstructing holocene temperatures and recent biomass changes intas97 1418 this project has only recently been agreed under the auspices of the international association for the promotion of cooperation with scientists from the independent states of the former soviet union intas it was joint submission between myself and swiss colleague dr fh schweingruber primarily to support our ongoing collaboration with two russian institutions in ekaterinburg and krasnoyarsk it will run for two years starting in late 1998 though this grant only amounts to total of 60000 ecu the 50000 that will go to russia represents very significant underpinning of the work there particularly given the deteriorating state of the current russian economy we received earlier funding from intas to establish the first treering densitometric facility in russia at krasnoyarsk these institutions are currently subcontractors to the current advance10k project see earlier i view this collaboration as an essential springboard for further development of russian dendroclimatology in the next decade such development is vital if we are to succeed in the essential task of building dense network of long treering chronologies across eurasia and the n hemisphere one aspect of this particular work that should be emphasised here is its concentration on collecting necessary new treering data and their interpretation in terms of biomass changes over recent centuries and the implications for estimating the magnitude of past and future carbon sinks in this part of the biosphere this issue is discussed in more detail elsewhere description of proposed research over the next five years i propose to continue work developing and interpreting the highly important northern hemisphere network of temperaturesensitive treering density data in continuing close collaboration with swiss fennoscandian russian and american colleagues and to explore number of important interrelated areas of direct relevance to these but also to other highresolution proxy climate data these areas include detailed investigations into the time stability of regional and hemisphericaverage treegrowthclimate responses following our recent discovery of widescale loss of temperature sensitivity in the decadal growth trends of the treering data across the northern boreal forest after about 1950 the implications of the above for empirical regression modelling of past climate variability the need to place statistical confidence limits on regional and hemispheric reconstructed temperature series taking into account the effect of temporal variability in the statistical reliability of treering chronology predictors and the fact that this reliability is also timescale ie frequency dependent the interpretation of the spacetime variability of the network data over many centuries in terms of changing patterns of summer northern hemisphere temperatures and related atmospheric circulation data the reconstruction of the longterm behaviour of important climate systems eg niñosouthern oscillation north atlantic oscillation using treering and other rigorously vetted and climatically calibrated palaeoclimate data comparisons of reconstructed climate variability ie temperature pressure naoenso with that generated by the latest long controlrun gcm experiments both german and uk to test the realism of the natural variability of climate generated by these models and finally stimulated by the dramatic results of preliminary and as yet largely unpublished work indicating major 19th century increases in tree growth around the hemisphere to undertake an indepth study of the evidence for changing productivity of northern boreal forests over recent centuries using combination of ringwidth and ringdensity parameters to derive time series of regional stem biomass and to explore the implications for carbon cycle and climate prediction models all of the above work is linked by common theme enhancing our ability to use palaeoclimate data to define natural climate variability in the real world and to test the realism of its expression in gcms enabling better identification of unusual perhaps anthropogenic influences on modern climate i now expand on some of these issues in more detail methodology for using highresolution palaeodata for gcm validation global oceanatmosphere general circulation models gcms offer the only prospect of understanding the extent of and mechanisms by which patterns of climate changes are and will be driven by anthropogenic and natural forcings the annualtomultidecadal timescales of variability generated by controlrun gcm simulations of natural climate eg von storch 1994 tett et 1997 including various experiments incorporating different non anthropogenic climate forcings such as changing solar irradiance eg cubasch et 1997 represent the benchmark by which perturbed model simulation results are judged hence they require validation on long timescales facet that is only possible using palaeodata decadal timescale variability 1050 yr is of particular importance santer et 1996 jones et 19985 for the detection issue also important are decadal variations in the statistics of interannual modes of variability hence highresolution annual records are necessary records from different locations need to be synthesised to identify spatial patterns hence absolute dating of the records is essential reconstructions of spatiallyresolved climate variations are required therefore to evaluate the extended climate model integrations that are currently used to provide an estimate of natural variability noise used in fingerprinttype signal detection and attribution studies santer et 1996 initial studies eg barnett et 19961 indicate possible model deficiencies but do not adequately consider the reliability of the palaeodata jones et 19985 clearly document the reliability issues surrounding range of palaeodata but only in qualitative terms and only using relatively sparse network hence i consider that the time is ripe to undertake major change of direction in my own research towards the study of the very real problem of how one actually uses treering data in assessing gcm output certainly the treering densitometric data with which i have worked in recent years appears to have enormous potential in this regard it has excellent coverage and reflects regional and hemispheric temperatures with considerable skill eg briffa et 1998147 schweingruber and briffa 19968 back to 1600 and beyond other highresolution palaeoclimatic research is also making rapid advances both in terms of the acquisition of new and longer records and with regard to the statistical modelling of their climate content and associated uncertainties however different proxy records vary greatly in the extent to which they reflect specific climate variables seasonal windows and timescales of variability eg briffa and jones 1993 briffa 1995 cook et 1995 jones et 1998 mann et 1998 evaluation of the reliability of these data on range of spatial and temporal scales is required to identify the temperaturecirculation modes that they capture and the uncertainty attached to them cook et 1998 have made first attempt at winter nao reconstruction back to 1701 based on network of treering widths we have made osborn et submitted1 an independent validation of that reconstruction using the extended instrumental nao index of jones et 1997 for the period 1824 1980 start has also been made for northernhemispheremean summer series briffa et 1998 and see figure 1 there is the potential for reconstructing winter or annual temperatures too due to the sensitivity of some ringdensity and particularly ringwidth sites to winter temperatures mann et 19985 have independently produced reconstruction of northern hemisphere annualmean temperatures ad 1400 present using combination of natural proxies historical and instrumental data further validation of their method and of the effect of decreasing sample size early in the record needs to be performed the same is true of the bradley and jones 1993 and jones et 19985 northern hemisphere summer temperature reconstructions back to ad 1400 and 1000 respectively based on simple averaging of various proxy timeseries trees ice cores historical and one instrumental record and the reconstruction of arctic temperatures produced from tree rings ice cores and less temporally resolved lake varves that extends back to 1600 at fiveyear resolution overpeck et 1997 in addition to the interest in internallygenerated variability the controversial question of the degree to which natural external forcings affect climate needs to be reexamined in the light of new model experiments cubasch et 1997 and new palaeoclimate reconstructions the north american drought severity reconstructions of cook et 1997 represent some of the strongest evidence yet of the influence of solar variability to compare similar drought severity indices computed from the ensemble of solarforced integrations completed by cubasch and coworkers in hamburg would be very timely therefore henceforth i intend to expand the scope of my palaeoclimate research as follows gather and rigorously assess the local reliability of all highresolution proxy data separately assess their ability to capture the important largescale patterns of variability operating in the real world compare and contrast different methodological approaches to using the palaeodata to estimate largescale temperature patterns and their averages and their time histories compare and contrast the major modes of spatiotemporal variability in control runs of gcms with those defined in the real world and gcm integrations incorporating different assumptions about past forcing changes eg solar irradiance changes changes in volcanic aerosols combine the various estimates of natural climate variability from the palaeodataobservationsgcms to provide yardstick values of such changes in anthropogenic climate change detection studies the methodology of exploring the characteristics of real and modelled natural climate variability using measurements palaeo and modelled data can be addressed in the following three ways i first using gcm data identify the major spatiotemporal modes of model circulation and their associated patterns of regional temperature and precipitation in the control run data ie what major circulation changes are associated with particular patterns of warming and cooling compare and contrast these in different models this identifies critical regions and optimum climate parameters including seasonal differences these can then be compared with the instrumental record to explore the spatial congruence and sensitivity in spectral character of the major modes eg by using extended eofs evolutionary spectral analyses and singular spectrum analyses these analyses will identify the most important regions and parameters requiring palaeobased extension and the optimised palaeodata will be used to extend the modelobservation comparisons referred to here this can be termed the modelcentric approach ii an alternative approach is from the standpoint of the palaeodata bring together the available dated highresolution proxies including very extensive new networks of some temperature and some precipitation sensitive treering chronologies ice core and some coral data rigorously assess the strengths of their relationships with regional climate data this assessment will include comparison within specific spectral bands as it may be that the palaeodata are only useful in some see discussion elsewhere the major spatiotemporal components of this palaeomatrix can then be compared with those of the full instrumental matrix and the different gcm data by projecting the palaeopatterns alternately on to the observed and model datasets the extent to which the limiteddomain palaeodata are capable of capturing the important modes of variability operating within the full spatial domain can be quantified part of this palaeoclimatic approach should be to define the limitations of the palaeodata in capturing the spatial patterns of climate variability associated with the warming signals in recent observed data ie the northern hemisphere mean temperature annual and summer records also by selecting only data within the observed record or within the modelled datasets that correspond to the signals represented in the palaeodata the limitations of using the palaeodata to define extended hemisphericmean records can be explored as has been done in four recent papers by overpeck et 1997 mann et 1998 briffa et 19987 and jones et 19985 iii the third approach is related to both of those above but it starts from the priori recognition that there are important modes of atmospheric variability responsible for some of the observed 20th century warming nao and enso hurrell 1996 this approach would concentrate on assessing the role of these phenomena in various models and in the palaeoextended observational record new unpublished enso reconstructions of stahle et in press and of nao cook et 19982 could be used to assess how unusual the recent observations of these phenomena are see eg trenberth and hoar 1996 also their rangevariability and their individual and combined roles in producing hemispheric warming within the different models the above approaches provide objective datasets that describe the nature of pre and postindustrial climate variations in the real world and in unforced models they will provide basis for focused comparisons of the manner degree of overall warming spatial patterns and evolution of those patterns particularly with regard to the nao and enso of climate changes in perturbed ie with anthropogenic forcings experiments using the same models these data will enable testing of the realism of natural climate variability generated by gcms and so reduce the uncertainties associated with anthropogenic detection claimed because of unprecedented deviation from this modelled variability such work will also undoubtedly advance our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the possible climate proxies and suggest priorities for the development and refinement of new proxies an application for funds to support pdra to work on this area is currently being assessed by nerc if successful the project will begin the task of palaeodata assessment and focus on uk met office hadley centre model control run data and explore the variability in solarforced control run data produced by the mpi hamburg this work will be done in close collaboration with colleagues at both of these institutions and will involve further collaboration with other colleagues exploring alternative means of integrating palaeo and instrumental data to produce largescale average warming histories or explicit patterns of past climate variability over the hemisphere i also intend to develop this and similar collaboration in future grant proposals to the eu and to nerc if the thematic proposal prescient now going forward to foster longterm joint work between modellers and palaeoscientists described elsewhere is successful largescale declining treegrowth temperature sensitivity in recent paper briffa et 19984 see figure 1 and attached abstract it was shown how treering radial expansion and particularly annual peak summer wood density have declined steadily since the middle of this century in trees across the whole northern boreal forest this decline is coincident with generally increasing trend in measured summer temperatures whereas before about 1950 there was high positive correlation between the two on the interannual timescale there is little or evidence of fall in correlation the relative yeartoyear growth of trees continuing to respond directly to changing temperatures over equivalent regions hence it appears that we see major but slow change in the underlying net productivity of these forests and an apparently unprecedented loss of response to slow temperature forcing this is manifest in data averaged around the hemisphere and is also seen in all of the major subcontinentalscale parts of the network eg n europe central siberia etc this is significant finding which has implications for dendroclimatic reconstruction of past temperatures and possibly for climate prediction we will address the reconstruction issue here and return to prediction in the next section in dendroclimatic reconstruction leastsquare regression techniques are used to derive transferfunctions for estimating past temperatures as function of treering variability when applied to treering predictor series affected by this recent growth decline they will overestimate past temperature levels because the regression coefficients will be increasingly biased when calibrated against recent temperature data the extent of this effect will depend directly on how much longtimescale variability is contained in the chronologies to explain this point we must first touch on the issue of treering chronology development pic figure 1 an illustration of inferred northern hemisphere summer temperature changes on interannual histogram and multidecadal thick line timescales this was produced by weighted averaging of treering density data from nearly 400 sites in the northern boreal forest briffa et 19987 this provides probable absolute dates and relative magnitudes for the effects of number of explosive volcanoes with high volcanic explosivity indices vei the line t shows smoothed instrumental temperature aprilsept and highlights the continuing divergence from the density data in the last 50 years note that the interannual correspondence remains high briffa et 19984 the thin line lfd illustrates how additional lowfrequency variance can be extracted from the same density data using new technique discussed in the proposal treering chronologies regardless of the type of growth parameter represented eg latewood width total ringwidth or density etc are most often appropriately considered as highpass filtered data this is because differences in overall growth vigour between trees as seen in different means and standard deviations are frequently subjected to statistical standardisation before being averaged to form chronology ie by subtraction of the series mean from each yearly value and division by its standard deviation in addition gradual changes such as the progressive narrowing of ringwidths that are function of tree age are also removed using any of large number of statistical techniques the purpose is to avoid nonclimate bias being introduced into the eventual averageseries chronology however lack of discrimination between tree specific and more universal trends such as those produced by slow climate forcing can result in the removal of all longperiod chronology variability and with it the potential for equivalent longterm climate recoverability the extent of loss depends on the length of the original series the flexibility of the detrending technique employed and the time varying replication of the chronology ie the number and nature of the individual series that go to form it during different periods for further details of these issues see briffa et 19962 hence in figure 1 we see powerful representation of the history of highlatitude northern summer temperatures spanning 600 years but only on timescales up to about century the focus of interest in this work was the identification of the relative magnitude of hemispheric cooling caused by large explosive volcanoes briffa et 19987 there was therefore attempt to maximise the representation of longperiod temperature change figure 1 illustrates how the longer period changes can be extracted using an alternative statistical approach described in the next section in the light of the above brief digression we can now see that the declining thermal sensitivity in northern tree growth is real but as yet demonstrated only in bandlimited spectral sense regressionbased dendroclimatic reconstructions of shorttomedium frequency variability say interannual to multidecadal can only be slightly if at all biased because the ratio of interannual chronology variance to underlying trend variance is very high attempts to reproduce progressively longer timescale changes century and upwards using predictor series with maximallyconserved longperiod variability are prone to greater bias this requires further study and we will return to the subject when discussing the related issue of longterm biomass change in the following section meanwhile the question of what is affecting late 20th century tree growth remains the most obvious candidate is breakdown in the hitherto established positive linear thermal growth response above some absolute threshold but the observed summer warmth over the whole northern boreal zone was higher during the 1930s and 40s than in the 196080 period increasing moisture stress might be implicated but simple caparisons of the temperaturetreegrowth residuals with admittedly gross measures of seasonal precipitation totals do not support this however substantial work is needed to establish whether there is some subtle but direct climate related cause before other environmental factors are explored detailed analyses of the timedependent responses of individual site chronologies to multiple climate parameters must be carried out so as to highlight the relative magnitude and timing of changes in different species and in very localised geographical areas changes in the seasonality of climate such as increasingly warmer and earlier springs warmer winters or increasing growing season soil moisture stress are important possibilities to explore this work alone will require time consuming analyses using relatively sophisticated techniques applied to large primary climate data sets these are available at the climatic research unit the value of this work will be seen to be even greater when one considers it in the light of new evidence of longer timescale changes in tree productivity and the possible role of anthropogenic changes described in the next section long term biomass change in northern forests figure 2 is dramatic illustration of the evidence as yet unpublished that major longterm changes underlie the interannual variability of northern conifer forest productivity during the last two centuries these curves are based on transformed ringwidth and wood density measurements from many trees at each of nearly 400 sites around the hemisphere produced by dfh schweingrubers laboratory in birmensdorf switzerland see the earlier section on advance10k i have developed technique in which the raw measurements at each site are first segregated into separate narrow treeage bands eg 1020 year old 3040 etc and combined to form annual timeseries for each band made up of data from different trees each ageband series is then scaled to have equal mean and variance over common period here 17001980 and the different band series recombined to produce relative growth record for each sitespecies these can be similarly scaled and combined over large areas to produce picture of relative regional growth changes the age banding approach removes the need to detrend individual tree timeseries described in the previous section and hence preserves the long timescales of variation this is how the narrow smoothed curve in figure 1 was produced pic figure 2 short and longterm changes in different measures of tree productivity averaged across nearly 400 sites in the northern boreal forest unpublished data relative replication of the constituent data is shown by the dotted lines the data are plotted as standardised departures from 17001980 base figure 2 shows that over the whole network the level of net productivity for trees of all ages was stable up until about the middle of the last century but basal area increment bai proxy for stem volume began to rise after this time in very young trees less than 50 years the rise may have accelerated since about 1950 but the sample data dotted line are very few very young trees with few rings are not generally sampled for past climate studies the bai in older trees has remained constant since about 1930 though at significantly higher level then before 1850 the maximum density data do not show the long term productivity increase after about 193040 as with stem volume young trees show increased density but the older trees clearly show the sharp decline discussed in the previous section several deductions can be made concerning these results and they pose considerable questions for climate reconstruction and carbon cycle modelling first they suggest that temperaturesensitive treering width chronologies may display positive recent trends that are not related to temperature and which may lead to exaggerated estimates of the magnitude of recent warming when calibrated against instrumental temperatures contrast this with the potential for underestimation of modern temperature trends based on density series again see previous section the effect will be moderated by the chronology production methods used in individual studies and the timescale of interest medium versus long period the whole issue requires close attention note that my own reconstructions all of which have been used in the various early attempts to produce hemispheric temperature histories are based mainly on density predictors the likely biases in the density data are probably small however the effects in these and in other published work particularly those based on ringwidth predictors need to be reexamined the raw data should be analysed using the new method i have described reworking of reconstructions will also be required to produce spectrally partitioned series where separate temperature regressions are performed on various bandpass filtered portions of the data eg 150 years band 50100 100 separate estimates of the regression error and additional time dependent uncertainty associated with each band can then be produced the separate period band reconstructions can then be recombined to produce full spectrum time series but with better defined confidence limits all proxy climate data should be investigated in this manner and it may be that averaging data to form regional series or undertaking spatial comparisons between palaeo and gcm model data is only valid for specific time bands of major interest is the reason behind the underlying trends in different growth parameters shown in figure 2 the rates of 19th and early 20th century bai increases and the continuing late 20th century ones in the case of the younger trees are coincident with those of global co2 but increasing nitrogen levels must play role here detailed study of the regional growth trend patterns with the distribution of nitrate pollution will throw some light on this also it could be very informative to study other treering data from less nitrogen limited ecosystems and results from other published studies certainly the density decline does not appear to be simple compensation for increasing stem volume as often seen in artificial fertiliser experiments because density did not decline from the 1850s onwards but did after 1950 when volume levels were stable as for the implications for carbon cycle modelling the data could add much to growing body of evidence indicating that the mid and highlatitude forests represent large part of the missing carbon sink the essential novel result is in the stabilisation of volume growth after 1950 regardless of what causes the 19th and 20th century fertilisation of tree growth our initial evidence suggests that at least for the northern boreal forest partial saturation may have occurred as early as the 1950s this implies reduction in the takeup of subsequent carbon emissions however the different growth trends for young and older trees and the different histories of volume and density changes must be accounted for these treegrowth data must therefore now be processed in different ways to provide data more relevant for interpreting stem biomass changes early spring and late summer wood measurements can be scaled by existing mean early and latewood density measurements and combined to provide flat mass increment fmi data using various forest carbon estimates taken from the literature these relative indices can be transformed into regional histories of absolute carbon sequestration including quantification of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide after 1950 due to the stabilisation or fall in northern tree growth the implications of these results for future climate prediction could then be explored through the use of simple carbon cycle and upwellingdiffusion energy balance climate models eg wigley 1993 besides undertaking detailed exploration of potential climate forcing of their variability and the fmi data should also be compared with model estimates of past changes in the magnitude of the missing carbon sink based on analyses of stable carbon isotope ratios joos et 1998 comparing the fmi data with measurements of total atmospheric co2 concentrations different seasonal values annual amplitude variations may contribute to the question of how much of the interannual variability in the annual amplitude of co2 concentrations is related to changes in summer forest productivity as opposed to winter respiration keeling et 1996 similar comparisons with the short satellitebased measurements of normalised difference vegetation indices ndvi will establish whether fmi evidence of net forest productivity is consistent with published evidence of recent enhanced northern forest photosynthesis myneni et 1998 research location the climatic research unit is the ideal institution within which to undertake the research discussed in this proposal the vast bulk of tree ring data and many of the other proxy data are archived here the very extensive climate datasets including new highspatialresolution gridded data that are the product of current nerc grant gr309721are ideal for this work also uniquely convenient access is available to many of the latest gcm control and perturbed simulation experiments that are distributed from the unit under the auspices of the detr climate impacts link project intended participation in the wider science arena my interest in treering research has always been motivated by desire to learn more about the fine details of past climate variability in order to understand the mechanisms that drive it and ultimately the forcings that control it now of course with the advent of the global warming debate the impetus to do this is greater than ever i have striven within the field to recognise and address the problems which restrict or confuse our attempts to interpret our data in ways which can contribute usefully to this debate i also consider it important to make efforts to promote our science to the wider scientific community and the public at large but equally to present its limitations clearly and unashamedly at the recent final igbp pages open science meeting held in april this year i was one of only two uk scientists invited to present plenary lecture on the treering record of highresolution holocene climate variability and i am currently preparing review paper for the forthcoming book arising out of the meeting the scope of treering work and its value for defining natural climate change is far greater than ever before because of the huge increase in the geographical regions being exploited the increased length of the time series being developed and the development of better techniques for processing and interpreting these data also outside of dendroclimatology new potentially valuable proxies are now coming to light doubt with their own strengths and weaknesses and problems of interpretation greater interdisciplinary interaction will greatly enhance our understanding and ultimately the value of all of these i have tried to aid this development of holocene palaeodata and encourage its wider application through my work as an ec project coordinator and through my collaboration with other researchers in dendroclimatology in other palaeodisciplines but also with climatologists and climate modellers i have served for three years on the scientific steering committee of the igbp past global changes pages programme and have recently been elected to serve for another three years as part of this work as well as coordinating the major holocene period highresolution palaeoclimate review hihol scheduled for publication in the year 2000 i will also co author new pages stream 1 ie concentration on the last 2000 years implementation plan to be published in 1999 i am member of the pagesclivar working group and i anticipate contributing to the forthcoming ipcc review finally i also wish to draw attention here to what i believe will prove to be an extremely significant advance in uk palaeoscience and gcm modelling provided the necessary nerc support is forthcoming i have recently headed the drafting of an estbastb proposal for thematic research programme palaeoclimatic research and earth system modelling for enhanced climatic and environmental prediction prescient we are proposing fiveyear programme that will link the uk palaeoclimate and gcm modelling communities in the collection and interpretation of palaeoclimate data to enable more rigorous testing of the capabilities and reliability of gcms with specific focus on the latest earth system model being developed at the uk meteorological office hadley centre the research i have proposed is at the heart of the nerc strategy for future work in environmental sciences it will contribute significantly to an area the importance of which is internationally recognised it offers practical approaches to exploring the interpretation of highresolution climate proxies and will advance the means of their use in gcm model validation how much of what i discuss is achievable over the next decade will depend on future levels of support but the award of senior research fellowship will greatly enhance the
