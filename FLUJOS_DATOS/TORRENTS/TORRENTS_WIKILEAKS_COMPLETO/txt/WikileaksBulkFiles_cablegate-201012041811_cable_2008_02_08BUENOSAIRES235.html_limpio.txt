summary with sevenweek period of bilateral estrangement in our rearview window we have an opportunity again to build more constructive relationship with argentina the warming trend in the bilateral relationship continues president cristina fernandez kirchner and her government rolled out the red carpet for codel engel and pddni kerr and the circle of goa luminaries making positive statements about the united states is growing capitalizing on this opportunity however will be easy task confidence must be rebuilt on our side and in buenos aires the goa must demonstrate its commitment to constructive relationship including through visits to the united states but concerted effort is also needed from our side including visits to argentina by senior usg officials the presence of authoritative usg officials here and the attendant positive media coverage it creates feed the argentine need for attention directly attacking one of the main causes of antiamericanism here the perception that the usg does not care enough about argentina the hard work will be worth the effort if we can make dent in antius sentiment and influence argentina to stay out of the bolivarian camp making argentina more cooperative interlocutor and receptive audience for us ideas is achievable end summary an austral warming trend 2 c three weeks have passed since the goa signaled an end to its bilateral squabble with the usg via highly publicized meeting on january 31 betweqpresident cristina fernandez kirchner cfk and ambassador wayne the us ambassador is the only chief of mission who has been received privately by cfk she has now received him three times since her inauguration the change in how the united states is treated and portrayed by argentine authorities is striking as we had agreed beforehand cfk insiders followed the january 31 session with positive and conciliatory statements from cabinet chief alberto fernandez foreign minister jorge taiana and others from january 31 on the argentines have given prominent positive public play to each event involving usg visitor including the two codel engel and pddni that occurred in the last week 3 c the chorus of antius recriminations has fallen silent in their place we are hearing positive pronouncements about our country on february 20 for example after meeting between the ambassador and minister of defense garre holdover from the first kirchner administration who had previously resisted close cooperation with the usg the defense ministry issued an upbeat communique on its website noting that the argentine side expressed gratitude for american assistance the statement then proceeded to detail several areas of successful bilateral cooperation that helped to train and transform argentinas military 4 c in the wake of the meeting three weeks ago with cfk the ambassador has had friendly and productive meetings with cabinet heavyweights such as cabinet chief fernandez mod garre foreign minister taiana economy minister lousteau and justice minister anibal fernandez reftels ae 5 c more importantly cfk herself has demonstrated her continuing personal interest in ties with the usg by hosting two meetings in her presidential office at the casa rosada with us visitors in rapid succession positive wellcovered session with codel engel on february 21 and pddni kerr who had productive meeting with her on february 25 privately rep engel described the codels 90minute meeting with cfk as homerun the meeting was covered intensively by the media which characterized the event as gesture of detente and improvement in bilateral relations in leading daily headlines pddni kerrs meeting was equally positive cfk warmly thanked him for his important visit and repeated several times her commitment to the struggle against terrorism saying for example that her government was strongly committed to fight terrorism at home and internationally and that her commitment to counterterrorism was absolute argentina is in play 6 c the aboutface is striking because it comes on the heels of coordinated goa effort with the kirchners and other goa allstars front and center to impugn the motives of the united states in the miami prosecution of venezuelan agents connected to the matter of guido alejandro antoniniwilsons cashfilled suitcase but the rhetorical coursecorrection is not surprising cfk spent much of the latter half of 2007 telegraphing her intention to pursue closer relations with the united states holding three meetings with ambassador wayne and spending week in new york city wooing investors and the media as well as meeting as shannon just days before her inauguration in meeting with the ambassador cfk expressed her admiration for the united states and her desire to improve the bilateral relationship her cabinet chief fernandez and new ambassador to the united states timerman argue forcefully that she wants to change past goa practices and maintain good relations with the usg 7 c clearly there is still hard work to be done to build mutual confidence and establish basis for sustained good relations to maintain and reinforce the recent positive momentum we need more engagement not less by both sides the goa certainly needs to demonstrate its commitment to this effort but it is important to remember that we also have much to gain if things go well 8 c the foreign policy orientation of the fledgling cfk government is very much in play moreover in our view the prevailing winds in the region favor our efforts to help argentina evolve into constructive partner hugo chavez whom cfk will visit in early march to ink an oilforfood deal septel is being portrayed in the local media as increasingly on the defensive and fidel castros withdrawal from the cuban political scene is being covered here as the end of radical era in contrast neoleft politicians like lula who just visited buenos aires to sign number of bilateral agreements and chiles michelle bachelet are wellregarded here as pragmatic leaders who are making progress on social justice while maintaining good relations with washington we read the tea leaves to indicate that cfk much prefers to follow lulas path than chavezs and wants to diversify argentinas good relations in the world 9 c at the same time there are countervailing forces that could push the new president in another direction influential figures within her government such as planning minister julio vido espouse close embrace of chavezs bolivarian project although vidos primary motive for tilting towards chavez may be pecuniary bolivarian approach to foreign policy would sit well with cfks poor and working class political constituency and probably appeal at certain level to the peronistpopulist instincts of cfk and her husband nestor kirchner himself was never as comfortable with the united states as his wife has proven to be for example he never received this ambassador or publicized contacts with us whereas cfk has met the ambassador six times and played each meeting positively and prominently in the media while nestor kirchner is still powerful decisionmaker he is by most reports ceding foreign policy to cfk 10 c in our view the governments leftleaning nationalistic heritage does not necessarily lead to chronic confrontation with the united states cfk seems more interested in governance and the longevity of her familys political prospects than in gratuitous yankeebashing without us engagement however our opportunity to develop more constructive relationship with argentina could be squandered we need to stay on the field to win the game why visits help educate and show interest 11 c engagement means among other things seniorlevel visits in both directions this is true for symbolic and practical reasons like other geographically isolated countries argentines keep track of who visits them and who doesnt the goas infatuation with the travel plans of assistant secretary shannon reflects deepseated societywide insecurity about argentinas relative importance in the world argentines obsess over the perceived indifference of other countries to their interests and concerns especially that of the united states visits to the region by senior usg officials that seem to hopscotch over argentina are always noted in the press and the corridors of power 12 c cfk clearly shares this fixation she told the ambassador late last year that she faults the usg for not paying sufficient attention to latin america read argentina over the past few years and repeated that analysis to codel engel on february 21 ref f this is not new or confined to cfk and her constituency it is widely shared perception in argentina that the united states has only rarely sustained positive interest in the southern cone at recent lunch with prominent local analysts businesspersons and media figures for pddni kerr this was recurrent theme and none of them were government supporters highlevel visits can be used to demonstrate our good intentions and sincere desires for stronger relations for example secretary chaos december visit to cfks inauguration helped us to rebut accusations of us conspiracy against the goa during the furor over the miami court case 13 c just as importantly visits help goa officials to learn cfk and her husband know little about the way that our society and political system function this holds true for most of their closest advisors and the argentine political establishment writ large as well the recent bilateral crisis for example reminded us how few of them including those in the prous camp really understand the extent of our justice systems independence to our great advantage argentina is now headed by president who wants to learn more about our country evinced for instance by the manner in which she pumps visitors for information about the us presidential race though she initially favored another woman candidate it was clear by february 21 that she had absorbed much about all three leading candidates and in both of her meetings with usg visitors in recent days she made positive comments about all three and about the vitality of our electoral process alberto fernandez told the ambassador that he recently recommended that cfk accept gordon browns invitation to travel to london for gathering of international political party leaders precisely because it would be an excellent opportunity for her to learn more about the global scene through direct contact with other world leaders the most promising areas of focus 14 c on the practical level despite this missions renewed access to every level of the argentine government there are number of concrete policy areas in which washingtonbased agencies and their leaders need to engage including via the personal contact that visits make possible c finance achievement of closer economic relationship which cfk has told us she wants will not happen without paris club deal to normalize the goas debt to official creditors that in turn will require treasurys engagement with cfks capable young economy minister martin lousteau paris club deal would be critical first step towards an economically resurgent argentinas broader reinsertion into global capital markets this in turn will lessen argentinas reliance on venezuela to help place new argentine debt reliance that comes with bolivarian political and ideological strings attached it could also help lousteau who is engaged in an internal tugofwar with less marketfriendly forces on many issues critical to the 500 us companies doing business here establish his primacy within the goa on economic policy c defense cooperation the ministry of defense is more friendly to us now than it has been at any time since mod garre took office two years ago the army chief who previously kept his distance from the united states has reached out to us for contact argentinas navy and air force are eager to work with us to capitalize on this attitudinal shift we need highprofile us military leaders like southcom commander stavridis scheduled to visit in may to come to argentina his visit could help us bring the military relationship to another level advancing the ball on issues like argentine participation in exercises exchanges and regional security cooperation such visit could also keep us military suppliers in the race for important contracts like 3d radars mod us forti told the ambassador last week that he hopes to get mod garre to the united states in the months ahead c law enforcement and intelligence cooperation in this area was bright spot in the bilateral relationship even during the most difficult periods of the first kirchner administration the worrying freeze in cooperation that took place during the period of estrangement is over and our cooperation is returning to normal we need seniorlevel visits such as the planned trip by deputy fbi director pistole in may to advance us interests in intensified counterterrorism work and to resume our valuable partnership with the goa to bring the iraniansponsored perpetrators of the 1994 amia bombing to justice we also need to get leading goa law enforcement officials to the united states for bilateral consultations s intelligence argentine intelligence officials highly value their relationship with us counterparts as pddni kerrs visit amply demonstrated during dinner with the pddni february 23 the goas deputy director of intelligence recounted with pride that his service has shared highvalue information with us and worked closely with us in support of us goals the pddnis visit reinforced our superb working relationship with argentinas service the national intelligence service side and we need to keep developing it through continued cooperation sbu science and technology cfk has repeatedly cited this as an area where she hopes to expand contact and cooperation with the united states 15 c visits by highlevel us and goa officials to each others country on these and other areas will advance our longterm interest in friendly relationship with populous fastgrowing country with considerable talent and resources as importantly such travel advances key us interests in specific policy areas normalization of financial relationships between developing economies and creditors amicable militarytomilitary ties and cooperation on regional counterterrorism issues that matter to our countrys security interests 16 c finally travel by prominent usg and goa officials to each others countries directly addresses one of the main causes of antiamericanism here the perception that the usg does not care enough about argentina the positive media coverage created by such visits makes argentines at all levels of society feel relevant in the world and taken into considerations by our powerful country this cannot help but chip away at this societys collective animus towards out nation which stems to large extent from its collective insecurity about itself lets make it work 17 c events over the past two years remind us that relations with the goa are not easy nonetheless we have real opportunity to reach more positive equilibrium in the bilateral relationship in his january 31 meeting with cfk the ambassador deployed departmentcleared talking points that featured the proposal that both sides would demonstrate interest in the relationship by engaging each other including via visits in each direction as reported in ref cfk agreed and expressed interest in steady stream of highlevel visits we therefore have deal in place with the goa on travel in both directions the argentines need to hold up their end of the bargain cabinet chief fernandez told the ambassador february 21 that he had identified march 812 for travel to the united states foreign minister taiana mod garre and economy minister lousteau also intend to travel to the united states soon we should remain committed to our part in this effort especially after several weeks of positive interaction with the goa kelly
