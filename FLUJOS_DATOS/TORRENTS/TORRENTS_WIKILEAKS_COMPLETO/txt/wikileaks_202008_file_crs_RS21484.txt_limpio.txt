would have been authorized through fy2009 this report focuses on workforce investment systems title i of wia summary of amendments to title i onestop delivery system under current law services for adults are provided primarily through coordinated servicedelivery system overseen locally by local workforce investment boards wib this onestop system is intended to provide seamless combination of services to improve employment opportunities for individuals the law requires that certain partners which are entities that administer programs such as adult education and vocational rehabilitation provide applicable services through the onestop system both bills would have made temporary assistance for needy families tanf required partner unless the governor notified the departments of labor and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21484 health and human services that tanf was not to be required partner under current law each required partner must enter into memorandum of understanding mou with the local wib regarding among other things how the operating costs of the system will be funded the house version of hr 1261 would have required each governor to determine portion of onestop partner programs federal funds for administration to be contributed toward paying the costs of the onestop centers infrastructure ie nonpersonnel costs the senate version would have required the governor to make this determination only if the local board chief elected official and the onestop partners in local area failed to reach agreement in the mou on methods to sufficiently fund the infrastructure costs under the senate version there would have been cap on the portion of federal funds that could be required to be contributed2 this cap would have been 3 of federal funds for wia programs and the employment service authorized under the wagnerpeyser act and 15 for other required partners structure of state and locally administered programs under current law the state wib functions as an advisory body to the governor both bills would have added to the required membership the state agency officials responsible for economic development and would have removed representatives of youth both bills would have also required the state wibs to develop and review statewide policies affecting the provision of coordinated or integrated services through the onestop system within each local area local wib is certified by the governor these local boards have broad responsibility for developing local workforce investment system membership includes representatives of businesses local educational entities labor 1 both versions contained some provisions contained in mar 6 2003 administration proposal for comparison of administration house and senate provisions see httpwwwdoletagov whatsnewwia20sidebyside20short20final2012203pdf 2 the cap would have applied to all federal funds allotted to program but the funds could be contributed only from the administrative funds crs3 organizations communitybased organizations economic development agencies and one stop partners both bills would have eliminated the requirement that representatives of the onestop partners be included on the local wibs onestop partners are required to be members of the state wibs under current law each local board is required to establish youth council as subgroup of the wib to develop the youth portion of the local plan to recommend eligible providers of youth activities and to coordinate youth activities in the local area both bills would have made youth councils optional state and national programs under current law there are three state administered programs youth adult and dislocated worker each of which has its own state grant both bills would have retained the youth program but refocused it as described below the house version of hr 1261 would have created consolidated adult program by combining the state grants for the wia adult and dislocated worker programs with the state reemployment grants and state employment service grants both of which are authorized under the wagnerpeyser act 29 usc 49 et seq the senate version would have maintained separate programs there are several national programs under current law such as job corps youth httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21484 opportunity grants yog and programs for native americans migrant and seasonal farmworkers and veterans both bills would have retained these national programs except for yogs which would have been replaced with youth challenge grants to assist youth in acquiring necessary skills credentials and employment experience yogs have not been funded since fy2003 state and local allocations separate formulas are currently used to allocate funds to states for adult activities dislocated worker activities the employment service and reemployment grants3 under the house version of hr 1261 these four funding streams would have been combined into one formula grant for revised adult program funds for this consolidated adult program would have been allocated to states by two part formula the first part would have allocated 26 of the funds based primarily on states prior year share of the wagnerpeyser state allotments the second part would have allocated 74 of the remainder on formula based on states relative4 number of unemployed individuals relative excess number of unemployed individuals more than 45 of the civilian labor force and relative number of lowincome adults each states total allotment would have been the sum of its allotment under the two parts except that state would have received less than it would have under the four separate unconsolidated programs if those formulas had been used for the year and unless dol determined otherwise state would have received 3 more in total than it would have under the four separate formulas the senate version of hr 1261 would not have created consolidated adult program funding streams would have remained separate the funding formula for adult 3 for detailed description of how funds are allotted to states for adults dislocated workers and employment services see httpwwwdoletagovbudgetwiaformdescpdf 4 the word relative as used in this report means the number of individuals in state compared to the total number in all states crs4 activities5 would have been modified version of the current formula6 and the dislocated worker formula would have been the same as current law under the house version of hr 1261 of the funds allocated to the states for the consolidated adult program the governor could have reserved up to 50 for statewide activities7 under the senate version of the funds allocated to states for adult activities the governor could have reserved not more than 15 for statewide activities the same as current law under the house version of hr 1261 of the funds allocated to local areas for the consolidated adult program 85 would have been allocated based on statutory formula and 15 would have been allocated to local areas based on formula developed in consultation with state and local wibs under the senate version of the funds allocated to local areas for adult activities not less than 70 would have been allocated based on statutory formula and up to 30 could have been allocated on formula developed by the state board the same as current law under current law funds to states for youth activities are allotted by formula based httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21484 on states relative number of unemployed individuals residing in areas of substantial unemployment at least 65 relative excess number of unemployed individuals and relative number of lowincome youth of the funds allocated to the state the governor can reserve not more than 15 for statewide activities the remainder of the funds are allocated to the local areas under both bills the funds would have been allocated to states using the current law formula except that any funds in excess of the amount available for states for fy2003 ie approximately 977 million would have been allocated by formula based on states relative number of individuals in the civilian labor force ages 16 through 19 in the house version and ages 16 through 21 in the senate version relative number of unemployed individuals and relative number of economically disadvantaged individuals ages 16 though 21 under the house version of hr 1261 of the funds allocated for youth activities to the states the governor could have reserved up to 10 for statewide activities under the senate version up to 15 could have been reserved the same as current law under current law of the remainder 70 is allocated based on statutory formula and up to 5 under the senate bill the formula would have been based on 40 of the relative number of unemployed individuals residing in areas of substantial unemployment at least 65 rather than onethird under current law 25 on the basis of the relative number of individuals in the civilian labor force which is not currently factor and 35 on the basis of the relative number of lowincome adults rather than onethird 6 the secretary would have been required to allocate up to 20 million from discretionary funds for dislocated workers to states that would receive less funds under the new formula than they received in program year 2003 7 of this amount not less than half would have been distributed to local areas by formula to support the provision of core services eg outreach and job search assistance through onestop delivery systems states could employ state personnel to provide the services in local areas in consultation with local boards crs5 30 is allocated on formula developed by the state board under both bills 80 would have been allocated to local areas based on statutory formula and 20 would have been allocated to local areas based on formula developed in consultation with state and local wibs youth activities under current law at least 30 of the funds allocated to local areas have to be spent on activities for outofschool youth under the house version of hr 1261 at least 70 of the funds would have been spent on outofschool youth under the senate version at least 40 of the funds would have been spent on outof school youth adult activities under current law three levels of services core intensive and training are provided to individuals sequentially to be eligible to receive intensive services such as comprehensive assessments and development of individual employment plans an individual must first receive at least one core service such as job search and have been unable to either obtain employment or retain employment that allows for self sufficiency to be eligible to receive training services such as occupational skills training and onthe job training an individual must have received at least one intensive service httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21484 and must have been unable to obtain or retain employment both bills would have modified this sequencing of services to provide that individuals could receive intensive or training services if they were unlikely or unable to obtain or retain employment through core or intensive services respectively under the house version unemployed individuals would have been eligible to receive intensive or training services if the onestop operator determined they would be unlikely or unable to obtain suitable employment or in the case of an employed person retain suitable employment under the senate version unemployed individuals would have been eligible to receive intensive or training services if the onestop operator determined they would be unlikely or unable to obtain employment that leads to self sufficiency or wages comparable to or higher than previous employment or in the case of an employed person leads to selfsufficiency under current law and the senate version of hr 1261 if local area determines that funds for adult activities are limited priority for intensive and training services must be given to recipients of public assistance and lowincome individuals participating in the adult program the house version would have added priority for intensive and training services for unemployed individuals in its consolidated adult program both bills would have permitted local wibs to use 10 of their allotment for adult activities for incumbent worker training programs to assist workers in obtaining the skills necessary to retain employment and avert layoffs8 an employer match would have been required training as in current law would have been provided primarily though individual training accounts which would have been called career scholarship accounts in the senate version the onestop operator is responsible for arranging payment to eligible training 8 under current law statewide activities may include training for incumbent workers but there is similar provision for local areas crs6 providers current law stipulates specific procedures states must follow for determining provider eligibility including specific cost and performance information that providers must collect under both bills current statutory requirements would have been eliminated and governors would have been responsible for establishing criteria and procedures regarding the eligibility of providers local wibs and onestop delivery systems would have continued to retain list of eligible providers and participants would have continued to choose providers from this list in consultation with case manager performance accountability under current law there are four core indicators of performance for youth ages 19 through 21 adults and dislocated workers entry into unsubsidized employment retention in employment six months after job entry earnings received six months after job entry and attainment of recognized credential there are also two measures of customer satisfaction one for individuals and one for employers the house version of hr 1261 would have eliminated the measure of attainment of credential and replaced it with measure of the efficiency of the program the house version also would have eliminated the current measures of customer satisfaction the senate version would have modified the earnings measure to be an increase in earnings both bills would have eliminated the application of these indicators to youth ages 19 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21484 through 21 under current law there are three indicators of performance for youth ages 14 through 18 attainment of basic skills attainment of secondary school diplomas and their equivalents and placement and retention in such things as postsecondary education advanced training military service and employment both bills would have modified current core indicators of performance to among other things apply to youth of all ages and to include measure of literacy or numeracy skills or gains the house version also would have included measure of the efficiency of the program nondiscrimination under current law discrimination regarding participation benefits and employment because of race color religion sex national origin age disability or political affiliation is prohibited the house version of hr 1261 would have continued these prohibitions but it would have added an exemption for religious organizations with respect to their employment of individuals of particular religion the senate version would not have changed current law authorization under the house version of hr 1261 youth activities would have been authorized at 1250000000 for fy2004 and for such sums as necessary for each of the fiscal years 2005 through 2009 adult activities would have been authorized at 3079800000 for fy2004 and for such sums as necessary for each of the fiscal years 2005 through 2009 under the senate version youth adult and dislocated worker programs would have been authorized for such sums as necessary for each of the fiscal years 2004 through 2009
