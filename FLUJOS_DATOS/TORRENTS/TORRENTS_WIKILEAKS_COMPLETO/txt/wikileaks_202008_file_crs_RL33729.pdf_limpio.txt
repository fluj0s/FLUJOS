of march 31 2007 and replaces it with the position of fema administrator82 it could be argued that the act also bolished the position of under secretary for preparedness upon the statutes enac tment on october 4 2006 by striking subsection of hsa that established the under secretary for information analysis and infrastructure protection iaip83 this argument rests on an understanding of the evolution of the under secretary for iaip into the under secretary for preparedness during the reorganizations of dhs under taken by secretary chertoff in 2005 and 2006 the portfolio of the under secretary for iaip was changed and the position was renamed as under secretary for preparedness84 according to this argument striking the provision establishing the underlying position under secretary for iaip would eliminate the position into which it evolved the under secretary for preparedness however provision of hsa an ppropriations act provision and another provision of the postkatrina act draw into question whether or not it was the intention of congress to eliminate this position the under secretary for iaip was established as an advice and consent positi on by two provisions of hsa and one of these is unaffected by the new law85 arguably the position continues to exist by virtue of this provision even if the other provision is stricken in addition it could be argued that provision of the depar tment of homeland s ecurity appropriations act for 2007 within which the postkatrina act is nested envi sions continuation of that office it provides for salaries and expenses of the immediate office of the under secretary for preparedness 86 finally the postkatrina act charges the under secretary of preparedness with taking such actions as are necessary to provide for the
