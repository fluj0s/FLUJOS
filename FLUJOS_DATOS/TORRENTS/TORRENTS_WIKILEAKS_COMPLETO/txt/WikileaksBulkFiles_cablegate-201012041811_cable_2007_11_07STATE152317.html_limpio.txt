request in september during their meeting at the apec summit in sydney australia president bush discussed with chinese president hu strong concerns relating to the ongoing transshipment via beijing of key ballistic missile parts from north korea to irans missile program president bush pledged to respond to president hus requests for further information embassy should on november 3 at the most effective level possible deliver the nonpaper in 8 which relates to specific time sensitive information about an imminent transshipment in addition at the earliest opportunity post should deliver the nonpaper in 9 to mfa at the highest level possible preferably by the ambassador since this is in response to presidentiallevel discussions objectives 2 srel china post should this point for november 3 delivery request china to stop an imminent shipment to irans ballistic missile program this is the same cargo that the ambassador shared about on october 25 ref it is now scheduled to leave beijing airport on november 4 this point for november 3 delivery note the importance of this demarche since it relates to topic discussed by presidents bush and hu in sydney embassy should further note that the embassy will be seeking an appointment at the highest level possible to convey more extensive presentation on this topic of ballistic missile parts from north korea to iran remind chinese officials that president bush has been personally engaged on the issue of the transshipment of ballistic missile parts between north korea and iran via beijing and that he raised this issue with president hu at the apec summit seek information on the steps china has taken since the apec discussion to address this issue and impress on them the necessity for china to take immediate strong action stress that the credibility of security council actions must be maintained by vigorous implementation by member states of unsc resolutions calling for chapter vii sanctions particularly 1718 1737 and 1747 indicate that the us believes that the proliferation of missile technology between north korea and iran will increase and that these two countries will attempt to conduct these transfers through chinese territory emphasize the need to inspect cargo and personal goods on regularly scheduled flights transiting beijing from north korea to iran in order to detect and deter these shipments explain to chinese officials that the us carefully reviews the intelligence material that we have on shipments before we share it and we ask that chinese authorities respect this and act on our information accordingly and appropriately indicate that the united states believes that we can work together cooperatively and effectively on these issues express our willingness to continue to share as much information as possible to assist chinas efforts to uphold these security council resolutions background ballistic missile parts shipped via beijing between north korea and iran 3 srel china iran and north korea have continued their longstanding cooperation on ballistic missile technology via air shipments of ballisticmissile related items we assess that some of these shipments consist of ballistic missile jet vanes that frequently transit beijing on regularly scheduled flights on air koryo and iran air we believe that the shahid bagheri industrial group sbig is the probable end user for these parts sbig is listed in the annex to unscr 1737 and these jet vanes are controlled under item 10a2 of the missile technology control regime and item 6 of chinas missile related export control regulations moreover unscrs 1718 and 1737 prohibit the transfer to or from north korea or iran respectively of jet vanes and any other item listed in unsc document s2006815 these shipments therefore represent violations of unscrs 1718 and 1737 4 srel china the us has raised this issue with china at the highest levels several times in the last few months in may 2007 the united states informed china of imminent shipments on three separate occasions refs ab and c though chinese officials informed embassy beijing that chinas investigations have found evidence of these transfers it appears that these shipments did occur and are continuing to transit via beijing in addition this issue was raised by isn pdas patricia mcnerney during bilateral nonproliferation talks in august 2007 ref d the deputy secretary also raised this issue with executive vice foreign minister evfm dai bingguo via during telephone conversation in august finally in september 2007 president bush discussed this issue with chinese president hu at the apec summit in sydney the two leaders agreed that the usg would provide the prc with further information on these transfers 5 srel china on october 25 the us provided prc officials with detailed information including the airway bill and flight number of another imminent shipment of military related goods from north korea to iran via beijing this shipment was also assessed as destined for irans solid propellant missile development organization the shahid bagheri industries group sbig we now have information that the goods will be shipped on november 4 and insist on substantive response from china to this information 6 srel china our information indicates that at least 10 air shipments of jet vanes have transited beijing thus far and that these shipments will not only continue but will also grow in volume we have encouraged the chinese to undertake frequent inspections of cargo on air koryo or iran air flights transiting beijing from north korea to both deter and detect these shipments 7 srel china the department is seeking both immediate action on this new information and strategic approach with regards to this critical issue we assess that the best way to prevent these shipments in the future is for chinese authorities to take action such as those identified in 9 that will make the beijing airport less hospitable transfer point nonpaper on urgent matter to be delivered november 3 8 srel china begin points last week we raised with you information regarding north korean plans to send shipment probably for irans ballistic missile program to iran we believe the cargo is intended for irans shahid bagheri industrial group sbig which is responsible for irans solidpropellant ballistic missile program you had requested additional information we now have reason to believe that the items above will be shipped to iran via scheduled iran air flight on november 4 if these goods are missilerelated north korea is prohibited under unscr 1718 from exporting missilerelated items and member states are prohibited from importing those items in addition north korea would potentially be precluded under unscr 1737 from transferring these items to iran if they are among the missilerelated components included in s2006815 or if north korea or china determines that they would contribute to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems moreover sbig is designated in united nations security council resolution unscr 1737 and as such is subject to the mandatory asset freeze called for in the resolution with these concerns in mind we are asking that chinese authorities investigate this shipment and prohibit it from proceeding to iran begin nonpaper for delivery by ambassador 9 srel china begin points over the past several months we have raised with chinese officials the problem of ballistic missilerelated transfers between iran and north korea being transshipped through china president bush raised us concerns on this matter with president hu during the apec summit in sydney demonstrating the importance of the issue to the united states in response to president hus request for additional details we are providing you further information regarding these activities specifically we are urgently providing information regarding an imminent shipment of serious concern north korea is prohibited under unscr 1718 from exporting missile related items and member states are prohibited from importing those items in addition north korea would potentially be precluded under unscr 1737 from transferring these items to iran if they are among the missilerelated components included in s2006815 or if north korea or china determines that they would contribute to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems moreover sbig is designated in united nations security council resolution unscr 1737 and as such is subject to the mandatory asset freeze called for in the resolution with these concerns in mind we are insisting that chinese authorities urgently investigate this shipment and prohibit it from proceeding to iran we are very concerned that north korean shipments of jet vanes occur on regularly scheduled commercial air flights transiting through beijing we believe this has been the case on about 10 flights these items are likely intended for irans solid propellant missile development organization the shahid bagheri industries group sbig these cargo shipments probably include front companies we have identified large number of shipments beginning late last year of what are probably ballistic missilerelated items that have transited beijing and we would like to share further information on these shipments 14 december 2006 delegation from sbig returned from pyongyang probably via beijing and transported what we assess to be jet vanes for solid propellant medium range ballistic missile mrbm under development in iran on or about 15 january 2007 north korea delivered what were probably jet vanes for irans developmental solid propellant mrbm to sbig via beijing on board regularlyscheduled commercial passenger flights on or around 23 january 2007 north korea delivered what were probably jet vanes for irans developmental solid propellant mrbm to sbig via beijing on board regularlyscheduled commercial passenger flights on or about 16 may 2007 an air shipment composed of four what were probably jet vanes from north korea to iran for sbig was scheduled to depart north korea and transit beijing via regularlyscheduled commercial passenger flights on or about 24 may 2007 an air shipment composed of five what were probably jet vanes from north korea to iran for sbig was scheduled to depart north korea and transit beijing via regularlyscheduled commercial passenger flights on or about 6 june 2007 an air shipment composed of four what were probably jet vanes from north korea to iran for sbig was scheduled to depart north korea and transit beijing via regularlyscheduled commercial passenger flights on or about 12 june 2007 an air shipment composed of five what were probably jet vanes from north korea to iran for sbig was scheduled to depart north korea and transit beijing via regularly scheduled commercial passenger flights on or about 14 june 2007 an air shipment composed of three what were probably jet vanes from north korea to iran for sbig was scheduled to depart north korea and transit beijing via regularly scheduled commercial passenger flights on or about 14 july 2007 an air shipment composed of ten what were probably jet vanes from north korea to iran for sbig was scheduled to depart north korea and transit beijing via regularlyscheduled commercial passenger flights on or about 26 july 2007 an air shipment possibly composed of an unknown number of jet vanes from north korea to iran for sbig was scheduled to depart north korea and transit beijing via regularly scheduled commercial passenger flights on or about 22 august an air shipment possibly composed of one jet vane from north korea to iran for sbig was scheduled to depart north korea and transit beijing via regularlyscheduled commercial passenger flights we believe that the number of jet vanes sent to iran will increase dramatically in the future to date we believe that about 40 probable jet vanes have been sent from north korea to iran the contract for these components called for total number of 500 and we assess that shipments of these may increase to rate of 100 160 per month in addition our information indicates that second order of 1500 components possibly additional jet vanes was agreed to in december of last year we believe that this trade will continue to utilize regularly scheduled commercial passenger flights as we have discussed on several occasions iran also has been seeking probable tungstencopper alloy plates from chinas dalian sunny industries also known as limmt dalian sunny industries shipped part of an order for this material in september these plates are suitable for iranian domestic production of jet vanes or as an insulator for ballistic missile components iran could be seeking these plates in case north korea is unable to provide the quantity or quality of jet vanes required we urge you to prevent such shipments via whatever action you deem appropriate including frequent inspection of iran air and air koryo flights the use of regularlyscheduled commercial passenger flights indicates that frequent regular inspections of iran air flights and air koryo flights are in order and would help deter these shipments in the future we will continue to provide you with relevant information to help end this proliferation reporting requirement and poc 10 u please report delivery of cable and any
