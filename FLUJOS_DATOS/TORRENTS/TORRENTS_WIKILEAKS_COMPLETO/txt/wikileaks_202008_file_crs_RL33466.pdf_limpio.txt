clean water act in 1987 pl 1004 since then the environmenta l protection agency epa states and others have been working to implement the many program changes and additions mandated in the law at issue today mo re than 30 years after enactment of the core law is what progress is being made to achieve its goals in general states and environmental groups fault epa for dela ys in issuing guidance and providing assistance to carry out the law epa and others are critical of states in turn for not reaching beyond conventional knowledge and approaches to address their water quality problems environmental advocates have been criticized for insufficient recognition of epas and states need for flexibility to implement the act finally congress has been criticized for not providi ng adequate resources to meet epa and state needs appropriations for clean wate r programs especially water infrastructure are continuing issue three issues have predominated recently in connection with implementation of the law the first involves funding to construct municipal wastewater treatment plants under the state revolving fund s rf provisions of the 1987 amendments budgetary constraints on federal aid for wa stewater treatment and large remaining funding needs are l ongstanding concerns the pr esidents fy2007 budget requested 688 million for these srf grants 22 less than fy2006 funding and in may 2006 the house passed legislation providing the level requested by the president hr 5386 the senate appropriations committ ee approved the same level in june final action did not occur before the 109th congress adjourned in december thus carrying over this legislative activity to the beginning of the 110th congress the second issue involves progress in implementing the nonpoint pollution management provisions dded in 1987 states have developed management programs describing methods that will be used to reduce nonpoint pollution which may be responsible for as much as 50 of the nations re maining water quality problems most observers agree that implementation of nonpoint source control measures is significantly hindered by limited resources epa has adopted program guidance intended to give states more fl exibility and to speed up progress in nonpoint source control the third issue is imp acts of requirements under current law for states to develop total maximum daily loads tmdls in order to address uncontrolled sources of impairment in waters that have not yet achieved water quality standards in addition other issues exis t that are important to implementation and attaining the goals and objectives of the act they include efforts to manage overflows of untreated wastewater from municipal sewer systems and questions about the effectiveness and costs of the nations wetlands protection efforts particularly in relation to the wetlands permit program in s ection 404 of the act congressional oversight of these issues in the 110th congress is

beginning of the 110th congress in 2003 epa promulgated revised rules that govern waste discharges from large animal feeding operations to the nation s waters those revised rules were challenged by multiple parties and in 2005 federal court issued ruling that upheld major parts of the rules vacated ot her parts and remande d still other parts to epa for clarification in june 2006 epa pr oposed revisions to the rules in response to the courts decision and expects to pr omulgate revised regu lations by june 2007 in 2005 congress enacted comp rehensive energy policy legislation hr 6 pl 10958

law concerned with polluting activity in the nations streams lakes and estuaries originally enacted in 1948 it was totally revised by amendments in 1972 pl 92 500 that gave the act its current form nd spelled out ambitious programs for water quality improvements that ar now being put in place by industries and cities congress made certain finetuning ame ndments in 1977 pl 95217 and 1981 pl 97117 and enacted comprehensive amendments in 1987 pl 1004 the act consists of two major parts regulatory provisions that impose progressively more stringen t requirements on industries nd cities in order to meet the statutory goal of zero discharge of pollutants and provisions that authorizehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33466crs2 1 for additional information see crs report rl30030 clean water act summary

wate r quality standards both major parts are supported by research activities au thorized in the law plus permit and penalty provisions for enforcement programs are administered by the environmental protection agency epa wh ile state and local governments have the principal daytoday responsib ility for implementing the law1 the last major amendments to the law were contained in the water quality act of 1987 pl 1004 these amendments culminated six years of congressional efforts to extend and revise the act and were the most comprehensive amendments to it since 1972 they recognized that spite much progress significant water quality problems persisted among its ma ny provisions the 1987 legislation 1 established comprehensive program for controlling toxic pollutant discharges beyond that already provided in the act to respond to socalled t oxic hot spots 2 added program requiring states to deve lop and implement pr ograms to control nonpoint sources of pollution or rainfall runoff from farm and urban areas plus construction forestry and min ing sites 3 authorized total of 18 billion for wastewater treatment assi stance under combination of the acts traditional construction grants program and new program of grants to capitalize state revolving funds 4 authorized or modified numbe r of programs to ddress water pollution problems in diverse geographic areas such as coastal estuaries the great lakes and the chesapeake bay and 5 revised many of the acts regulatory permit and enforcement programs congressional activity after pl 1004 congressional oversight of water quality issues was limited immediately after enactment of pl 1004 subcommittees held general oversight hearings as well as several hearings on individual issues wetla nds protection chesapeake bay programs and toxics contamination of great lake s waters but reserved ex tensive review and oversight until implementation had been underway for some time epa states industry and other c itizens continue to implement the 1987 legislation including meeting the numerous requirements and deadlines in it three sets of issues have been the focus of ttention regarding the pace and effectiveness of implementation the toxic pollutant control provisions nonpoint pollution management provisions and the state revolving fund provisions to transfer wastewater treatment funding responsibility to the states after 1994 attention has also focused on the costeffectiveness of clean water requirements and flexibility of implementation implementation issues discussed belo w were the basis for legislation to reauthorize the clean water act durin g the 103rd congress committees held hearings in 1993 and the senate envir onment and public works committee

comprehensive reauthorization bill s 2093 in may 1994 legislation also was introduced in the house but further action occurred because of controversies specific to the act and the pending bills as well as controversies over regulatory relief issues that became barriers to number of bills in 1994 in the 104th congress the house moved quickly on clean water act legislation approving comprehensive r eauthorization bill in may 1995 hr 961 would have amended many of the regulatory and standa rds provisions of the law required epa to use extensive new risk assessment and costbenefit analysis procedures and increased flexibility with regulatory relief from current clean water programs however the sena did not take up the clean water act during the 104th congress thus legislation was enacted 1997 marked the 25year anniversary of the 1972 clean water act amendments which established the goals objectives and structure that continue to guide the law today in the 105th congress major committee activity over the act occurred either in the house or the senate since the 104th congress attention has focused on individual program areas of the law co mprehensive reauthorization legislation has been introduced however activity on bills dealing with specific water quality issues has occurred congress passed bill to strengthen protection of coastal recreation waters through upgraded water quality standards and coastal waters monitoring programs pl 106284 and so passed bill reau thorizing several existing cwa programs ie chesapeake bay clean lakes and the national estuary program pl 106457 further congre ss passed bill to authorize cwa grant funding for wet weather sewerage project s included as provision of pl 106554 fy2001 consolidated appropriations the 107th congress approved the great lakes legacy act pl 107303 which authorized 200 million for epa to carry out projects to remediate sediment cont amination in the great lakes the 108th congress enacted legislation amending the act to extend the national estuary program through fy2010 pl 108399 more generally following the septembe r 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon congressi onal attention has focused on security preparedness and emergency response issues among the many topics of interest is protection of the nations water infrastructure facilities both wastewater and drinking water from possible physical damage biol ogicalchemical attacks and cyber disruption2 policymakers are considering number of legislative options in this area including enhanced physical security communication and coordination and research physical security of wastewat er treatment plant ope rations is one issue under consideration in the 108th congress the house passe d legislation to provide 200 million in grants for security activities at wastewater trea tment plants hr 866 similar senate bill was approved by the senate environment and public works committee s 1039 further acti on occurred due in part to concerns expressed by some that the legislation would not require that vulnerability assessments be mandatory and be submitted to epa as is the case with assessmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33466crs4 3 see crs report rl33465 clean water act review of issues in the 109th congress by claudia copeland 4 us environmental protection agency the national

utilities re quired by the 2002 bioterrori sm preparedness act pl 107288 the issue again received attention in the 109th congress3 although much progress has been made in achieving the amb itious goals established in the law 30plus years ago to restore the maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of rive rs lakes and coastal waters problems persist based on the limited water quality m onitoring that is done by states epa reported in the 2000 national water quality inventory re port that 39 of assessed river and stream miles and 45 of assessed lake acres do not meet applicable water quality standards and were found to be impaired for one or more desired uses4 the types of remaining water quality problems are diverse ranging from runoff from farms and ranches city st reets and other diffuse s ources to metals especially mercury organic and inorganic toxic subs tances discharged from factories sewage treatment plants and nonpoint sources the bush administration has been revi ewing number of current clean water programs and rules but has proposed fe w new initiatives in january 2003 the agency announced water quality trad ing policy intended as an innovative approach to assist industry and muni cipalities in meetin g clean water act obligations trading allows one source to meet regulatory requirements by using pollutant reductions created by another s ource that has lower pollution control costs the policy revised may 2002 proposal which reflected lessons learned from similar policy issued by the clinton administration in 1996 water quality or effluent trading projects have occurred in the united states since the early 1980s5 congressional oversight of the acts implementation during this time has been wideranging extending from review of the state and needs of the nations wastewater infrastructure to cwa enforcement implementation of wetlands protection and regulatory efforts and examination of various epa policies and programs as result of the 2006 midterm elections and changed leadership in the house and senate many obser vers anticipate that the 110th congress will pursue vigorous oversight of clean water and othe r environmental programs the direction and agenda for such activities is uncertain state revolving fund program meeting the nations needs to build upg rade rebuild and repair wastewater infrastructure is significant element in achieving the clean water acts water quality objectives the acts program of financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment plant constr uction is key contributor to that

overview and background by claudia copelandhas provided more than 76 billion to assi st wastewater trea tment construction but funding needs remain very high an dditional 181 billion nationwide for all types of projects eligible for funding under th act according to the most recent needs survey estimate by epa and the states published in august 20036 in september 2002 epa released study called the gap analysis that assesses the difference between current spending for wastewater in frastructure and total funding needs both capital and operation and maintenance7 in that report epa estimated that over the next two decades the united states needs to spend nearly 390 billion to replace existing wastewater infrastruct ure systems and to build new ones funding needs for operation and maintenance not eligible for clean water act funding are an additional 148 billion the agency estimated according to the gap analysis if there is increase in investment th ere will be about 6 billion gap between current annual capital expenditures for wa stewater treatment 13 billion annually and projected spending needs the study also estimated that if wastewater spending increases by 3 annually the gap would shrink by nearly 90 to about 1 billion annually at issue has been what should be the federal role in assisting states and cities especially in view of ch high projected funding needs debate over the nature of the na tions efforts regarding wastewater infrastructure was central and controversia l part of the 1987 amendments to the act the amendments extended through fy1990 th traditional title ii program of grants for sewage treatment project construction under which th federal share was 55 of project costs the 1987 law initiated prog ram of grants to capitalize state water pollution control revolving funds srfs or loan programs in new title vi states are required to deposit an amount equal to at least 20 of the federal capitalization grant in the fund established under title vi under the revolving fund concept monies used for wastewater trea tment construction woul d be repaid by loan recipients to the states repayment was not required for grants under the title ii program to be recycled for future construction in other communities thus providing an ongoing source of financing the expectation in 1987 was that the federal contributions to srfs would assist in making transition to full state and local financing by fy1995 although most states believe that the srf is working well early funding and administrative problems ve delayed the anticipated shift to full state responsibility thus srf issues have been prominent on the clean water act reauthorization agenda in recent congresses8 srf monies may be used for certain types of financial activity including loans for as much as 100 of project costs at or below market interest rates including interestfree loans to buy or refinance c ities debt obligation or as source of revenue or security for payment of princi pal and interest on stateissued bond srf monies also may be used to provide an guarantees or credit enhancement for localities loans made by state from its srf are to be

funding unde r title ii traditional grants program and title vi capitalization grants for revolving loan programs9 one issue of continuing interest is impacts on small communities these entities in particular have found it difficult to partic ipate in the srf loan program since many are characterized by narrow or weak tax bases limited or access to capital markets lower relative household inco mes and higher per capita needs they often find it harder to borrow to meet their capital needs and pay relatively high premiums to do so meeting the special needs of small towns through reestablished grant program other funding s ource or loan program with special rules has been an issue of interest to congress congressional oversight of wastewater srf issues has focused on several points including the fact that many small communities have found it difficult to participate in the srf loan program and the lack of funds for highcost categories of projects such as correcting combined sewer overflows although there has been some criticism of the srf program and debate continues over specific concerns such as small community impacts the basi c approach is well supported in congress

or rainfall runoff from farm and urban areas as well as construction forest ry and mining sites previously they had largely focused on controlling point sources while helping states and localities to plan for manageme nt of diverse nonpoint sources yet as industrial and municipal sources ve abated pollution uncontrolled nonpoint sources have become relatively larger portion of remaining water quality problems perhaps contributing as much as 50 of the nations water pollution thus the addition of section 319 to the act was inte nded to strengthen the law regarding this major contributor to water pollution which previously had received limited attention at issue today is what progress is bein g made to manage nonpoint source pollution and what additional efforts may be needed involving section 319 or other public and private activities some observers are critical of the largely voluntary nature of the section 319 program consistin g of all carrot but stick while others argue that the types of individual nd management decisions that are needed to manage nonpoint source pollution cannot be regulate d in the same ways that industrial sources are controlled states were required to identify waters not expected to meet water quality standards because of nonpoint source pollu tion and to implement plans for managing pollution from runoff federal grants to taling 400 million were au thorized to cover as much as 60 of the costs of imp lementing states management plan the funding issue has become more urgent as states moved from assessment and plan development to management ce congress intended that section 319 funds be used primarily to imp lement nonpoint pollution controls on the ground epa has urged states to use portion of monies th at they receive under section 106 of the act water quality program assistance grants for nonpoint source activities but doinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33466crs8 so utilizes money otherwise needed for core state efforts such as permit issuance monitoring enforcement etc several cerns have been raised about the section 319 program adequacy of plans whether state plans have comprehensively addressed nonpoint pollution problems is lingering question some environmental groups criticize epa for providing inadequate guidance on met hods or management practices to advance control of nonpoi nt sources beyond k nown problems and existing implementation steps such as voluntary compliance and public education moreover some believe that states shoul d be required to repeat the nonpoint source assessments which were onetimeonly activ ities under the 1987 law in order to reflect improvements in technical and scientific information funding precise estimates of the cost to manage nonpoint source pollution are not available because so much depends on the sitespecific nature of problems and solutions however in 1994 epa estima ted that current and planned spending by private sources states and cities under provisions of current law is between 750 million and 11 billion per year without ad equate funding to implement state management plans it is doubtful that much will be achieved under section 319 to control nonpoint source pollution because agricultural activities are known to be significant source of nonpoint pollution nationwide the adequacy of effo rts to address these sources has received much attention questions have been ra ised about the epa state grant programs efficacy and overlap with farm bill c onservation funding leading to proposed reductions in fy2004 and fy2005 ppropriations for section 319 funds in particular the white house office of management and budget omb found that epa had not demonstrated results under the program and has urged the agency to shift its focus away from implementing projects in agricultural areas and toward implementing plans in impaired waters state officials have been concerned that omb is not fully aware of the extent to which section 319 funds address range of nonpoint pollution control needs beyond the agricultural sector program changes in the mid1990s epa and states negotiated changes intended to give the 319 program new frame work by giving states more flexibility as result in 1996 epa issued revised guidance concerning state management of nonpoint source programs that is intended to recognize that federal and state processes need to be streamlined to increase program effectiveness and to speed progress towards solving nonpoint pollution problems the revised guidance outlines nine key elements to be reflected in state programs eg strong partnerships with stakeholders explicit short and longterm goals for protecting surface and ground waters states that meet the nine criteria can be designated as leadership states making them eligible for incentives such as multiyear grants reduced amount and frequency of reporting and selfassessment by states themselves these incentives contrast with the previous progra m approach in which states competed for grants and those that did not meet particular requirements received less grant money significance for tmdls attention has focused on nonpoint source management efforts as result of recent emphasis by epa and states on meeting tmdl requirements see tmdl require ments next scrutiny of nonpointhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33466crs9 pollution problems and how they are being ddressed has intensif ied as policymakers and program officials assess additional steps to continue progress towards the acts water quality goals for several years epa has been explicitly linking implementation of section 319 with tmdl activities for example in 2001 epa published guidance saying that grants awarded under section 319 should have concentrated focus on the development and implementation of tmdls for nonpoint sources of pollution althoug h funds will still be awarded to activities other than tmdls however states and agricultural interests criticized the guidance as being too restrictive and in august 2002 epa modified the guidance which continues to encourage development of nonpoint source tmdls but gives states more flexibility to do so especially in areas that lack formally established tmdls since fy2001 100 million of section 319 grant funds w hich totaled 204 million in fy2006 for example is being devoted annually to devel oping and implementing nonpoint source tmdls total maximum daily load tmdl requirements in the 1972 clean water act congress recognized that in many cases pollutant controls implemented by industry and muni cipalities would be in sufficient to attain water quality standards due in part to pollutant contributions from unregulated sources thus section 303d of the clean wa ter act requires states to identify water segments that remain impaired even after application of pollution control technology and develop total maximum daily load s tmdls that set the maximum amount of pollution that water body can receive without violating wa ter quality standards if state fails to do so epa is required to develop priority list for the state and make its own tmdl determin ation most states have lacked the resources to do tmdl analyses which involve complex assessment of point and nonpoint sources and mathematical modeling and epa has both been reluct ant to override states and has also lacked resources to do the analyses thus for many years there was little implementation of the provision that c ongress enacted in 1972 at issue today is continuing controversy over implementation of this program which is intended to address uncontrolled sources of water quality impairment and efforts to revise the rules and requirements for it in recent years national and local envi ronmental groups have filed lawsuits in 38 states against epa and states for failure to fulfill requirements of the act of the suits tried or settled to date 22 have resulted in court orders requiring epa to develop tmdls expeditiously epa and st ate officials have been concerned about diverting resources from other highpriority water quality activities in order to meet the courts orders in 1996 epa created an advisory committee to solicit advice on the tmdl problem recommendations from the advisory committee formed the basis of program changes that epa proposed in august 1999 this proposal set forth criteria for states territories and authorized indian tribes to identify impaired waters and establish all tmdls within 15 year s it proposed more comprehensivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33466crs10 11 for additional information see crs

congressional hearings were held during the 106th congress by four separate house nd senate committees public and congressional pre ssure on epa to revise or withdraw the tmdl proposal entirely was great several bills to modify epas tmdl proposals or delay implementation of final rules were introduced but none was enacted tmdl issues also were addressed in fy2001 appropriations bills in july 2000 congress approved an fy2001 military cons truction and emergency supplemental appropriations bill that included provisi on to prevent epa from spending any funds in fy2000 or fy2001 to finalize or implement new tmdl rules president clinton signed the bill in spite of the tmdl restriction which the administration opposed pl 106246 however the epa adminis trator signed the new rules two days before the president signed the bill but delayed the effective date until october 2001 when the limitation in pl 106246 would expi re epas signing of the rule before the rider took effect d to more criticism the fy2001 appropriations act providing funds for epa pl 106377 included report language ma ndating studies by the national academy of sciences nas and epa on the scientific basis of the tmdl program and on the potential costs to states and businesses of implementing the revised tmdl rules the nas report examining the role of science in the tmdl program was issued in june 200112 it did not specifically analyze th july 2000 revised regulations the nas panel concluded that scientific knowledge exists to move forward with the tmdl program and recommended that epa and states use adap tive implementation for tmdl development in many cases the report said water quality problems and solutions are obvious and should proceed wit hout complex analysis in other cases solutions are more complex and require different level of understanding and something like phased imple mentation house tran sportation subcommittee held hearing on the nas report in june 2001 in august 2001 epa issued draft report on costs of the 2000 tmdl program it timated that average annual costs to states and epa of developing tmdls coul d be 6369 million while implementation costs for pollutant sources

that it would delay the effective date of the 2000 ru until april 30 2003 to allow for further review that announcement came after federal court gran ted the administrations request for similar 18month suspension of litigation which challenged the regulation nearly dozen interest groups sued epa over various parts of the tmdl rule house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee held an oversight hearing in november 2001 concerning epas plans to re vise the rule most recently on march 19 2003 epa withdrew the july 2000 tmdl rule 68 federal register 13607 epa officials said that additional time beyond may 2003 was needed to decide whether and how to revise the current pr ogram and that allowing the rule to take effect would have disrupted ongoing review efforts in the interim and continuing for the present time current program requi rements under existing regulations issued in 1992 and courtsanc tioned tmdl schedules remain in place having withdrawn the 2000 rule epa s reportedly been considering other options including initiating an entirely new rule but specific plans have been announced in mid2002 epa developed draft revised rule that it informally circulated among interest groups and fe deral agencies for many months but formal proposal has occurred one epa view widely reported is that new rule is not essential because epa be lieves that states are and w ill continue to improve the pace at which tmdls are established even under existing rules most environmentalists say that short of retaining the 2000 ru the best action would be to leave the 1992 rules in place because desp ite flaws those rules are preferable to new rule that might significantly weaken the program states cities and industry groups have urged epa to develop new rule with more flexibility than either the 1992 regulations or the 2000 revisions other issues number of other issues affecting effo rts to achieve the goals and objectives of the clean water act continue to receive attention as well stormwater discharges epa has struggled since the 1970s to regulate industrial and municipal stor mwater discharges in workable yet comprehensive manner in pl 1004 congress

program were issued in october 1999 the burden of complying with the rules continues to be an issue with many affected industries and municipalities especially sm all cities which faced co mpliance deadlines beginning in march 200315 stormwater issues were addressed in one provision of omnibus energy legislation in the 109th congress as the march 2003 compliance deadline approached for phase ii small construction sites to comply with existing stormwater permit rules epa proposed twoyear extens ion of those rules for small oil and gas construction sites to allow the agency to assess the economic impact on that particular industry in march 2005 epa again extended the deadline until june 2006 during this time congress considered legislative solution which it enacted in section 323 of hr 6 the energy po licy act of 2005 it provides permanent exemption from stormwater runoff rules fo r the construction of exploration and production facilities by il and gas companies or the roads that service those sites industry officials said that epas orig inal stormwater rule created costly permitting requirements even though the s hort construction peri od for drilling sites carries little potential for stormwater r unoff pollution the provision in hr 6 makes epas temporary delay permanent and makes it applicable to construction activities at all oil and gas development and production sites regardless of size including those covered by an earlier phase i of the stormwater program opponents argued that the provision did not belong in the energy legislation and that there was evidence that construction at oil and gas sites causes less pollution than other construction activities congress passed the conference report on hr 6 with the oil and gas stormwater provision in july 2005 president bush signed it into law on august 8 pl 10958 in june 2006 epa promulgated rule to conform the cwa to these provisions of pl 1095816 combined and separate sewer overflows total of 772 municipalities have combined sewers where domestic sanita ry sewage industrial wastes infiltration from groundwater and stormwater runoff are collected these systems serve approximately 40 million persons mainly in older urban and coastal cities normally under dryweather conditions the combin ed wastes are conveyed to municipal sewage treatment plant properly designed sized and maintained combined sewers can be an acceptable part of citys water pollution control in frastructure however combined sewer overflow cso occurs when the capacity of the collection and treatment system is exceeded due to high volumes of rainwater or snowmelt and the excess volume ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33466crs13 diverted and discharged directly into receiving waters bypassing the sewage treatment plants often the excess flow th at contains raw sewa ge industrial wastes and stormwater is discharged untreated many combined sewer systems are found in coastal areas where recreational areas fish habitat and shellfish beds may be contaminated by the discharges in 1994 following negotiations with key stakeholder groups epa issued cso permitting strategy cities were to implement nine minimum controls by january 1 1997 eg proper operation nd maintenance programs for sewer systems and pollution prevention programs the epa strategy did not contain deadline for issuance of permits or for controlling csos deadlines will be contained in plans developed by permitting authorities which primarily are states controls are available and generally are based on combinations of management techniques such as temporary retention of exce ss flow during storm events and structural measures ranging from screens that capture solids to construction of separate sewer systems epa officials stated in 1998 that only bout onehalf of the cities with combined sewers implemented the minimum measures called for in the 1994 strategy epa is now working with states to remind cities of their obligations to address cso problems however formal enfor cement strategy is not contemplated more recent issue concerning some cities is the problem of overflows from municipal separate sanitary sewers ssos that are not csos because they transport only sanitary wastes discharges of untr eated sewage from these sewers occur from manholes broken pipes and deteriorated infra structure and undersized pipes and can occur in wet or dry weather epa estimates that there are about 18000 municipalities with separate sanitary sewers all of which can under certain circumstances experience overflows explicit epa or statutory control policy currently exists in 1995 epa convened stakeholders group to discuss how to address those overflows that pose the high est environmental nd public health risk first on january 5 2001 the clinton administration finalized regulations to improve the operation of muni cipal sanitary sewer collection systems reduce the frequency and occurrence of overflows clarify the existing cwa prohibition on sso discharges and clarify ci rcumstances appropriate fo r enforcement action the clinton proposal was not finalized nd remains under review by the bush administration funding for cso and sso projects is majo r concern of states and cities the most recent clean water needs survey estimating the cost of projects to meet objectives of the cwa found that the larg est needs category totaling 51 billion is to address csos epa estimates that co sts to restrict ssos are 885 billion in december 2000 congress passed legislation the wet weat her water

robert meltz and claudia copelandthan on whether such resources should be preserved the permit program authorized by section 404 of the clean water act is one of the major federal programs that protects wetlands however environmentalists and others have criticized section 404 as being inadequate to prevent the tinuing loss of wetlands due to statutory exemption of certain types of actions on farmlands and weak enforcement those wishing to develop wetlands maintain that existing laws are already an intrusion on private landuse decisions nd that further federal invol vement is unwarranted how best to protect remaining wetlands and regulate activ ities taking place in wetlands has become one of the most contentious envir onmental policy issues facing congress and was prominent element of clean water debate during the 103rd and 104th congresses although there has been recent legislative activity on section 404 committee hearings were held on several issues arising from judicial decisions administrative actions of interest and implementation of current law particular attention has focused on issues rela ted to 2001 supreme court case which narrowed the governments regulatory

thus limiting its effect on current permit rules while few have read the decision more broadly on february 21 2006 the supreme court heard arguments in two more cases brought by landowners rapanos v united states carabell v us army corps of engineers seeking to narrow the scope of th section 404 permit program the courts ruling was issued on june 19 rapanos v united states 126 sct 2208 2006 in 54 decision plurality of the court led by justice scalia held that the lower court had applied an incorrect sta ndard to determine whether the wetlands at issue are covered by the cwa justice ke nnedy joined this plurality to vacate the lower court decisions and remand the cases for further consideration but he took different positions on most of the substantiv issues raised by the cases as did four other dissenting justices early judgment s by legal observers suggest that the implications of the ruling both shortterm and longterm are far from clear because the several opinions written by th justices did not draw clear line regarding what wetlands and other waters are subject to federal jurisdiction one likely result is more casebycase determin ations and continuing litigation there also could be renewed pressu re on the corps and epa to clarify the issues through an administrative rulemaking17 the senate environm ent and public works committee held hearing on issues raised by the

examine issues and frustrations arising from government and judicial interpretations of the decision in december 2003 epa and the corps announced that the administration would not pursue developmen t of rule changes concerning federal regulatory jurisdiction over isolated wetlands the epa administrator said that the administration wanted to avoid contenti ous and lengthy rule making debate over the issue environmentalists and state representatives expressed relief at the announcement interest groups on all side s have been critical of confusion in implementing the 2003 guidance which constitu tes the main tool for interpreting the reach of the swancc decision however environm entalists remain concerned about diminished protection resulting from the 2003 guidance while developers said that without new rule conf using and contradictory inte rpretations of wetland rules likely will continue18 strategy concerning animal feeding operations as noted previously epas water quality reports identify agricultural activities as the leading contributor to water quality impairments nationwide animal feeding operations afos are only subset of the agriculture category but because more than half of the states specifically identify afos as contributing to impairments public and policy attention has increased on how to minimize public hea lth and environmenta l impacts of runoff from them afos are agricultural facilities that confine livestock feeding activities thus concentrating animal popul ations and waste animal waste is frequently applied to land for disposal and to utilize the nutrient value of manure to benefit crops if not managed properly however it can pose ri sks to water quality and public health contributing pollutants such as nutrients sediment pathogens and ammonia to the environment in 1999 epa and the us department of agri culture initiated national afo strategy to improve compliance and strengthen regulations that are intended to control adverse environmental impacts of these agricultural activities clean water regulations issued in the 1970s required discharge permits for the largest afos termed confined animal feeding operations cafos however epa acknowledged that compliance and enforcem ent of these permit rules was poor less than onethird of covered facilities actually have permits and that the regulations themselves were outdated in december 2000 epa proposed rule to increase the number of afos required to obtain cwa per mits and to restrict land application of animal wastes in may 2001 house transportation and
