the complicated syst em of telephone access charges2 which include the subscriber line charge slc see the section subscriber line charge and the presubscribed interexchange carrier char ge picc see the section presubscribed interexchange carrier charge the plan referred to as calls was modified by the coalition of phone companie s after criticism from the fcc and consumer groups the fcc adopted the main provisions of this fiveyear access reform plan on an interim mandatory basis on may 31 20003 the access charge rate structure is mandatory for all major local phone compan ies with certain ra level components being mandatory on an interim basis th mandatory nature of the plan has been criticized by some companies who do not believe that the plan does enough to guarantee affordable local telephone servi ce in rural highcost areas the plan permits some companies to opt out after the first year those who opt out will behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30052crs2 subject to special cost studies some major longdistance and local telephone companies that were not parties to the proposal and certain consumer groups have criticized the plan us west recently acquired by qwest and the only large local phone company that did not agree to the calls plan and the national association of state utility consumer dvocates nasuca both filed petitions in court for review of aspects of the calls plan us west believed the plan was arbitrary capricious and otherwise contrary to law nasuca representatives stated that the plan would actually raise phone bills on september 19 20 00 qwest altered its position concerning calls and agreed to carry out its provisions qwest also announced that it would drop various lawsu its that it had filed and would review others access charges subscriber line charge slc the subscriber line charge is federally regulated charge that first appeared on phone bills following the divestiture of the american telephone telegraph company tt in 1984 it is also referred to as an access charge and is intended to llow local telephone co mpanies to recover some of the fixed costs telephone wires poles and other fac ilities of connecting phone customers to the interstate longdi stance network when customer makes an interstate longdistance call in the vast majority of cases heshe must use local phone companys network to connect to th longdistance network access charges are paid to local telephone companies by bot h the end user busin ess or residential customers and the longdistance company carrying longdistance call the slc paid by end users appears on bill as specific itemized charge the longdistance company that carries an individual longdistance call pays access charges to both the local phone company originating the call and the one terminating the call the access charges paid by the longdistance carriers do not appear on telephone bill over the past few years the fcc reduced the amount of access charges paid by longdistance companies access charges are kept by the local phone companies they are not forwarded to the federal government in formation on the subscriber line charge is provided at the fcc website h ttpwwwfccgovcgbtelephonehtml in conjunction with decisions related to the implementation of the telecommunications act of 1996 the fcc revised the slc for residential and business customers with more than one telephone line although slc charges for customers with single line did not change in most cases until the calls revisions the slc for primary resi dential line was 350 per month any additional residential lines are considered nonprimary lines the slc for non primary lines was capped at 5 per line per month through 1998 starting in 1999 the slc for nonprimary residential lines wa s adjusted for inflation and increased 1 it was capped at 607 however this di d not mean that all nonprimary lines incurred 607 charge on telephone bill if the local telephone companys average interstate costs of providing that line were less than 607 it could only charge the actual amount of its costs to consumer calls revisions of the slc as of july 1 2000 the slc and picc for residential and single line businesses were consolidated into new slc the picc charge was eliminated as separate charge the new primary line residential and singleline business slc was capped at 435 per month and on july 1 2001 rosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30052crs3 4 us federal communications commission in the matter of multiassociation group plan for regulation of interstate services of nonprice cap incumbent local exchange carriers and interexchange carriers fcc 01304 adopted oct 11 2001 released nov 8 2001 available via the fcc we bsite at http www fccgov 5 us federal communications commission in the matter of cost review proceeding for residential and singleline business subscriber line charge slc caps fcc 02161 adopted june 4 2002 released june 5 2002 available via the fcc website at httpwwwfccgovto 5 under this plan th cap was scheduled to rise to 6 on july 1 2002 and to 650 on july 1 2003 the increases after 2001 are subject to fcc validation the fcc noted that for the first year the new single slc charge was lower than the separate slc and picc charges combined the slc cap for residential customers and singleline businesses remained at 350 for smaller local telephone companie s approximately 1300 carriers providing service to less than 10 of total tele phone access lines on october 11 2001 the fcc adopted an order to reform these charges also4 in this order referred to as the mag multiassociation group plan the slc caps for the smaller carriers were increased to the same levels paid by most other telephone subscrib ers as of january 1 2002 the slc cap for residential and si ngleline businesses increased to 5 beyond that date the fcc conducted cost re view studies and increased to 6 on july 1 2002 and to 650 on july 1 2003 2002 and 2003 increases in the subscriber line charge on june 5 2002 the fcc following cost review proceeding determined that the scheduled increases in the subscriber lin charge were appropriate and necessary to fulfill the commissions access charge reform plans5 as result on july 1 2002 the subscriber line charge cap for residential and singleline business customers increased to 6 and increased again to 650 on july 1 2003 the fcc noted that raising the cap does not mean that all customers will necessarily see charge at the cap level on their bill if phone companys cost of providing the line is less than the cap it may only recover that actual cost the cap is the maximum charge that may appear on bill and applies to all carriers in order to ensure the affordability of phone servi ce for lowincome consumers the fcc expanded the lifeline support program part of the universal service mechanism to cover the full amount of slc charges under the calls plan nonprimary line residential two or more lines in the home slc charges were increased and capped at 7 beginning july 1 2000 the charge will remain at this vel for five years howeve r if the telephone companys average interstate costs of providing the line are less than 7 it may only charge the customer the amount of its costs t all nonprimary resi dential lines will be charged at the 7 cap prior to the implementation of calls this charge was capped at 607 but was scheduled to increas by 1 plus an amount for inflation on july 1 2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30052crs4 in the mag plan the fcc adopted the mag proposal to apply the same slc caps to primary and nonprimary residential lines of the smaller carriers the fcc stated that several commenters in this proceeding indicated that higher slc rates for nonprimary lines would limit the growth of these lines which are often used for advanced telecommunications services and ar an important source of revenue for the smaller carriers prior to calls the maximum slc for businesses with multiple lines was 9 per line per month through 1998 in 199 9 the multiple line business slc was adjusted for inflation and increased to 920 per line this charge was adjusted for inflation annually as with the residen tial slc local phone companies could only recover their costs thus business custom ers with multiple lines did not necessarily see 920 charge for each line the amount could be less and according to the fcc the average slc for businesses with multiple lines was 717 as result of the adoption of the mag plan order the multiple line slc cap for smaller carriers increased to 920 on january 1 2002 multiple line businesses will not see consolidation of the picc and slc charges under the calls plan the mu ltiple line business picc is capped at 431 its precalls cap and will be reduced and eliminated in most areas over the next several years or sooner the multiple line business slc will be frozen for five years for business customers of the rgest local phone companies the slc charge is 920 or the companys average interstate cost of providing the line in that state whichever is less multiple line busine ss customers of the smaller local telephone companies will be charged 6 or the cost of providing the line in that state whichever is less the fcc plans to reevaluate the multiple line business charges at the end of the fiveyear period covered by the calls plan the presence of cap does not mean that every customer will be charged that specific amount on their bill the cap is th maximum charge that may appear the actual charge on an individual phone bill may be lower than the cap presubscribed interexchange carrier charge picc the picc began appearing on telephone bills in january 1998 it was flatrate perline charge that longdistance companies paid to local telephone companies it was charged in addition to the slc because the fcc determined that the slc did not allow local phone companies to recover all of the fixe d costs associated with the interstate portion of the local loop the fcc set picc charges as ceilings not absolute rates and thus specific piccs varied from st ate to state depending upon the costs of providing service within the state th charge could be ssessed for all telephone lines regardless of whether business or residential customer had actually selected presubscribed specifi c longdistance company as of july 1 1999 the picc for primary residential lines and businesses with single line was capped at 104 per month up from 053 in 1998 the primary line and single line business picc was adju sted annually for inflation and increased by 050 through june 30 2000 the ma ximum picc charge for nonprimary residential lines was 253 per line per month up from 150 in 1998 the cap for business customers with multiple phone lines was raised to 431 per line per month up from 275 in 1998 the multiple business line picc ceiling could be adjustedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30052crs5 for inflation and increased if necessary by approximately 150 per year as with the residential and singleline business picc the fcc estimated that as its plans were implemented picc charges would decrease and eventually reach zero in many places longdistance companies took various appr oaches to including or not including picc charges on phone bills in some cases the charges appeared as an itemized line on bill but they also may have been lu mped in with other charges and labeled national access fee or carrier line charge the fcc did not order longdistance companies to present picc charges in specific way nor did the fcc order the companies to charge the customer directly for picc charges the fcc stated that its reductions in access charges which the longdistance companies pay to local phone companies largely offset any increases in perline or other charges making them revenueneutral some longdistance companies chose to r ecover all or part of the picc charges from their customers and stated that they had to do so because their costs rose and the fcc reduc tions in access charges were not enough and had already been passed on to customers longdista nce companies requested further reductions of these charges calls revisions of the picc under the calls plan on july 1 2000 the picc charge was eliminated as separate charge for residential and single line business customers the picc and slc see section subscriber line charge were consolidated into single new slc charge however multiple line businesses will not see consolidation of the picc and slc charges the multiple line business picc will be capped at 431 its pre calls cap and will be reduced and eliminated in most areas over the next seve ral years or sooner as with slc caps the presence of picc cap does not mean that all customers will be charged at the cap rate the specific charge may be less than the cap and must be based on the actual cost of providing phone service in each area other calls provisions overall according to the fcc this action will simplify charges and reduce the fees appearing on monthly bills especially for low volume residential and business users due to the wide variety of billing formats the different fees on telephone bills charges attached to different calling plans and the volume of calls customer makes it is not possible to state that any particular bill will decrease by specific amount or per cent the fcc has stated however that lowvolume users 30 minutes or less of longdistance calling per month may save between 10 and 50 per year various observe rs believe it is even more difficult to quantify savings for heavy users of longdis tance services in addition this action by the fcc may result in an increase in local and longdistance competition and further reductions in longdistance charges according to the fcc some of the major consumer benefits of the calls plan are as follows the elimination of the residential and single line business picc the multiple line business picc will be reduced over time and eliminated in some areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30052crs6 6 federal register june 21 2000 pp 3868438704a 32 billion reduction in access char ges paid by longdistance companies to local phone companies although major longdistance companies have agreed to pass these savings on to their customers over the fiveyear life of the calls plan some consumer groups and analysts question whether all of the sa vings would actually reach consumers and when the government cannot force the comp anies to pass on the savings it is not clear at this time whether per minute charges for longdistance calling will fall availability of at least one longdistance plan to att and sprint customers that does not have monthly minimum use charge monthly minimum use fees see the section minimum use fees of approximately 3 per month have been ch arged by some longdistance carriers to customers who do not make large volumes of longdistance calls although this plan does not abolish the use of minimum monthly fees and the fcc did not reach the conclusion that such flat fees were unreasonable inequitable or inconsistent with the communications act companies agreed to eliminate or make avoidable some of these fees as part of the calls proposal att and sprint agreed to make longdistance plans available that would address the n eeds of lowvolume users also members of the coalition agreed to work with the consumer information bureau at the fcc to develop consumer education plan the plan will address important issues relating to longdistance and local phone serv ice pricing and service in addition the calls companies will create programs and materials to assist consumers in understanding their telephone bills in order to reach the maximum number of consumers the materials must be available in various formats and languages within 90 days of publication of provisions of the order in the federal register calls companies had to submit compliance statement relating to their consumer education plan to the fcc6 education efforts must continue over the fiveyear life of the plan report was filed with the fcc on september 19 2000 as part of the education effort the calls member companies established websites to provide phone bill assistance and other informa tion to consumers see httpwwwlifelinesupportorglills identification of 650 million in imp

format on september 17 1998 the fcc adopted notice of proposed rulemaking addressing the issue of th clarity of telephone bills7 the three main proposals of the rulemaking were as follows telephone bills should be clearly organized and highlight any new charges or changes to consumers services telephone bills should contain fu ll and nonmisleading descriptions of all charges and clear identification of the service provider responsible for each charge and telephone bills should contain clear and conspicuous disclosure of any information consumers need to make inquiries about charges the fcc received over 60000 consumer i nquiries concerning telephone bills in 1998 on april 15 1999 the fcc issu ed an order generally adopting the proposed principles and minimal basic guid elines to help consumers understand their telephone bills8 the guidelines adopted imple ment three basic principles consumers should know who is asking them to pay for service what services they are being asked to pay for and where they can call to obtain additional information about the charges appearing on their telephone bill the fcc chose to adopt broad binding pr inciples instead of detailed rules that would rigidly control all of the wording nd the format of telephone bill thushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30052crs8 9 federal register july 13 2000 pp 4325143258telephone companies have wide latitude to satisfy the dopted principles in way that serves the needs of the carrier and the customer in its order the fcc states that we incorporate these principles and guidelines into the commissions rules because we intend for these obligations to be enforceable to the same degree as other rules thus while we provide ca rriers flexibility in their compliance we fully expect them to meet their obliga tion to provide customers with the accurate and meaningful information cont emplated by these principles deniable and nondeniable charges the truthinbilling order also requires companies to identify charges on customers bill that are deniable and nondeniable gene rally deniable charges are those that if not paid may result in the termination denial of customers local telephone service nondeniable charges are those that if not paid will not result in termination of the customers local telephone service specific fo rmat on bill is required although deniable and nondeniable charges must be clearly and conspicuously iden tified in addition carriers are free to choose other methods of informing consumers about charges that may be contested state laws may also address this issue the fcc views identification of charges into these two categories as protecting consumers from paying questionable unauthoriz ed charges out of fear of having their local telephone service disconnected ho wever this guideline applies only to companies who include both categories of charges on single bill companies that bill directly for service that includes basic local telephone service would not be covered for example customers being billed directly by wireless tele phone company for only wireless service would not have charges for wired basic local telephone service on their bills although not paying charges on the wireless bill would have effect on thei r athome wired service non payment of the wireless bill may result in termination of their wireless service essentially customers should not conclude that every b ill for telephone service has both deniable and nondeni able charges on it prior to withholding payment for any charge on bill customer should verify the status of the charge with the billing company after reviewing petitions for reconsideration relating to truthinbilling and billing format the fcc on march 29 2000 re leased an order on reconsideration that reaffirmed the require ment that telephone bills hi ghlight new service providers and prominently display contact number for inquiries this requirement is intended to act as deterrent to slamming and cramming by allowing consumers to more easily identify changes in providers on their bills the rule does not cover services provided on pertransaction basis like di rectory assistance changes in customers local or longdista nce company would be covered9 the order also adopted proposals to requi re carriers to use standard industry wide language and clear descriptions for line item charges identified as resulting from federal regulatory activity the fcc felt that current presentations of these chargeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30052crs9 10 federal register june 25 1999 pp 3449934501 11 summary of this order was published in the federal register on june 25 1999 on pages 3448834498on telephone bills are misleading inaccurate and confusing as result through proceeding announced in the federal register the fcc will seek comment from consumer and industry groups concerning standard labels for these charges10 finally carriers must prominently display on each bill tollfree number or numbers that customers may us to inquire about or dis pute any charge on their bill provisions of this order not subject to further rulemakings become effective 30 days after the publication of notice of the

area code overlays local telephone calls may require sevendigit or 10digit dialin g calls made outside of customers local dialing area but not going far enough to be classified as long distance will incur additional charges on telephone bill local dialing areas are not determined by the fcc state authorities regulate the local dialing areas in their state and make the determination as to whether calls to certain exchanges are within specific local dialing area or are toll calls toll calls are often handled by the sa company that provides local telephone service to customer however in many states state authorities have permitted longdistance carriers to compete in the toll call market toll call rates can vary substantially depending upon th carrier chosen in states where such competition is permitted and other factors if there are any questions concerning toll call charges or whether specific exchan ge is included in local dialing area they should be addressed to the company providing local telephone service or state authorities instate connection fee longdistance companies may have charge on bill labeled the ins tate connection fee or somethin g similar according to the longdistance carriers this is fee to recover the charges that local telephone companies assess on the longdistance companies to carry instate longdistance and toll calls over their lines these charges are often referred to as intrastate access charges the fcc does not regulate th fee assessed to recover these charges customers with questions about the fee on their bill or intrastate access charges should contact the companies involved and their state public utility commission in some cases longdistance companies exempt certain customers from the fee for example customers who have certain service packages from the longdistance company customers enrolled in certain types of lifeline programs or customers who spend less than 1 per month on longdistance calling regulatory assessment fee in some cases longdistance and local companies charge regulatory assessment fee regulatory cost recovery fee or carrier cost recovery charge the exact wording and the amount of the charge will vary according to the companies assessing the fee it allows them to recover certain costs associated with interstate access charges property taxes and corporate expenses relating to governmental regulatory actions and compliance as with some other fees companies may exempt customers that subscribe to certain calling plans or services the fee is not federal f ee and is not controlled or mandated by the fcc contact the company involved or state authorities for further information jamming with the advent of competition in the toll call market complaints have arisen that some customer accounts are being frozen so that customers cannot use company competing with their local phone company to complete toll call this tactic is referred to as jamming in cases where this is occurring customers may be paying more for their toll calls customers who feel that they have been jammed and have inquiries about competition in the toll call market should address their inquiries to state authoritieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30052crs13 sliding some customers have also compla ined that their chosen provider of toll call service has been sw itched without their permissi on this practice has been termed sliding as with jamming toll call rates can vary substantially from company to company consumers who believe that they have been victims of sliding should contact their chosen toll call provider or state authorities miscellaneous caller services local telephone companies offer wide variety of caller services such as caller id call waiting call forwarding call rejection call trace call retur n priority ringing and voice mail among many others both the types of caller services offered and the charges for these optional services vary from company to company charges may include monthly fees or peruse charges the fcc does not regulate these charges longdistance services generally longdistance charges for wired telephones are wholly depende nt upon the longdistance company that consumer chooses as hisher longdistance carrier th particular calling plan if any chosen and the number and length of calls made during billing period usually customers designate specific longdistance company as their primary longdistance carrier when customer dials longdistan ce call by dialing 1 area codetelephone number telephone switch auto matically routes the call to the customers designated longdistance carrier howe ver customers are not requi red to use their designated longdistance carrier to handle any of their longdistance calls if customers use dial around longdistance carriers reached by dialing the appr opriate 1010xxx code for particular company instead of their chosen longdistance carrier charges for those calls can also be in cluded on local bill in addition customers may use different types of prepaid phone cards or longdistance company calling cards to complete longdistance call rates and conditions for these cards vary widely and the charges billed to card can vary depending upon whether payphone business or residential phone is used many longdistance companies are now billing their residential customers directly instead of billing through local telephone company as result customers may receive minimum of two bills for telephone service longdistance calling from wireless cellular tele phones is also wholly dependent on the company and calling plan th at customer chooses many cellular companies now bundle local and longdistan ce calling into service packages and do not charge extra for longdistance calls however customers mu st pay attention to the calling limitations if any in their wireless contract that apply to longdistance calls there may be limits on the number of longdistance calls per month the number of minutes per month or international vs domestic calling for example per minute charges for longdistance calling from wireless phones may be quite high if the calls are outside the scope of customers

service charges advertising should disclose any time or geographic restriction on the availability of advertised rates the basis for comparative price cl aims should be disclosed and only current information used in making claims and information should be disclosed in clear and conspicuous manner and without distracting elements so that consumers can understand it and make fully informed choices consumers are usually charged fee of up to 5 by local telephone company when they change the longdistance carrier selected as their primary carrier often the newly designated longdistance carrier will pay the fee as an incentive to obtain new customers the fee has been capped at 5 since the 1984 divestiture of att on march 14 2002 the fcc began pro ceeding to examine this charge13 the agency will seek to determine if the charge is outdated and may in fact hinder competition by discouraging consumers from switching companies as part of the proceeding the fcc will atte mpt to

quest of telephone ca rriers to clarify how local lephone co mpanies should compensate each other reciprocal compensation for carrying telephone traffi c to isps essentially when telephone company x local phone provider delivers local call to the isp who has chosen telephone company z to handle its local calls x pays z to deliver the call to the isp if the isp calls someone z pays x to deliver the call charges paid from x to z or z to x are based upon the length of time that the call is connected or some other basis determined by x and z x and z enter into an agreement for specified period of time to compensate each other for ca rrying calls this compensation is paid between x and z and does not involve any ch arges to the isp or its customers and has direct bearing on the fees that an isp charges its customers however calls to isps tend to last long time since using the internet is usually not speedy endeavor but outbound calls from isps do not in most cases thus local phone companies like x end up paying lot more to z than z pays to x since the compensation is often based upon the leng th of time that the call is connected x and other local phone companies in the same position petitioned the fcc to reconsider the status of these calls and designate them as interstate instead of local reciprocal compensation applie s only to local telephone calls on february 25 1999 the fcc ruled that internet traffic is jurisdictionally mixed and appears to be largely interstate in nature and in notice of proposed rulemaking is seeking to determine federal intercarrier compensation mechanism17 designation of these calls as interstate by the fcc is purely jurisdictional designation although this ruling means that the structure and method of reciprocal compensation payments between x and z will change it does not change the status of local calls to isps to longdistance for the purposes of billing individual customers it also does not re quire an end to reciprocal compensation the us court of appeals for the dist rict of columbia ruled on march 24 2000 that the fcc had not adequately justifie d its analysis of phone calls to internet service providers as interstate the cas was sent back to the fcc for further explanation in an order released on april 19 200118 the fcc concluded that telecommunications traffic delivered to isps is interstate access traffic and is not subject to reciprocal compensation howe ver the fcc did not abolish reciprocal compensation instead it established gr adual reduction of th rates over the two
