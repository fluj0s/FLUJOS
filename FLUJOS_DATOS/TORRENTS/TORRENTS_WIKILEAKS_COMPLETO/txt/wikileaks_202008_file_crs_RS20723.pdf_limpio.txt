mildred amer government and finance division august 20 2008 abstract this report contains table that shows by party the number of freshmen elected to the house in each election since

democrats 38 thus the total for the two congresses was 140 new democrats and 137 new republicans this pattern appears repeatedly in both the h ouse and the senate after the republicans gained control of the house in the 104th congress with 73 freshmen the democratic freshmen totaled 65 in the following two congresses while the number of republican freshmen totaled 49 order code rs20723 updated august 20 2008 freshmen in the house of representatives and senate by political party 19132008 mildred amer specialist in american national government government and finance division summary sixtyfive freshmen were elect ed in november 2006 to the 110th congress 55 to the house and 10 to the senate most of the freshmen were democrats thus enabling the party to regain control of both hous of congress after 12 years the 103rd congress freshmen class elected in november 1992 which was composed of 110 new representatives and 12 new senators represented the largest freshman class in more than four decades two years later in 1994 the republicans gained control of both the house and the senate for the first time in some 40 years when 97 new members 86 in the house 11 in the senate were elected to the 104th congress this report will be updated after the november 2008 elections analysis of data table 1 shows by party the number of freshmen elected to the house in each election beginning in 1912 and those elected to the senate beginning in 1914 these starting points were used because the size of the house was fixed at 435 before the election of 1912 and direct ection of senators commenced after ratification of the seventeenth amendment in 1912 italicized tries in the table denote the party which elected the majority of freshmen members table 1 demonstrates that there can be rebound effect in which one party has majority of freshmen at the beginning of congress and the other pa rty recovers part or all of the loss within the next two elections1 another pattern is party shift occurring and prevailing over time for example in the time frame of this report the 72nd throughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20723crs2 75th congresses 19311938 estab lished democratic dominance in the house that has since been overcome by the republicans three times in 19471948 80th congress 1953 1954 83rd congress and 19952006 104th 109th congresses the table shows instances in the house and senate throughout the period of this study when one party has had majority of freshmen but that majority was insufficient to achieve control of chamber for example see the senate in the 107th congress and both houses for the 76th 78th 105th and 106th congresses data sources the data for the house from 1913 to 1953 we re drawn from the lists of freshmen in congressional directories
