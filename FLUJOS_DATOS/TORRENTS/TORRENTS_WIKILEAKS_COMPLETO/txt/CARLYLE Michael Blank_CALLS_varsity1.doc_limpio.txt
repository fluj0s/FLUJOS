limited transaction overview carlyle venture partners carlyle has the opportunity to invest in equinix inc equinix or the company which operates internet business exchange facilities carlyles 5 million investment in equinix will be part of 5060 million series b preferred round which will be led by egroup an affiliate of news corp additional series b investors will likely include etrade dell northpoint enron and insiders the company will use these funds to open new ibx facilities across the us and for general corporate purposes equinixs management projects that this series b round will be adequate to fund the roll out of equinixs business plan through first quarter 2000 at which point the company will likely seek additional debt or equity funds from the public market this series b financing round follows the series financing which was raised in september 1998 from an investor group that included cisco systems microsoft corporation benchmark capital stanford university and several individual parties this series round which priced at 100 per share totaled approximately 124 million and implied postmoney valuation of roughly 22 million these series investors are committing up to 10 million in the series b round the series b preferred investment at 800 per share values the business at 230240 million postmoney and implies roughly 176 million premoney valuation postfinancing carlyles 5 million investment will represent roughly 22 of the fully diluted equity of the company investment summary equinix was formed in june 1998 by an experienced senior management team to design build and operate internet business exchange facilities ibxs equinix ibxs will be the first carrier and ip network neutral collocation facilities and will provide customers with the flexibility speed and adaptability to react to current market conditions expand their business offerings and enter new markets internet service providers isps internet content providers cps and telecommunications carriers including clecs will seek access to equinixs neutral unregulated ibxs located across the globe to connect to each other and economically deliver the highest quality internet services to their customers equinix is perhaps best characterized as an internet infrastructure service business that provides the foundation for pervasive internet where companies conduct missioncritical business activities efficiently securely and economically the companys primary focus is the rapidly emerging missioncritical internet business market which includes customers such as isps highvalue cps and telecommunications carriers these customers require the ability to conduct business with each other in order to receive mutual benefits including peering transit and base facility services equinix ibxs will enable these customers to connect to each other in neutral unregulated environments and to provide secure high quality internet services to their customers by building and operating the core of the internet with open and scalable business exchanges equinix will make possible infinite internet business growth and development with the tremendous growth of the internet and data traffic in recent years the number of internetrelated businesses isps cps etc has exploded in addition component service providers csps such as critical path have emerged to enable isps to outsource critical services such as electronic mail access content distribution or ip bandwidth after many discussions with potential customers it became clear to equinixs senior management team that large number of internet businesses have high demand for neutral locations where they can directly interact with other internet businesses quickly and efficiently equinix ibxs will be the premier facilities where carriers isps cps and csps can all collocate under the same roof all of equinixs customers will benefit from this proximity which results in more centralized content greater network flexibility and improved traffic exchange such proximity is not available at the current internet network access points naps such as mae east due to lack of available space originally sponsored by carriers such as mfs in virginia and ameritech in chicago in the mid1990s the naps have become an everincreasingly essential part of internet service delivery as they provide way for isps to exchange data traffic generally these naps were built in preexisting carrier facilities designed for minimal amounts of switching equipment as isps built out their infrastructure into these facilities large number of compromises were made in areas such as quality cost security and power in addition these sites were far too small to accommodate the growth of the internet in recent years as internetdependent mission critical businesses began to take shape it became clear that cps needed to move their servers as close to the naps as possible so that they could achieve the shortest network distance between their content and internet end users however space was limited in the naps and separate industry has emerged to house internet content which has taken the form of server farms in separate nonnap data centers forrester research estimates that by the year 2002 approximately 40 of complex web sites will be outsourced and that internet hosting revenues for complex sites will increase from roughly 200 million in 1997 to approximately 80 billion by 2002 currently almost collocation occurs in nap facilities due to lack of space and insufficient services equinixs business proposition is to provide its customers with the ability to collocate in new facilities that offer unlimited naplike connectivity between all resident companies number of companies have emerged to meet this growing need for collocation services including larger firms such as uunet cable wireless and gte internetworking and new companies such as abovenet communications and exodus communications in general these companies profit not solely from collocation but also from the sale of bandwidth and specialized content management or web hosting services in contrast equinix believes that customers will prefer to collocate in its ibxs because equinix plans to maintain total neutrality with respect to bandwidth and carriers and does not plan to offer advance web hosting services this focused approach on neutral connectivity and collocation enables the company to differentiate itself from its potential competitors in the marketplace because customers are free to purchase bandwidth and enhanced services from entities other than their collocation provider equinix plans to open three ibxs in 1999 and an additional twelve facilities in 2000 and managements financial projections include only these fifteen us ibxs however the company plans to deploy at least 35 sites worldwide over the next three years and believes that its first two nonus facilities will open in mid2000 in london and hong kong equinix will strategically locate these ibxs near facilities operated by isps near major central offices operated by carriers and near heavy concentrations of internet users the company opened its first facility in ashburn va near washington dc in late july 1999 washington was logical choice for equinixs initial facility because more internet traffic passes through the area than anywhere else in the world this facility is strategically located near america online and mci worldcom and enjoys initial anchor tenants including mci worldcom teleglobe concentric network akamai netrail and remarq equinix surpassed its own expectations by preselling over 25 of available collocation space before this opening the company hopes to replicate this early success as it continues rolling out ibxs over the next three years in summary equinixs business is founded on three important principles neutrality exchange and synergy neutrality with respect to carriers enables equinix customers to purchase bandwidth and other services from anyone this choice should result in greater redundancy and improved pricing exchange enables equinix customers to interconnect quickly and economically with other internet businesses under one roof such interconnection is not available in current nap facilities synergy represents the opportunities for new business development that will be created by the ibx environment the increased communication and business activity between resident companies in the ibx will likely spur significant business growth and new business creation by building the core of the internet with focus on these principles of neutrality exchange and synergy equinix plans to support infinite internet growth while creating successful profitable business for its shareholders investment considerations growth of internetrelated businesses demand for collocation internet traffic is growing approximately 300 per year and data services are growing roughly 40 per year as result the number of businesses providing internet and data services carriers isps cps csps etc has exploded in the past few years due to this tremendous increase in the number of internet businesses and the limited space and services in existing naps separate industry has emerged to house internet content which has taken the form of server farms in separate nonnap data centers equinix ibxs will be the premier facilities where carriers isps cps and csps can all collocate and transact business with each other under the same roof all of equinixs customers will benefit from this proximity which results in more centralized content greater network flexibility and improved traffic exchange demand for exchange points that are carrier and ip network neutral key differentiating element of equinixs business plan is the companys focus on carrier neutrality historically isps have located their mission critical infrastructure in naps each of which is served by single carrier all circuits into such nap are monopolized by the carrier sponsor which in turn enables the carrier to increase prices without adding necessary redundancy equinix plans to address this carrier neutrality issue by enabling its customers to purchase bandwidth and other internet services from anyone in the ibx this is major departure from the business plans of most competing collocation companies which seek to make money from the sale of bandwidth and other services this availability of customer choice in carrier neutral ibx should result in greater redundancy and more favorable pricing for equinixs customers experienced management team strong investor base equinix is led by senior management team with extensive relevant experience the companys chief executive officer avery and chief technology officer jay adelson built and ran the palo alto internet exchange paix the first generation neutral switching and peering facility for global and regional isps in addition the company enjoys strong initial base of venture investors including cisco systems microsoft corporation benchmark capital and stanford university and strategic potential series b investors news corp etrade dell northpoint early initial success strong early customer sponsorship the company opened its first facility in the washington dc area in late july 1999 this facility is strategically located near america online and mci worldcom and enjoys initial anchor tenants including mci worldcom teleglobe concentric network akamai netrail and remarq equinix surpassed its own expectations by preselling over 25 of available collocation space before this opening the company hopes to replicate this early success as it continues rolling out ibxs over the next three years high quality facilities focused on customer service equinix ibxs will be the premier facilities where carriers isps cps and csps can all collocate and transact business with each other under the same roof the company is focused on providing all necessary elements to ensure that its customers can economically deliver the highest quality internet services to their respective customers these elements include greater available space security power and customer service than is presently available in existing naps and collocation facilities these higher quality of service requirements are demanded by key customers as the internet becomes more missioncritical component of their business plans favorable diligence results from core location and northpoint in addition to meeting with equinixs management team in california and touring the companys ibx in virginia carlyle has also learned about equinix through its existing investments in core location and northpoint core location plans to lease an entire floor of its chicago facility to equinix for the chicago ibx and northpoint currently plans to collocate its dsl equipment in equinix ibxs across the us northpoint also plans to invest 5 million in this series b round potential attractive exit alternatives carlyle anticipates that the most likely exit option for this investment will involve either an initial public offering or sale of the company to strategic buyer as the market for enhanced internet services has grown and consolidated in recent years it has not been uncommon for companies such as abovenet and exodus to be valued either by strategic acquirers or the public market at levels in excess of 10x estimated revenues while equinixs business plan is somewhat different from both of these examples we believe that an attractive public offering or strategic sale would be likely if the company executes its business plan and achieves its projected financial results with estimated 2000 revenues of nearly 65 million we believe that it is not inconceivable that equinix would be valued at 500 million or higher within the next twelve to eighteen months thus assuming the successful execution of the companys business plan we believe that potential equity returns on this investment would be attractive to our investors investment risks minority investment following this proposed investment carlyles 5 million series b investment will represent roughly 22 of equinixs outstanding fully diluted equity the series b preferred stock will have limited class and will have the authority to elect only one of the companys seven directors this series b director has not yet been identified due to its minority ownership position carlyle will have limited control on key decisions affecting the company certain entities have invested in the company at lower valuations and the possibility exists for diverging interests among equinixs shareholders uncertainty of market acceptance of equinix ibxs significant competition there are many other companies that will offer collocation services to equinixs potential customer base equinixs sales force will have significant challenge to compete with these other providers many of whom are larger and more established than the company while management believes that equinixs focus on neutrality exchange and synergy will prove to be attractive to potential customers there can be guarantee that equinix will be successful in attracting and retaining key potential customers uncertain availability of optimal real estate equinix plans to strategically locate its ibxs near facilities operated by isps near major central offices operated by carriers and near heavy concentrations of internet users for example equinix is planning to lease an entire floor in the core location building in chicago well chosen placement of multiple locations will be key strategic advantage for the company in the long term there can be guarantee that the company will secure such real estate in optimal locations at attractive prices if equinix is forced to select suboptimal locations such actions could have negative impact on the companys business plan future financing requirements uncertain capital markets the company projects that it will require additional funding in mid2000 or earlier to complete its planned roll out of ibx facilities although management believes that the public equity and debt markets will be receptive to equinixs business model and several major investment banks are supportive of potential high yield financing later in 1999 there can be guarantee that such funds will be available at any certain point in the future difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified employees as equinix rolls out its ibxs over the next three years it will need to hire additional personnel to manage various corporate sales technical and customer service functions it is often difficult to identify and hire experienced employees given the relative infancy of the internet industry thus there can be guarantee that the company will be able to grow its employee base with quality personnel to match its expansion plans for the future future consolidation of internet businesses although the number of internet businesses has increased significantly in recent years with the growth of the internet there has also been significant consolidation in the overall industry as an example it is unclear whether the number of isps will increase or decrease in the next few years decrease in the raw number of internet businesses could negatively impact equinix as its business plan is based on the need for these multiple companies to collocate under the same roof and transact business with each other however it is possible that the internet market will continue its explosive growth and that such growth will foster the continued emergence of new types of internetrelated businesses potential erosion of prices and margins over time as additional companies begin to offer collocation services to the market it is possible that equinix will need to reduce its monthly lease rates to maintain competitive pricing such price reduction would likely have negative impact on the companys profitability margins in addition the company may need to discount off its published price list in order to attract its initial set of anchor customers in new ibx facilities projected financials the chart below provides summary of managements financial projections for the years 1999 through 2001 these projections reflect equinixs plan to open three ibx facilities in 1999 northern virginia newark and san jose and twelve additional ibx facilities in 2000 in addition the company plans to open two international ibxs london hong kong in 2000 equinix expects to invest roughly 10 million of capital expenditures in each new ibx facility and projects that each facility will be ebitda positive before corporate sga by its second month of operations management assumes that each new facility will be 15 presold before opening and will fill up its entire capacity in its first 1218 months of operations as evidenced in the chart below management projects that equinix will realize ebitda of nearly 100 million in 2001 this projection is based on additional new facilities in 2001 and assumes that the company will be able to access the public equity or debt markets for additional funding in q2 2000

anticipates that the most likely exit option for this investment will involve either an initial public offering or sale of the company to strategic buyer with projected irrs in excess of 30 please contact frank yeary at 212 3814900 if you have any questions on this investment transaction overview on july 29 1999 carlyle venture partners carlyle and customer analytics inc customer analytics or the company executed term sheet pursuant to which carlyle has the opportunity to invest 5 million in the company the total amount being raised by customer analytics in this round is 7 million with the remaining 2 million coming from the companys existing investor trident capital carlyle will receive one board seat on the seven member board and its investment in the company will represent an ownership position of approximately 22 based on post money valuation of 23 million we believe that while the company has strong existing management team critical addition is that of chief operating officer the existing investors and the management team have agreed to this condition as result the transaction will be staged with carlyle and the other investors funding their prorata share of 175 million at an initial closing expected at the end of august 1999 carlyle and the other investors will fund the remaining 525 million of the round concurrently with the hiring of chief operating officer reasonably acceptable to all the investors such hiring is expected in the near term investment summary customer analytics based in burlington ma is provider of industry specific enterprise relationship management erm applications currently the company is focused on selling its products primarily to mid tier financial services companies including banks insurance companies and mutual funds the companys software application suite erm central is currently in its version 10 release having automated their back and front office systems enterprises will next automate strategic and tactical marketing operations existing data mining and data applications have improved the interaction between customer and an organization and have produced large repositories of data however these applications remain focused on automating business processes rather than analyzing data to provide meaningful and actionable customer information in addition this data resides in various sections of the enterprise some data may be in the call center some in the sales force automation system or some from the corporate website and this data is often not integrated through its easytouse webbased applications the company enables its clients to create and manage marketing campaigns perform sophisticated analyses and connect disparate customer data throughout the enterprise more effectively than traditional enterprise systems as result we believe that the company presents an attractive investment opportunity for the reasons outlined in the section below investment considerations leadership in an emerging market customer relationship management crm as it exists today is nearly 35 billion market gartner group has projected that corporate spending on customer marketing solutions will grow at 35 cagr and will exceed 9 billion by 2002 the market for relationship management solutions however is undergoing transformation from systems that focus on data mining in separate departments of

relationship management or erm we have identified only one other company whose stated mission is to develop systems for this emerging market epiphany is kleiner perkins backed startup with 15 million in revenues for 1998 with run rate of 10 million in revenues for 1999 epiphany has currently filed an s1 and is expecting public offering in the next couple of months customer analytics has adopted vertical industry approach to the market while epiphany develops more generic solutions not targeted to specific industry in 1998 relationship marketing software spending for north american financial services institutions alone is estimated at 440 million and is expected to double by 2002 because customer analytics has chosen financial services as an initial industry of focus the company has the potential to be the market leader in this large segment of the market key product and service differentiation traditional data mining and crm companies have offered departmental specific reports and views into data resident only on that departments systems customer analytics provides views reports and analysis across all systems through their webbased applications the company has two main products aimed at integrating data and providing reporting capabilities through the web to the enterprise as whole 1 erm audit the audit is essentially scorecard for assessing an organizations readiness for relationship marketing the audit compares the value of best practices to current client situations to measure the impact of adopting best practices and estimating payback essentially

business model strong management team when the company was initially funded in april 1998 the company had only one employee the founder evangelos simoudis over the past year the company has been able to assemble strong team of people with backgrounds in this industry for description of the companys executive management team please contact megan mcgovern at 202 6261275 evangelos simoudis founder and chief executive officer of customer analytics is widely regarded as an expert in the data mining industry prior to founding customer analytics he was vice president of global business intelligence solutions at ibm currently 300 million runrate revenue unit as one of the youngest employees to be promoted to vice president evangelos oversaw the development and delivery of data mining data

documentation she is an experienced leader of development teams with over 18 years of experience building successful teams and awardwinning products most recently gail was vice president of engineering at eprise corporation which developed businesstobusiness web content management products investment risks competition the company faces direct and potential competition from five different types of companies 1 pureplay erm software the leading company in this category is epiphany epiphany is kleiner perkins backed startup with 15 million in revenues for 1998 and 10 million run rate in revenues for 1999 epiphany is likely to be the most significant competition for customer analytics according to industry and customer references customer analytics is second to epiphany epiphany is not focused on any particular industry however and as result their solutions tend to be more generic and tend to require more backend customization customer analytics system is highly focused on financial services companies these companies tend to have very specific needs relative to other crm focused industries 2 financial services data providers companies in this category include harte hanks john harland co experian and other traditional financial service bureaus these companies are information providers focused on the financial services industry many of the potential customers that customer analytics targets are currently clients of these firms these service bureaus provide reports and custom analysis specifically for marketing departments in addition the analysis is limited to data from that particular service bureau if service bureau customer wants to achieve more rigorous analysis he can provide his own data to the service bureau but he would have to wait significant amount of time to obtain results erm central alleviates these problems by letting the customer analyze his own data along with data from any service bureau in near realtime in addition this information is available for people to access across the enterprise 3 campaign management software companies in this category include exchange applications and prime response both of these companies market software specifically focused for marketing departments in larger companies for managing large marketing campaigns the implementation and license fees associated with these products make these solutions prohibitive to the midtier market in addition their solution offers only portion of the functionality of erm central 4 enterprise application software companies in this category include i2 technologies or siebel systems and to some extent sap or peoplesoft these companies are more likely to partner with customer analytics than to compete erm central is not meant to be replacement for siebel type system but meant to be complement major component of customer analytics value proposition is to allow its clients to integrate the data residing in disparate applications across the enterprise thus if company uses siebel for call center management and sap in other parts of the enterprise erm central will allow the data from these systems to be integrated siebel systems is in discussions with customer analytics regarding strategic partnership 5 decision support and data warehousing software companies in this category include brio business objects cognos informatica and sagent from competitive standpoint these companies are more focused on analytics of decision support instead of focusing on total view of the customer in particular industry however it is possible that these companies may want to apply their decision support analytics to attack to customercentric erm market completion of the management team as the company grows key additions will need to be made to the management team including chief operating officer vice president of marketing and vice president of business development as condition of the completion of this financing the company will hire chief operating officer despite difficult labor market the company has demonstrated an ability to assemble team not only with significant software development experience but also sales and marketing experience directly related to the database marketing and financial services sectors as result we believe that the company is in strong position to hire qualified candidates for these positions product development customer analytics has signed one paying customer for the version 10 release of its product the product will not contain its full feature set until the first quarter 2000 the initial customer has been pleased with the product and the service that the company has provided based on discussions with industry analysts the current customer and potential customers the functionality in the current release provides substantial benefit over existing solutions in the marketplace however the full development of these products is in process and any unexpected delays in the products development or implementation schedule would cause future revenues to grow at slower than expected rate rollout of product line as the company continues to work on the functionality of the software it must continue to sell version 10 to its customers in addition as the competition begins to intensify in the erm market the company needs to move quickly to gain penetration in the financial services industry the companys vice president of sales is aggressively growing his sales staff with people who have direct experience selling to software to firms in the financial services industry in addition customer analytics has quantified pipeline of sales to potential customers of approximately 5 million however unexpected delays in the products development may decelerate the rollout of future versions of erm central summary financial information base case projections in thousands 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 revenue 800 13900 57600 186400 314500 operating income 5700 2500

projections and conservative exit multiples should you have any questions on this investment please contact brian hayhurst at 202 347 2626 transaction overview carlyle venture partners carlyle has the opportunity to invest in varsitybookscom varsitybooks or the company an online retailer of textbooks the company has received 114 million of equity capital in seed and first round funding collectively and is currently seeking 30 million second round of venture financing the company desires an investor group of two financial investors as well as one to two strategic investors carlyle has evaluated this opportunity and has decided to follow tribune ventures who is acting as lead investor in this round tribune would invest 10 million carlyle would invest approximately 75 million the existing investors including mayfield and fbr would invest 75 million and southeastern technology partners would invest 5 million the pre money valuation would be 60 million carlyles investment would represent an ownership position of 83 we believe this is an attractive valuation given the companys market position and stage and given current market conditions the proposed transaction is expected to close in august 1999 investment summary varsitybooks based in washington dc is the leader in the emerging online textbookretailing market the company was founded in december 1997 to become the nations premier online textbook retailer and channel to the college market the company selected the 3 billion textbook industry to establish stronghold in the college market because textbooks are expensive commodity goods that must be purchased by every student equally important textbooks have traditionally been sold to students by monopolistic oncampus bookstores plagued by customer service concerns through partnership with baker taylor inc carlyle portfolio company varsitybooks has access to approximately two million books from more than 25000 publishers we believe that varsitybooks is an attractive investment opportunity with the following attractive characteristics investment considerations strong brand name and first mover advantage in the internetsavvy college student market varsitybooks launched its web site in august 1998 posting the required and optional reading lists course booklists for five washington dc area schools on its site and marketing only to those schools without any pre launch marketing the company sold to an average of 11 percent of the undergraduate population at each of the schools within weeks of its launch despite the fact that it did not market outside the washington dc area the company sold books to students in all 50 states the following spring semester the company marketed heavily to 74 target schools and posted booklists for 57 schools on its web site the company sold to an average of 35 percent of the students at each of the original five schools and 5 percent of the students at each of the new schools the company sold books to students at approximately 1200 colleges and universities across the country moreover revenues grew from approximately 100000 in the fall of 1998 to 145 million in the spring of 1999 this growth was accomplished by increasing the number of schools where the company marketed from five in fall 1998 to 74 in the spring 1999 same school orders increased by 200 from the fall to the spring semester in addition the company increased its student marketing representative organization from less than 50 in the fall to 300 in the spring more important however is the upcoming fall semester for which varsitybooks is preparing to market directly to 3 million students with student representative organization of 1800 featuring the booklists of 250 universities on its web site including large state universities private colleges and community colleges the company will also be posting booklists for its partnerships with high schools colleges and distance learning programs to support the demand baker taylor has agreed to stock 25 million in inventory in addition the research firm media metrix ranked varsitybooks the number one collegetargeted web site for january 1999 leading all college oriented sites with 283000 unique visitors currently varsitybooks is the categorykiller in the online textbook market and already one of the most recognized college brands in the country given that 90 of the 15 million us college students use the internet this strong firstmover advantage has allowed the company to begin to compile valuable database of customer data on this coveted demographic key differentiation from its competitors the company has three key competitive advantages 1 proprietary method of assembling booklists obtaining course book lists from universities is long tedious and difficult process many universities do not make these lists readily available to people outside the university community in addition many of these lists are not in standard formats or are even gathered electronically the company has developed proprietary method for gathering and posting booklists from universities across the country greatly increasing the convenience of customers shopping experience 2 nationwide student representative network varsitybooks employs nationwide network of student representatives reps to market directly on campus reaching into classrooms student organizations and dormitories by this fall this powerful grassroots marketing tool will be fueled by approximately 1800 handpicked highly trained reps managed at regional and corporate level in addition to driving market share and keeping pulse on the environment at campus level this network represents potent revenue stream as other companies have already expressed an interest in utilizing the companys reps to market their own goods and services the sheer size of this organization can be an effective barrier to entry for other companies wanting to reach students in similar fashion 3 relationship with baker taylor

streamsecommerce opportunity the company believes that it is ideally positioned to supplement its retailing revenue by offering other products or services over time the company expects to be

textbook purchases textbook purchases are split into three categories sales from targeted schools or schools to which the company directly markets nontargeted schools or consumers and partnership schools or schools who varsitybooks has contracted with the school to provide all its textbook sales even with modest penetration rates the company can scale quickly in these markets 2 purchases of

services other companies have already expressed interest in paying the company for its use of varsitybooks network of 1800 student representatives nationwide 4 indirect revenue as the companys user base builds varsitybooks becomes natural destination site the company expects that it will become an indirect sales channel for other service or product providers the company expects to receive transaction fees on the sales of these other products 5 advertising given the highly targeted nature of varsitybooks customer base the company expects the site to be attractive to advertisers the company has not projected significant advertising revenues outsourced distribution and fulfillment model varsitybooks is able to offer discounts of up to 40 percent on new college textbooks combined with direct delivery to students dormitory and flat rate shipping because of its unique distribution and fulfillment model because of its exclusive relationship with baker taylor varsitybooks has scaleable model that allows the company to grow rapidly while keeping overhead costs low baker taylor orders the companys requested titles directly from publishers and warehouses the books in its largest facility varsitybooks has sophisticated it infrastructure that seamlessly passes customer orders to baker taylor who then dropships the books under the varsitybooks name via ups directly to

advantage and erects natural barriers to entry strong management team the companys founders eric kuhn and tim levy are young entrepreneurs who have captured significant mindshare for varsitybooks among the college student market as the company began to grow rapidly the founders recognized the need to augment the senior management team with experienced individuals for detailed description of the companys executive management team please contact megan mcgovern at 202 6261275 ability to attract customers by wordofmouth branding given that traditional textbook shopping is generally negative experience students are looking for any possible way to make their experience better as more and more students have positive shopping experiences at varsitybooks they will spread the word to their friends given the closeknit nature of the college environment varsitybooks brand name has spread quickly with relatively small marketing expenditures investment risks valuation varsitybooks premoney valuation of 60 million is high relative to the companys stage of development and the 225 million postmoney valuation of the previous round completed in february 1999 but it reflects the progress varsitybooks has made to date and the size of the opportunity the company is pursuing the company has grown from 100000 in revenues at the end of 1998 to 2 million in revenues for the six months ended june 1999 and is on track to do over 7 million in revenues for the year the existing investors have committed an additional 75 million in this round affirming strong commitment to the company while we are not basing our investment decision on other firms actions competitors and other companies at similar stage of development have been valued at significantly higher multiples in both private and public financings ie drugstorecom onsalecom etoyscom critical path in addition our own analysis of varsitybooks business model leads us to conclude that the likely returns are very attractive if the company continues to execute as it is currently competition varsitybooks has done well at penetrating its target market in short period of time traditional brickandmortar college bookstores are the companys primary competition as they have held nearmonopoly over the college bookbuying market however faced with high overhead these stores cannot profitably discount textbooks to the levels that varsitybooks can furthermore these stores are unable to compete with the companys nonprice advantages such as direct home delivery and the ability to shop twentyfour hours day seven days week however the company faces direct and potential competition from three different types of companies 1 existing brickandmortar stores that are forming an internet presence companies in this category include the traditional large monopolistic oncampus textbook retailers such as barnes noble college stores textbookscom follett college bookstores efollettcom wallaces bookstores ecampuscom and the national association of college stores coursewebcom in addition to managing college stores these companies are the leading usedbook wholesalers in the country and as such each sells books to hundreds of schools across the country the channel conflicts these companies face make it difficult for them to realize the value of an internetbased business in an effort to not cannibalize their own brickandmortar sales they have focused on selling used books however used books are poor online purchase because used book is not commodity good and the purchaser is likely to demand the ability to touch and feel book before they buy it uniformly these companies launched internet stores as defensive tactic to retain market share 2 pureplay internet textbook startup companies companies in this category include venturefunded companies such as bigwordscom or other startups such as classbookcom neither of these companies have the brand presence of varsitybooks however bigwords has recently received venture capital financing and is trying to catch up to varsitybooks market lead bigwords does not have booklists on university basis nor do they have an agreement with large textbook distributor as the company does instead bigwords has opted to build its own warehouses increasing its infrastructure costs 3 onlinebook retailers companies in this category include amazoncom and borderscom which do offer textbook titles in their databases but not wide selection mainly because they are focused on the mass market in addition they do not generally discount textbooks or stock them for immediate shipping moreover the textbooks are not organized according to school booklists and so it is difficult for students to find the needed titles as it expands beyond textbooks varsitybooks is likely to face competition from several of the collegefocused web sites that hope to become content driven collegiate portals such as embarkcom or universityaccesscom the company believes that its strategy of starting with textbook sales and establishing beachhead in the college market based on saving students time and money will as it grows give it significant advantage over these other web sites the companys textbook strategy has enabled it to gain rapid market share begin building highly leverageable database of student preferences demographics and purchasing behavior most important the textbook strategy has allowed the company to build categorykiller studentfriendly brand moreover the companys unique network of student reps will compound these strategic advantages execution risk as competitors emerge in attacking the college student market varsitybooks will need to execute its business plan quickly to capture market share among its demographic the management teams web knowledge and experience should enable the company to continue to carry out its plan access to capital the company does not expect to be cash flow positive until 2001 assuming the current market environment and the company meets its projections an initial public offering is likely in the year 2000 assuming that the public market is not viable alternative during this time period the company must be able to raise enough capital in the private markets to sustain its operations under this scenario the management has identified key variable costs that can be reduced while still maintaining growth strategy because of seasonal nature of the business the company can adjust its marketing strategy accordingly during the year in addition because the company has overhead for its fulfillment its fixed costs are relatively low projected financials revenues for the company grew from approximately 100000 in the fall of 1998 to 145 million in the spring of 1999 this growth was accomplished by increasing the number of schools where the company marketed from five in the fall of 1998 to 74 in the spring 1999 also sameschool orders increased by 200 from the fall to the spring semester currently the company has revenues of 17 million for the 6 months ended june 30 1999 actuals in thousands 6 months ended 1998a 63099 revenue 131 1727 operatingincome 1892 3994 loss net income
