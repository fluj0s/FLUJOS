renewable energy and dinner with the usspain council hosted by the ambassador in addition senator martinez gave an interview to pais newspaper senators grassley and thune met with senior official at the ministry of industry tourism and trade to discuss us pork exports end summary prince of asturias 2 sbu shortly after their arrival january 10 senators martinez grassley thune and craig were received by the prince of asturias at zarzuela palace the prince stressed the importance for spain of maintaining excellent relations with the us and his commitment to improving those relations the prince reminisced happily about his travels in the us and expressed great fondness for the country he had clearly been following the us presidential primaries and sought the senators views on the process mariano rajoy 3 sbu the delegation met at pp headquarters with presidential candidate mariano rajoy rajoy noted that with less than two months to go before the spanish general elections the polls showed him in tie with zapatero and his spanish socialist workers party psoe rajoy said his campaign would focus on the economy nationalism and terrorism on the economy he said polls showed it to be the number one issue rajoy said zapatero had lived for four years off the inheritance of the previous pps governments good economic management rajoy said the macroeconomic indicators were still good but people were beginning to feel the pinch of inflation running above the eu average he also said interest rates were rising serious worry in nation of 44 million with eight million mortgages rajoy said zapatero had not defended spain the oldest national identity in europe from the demands of radical regional groups with nationalistic aspirations on terrorism rajoy contrasted pp firmness with zapateros attempt to negotiate with eta 4 sbu in foreign policy rajoy said he would defend democracy freedom human rights and western values he said spain and europe needed the best possible relationship with the us rajoy noted spain had once been reliable ally of the us he promised that as president he would speak his mind and avoid surprises rajoy said spain should play significant role in latin america and should promote democracy freedom and human rights in the region which was suffering some unacceptable leaders at the moment he said the pp position regarding venezuela was well known populism was not the direction the people of latin america were moving he expressed strong disagreement with zapateros cuba policy and voiced concern over treatment of dissidents in cuba rajoy noted spains position on cuba was important within the eu rajoy insisted he would fulfill spains commitments abroad which would be in defense of western values he said it was difficult but the public would understand the need for overseas engagement if the problems were explained to them he said spain would continue in afghanistan and noted the while in opposition the pp had supported sending troops abroad rajoy said the pp opposed spains 2004 withdrawal from iraq which he characterized as mistake albeit one that won the psoe votes 5 sbu although he did not indicate he would make it campaign issue rajoy noted spain was number two in the world behind the us in terms of the numbers of immigrants received over ten percent of the population was of foreign origin and there was large muslim immigrant population he said immigration was beginning to cause problems as ordinary spaniards saw their access to social services affected he mentioned public health was 40 percent of spains budget he said the pp was against illegal immigration and in favor of orderly migration flows he condemned zapateros amnesty for nearly one million illegal immigrants saying it had drawn new immigrants and noted that migratory pressures from africa were only increasing 6 sbu rajoy mentioned that while minister of interior he was the first european minister to visit the us after the madrid 00000098 002 of 005 911 attacks he said the west needed to invest more resources in educating people about democratic values he criticized the zapatero governments alliance of civilizations aoc effort saying it was an electoral ploy he said the left wing in spain and elsewhere tried to use the popular media and entertainment figures to convince people that they favored peace while center right parties such as the pp in spain favored war he said this had to be countered through education 7 sbu asked about voter turnout rajoy said this was big unknown he said in 2000 the pp won an absolute majority in congress in 2004 they lost by about five percent because zapatero was able to mobilize socialist voters using the iraq war and the atocha bombings he characterized 2004 as vote against the pp rather than for the psoe rajoy predicted the antipp vote would not be there this year he said the pp base was very loyal and would vote so the question was many socialist actually turned out he noted in 2004 polls should him eight points ahead the day of the atocha bombings and he lost by five points the following sunday rajoy noted that the polls in the 2007 municipal elections predicted pp defeat in fact the pp won he said turnout and loyalty were key he claimed polls showed 85 percent of pp voters were loyal but only 72 percent of psoe voters he said his strategy was to reach out to the center and the opposition rather than to his base he said this was to avoid mobilizing the psoe base and increasing their turnout rajoy mentioned that convincing the media which supported the pp to avoid antagonizing the left was challenge noting he had been campaign manager both times he noted aznars 1996 campaign was aggressive whereas in the even more successful 2000 campaign the pp had behaved like nuns rajoy said the costs of campaigning in spain were negligible compared to the us he said in spain as opposed to the us it was important not to let people know how much money you had raised since voters would turn against the candidate with the most money he noted the parties were prohibited from buying advertising until the last two weeks and so they had to earn media coverage in the meantime and were heavily focused on the internet which he said was the only way to reach young voters he said the party was commissioning two polls month and would move to daily polling in the last two weeks rajoy joked that after long and intensive study of the science of polling he had concluded he knew nothing about polls he said most of the pp money would be spent on radio and billboard advertising he noted he was on the trail four out of every seven days rajoy said the debates scheduled for february 25 and march 3 could be decisive since they came so late in the process he mentioned that the pp was also hitting family issues noting the psoe favored gay marriage rajoy said there were 15 million absentee voters number he said was significant in terms of the spanish electorate he recalled that in recent election the pp had lost seat in galicia because hugo chavez had sequestered the mail from venezuela which rajoy was sure contained heavy pp vote since spaniards there were unhappy with the psoes failure to stand up to chavez rajoy mentioned the pp had an office in washington and their representative there was part of the partys governing committee he also sought the senators views on the us presidential campaign jose maria aznar 8 sbu on january 11 codel martinez held wideranging discussion with former spanish president jose maria aznar that touched on the electoral outlook in spain and the us as well as aznars strong opinions on kosovo turkey and the alliance of civilizations president aznar told the codel that he held real reservations about kosovos independence concerns he mentioned he had conveyed to senator lieberman the night before aznar said he believed international acceptance of unilateral declaration of independence udi would lead to three undesirable results the facto acceptance of changed borders in europe as consequence of blackmail the establishment of principle of selfdetermination that would have ramifications in spain italy turkey iraq and other states with minority populations and the rise of nationalism on the european continent aznar said he feared the explosive mixture of nationalism and changing borders and would prefer kosovo remain protectorate for the next century rather than have udi be accepted by much of the international community 9 sbu aznar opined that turkeys eu bid was impossible at present and would continue to be so for perhaps the next 15 years the former president said that while europe should certainly look to forge and maintain special relationship with turkey it was hard for him to imagine muslimmajority country fitting into europe of christian roots he said madrid 00000098 003 of 005 that eu and us leaders needed to consider just what the turkey factor would mean to europe with the addition of 100 million muslims 10 sbu aznar voiced skepticism regarding the aoc he said during his term in office he visited iran and worked closely with former iranian president khatemi to establish dialogue of civilizations but that he could not see the desirability or feasibility of forming an alliance with figures such as supreme leader khamenei aznar said that the aoc was not in the best interests of the west he mentioned that he maintains good relations with turkish president erdogan and claimed to have it on good authority that erdogan was taking an active role in zapateros aoc not because he necessarily believed in it but because he hoped it would help turkeys eu bid 11 sbu aznar concluded the meeting with discussion of the role of his think tank the foundation for social analysis and studies faes he said that faes was set up in the european liberal tradition and was intended to defend the values of the western world and an atlantic policy faes seeks to strengthen the useu pillar and believes that an atlantic europe is the only possibility for the continent renewable energy 12 u at lunch on renewable energy hosted by the american chamber of commerce the senators and spanish companies discussed the status of several forms of renewable and lowemission energy ambassador aguirre and amcham president jaime malet opened with remarks describing spanish and us leadership in the sector and emphasizing the amount of spanish investment in renewables projects in the us ambassador aguirre described the february renewable energy trade and investment mission post is organizing with the gos to bring spanish government officials and companies to the us senators grassley and thune discussed biofuels which senator grassley noted were likely to shift away from the present emphasis on cornbased ethanol to cellulosebased ethanol after the next 510 years senators grassley and thune explained their states favorable location for wind power iowa has spanish investment in both wind farms and wind turbine manufacturing plant while senator martinez noted that the us geographic variability meant that an identical national renewable portfolio standard for each state would be unfair to states such as florida that lacked commercially viable quantities of wind senator craig and ambassador aguirre emphasized the importance of technological advances in addressing energy dependence and climate change senator craig described us climate change policy outlined the us national energy laboratories role in technological research and reviewed issues related to nuclear and clean coal technology spanish company representatives described spains system of incentives for electricity from renewable sources spains system is based on guaranteed prices while us incentives are mainly taxrelated and expressed interest in investment opportunities in the us in electricity transmission as well as generation participants from both countries emphasized the importance of encouraging renewable energy as an alternative to dependence upon hydrocarbon imports from undemocratic suppliers cuban dissidents 13 sbu senators martinez and craig joined by the ambassador and deputy chief of mission met january 11 with cuban dissidents hector palacios and his wife gisela delgado palacios briefed the senators on his personal situation saying he had been released from jail at the petition of the spanish government in order to come to spain to receive medical treatment while appreciated spains help he did not agree with spains policy of engagement with the cuban regime or with gestures such as the 2007 moratinos visit to cuba he said he and his wife had made public statements critical of spanish policy and as result the spanish had cut his per diem allowance and moved him to cheaper hotel he said moratinos had not seen him and instead he dealt with the director general for iberoamerica 14 sbu palacios said political control in cuba was fragmenting into three or four different groups fidel had been the glue that held it together each group had somewhat different agenda their common goal was to stay in power palacios said cuba was ripe for change he said the military would not be major obstacle once change began because conscription meant that the military reflected the people also fidels policy of rotating troops regularly underneath their officers had had its intended effect of madrid 00000098 004 of 005 preventing the formation of units personally loyal to their commanders he said greater problem would the large system of repression fidel had created the ministry of interior neighborhood committees bands of thugs who attacked and intimidated dissidents there were about 200000 people in this system and they were the ones who lived well and who had great deal to lose even those within government would find these people formidable obstacle if they tried to promote change 15 sbu palacios said us assistance was not reaching the dissidents he noted the irony of being jailed as an agent of us imperialism when the actual amount of usg funding was minimal he said they ran into problems doing things as simple as finding the small amounts of money needed to bring dissidents from one part of the island to another to attend demonstrations he said he planned to travel to washington and miami soon and intended to raise this issue in both places national security advisor casajuana and foreign minister moratinos 16 sbu senators martinez and craig joined by senator lieberman met january 11 with carles casajuana and discussed afghanistan lebanon morocco cuba and the aoc also on january 11 codel martinez met with fm moratinos where the conversation touched on afghanistan the middle east peace process syria venezuela cuba and the aoc both meetings are reported via septels agricultural trade issues 17 sbu on january 11 senators charles grassley and john thune together with the deputy chief of mission agcouns and econoff met with the ministry of industry tourism and trades secretary of state for international trade pedro mejia and secretary general alfredo bonet senator grassley emphasized the importance of sciencebased decisions in the agricultural biotechnology context mejia said that spain had relatively liberal view with respect to biotechnology however even in spain the technology was controversial and faced ngo opposition albeit not as strong as in some other eu member states senator thune asked what influence spain could exercise in brussels on this issue bonet noted it was very difficult to get qualified majority for biotech approvals in the eu environment council so in the end the commission was taking decisions in favor of biotechnology both mejia and bonet noted that commodity price hikes might spur greater liberalization on biotech imports the secretary of state asked about the status of the proposed elimination of the splash and dash tax credit loophole that allows biodiesel producers in the us to import commodities such as soybeans add minimal amount of petroleum diesel and then reexport the biodiesel european producers have complained about these imports the senator promised to get back to the secretary of state on the status of the proposed elimination of the loophole mejia said that he was pessimistic about the prospects for doha because major developing countries were not willing to give sufficiently in terms of industrial and services market access he emphasized especially spains interest in better services access he noted also that with high agricultural commodity prices some developing countries now did not see why they should give on industrial goods and services access he said that the us was still under pressure to do more on domestic agricultural support spains senior trade representative asserted that the eu had made good agricultural access offer the senators expressed support for doha but were pessimistic about getting support for trade promotion authority tpa this year finally there was lively discussion of secretary of state mejias february energy renewables trip to sipdis the us both senators grassley and thune were very interested in the mission comment this was very good substantive discussion however it is clear that while spain will continue sometimes to vote in favor of biotechnology liberalization proposals the spaniards will tread warily on this issue given their own domestic sensitivities and other equities spain has in the eu it was interesting to hear mejias strong emphasis on services as the future of spains economy unfortunately spanish services companies have not been aggressive in promoting doha although this is true of many other services companies in europe as well
