version of this report crs report 98326 privacy an overview of federal statutes governing wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping the 1927 radio act outlawed intercepting and divulging private radio messages the 1934 communications act extended the interception and divulgence ban to telephone and telegraph communications federal law condemned secretly capturing face to face conversations by using hidden microphones or their ilk and police and federal authorities employed them with increasing regularity then in the late 1960s the supreme court held that the privacy crs2 protection afforded by the fourth amendments warrant requirements enveloped all that over which an individual might have justifiable expectation of privacy including under the appropriate circumstances the individuals conversations in anticipation of the courts announcement several states had enlarged the powers of their courts to issue wiretapping andor electronic eavesdropping warrants the court however found one of the more detailed of these constitutionally deficient congress responded with title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act to provide constitutionally viable procedure under which state and federal courts might approve wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping orders title iii at the same time outlawed wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping except under court order or with the consent of one of the parties to the conversation title iii regulated capture of the spoken word it did nothing to protect the more modern forms of communication fax messages email electronically transmitted data congress recast title iii in the electronic communications privacy act ecpa to correct this oversight it responded to supreme court opinion again this one describing the presidents inherent authority to approve warrantless wiretapping of purely domestic threats to national security with the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa fisa creates judicial warrant procedure for

crime the communication facilities or place where the interception is to occur the communications to be intercepted the identities if known of the person committing the offense and of the persons whose communications are to be intercepted why alternative investigative methods would be futile or dangerous the duration of the proposed interception steps taken to avoid interception of innocent

disclosed to law enforcement or intelligence officers for the performance of their official duties and as evidence during legal proceedings in emergency cases involving organized crime threats to national security or immediate danger of death or serious injury interceptions may be authorized by senior officials before the issuance of an order in such cases court approval must be sought within 48 hours and the interception abandoned and an inventory of the results turned over to the communicants if approval is denied crs4 any federal prosecutor may approve an application for court order authorizing the interception of email or other electronic communications upon probable cause of felony and the other requirements for issuance and execution of search warrant with regard to stored email or voice mail communications in remote storage and telephone and service provider records government officials may gain access to electronic communications in electronic storage for less than six months under search warrant issued upon probable cause to belief crime has been committed and the search will produce evidence of the offense the government must use the same procedure to acquire older communications or those stored in remote computer storage if access is to be afforded without notice to the subscriber or customer if the government officials are willing to afford the subscriber or customer prior notice access may be granted under court order showing that the information sought is relevant and material to criminal investigation or under an administrative subpoena grand jury subpoena trial subpoena or court order general identifying and billing information is available to the government pursuant to an administrative subpoena grand jury or trial subpoena warrant with the consent of the subscriber or customer or under court order issued with showing that information is relevant and material to criminal investigation federal government attorneys and state and local police officers may apply for court order authorizing the installation and use of pen register andor trap and trace device upon certification that the information to be produced is relevant to pending criminal investigation the approval procedure under the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa is the most distinctive of the wiretaprelated procedures first its focus is different it is designed to secure foreign intelligence information not evidence of crime although the prospect of securing evidence is not disqualifying as long as there is measurable foreign intelligence purpose it operates in highly secretive manner and it is conducted entirely before the judges of an independent court convened for other purpose the contents of fisa surveillance application and subsequent order include the identity of the applicant and an authorizing official particularized information concerning the facilities or locations involved in the interception and of the foreign agent or power whose communications are the target of the interception detailed description of the communications to be intercepted and summary of the minimization procedures to be followed certification that the information cannot reasonable be obtained using alternative means whether the information relates to foreign attack sabotage terrorism or foreign clandestine intelligence activities the means of accomplishing the interception history of past related applications the term of the interception any other information the judge requests fisa court judges issue orders approving electronic surveillance upon finding that the application requirements have been met and that there is probable cause to believe that the target of the interceptions is foreign power or the agent of foreign power and the targeted places or facilities are used by foreign powers of their agents as in the case of law enforcement wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping there is authority to intercept prior to approval in emergency situations but there is also statutory authority for foreign intelligence surveillance interception without court order when the communications crs5 sought are limited to those among or between foreign powers or involve nonverbal communications from places under the open and exclusive control of foreign power the second of these is replete with reporting requirements to congress and the fisa court in addition to surveillance provisions fisa authorizes court orders in foreign intelligence cases for physical searches the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices and for the release of business records and other tangible items the physical search sections mirror those governing electronic surveillance fisa pen register and trap and trace procedures are similar to those of their law enforcement counterparts in ecpa but with many of the attributes of other fisa provisions the orders may be issued either by member of the fisa court or by fisa magistrate upon the certification of federal officer that the information sought is likely to be relevant to an investigation of international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities they allow the attorney general to authorize emergency installation and use as long as the application for an authorizing court order is filed within 48 hours and restrict the use of any resulting evidence if an order is not subsequently granted the provisions for use of the information acquired run parallel to those that apply to fisa surveillance and physical search orders the usa patriot act and later the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act temporarily rewrote the fisa business records procedure that expires on december 31 2009 in its temporary form fisa orders may apply to any tangible property relevant to foreign intelligence investigation recipients may challenge the legality of the order and ask that its secrecy requirements be lifted or modified as additional safeguards congress insisted upon the promulgation of miminization standards established use restrictions required the approval of senior officials for orders covering library and certain other types of records confirmed and reenforced reporting requirements and directed the justice departments inspector general to conduct an audit of the use of the fisa tangible item authority protect america act the protect america act pl 11055 which has since expired granted the attorney general and the director of national intelligence the power under limited conditions to authorize gathering foreign intelligence information including by electronic surveillance for up to year relating to persons believed to be overseas in order to exercise that power the attorney general and the director of national intelligence were required to certify under oath that the collection effort involved 1 procedures reasonably calculated to assure that the information sought concerned person outside the united states 2 communications to which service providers or others had access 3 desire at least in significant part to gather foreign intelligence information 4 accompanying minimization procedures and 5 electronic surveillance other than that directed at person reasonably believed to be abroad 50 usc 1805baexpired that having been done or in emergency situations with their oral approval the attorney general and director of national intelligence might direct the communications providers or others with access to immediately assist in the gathering of the foreign intelligence information in manner least disruptive of service to the target and under confidentiality restrictions imposed by the attorney general and the director of national intelligence the directive came with the promise of compensation at prevailing rates as crs6 well as immunity from civil liability and was enforceable through the contempt power of the fisa court recipients were entitled to seek judicial modification of directive issued contrary to the statute or otherwise unlawfully in the fisa court under expedited procedures the fisa court was also tasked with the responsibility of reviewing the procedures crafted to ensure that the authority was only invoked with respect to persons reasonably believed to be found overseas should the court have determined that the procedures were clearly erroneous the government was free to amend them or to appeal the determination initially to the foreign intelligence surveillance court of review and then to the supreme court foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 amendments act of 2008 pl 110261 pl 110261 hr 6304 signed july 10 2008 addresses four fisa related matters first in manner reminiscent of the protect america act it provides temporary authority to gather foreign intelligence information from or relating to overseas targets second it reasserts the exclusivity of fisa and title iiiecpa as basis for governmental electronic surveillance third it instructs the inspectors general in various agencies to conduct review and report to congress on the terrorist surveillance program fourth it seeks to protect those who assist government surveillance activities from civil liability for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98327
