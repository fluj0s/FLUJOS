established in 1998 and 1999 the senate bill has provision repeal of oil and gas tax incentives the house bill would obtain tax revenue offsets by reducing subsidies for oil and natural gas production the senate bill has provision renewable energy electricity production tax credit ptc the house bill would extend the ptc for four years and expand it to include some additional resources the senate bill has provision other tax incentives the house bill would extend several investment tax credits covering solar energy and energy efficiency in residential and commercial sectors the senate bill has provision energy efficiency equipment standards key differences involve standards for residential refrigerators freezers refrigeratorfreezers metal halide lamps and commercial walkin coolers and

provisions of the two bills there are several provisions where the two bills are very similar one example is energy efficiency standards where the house and senate provisions have more similarities than differences however especially among the more controversial provisions many either have major differences or the provision appears only in one bill one key challenge will be to resolve such differences second challenge involves additional action that will be required to get bill to conference committee because the house and senate have passed different measures constitutionally required congressional procedures prevent the tw bills hr 3221 and hr 6 from going to conference in their current form further action will be needed on at least one of the two bills in at

senate takes up hr 3221 amends it however it wishes and then pass the bill as the senate version of hr 3221 then conference could be held to resolve any remaining differences between the two versions of hr 32211 third challenge involves opposition to the bills expressed by the administration in june 12 2007 statement of administration policy on hr 6 the administration expressed several points of opposition to the senate bill2 its primary concerns involved issues related to oil and natural gas the administration stated that the bill does nothing to increase domestic supplies of oil and natural gas moreover it threatened to veto the bill if it retained price gouging provision which it feels would lead to problematic gasoline price controls another veto threat was focused on the proposal to subject foreign oil cartels to the jurisdiction of us courts additional concerns were identified one concern focused on the explicit 35 mpg fuel economy target in the cafe provision and the proposal to set standards for medium and heavyduty trucks for the rfs provision the administration strongly urged expansion to include fossilbased alternative fuels regarding loan guarantees the administration stated opposition to loosening of controls over program size and special treatment that would allow guarantees for biofuels projects to be increased to from 80 to cover up to 100 of project costs in an august 3 2007 statement of administration policy on hr 2776 and hr 3221 the administration expressed several points of opposition to the house bill 3 its primary concerns were focused on oil and natural gas it stated that because the two bills would lead to less domestic oil and gas production higher energy costs and higher taxes the presidents senior advisors would recommend that he veto these bills other concerns included the proposed repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for the oil and gas industry the application of royalty requirements for certain offshore oil and gas leases issued in 1998 and 1999 increased authorization for clean renewable energy bonds and expansion of the davisbacon prevailing wage requirements
