since the fall of the saddam hussein regime in 2003 and developments in iraq have had political economic and security implications for iraqs neighbors and the broader middle east declining levels of violence in iraq and discussion of options for modifying us policy toward iraq are fueling consideration of iraqs future and the current and potential policies by iraqs neighbors policymakers and observers are now considering several potential iraq scenarios ranging from the resolution of outstanding iraqi political disputes and the successful consolidation of iraqs government and security forces to competition among iraqs neighbors for influence in iraq or the return to widespread civil violence understanding regional perspectives on iraq and the potential nature and likelihood of regional policies toward iraq will be essential for members of the 111 th congress as they consider the future of us policy including troop withdrawal options the implementation of usiraq security agreements and annual appropriations and authorization legislation the national intelligence estimate nie on iraq released in august 2007 assessed that iraqs neighbors will continue to focus on improving their leverage in iraq in anticipation of coalition drawdown the nie identified iranian assistance to armed groups and the reluctance of iraqs sunni arab neighbors to support the iraqi government as particularly problematic this report provides information about the current perspectives and policies of iraqs neighbors analyzes potential regional responses to continued insurgency

and the policies of ir aqs neighbors will be relevant to members of the 111th congress as they consider troop withdrawal options the implementation of usiraq security agreements and annual appropriations and authorization legislation principal current concerns include alleged iranian political financial and military support for various iraqi shiite political parties and militia groups turkish military operations against the kurdistan workers party in northern iraq and sunni arab states anxiety about the future of iraqs minority sunni arab population and the growth of irans regional influence longer term concerns focus on the challenges likely to arise during the reintegration of deeply changed iraq into the regions strategic military balance and global economic and energy markets iraq and other regional security problems such as the israelipalestinian conflict the enduring threat of transnational terrorism irans nuclear program and the ongoing political crisis in lebanon have become increasingly intertwined some observers believe that in order for the united states and its allies to reach sustainable reconciliation and find lasting solution in iraq related regional crises also must be addressed others contend that lasting resolutions to these problems can only be secured according to their ow n timelines and that efforts to link them to the stabilization of iraq are unlikely to produce desirable results the iraq study group and others have argued that if iraqis are unable to resolve their differences and rein in armed groups then widespread violence could return to iraq should iraq stabilize iraqs neighbors are expected to deepen their economic and political reengagement with iraqis while seeking to minimize the potential for the postsaddam iraq to threaten their security or regional standing under any circumstances iraqs neighbors are expected to seek to defend their perceived national interests

distinct views and interests with regard to common set of policy questions about iraqs future as observers of and participants in iraqi affairs iraqs neighbors are seeking to understand and influence changes in the following five areas the regional strategic balance prospects for sectarian and ethnic violence in iraq and elsewhere the strength of iraqbased transnational terrorist groups the status of iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons and the emergence of viable long term ec onomic opportunities the manner in which the united states and regional parties prioritize and pursue their interests in these areas will determine whether greater cooperation or confrontation define iraqs future and its longterm relations with its neighbors

the removal of the saddam hussein regime upset the tenuous political and economic balance that had existed in the persian gulf region since the end of the 1991 gulf war in political and military terms the regimes fall and the subsequent dismantling of iraqs armed forces removed potential military threat to the arab gulf states but also eliminated key strategic counterweight r

shiitedominated government some of whose members are friendly to iranian interests in economic terms the termination of the sanctions on iraq created new trade and investment opportunities that have contributed to regional economic growth but have remained limited by ongoing violence other trends that have defined the postwar environment in iraq are reflected elsewhere in the region and are creating significant concern among regional powers the mobilization of populations along ethnic or sectarian lines and the emboldening of politically affiliated armed nonstate actors have upended established patterns of rule and challenged central government authority 1 from the us perspective regime change in iraq brought an end to the need for policy of containment toward iraq and the attendant us military posture that had supported it since the end of the 1991 gulf war stabilization and training efforts in iraq regional counterterrorism activities and the potential for confrontation with iran have replaced containment of saddams iraq as the principal strategic drivers of the us military presence in the region subsequent developments in iraq and with regard to potential iranian threats will affect future consideration of us basing access and prepositioning needs and by extension bilateral relations between the united states and number of regional governments 2 g21g142g140g157g138g155g146g138g151g561g138g151g141g561g7g157g145g151g146g140g561g18g152g149g146g157g146g140g156g561g138g151g141g561g24g146g152g149g142g151g140g142g561 the hardening of sectarian and ethnic identities in iraq has created significant anxiety among iraqs neighbors many of whom also have religiously and ethnically diverse populations sunni arab governments and religious figures have ch aracterized the empowerment of iraqs shiite arabs and close relationships between the iranian government and some iraqi and noniraqi shiite political parties and armed groups as evidence of an emerging and potentially hostile shiite crescent at the height of iraqs sectar ian violence sunni arabs in saudi arabia jordan and egypt accused iraqi shiite militia groups and shiitedominated iraqi security forces of targeting sunni arab civilians similarly shiites outside of iraq expressed alarm about the targeting of iraqi shiite civilians by sunni arabled insurgent and terrorist groups and the potential for sunni arabled governments to interv ene in iraqi affairs to the detriment of iraqi shiites turkish concerns about kurdish separatism and the fate of iraqs ethnicallyturkish turkoman minority group are well documented and continue to drive turkish policy regarding iraq the postsaddam strengthening of iraqi shiite political parties and the shiite hawza or religious establishment in the iraqi city of an najaf also have regional implications both phenomena contribute to concern in saudi arabia and bahrai n that indigenous shiite arabs may become more politically active or hostile based on the example of iraqs empowered shiite population or in response to future pronouncements from iraqbased clerics sectarian tension continues to characterize bahrains domestic politics and saudi arabias minority shiite population has come under renewed scrutiny from some sunni saudis in spite of recent efforts toward rapprochement led by saudi king abdullah iran the traditional target of sunni arab concerns about shiite interference also may harbor concerns that clerics in an najaf could challenge or undermine the religious authority of the hawza in the iranian city of qom 1 for discussion of these trends see graham fuller t he hizballahiran connection model for sunni resistance washington quarterly vol 30 1 winter 20062007 2 see dr w

neighbors have expressed concern about the establishment and growth of various transnational terrorist organizations in iraq since the fall of the saddam hussein regime still tenuous security progress and the inexperience of iraqs security establishment create the potential for chaotic iraq to serve as an ungoverned space that terrorist organizations can exploit under the late jordanian terrorist leader abu musab zarqawi qaeda in iraq grew to embody these fears by cr eating sophisticated iraqi and regional terrorist network that claimed responsibility for deadly attacks in neighboring jordan ethnic nationalist terrorist organizations such as the mojahedine khalq mekmko the party for freedom and life in kurdistan and the kurdistan workers pa rty pkk pose similar transnational threats to turkey and iran 3 from us perspective these groups may contribute to regional instability if their activities provoke hostile responses by iraqs neighbors as pkk terrorist attacks in turkey have in provoking turkish operations in northern iraq broader international concerns focus on foreign fighters who have fought coalition forces and the iraqi government in iraq although the overall numbers of volunteers reportedly remain limited and their survival rates are reported to be quite low the foreign fighter phenomenon has led many observers to suspect that noniraqi fighters who survive their experiences in iraq may attempt to follow the example of the socalled afghan arab veterans of the antisoviet war in afghanistan by returning to their countries of origin or traveling to other conflict zones and helping to ignite and sustain insurgencies and terrorist campaigns recent research has determined that experienced afghan arab fighters and their recent trainees formed the core cadre of qaeda in the arabian peninsula and contributed to the groups lethality and resilience in the face of saudi counterterrorism efforts4 continued coordination between the united states regional governments and the wider international community may be required to effectively stem any reverse flow of volunteers from iraq

serious humanitarian situation for millions of iraqis who have become internally displaced or have fled iraq to other regional countries noniraqi refugees within iraq also have suffered iraqs neighbors are faced with the dual pressures of responding to the displaced iraqis reaching their borders as well as to the needs of iraqis and noniraqis displaced within iraq at the popular level strong religious charitable imperatives and the bonds of ethnicity and sectarian concern have produced calls for greater involvement while in some countries the massive influx of iraqi refugees has created economic and political disruptions the united nations continues to call on the countries of the region and the international community to coordinate more effective relief response in the event of wider or lasting civil conflict those needs could increase substantially 3 the mek is designated by the us government as fo reign terrorist organization fto the us military and us intelligence services disarmed and screened over 3000 mek members present in iraq who remain at facility northeast of baghdad known as camp ashraf they have been granted protected persons status under the geneva

vast energy resources its large consumer market and its position as geographic crossroads make it an attractive economic partner for its neighbors and the international community however since 2003 the lingering effects of over decade of international sanctions and continuing postwar violence have created conditions that limit the ability of iraqs neighbors to expand trade with and investment in iraq to its full potential bilateral and intraregional trade levels have increased from the saddam era especially with regard to regional demand for iraqs energy resources however violence has limited the extent to which entities and individuals in the region have been willing and able to invest and conduct business in iraq over the medium to long term the rehabilitation of iraqs oil production infrastructure and the expansion of exploration and production are expected to increase the availability of oil and refined petroleum products in the region but may also create production quota competition within opec and affect prices and consumption patterns in global energy markets g11g155g138g154g514g156g561g8g158g157g158g155g142g561 the diversity of political actors in iraq and the confluence of regional and international policy problems with iraqi affairs complicate efforts to predict the course of events in iraq as us policy and circumstances in iraq and the region have

policymakers and the new iraqi government were the sunniled insurgency against coalition and iraqi forces the presence of foreign terrorist operatives in iraq and the gr owth of organized criminal activity such as kidnaping extortion and drug trafficking the bombing of an important shiite mosque in the iraqi city of samarra in february 2006 exacerbated preexisting cycles of retaliatory sectarian attacks between sunnis and shiites that continued in earnest through early 2007 leading many observers to characterize the violence between rival communities and militias as the beginnings of civil war us forces embarked throughout 2007 on efforts to reduce sectarian and ethnic violence which seriously jeopardized us security goals and prevented the emergence of stable iraqi government since november 2007 us and iraqi officials have presented statistics showing dramatic drop in sectarian violenceattributing the progress to the us troop surge and the ceasefire of the shiite jaysh mahdi jam militia affiliated with cleric moqtada sadr the return of widespread sectarian violence could rekindle domestic pressure on the governments of iraqs neighbors to intervene on behalf of members of specific sects or ethnic groups iran and turkey have engaged directly with iraqs kurdish and shiite arab populations respectively in order to secure their interests and guard against some of the potentially negative implications of these problems however irans intervention on behalf of iraqs shiites may be contributing to the persistence of sunniled resistance activities and iraqs kurds remain wary of turkish intentions particularly in light of ongoing turkish military operations in northern iraq against the pkk members of congress may be asked to consider various potential us responses to efforts by iraqs neighbors to influence developments in iraq through proxies or more direct intervention relations between iraq and its sunni arab neighbors remain characterized by limited diplomatic engagement limited investment and trade and general reluctance among sunni arab governments to embrace the iraqi government in much of the arab world governments and citizens remain divided on the question of whether the us military presence in iraq is an ultimately stabilizing or aggravating factor most arab governments fear general failure of the new iraqi government and the prospect of chaos that could leave iraqs minority sunni arab population vulnerable or create opportunities for terrorist elements to prosper many arab citizens oppose the continuing us military presence in iraq and some view the current iraqi government as an illegitimate outgrowth of us occupation reconciling these differences of opinion is likely to remain difficult and could complicate

reversing the deterioration in security that became acute by the end of 2006 attributing the sizable reductions in violence to the troop surge strategy announced by president bush on january 10 2007 and to developments in iraq such as the sadr ceasefire and the sunni awakening the administration believes that future us decisions about troop withdrawals should remain conditionsbased and that

majority preferences and thereby empowers potential shiite allies iran sees continued control by iraqs diverse shiite parties as providing iran with strategic depth and ensuring that iraq remains pliable and attentive to irans interests however irans reputed aid to some iraqi shiite parties and their militias has at times hindered us efforts to stabilize iraq and has heightened the us threat

irans strategy bore fruit with victory by shiite islamist bloc the united iraqi alliance or uia in the two national assembly elections in 2005 the uia bloc which won 128 of the 275 assembly seats in the december 15 2005 election includes irans primary shiite islamist proteges in iraqthe islamic supreme council of iraq isci and the dawa islamic call party prior to 2007 the uia also had the support of the faction of the mercurial young shiite cleric moqtada sadr but sadrs faction withdrew from the uia in september 2007 after the united states insisted that the iraqi government allow us forces to pursue mahdi army jaysh almahdi jam militiamen as part of the 2007 troop surge like his predecessor as prime minister ibrahim jafari the current prime minister nouri maliki is from the dawa party maliki spent most of his exile in syria most isci leaders spent their years of exile in iran and the organization is considered to be the most proiranian of iraqs shiite political groups the sadr

control of such shiite cities as diwaniyah karbala hilla nassiryah basra kut and amarah this caused backlash against sadr among iraqi shiite civilian victims particularly after the august 2007 jam attempt to take control of religious sites in karbala the backlash caused sadr to declare six month suspension of jam activities extended at six month increments since continuing to present evidence of iranian material assistance to shiite militias gen petraeus testified on april 89 2008 that iran continues to arm train and direct special groups radical and possibly breakaway elements of the jamand to organize the groups into hezbollahlike force to serve irans interests and fight proxy war against the iraqi state and coalition forces the testimony was delivered amidst an isf offensive launched by maliki on march 26 2008 to clear jam and fadhila party militiamen from basra particularly the port area which these militias controlled and used for financial benefit maliki reportedly launched the offensive in part to reduce sadrist strength in provincial elections planned for the fall of 2008 but now put off until early 2009 in the initial assault the isf units dominated by badr loyalists failed and partly collapsed but us and british forces intervened with air strikes and military advice helping the isf gain the upper hand and restore relative normality sadr who reportedly received iranian aid during the fighting agreed to an iranbrokered ceasefire on march 30 2008 but not to disarm some fighting and jam rocketing of us installations in baghdad continued subsequently in some cases killing us soldiers and us forces continued to fight jam elements in sadr city until another sadrgovernment agreement on may 10 2008 subsequently the isf moved into amarah unopposed on june 16 2008 and quieted that city in responding to malikis moves sadr told his followers on june 13 2008 that most of the jam would now orient toward peaceful activities clarified on august 8 2008 to be social and cultural work under new movement called mumahidun or trail blazers 2 that small corps of special companies would be formed from the jam to actively combat us but not iraqi forces in iraq and 3 in order to circumvent the governments demand that the jam be disbanded as condition for sadrist participation in the provincial elections the sadr movement would back technocrats and independents for upcoming provincial elections but not offer separate sadrist list however the number two us commander in iraq gen lloyd austin said on august 18 2008 that us forces were increasingly

governments restraint from over t involvement in the iraq conflict stands in contrast to reported patterns of private saudi support for anticoalition and antiiraqi government activity the saudi regime is likely to continue to refrain from providing direct support for insurgent forces in order to avoid confrontation with the united states and out of fear that the collapse of iraqs government could strengthen ir aqbased transnational terrorist elements hostile to the saud family however return to sectarian violence in iraq or more assertive iranian policy could undermine domestic support for

forbidding saudis from traveling to iraq to fight but popular support for antius or antiiranian activity may remain strong prince saud faisal has dismissed calls for direct involvement and has stated

nevertheless saudi officials have delayed full embrace of the current iraqi government and reportedly remain frustrated with what they perceive to be prime minister malikis antisunni sectarian policy approach and his administrations unduly close relationship with iran reconciliation and long term stability in iraq could ease saudi fears of creeping instability but could also create new challenges saudi arabias immediate concern remains the reintegration or elimination of returning saudi militants the outcome of reconciliation or conflict in iraq and the leadership and character of iraqs

intervention in iraq the s unni arabled governments of the gulf cooperation council had predicted that removing the saddam hussein regime would not necessarily produce stability in iraq and several were reluctant to support us military operations for the most part gulf leaders publicly indicated that they would only support us attack if such action were authorized by the united nations and had broad international support two of the gulf states kuwait and qatar were more openly supportive of us plans 60 the fall of the saddam hussein regime initially generated sense of relief by removing the principal conventional threat to the gulf states security however instability and violence in iraq coupled with arab perceptions of an emboldened and potentially hostile iran created new shared fears among gulf leaders during the period of escalating sectarian violence in iraq gulf leaders feared that sectarian clashes could draw in iraqs neighbors and bring them into conflict with iran despite the return of relative calm the rise of shiite islamist factions in postsaddam iraq has created residual threat perception among some in the gulf several of the gulf states have substantial shiite populations but most gulf shiite communities consider themselves to be under represented in government and to lack key economic opportunities nevertheless some gulf states have reached out to the iraqi government in an attempt to open new chapter in their respective bilateral relations in june 2008 the united arab emirates appointed an ambassador to iraq and the following month wrote off 7 billion including interest in iraqi debt bahrain also appointed an ambassador who presented his credentials in october 2008 gulf governments generally believe that parts of iraq could become safehaven for terrorists if security gains are reversed or if the united states were to withdraw militarily from iraq without ensuring that iraqi forces were adequately trained and equipped in response to these and other concerns the gulf states and the united states have renewed security discussions under the framework of multilateral consultations and bilateral consultations under the gulf security dialogue 61 59 prepared by christopher m blanchard analyst in middle eastern affairs and kenneth katzman specialist in middle eastern affairs 60 both governments hosted buildups of us forces and

november 22 2006 israeli prime minister ehud olmert claimed iraq without saddam hussein is so much better for the security and safety of the state of israel and praised president bush for his leadership63 olmert later added that the removal of saddam was major major contribution to stability in our part of the world64 yet israelis had not viewed iraq as significant threat after the first gulf war and other israeli voices have been skeptical about the chances of achieving the us goal of bringing democracy to the region via the second war many in israel are very concerned that as result of the war in iraq an arc of iranianled shiite enemies of israel including iran shiiteled iraq alawiteled syria and hezbollahdominated lebanon has emerged some maintain that permanently weak iraq would interrupt this geographicalideologicalsectarian formation and therefore would be in israels interest others see the need for stronger iraq to act as counterpoise to an iran elevated by the removal of saddam hussein from iraq and the taliban in afghanistan decentralization in iraq might accomplish the goals of the former analysts there have been reports that israelis are training the iraqi kurdish militia peshmerga and that israelis of kurdish origin are establishing economic ties in northern iraq iraqi kurdish leaders deny these reports while israeli officials insist that they continue to see iraq as one unit 65 as the debate about the future of us forces in iraq has intensified some israeli analysts have suggested that israeli interest would be served by continued us presence in iraq they argue that israels main interest is in not having the united states israels preeminent ally and benefactor perceived as weak or failing power in their view israel is less safe to the extent that the united states is so perceived66 the late israeli pundit zeev schiff suggested that israel could look forward to radical arab shift that will strengthen extremists if arabs interpret americas withdrawal as sign of defeat 67 in march 12 2007 speech prime minister olmert warned against the consequences of premature us withdrawal arguing that negative outcome would harm israel the gulf states and the stability of the middle east as well as the ability of the united states to address threats emerging from iran68 in the same vein israels ambassador to the united states sallai meridor expressed hope th at the withdrawal from iraq would be done in such way that does not strengthen iran and qaeda or boost organizations such as hezbollah and hamas so that we dont face

governments the concern over potential iraqi government cooperation with terrorist groups that drove us policy toward iraq in 2002 and early 2003 has given way to wider concern that instability in iraq created safehavens for expanded operations by qaeda and regional terrorist entities such as the pkk to some extent success against qaeda in iraq has reduced these threats although iranian and

differences and policy coordination mechanisms such as the gcc and the arab league israel and the sunni arabled governments of the region largely share us apprehension about irans regional ambitions
