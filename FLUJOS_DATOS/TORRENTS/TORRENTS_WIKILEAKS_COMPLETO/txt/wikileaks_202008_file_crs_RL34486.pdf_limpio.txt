1113 which provides the procedures that are to be followed if debtor in possession wants to reject collective bargaining agreement cba the changes proposed for 1113 may be intended to promote negotiation between the debtor and the authorized re presentatives of labor groups that have existing cbas with the debtor company they also appear to constrain court involvement in the process this could lead to more agreed upon modifications and fewer rejections of cbas alternatively it could prolong the negotiation process and put burdens on the debtor that would make liquidation more feasible than reorganization the bill prescribes the parameters of offers that may be made by the debtor in negotiations as well as the requirements that must be met before court can approve rejection it attempts to curtail what the sponsors have referred to as excesses of executive pay by making rejection of cba difficult if executives are to receive incentive pay and by requiring considerati on of past concessions by the labor group in determining whether the labor group is being disproporti onately burdened by proposed modifications to cba hr 3652 appears to propose changes to 1113 that would resolve some differences between courts in interpreting the requirements for modification or rejection of cba it also clearly states that rejection of cba is breach of contract even when approved by the cour t and clarifies the damages that are available the bill provides an absolute right of all employees to strike if their cba is modified or rejected th is contrasts with recent court decisions involving unions representing employees of financially distre ssed airlines in which the employees were enjoined from strikinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34486contents introduction 1 background 2

11 bankruptcies legal analysis of hr 3652 introduction chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code1 is used by financially troubled business debtors that want to reorganize their financial affairs so that they may remain in business rather th an liquidate although trus tee is appointed in chapter 7 liquidations in business reorganiza tion under chapte r 11 the debtor generally remains in possession and trustee is appointed2 thus allowing those most familiar with the business to c ontinue managing it the bankruptcy code generally provide s debtors the opportunity to either assume or reject executory contracts in existence at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed3 one sort of executory contract collective bargaining agreements cbas is treated somewhat differently althoug h rejection of any executory contract is subject to the approval of the court for most contracts the business judgment rule applies and courts ge nerally approve rejections that the debtor deems to be in its business interest rej ection of cbas must meet higher standard section 1113 of the bankruptcy code pr ovides the procedures that must be followed to reject cba recently intr oduced legislation would modify

code was amended to add 11 usc 11135 which outlines the requirements that must be met before court can approve rejection of collective bargaining agreement cba by debtor company using chapter 11 to reorganize the section applies only to chapter 11 bankruptcies although there are committee reports to explain the reason for adding 11 usc 1113 its addition followed the us supreme courts holding in national labor relations board v bildisco and bildisco 6 it is generally believed th at congress added the section in response to bildisco 7 bildisco was decided in february 1984 resolving split between the circuits regarding the standard for rejection of cb the court held that rejection required that the agreement be burdensome to the debtor company and that rejection was favored after balancing the equities of the specific case the court also held that the debtor in possession did not automatically assume the cba postpetition and would not violate 8a5 of the na tional labor relations act nlra8 if it unilaterally changed the terms of cba prior to the bankruptcy courts appr oval of rejection of that agreement9 by adding 1113 congress provided both procedure and standard

of changes to existing subsections of 11 usc 1113 as well as adding six new subsecti ons as written the bill would entirely replace the text of the first three subsecti ons however the actual change to the text of the first subsection is minimal at first glance the bill appears to make dramatic changes in the bankruptcy code but in some cases the bills language may be clarifying the code rather than substantively changing it in other cases the language in the bill may be intended to either legislate resolution of some point of law that has been disputed in the courts or legislatively overrule existing case law11 however since there are committee reports as yet crs cannot discern with cer tainty the sponsors intent in proposing the changes the proposed changes w ill be discussed in order subsection by subsection with accompanying discussion about the current state of the law including ambiguities in the current code various courts interpretations and scholarly writings about 11 usc 1113 all headings referencing subsection of 11 usc 1113 refer to the subsections as proposed by this bill 11 usc 1113a although the language of hr 3652 indicates that subsection is deleted entirely there is only one difference between the current text and the proposed text that is the remova l of the words assume or as currently written 11 usc 1113a states that debt or may assume or reject collective bargaining agreement only in accordance with the provisions of this section however that is the only time that assumption of cbas is referred to in the entire section courts generally have found that 11 usc 365 governs the assumption of cbas12 but removing assume from the language of 11 usc 1113a would seem to make it clear from the statute that nothing in 11 usc 1113 applies to assumptions of cbas note however lthough it would remove assume from this subsection the bill would add later subsection13 stating that assumptions of cbas are in accordance with 11 usc 365 which addresses executory contracts generally 11 usc 1113b hr 3652 would limit the modifications to the existing cba that can be proposed by the debtor the current law provides general guidance about

organization is signatory unless the organization declines or the court finds ot her representation appropriate 11 usc 1114c1 for section 1113 an authorized repres entative is the labor union that is signatory to the collective bargaining agreement for wh ich the debtor is proposing modifications in this memorandum representative will be used interchangeably with authorized representative when

necessary and failing to affirm the lower courts approval of rejection of cba because the lack of snapback provision in debtors proposal that included wage cuts that would persist for five years flawed the bankruptcy courts finding that the proposal was fair and equitable snapback provision is one that would later restore employees wages or be nefits that were reduced as concession to the financial difficulties of the company 20 hr 3652 81 amending 11 usc 1113c1ain contrast the bill would limit proposals to those that would 1 limit the effect of the labor groups financia l concessions

affecting the labor group for more than two years would assure labor groups that they would not be confronted with situations in which cbas rejection was approved by the court after the labor group

to successf ully reorganize modifications that can in just two years provide sufficient economic relief for the companys survival may necessarily require economic concessions from employees that are too burdensome to be acceptable because the effect on paychecks is too great conversely modifications that last more than two year s but also have smaller effect on paychecks may not provide suffi cient economic relief to allow the debtor company to survive effectively forcing the company into liquidation the bills second requirement for debtors proposals is that they must be more than the minimal savings necessary to permit the debtor to exit bankruptcy such that confirmation of such plan is not likel to be followed by the liquidation of the debtor21 it is questionable whether this will do anything to clarify existing law under which there have been conflicts22 over the meaning of necessary in the current requirement that the debtor ma ke proposal that provides for those necessary modifications in th employees benefits and pr otections that are necessary to permit reorganization23 some courts have held that necessary means the minimum needed to avoid immediate liquidation24 other courts have found that necessary is more lenient standard than essential and have looked at whether the modifications will ensure the debtors ability to survive reorganization25 by including the phrase such that confir mation of the plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation of the debtor it seems that the bill is intended to use the more lenient standard however the us of more than the minimal savings could cause court to use stricter standard if the bills language were strictly interpreted to mean that the debtor ma propose more than the absolute minimum savings the debtor might be in vi rtually untenable position one court in construing the current laws requirement that modificati ons be necessary to allow reorganization noted that in the context of this statute necessary must be read as term of lesser degree than essential to find otherwise would be to render the subsequent requirement of good faith negotiation whic h the statute requires must take

limitation on propos als looks only at the burdens that are pl aced on the groups with whom the debtor is expected to have continuing relationships rather than looking at whether all are being treat ed fairly and equitably as required by current law27 the proposed change would also specify management personnel as one of the groups to be considered in termining whether the labor group is being overly burdened throughout the history of 11 us c 1113 courts have considered management personnel when considering whether debt ors proposal treated all parties fairly and equitably28 however they have looke d at the whole picture rather than simply comparing burdens for exam ple proposal to reduce wages for union employees was considered fair and quitable even though some management employees

hr 3652 141 adding 11 usc 1100courts interpreted the rla as requiring labor groups to continue collective bargaining until there is possibility that the parties can agree at that point most would agree that the parties have reached an impasse if the changes to 1113c1 are adopted courts may need to determine if impasse is reached at some earlier point crs is uncertain how courts would construe the require ment that the parties be at impasse since the proposed bill in cludes the phrase further negotiations are not likely to produce mutually satisfactory agreement41 courts may use more likely than not standard if however the courts construed imp asse as equivalent to the recent court interpretations of the rla standard requiring an impasse as prerequisite to rejection could effectively eliminate most rejections possibly through attrition since bargaining may well c ontinue for considerable period of time before court would consider the parties at an impasse if the company were to delay filing for bankruptcy and try to negotiate modifications to the cba parties who had not been able to reach mutually satisfactory agreement might be considered to be at impasse when the bankruptcy case comme nces however whether the bargaining takes place before or after the bankruptcy filing if it takes place over an extended period of time company might be forced to liquidate rather than reorganize those opposing this provision are likely to argue th is would defeat the purpose of chapter 1142 and by not preserving jobs would not pr otect workers those in favor of this provision are likely to argue that it encourages the parties to negotiate modifications each can accept allowing the company to th continue with its workforce in place under revised cba 11 usc 1113c1a

evaluate the representatives proposals as possible alternatives to the current cba that the court might be able to impose on both the debtor and the labor group in lieu of outright rejection on the other hand could it mean that the court is simply to look at the representatives proposals to determine whether they all meet the requirements of the subparagraphs if they do is the court then powerless to change the status quo of the cba there is nothing in the bill that explicitly gives the court the discretion to evaluate the representativ counterproposals and subs titute one for the existing cba however nothing in the current 11 usc 1113c gives courts the power to impose the debtors last proposal on bot h the debtor and the labor group after the court has approved rejec tion yet courts have exercised that power43 inconsistencies between courts in applying the current law appear to be part of the impetus behind hr 365244 allowing the courts more discretion might increase those inconsistencies and lead to more f orum shopping in bankruptcy filings courts might construe proposed subsection c1 as simply providing prerequisites that must be met before cba can be rejected in this case proposed subparagraphs and b might act as constraint on negotiations by the representative since liquidation of th company normally would involve loss of jobs it may be in the labor groups interest to make cessions if the debtor cannot reorganize without those concessions howe ver as noted earlier at times the burden on employees would be too great if th required economic relief provided to the employer were concentrated in period of two years to lessen the immediate impact on employees paychecks representative might want to spread the effect of the financial concessions over three years ra ther than two however representative might be reluctant to offer such propos if making it w ould open th door for courtapproval of rej ection this might create bu iltin conflict between the labor groups interest in avoiding rejection of the cba and its interest in preserving jobs by making sufficient concessions to the btor to assure succe ssful reorganization current law does not require the cour t to look at the representatives counterproposals but only at whether the representative had good cause for rejecting the debtors proposals45 under current law rejecti on has

because it preserves jobs and assets 51 under both current law and the bill interim modifications could be made to cba if necessary for the company to remain in bus iness but the bill permits labor strikes in response to those modifications so they may provide little effective relief see discussion under 11 usc 1113e and 11 usc 1113gthe proposed provisions would encourage both pa rties to negotiate it is possible that the provisions could create an imbalance in the two parties motivation to negotiate but at this point we do not know which party might be more motivated by the proposed provisions 11 usc 1113c1c this simply reiterates the impasse requirement by specifying that the court may only appr ove rejection if it finds that further negotiations are not likely to produce mutually satisfactory agreement47 as noted earlier courts may construe this as requiring less certainty as to the futility of further negotiations than exists under the rlas requirement for continued bargaining48 under current law the bankruptcy courts do not evaluate the prospects for an eventual agreement between the parties 11 usc 1113c1d this provision requires the court to consider how the labor group would be affected by the debtors proposal but it seems to presume that the labor group will strike if the cba is rejected it requires the court to consider the effect of such strike including the debtor companys ability to retain an experienced and qualified workforce49 reorganization in bankruptcy is based on the concept that it is better for all concerned if company can continue in business rather than liquidate50 if the result of rejection of cba is strike that would effectively put the company out of busine ss the court may decide not to allow rejection if however the debtor company is not in position to remain in business under the terms of the existing cba the co mpany may be forced to liquidate rather than reorganize51 this alternative might leave all creditors including the labor group in worse shape than they would ve been had the company reorganized 11 usc 1113c2 this subsection provides parameters for the courts consideration of whether the

evaluation of the burden imposed on the labor group as compared to other groups52 11 usc 1113c3 under current law in considering whether to approve rejection the court has discretion in concluding that the required conditions have been met while hr 3652 does not re move all of the cour ts discretion in one area the bill appears to significantly restri ct the courts discretion hr 3652 would establish presumption that the debt or has overly burdened the labor group in comparison to the burdens on other groups including management53 if it has implemented program of incentive pay bonuses or other financial returns for insiders or senior manage ment personnel during the bankruptcy or within 180 days before the case began54 unless that presumption can be effectively rebutted the debtor will have failed to meet the requirements for rejection55 the bankruptcy abuse prevention nd consumer protection act of 2005 bapcpa restricted key employee re tention plans kerps which provided retention bonuses and severa nce pay to management em ployees who were retained to manage the business th rough its reorganization56 since bapcpa became effective there has been move toward paying managers incentive payments which were not restricted57 though some of these incentive pay schemes have been rejected by the courts as actually be ing retention bonuses that did not meet bapcpas requirements58 others have been upheld as incentive bonuses and therefore not subject to the restricti ons imposed by the postbapcpa bankruptcy code restrictions59 in 2006 both the senate and the

before the bankruptcy petition was filed62 these restrictions are bolstered by the bills proposed amendment to 11 usc 1113c3 this proposed amendment could make it difficult for the court to approve rejection of cba if there were any sort of incentive pay even if the court had approved the incentive pay after finding that it was necessary to retain person63 whose services were essential for the business to continue64 and met the other restrictions of 11 usc 503c1 argu ably this could put court in the position of having little flexibility to make decisions that could result in the debtor companys successful reorganization if it allowed incentive pay to retain someone essential to the business it could be unable to approve rejection of cba if the debtor could not rebut the presumption that the bor group was being burdened more than management if it did not allow incentive payments the company might lose an employee who was seen as necessary for survival either alternative might cause the debtor to liquidate rather th an reorganize however it c ould also be argued that this provision would encourage debtors to caref ully consider whether incentive pay was necessary and if necessary limit it so that an effective argument could be made that the incentive did not create situation in which the labor group was disproportionately bur dened by the modifications in cba 11 usc

provision for holding the hearing within fourteen days of the filing date70 the deletion may have been unintentional the intent may have been to set the same time frame for notice as for hearing on the other hand the deletion may have been intended to avoid requiring an early hearing on an application for rejecti on permitting additional time for continuing negotiation between the debtor and the authorized representative the bill would restrict the parties who could appear and be heard limiting them to only the debtor and the authorized representative71 this may have the effect of streamlining the hearing process by eliminating consideration of other parties concerns under both current and propos ed law the creditors would have an opportunity to approve or rej ect the reorganization plan which would incorporate the results of the rejection hearing under the bills proposals there would be time frame within which the court would be required to rule nd provision allowing the btor to unilaterally modify cba while ruling was pending72 this appears to encourage continuing negotiations between the debtor and the aut horized representative without statutory deadline 11 usc 1113e the bill proposes changes to this section while parties continue to negotiate changes to cba courts would tinue to be allowed to approve interim modifications to cba if essential to the continuation of the debtors business or in order to void irreparable dama ge to the estate73 however the addition of subsection g as proposed in the bill74 allowing labor groups to strike or engage in other methods of selfhelp in response to cour tordered modifications under this subsection may tend to reduce either the extent to which courts are willing to approve interim modificati ons or the potential benefit to the debtor of an interim modification if so it could lead to liqui dations rather than reorganizations when interim modifications are essential for the company to remain in

there is stat ute addressing whether court approved rejection of cba gi ves rise to claim for da mages and courts have been divided on the subject76 the bill would add subsection that would define rejection of cba as breach and would address the effect of rejection of cba in terms of both money damages and selfhelp the right of affected employees to strike rejection as breach this is one of the subsections where the use of particular word may have import that is not immediately obvious in general rejection of executory contracts has been treated as breach77 however recently in northwest airlines corporation v association of flight attendants 78 rejection of cba was characterized not as breach but as an abrogation79 as the court viewed it an abrogation has different legal effect than does breach while breach would have remedy an abrogation under 11 us c 1113 terminates the provisions of the cba and allows s ubstitution of courtapproved provisions80 it is possible that the word breach is us ed in this proposed subsection merely to identify the rationale for the prescribed re medy on the other hand it is possible that the word was used to legislate an effect of rejection that is different than that determined by the northwest airlines court in evaluating which is more likely to be the case one should consider that the c ourt specifically sted the effect of rejection under 11 usc 365 with that under 11 usc 1113 stating contract rejection under 1113 unlike contract rej ection under 365 permits more than non performance81 according to the court the purpose of 11 usc 1113

that rejection is an abrogation rather than breach but also that there are damages to be recovered from rejection of cba under 11 usc 1113 money damages under the bill courtapprove d rejection would be breach of contract with the same effect as rej ection of any other executory contract under 11 usc 365g but would exclude thos damages from the limitations of 11 usc 502b7 under 11 usc 365g rejec tion of contract is treated as breach of contract immediately before the date the bankruptcy petition was filed83 section 502b7 limits damages for termination of an employment contract to one years compensation without acceleration plus any unpaid compensation although hr 3652 specifically excludes damages for re jected cbas from the damage limitation of 11 usc 501b7 the explicit excl usion may not be necessary since courts have held that the subsec tion does not apply to cbas84 section 365g of the bankruptcy code sets the date of the breach as just before the filing of the petition which would make such claims prepetition claims pre petition claims are ge nerally unsecured nonpriority cl aims however this bill proposes to define administrative expenses which are priority claims as including all payments required under 11 usc 1113 th at must be paid on or before the date the reorganization plan is confirmed85 proposed subsection g does not actually mandate payment of the breach damages befo re the confirmation date so it is unclear whether those damages are intended to be treated as an administrative expense and therefore priority claim rather than as prepetition nonpriority cl aim if given the status of an administrative claim it is difficult to foresee situation in which company could benefit from rejection of cba since it would appear likely that any financial gain garnered by rejecting the cba would be lost through the breach damages for rejections if those damages are treated as are other breach damages for rejection of executory contracts they would be unsecured nonpriority prepetition claims and the reorganization plan could pr ovide for partial rather than full payment of them thereby allowing some economic benefit to the company in bankruptcy

current 11 usc 1113d2 or do not make the cba ineffective in its entirety ther efore although strike clause would become ineffective after rejection of cb it would remain in effect under current law when there are interim modifications to cba hr 3652 would change the law so that all labor groups even those controlled by the rla would have the right to strike when cba was rejected the right to strike would also exist if interim m odifications were approved by court apparently without reference to whethe r the cba included strike clause since strike might be fatal economic blow to distressed company and since interim modifications are approved by the c ourt only when they are either essential to the debtors business or to avoid irreparable harm to the estate88 codifying the right to strike after courtapproved inter im modifications might jeopardize both the debtor companys existence and its cr editors claims the proposed subsection would by its language also preempt all ot her federal and state laws regarding labor groups right to engage in selfhelp89 11 usc 1113h under current law there is provision for future modifications of cba if the debtors fi nancial condition improve s in negotiations over cbas representatives may ask for s napback provisions that would provide for future modifications but the absence of such provision would not necessarily lead to courts determination that the representative had good cause for rejecting the debtors proposal hr 3652 would dd subsection to assure that based on changed circumstances representatives coul d request modifications after cbas were either rejected or modified the bill would require the court to grant the request if the change would result in the new provisions being more than the minimum savings needed for the debtor to reorganize successfully90httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34486crs17 91 11 usc 1113d1 92 11 usc 1113d2 93 some of these are wages for postpetition services as well as professional

planassurance of the possibility of future favorable modifications might make representatives more inclined to cooperate with debtors proposals for modifications however under current law while snapback provisions have been available for modifications they have not been required as part of ither negotiated modification or courtappr oved rejection 11 usc 1113i currently there is provisi on for arbitration rather than court hearing to rule on motion for re jection of cba hr 3652 would add subsection to allow arbitration in lieu of court hearing if requested by the authorized representative so long as the court finds that arbitr ation would help the parties reach an agreement that was mutually satisfying this could reduce the demand for courts resources however only the authorized representative can make the request the debtor cannot make the request and the court cannot order arbitration without request using arbitration to resolve debtors request to reject cba may open greater possibilities for finding middle ground betw een complete rejection of cba and assumption of the existing cba it may also however increase the time required to resolve the issue under current law unle ss otherwise agreed to by the debtor and representative the court is required to hold hearings on requests for approval of rejection within more than twentyone days91 and to rule on the application later than thirty days after the beginning of the hearing92 as noted earlier the proposed changes to 1113 eliminate both of these deadlines the bill does not directly address whic h party will pay for arbitration it appears however that if all of the bills provisions were to become law the debtor would probably pay for the arbitration as an administrative expense since subsection j provides for reimbursing the representa tive for reasonable costs and fees incurred 11 usc 1113j although current law includes provisions for allowing priority claims as administrative expenses for various expenses incurred in reorganization93 there is provision for reimbursi ng the authorized representative for fees and costs incurred in complying with the requirements of 11 usc 1113 the bill would add subsection j to make these costs reimbursable upon request and notice and hearing under the bills proposed changes they would be considered administrative expenses94 as administrative expenses they would be priority claims whose payment in full must be provided fo r in the plan for reorganization this provision could result in shor ter negotiations or more flexible proposals by the

determine the effects on the labor group any accrued obligations that were not assumed as part of sale transaction would be treated as administrative expenses under current law all postpetition obligations that are required by the cba are considered administrative expenses additionally where cba has been assumed accrued prepetition obligations under the cba may also be administrative

contracts and assumed under 11 usc 365 conclusion in its findings95 the bill states that congress finds that chapter 11 was enacted to protect jobs and enhance enterp rise value for all stakeholders96 but is instead being used to cause the burdens of bankruptcy to fall dispr oportionately and overwhelmingly on employees and retirees97 revising the process for rejection of cbas is one of the ways this bill proposes to rectify the ine quities it asserts for many companies in bankruptcy ex pense for employees is the largest expense in the budget and some modification of that expense may be essential to their successful reorganization section 1113 as it currently exists has provided labor groups with protection from debtor co mpanies unfettered re jections of cbas but has also provided method for debtor co mpanies to reject cbas when they could not reach compromise with the authorized representatives of the labor groups the proposed revisions to section 1113 would c onstrain both debtor companies and the courts when debtors file under chapter 11 the bill clearly contemplates allowing labor groups to have greater possibly definitive role in determining the feasib ility of reorganization labor groups but not debtors would be allowe d to request arbitration rather than court hearing to determine approval of debto rs request to reject cba in certain circumstances the bill would allow labor groups to obtain future relief due to changed circumstances without having to bargain with the compan the bill would also extend the right to strike to all labor groups whenever cba was modified or rej ected without their consent finally the bill pr ovides labor groups with fined remedy for rejection of cba though courts might differ in their interpretation of that remedyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34486crs19 companies in financial distress may argue that the bills pr oposed changes to chapter 11 are insufficiently flexible to llow successful reorganization if that is their conclusion they might try to reso lve their financial difficulties outside of bankruptcy or choose to liquida rather than reorganize
