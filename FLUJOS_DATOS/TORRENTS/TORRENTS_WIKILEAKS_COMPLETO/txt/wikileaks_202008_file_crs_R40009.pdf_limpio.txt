federal communications commission fcc or commission that required broadcast licensees to cover issues of public importance and to do so in fair manner issues of public importance were not limited to political campaigns nuclear plant construction workers rights and other issues of focus for particular community could gain the status of an issue that broadcasters were required to cover therefore the fairness doctrine was distinct from the socalled equal time rule which requires broadcasters to grant equal time to qualified candidates for public office because the fairness doctrine applied to much broader range of topics in 1987 after period of study the fcc repealed the fairness doctrine the fcc found that the doctrine likely violated the free speech rights of broadcasters led to less speech about issues of public importance over broadcast airwaves and was longer required because of the increase in competition among mass media the repeal of the doctrine did not end the debate among lawmakers scholars and others about its constitutionality and impact on the availability of diverse information to the public the debate in congress regarding whether to reinstate the doctrine continues today in the 109 th congress bills such as hr 3302 were introduced to reinstate the fairness doctrine however in the 110th congress the proposed legislation related to the fairness doctrine would have prohibited the fcc from reinstating it in the c onsolidated appropriations act of 2008 congress forbade the fcc to use any of the funds appropriated to it under the act to reinstate the fairness doctrine this prohibition continues temporarily under the continuing resolution now in effect once the restriction on spending is lifted the fcc will be free to reinstate the fairness doctrine if the agency so chooses congress also may introduce legislation to reinstate the doctrine any attempt to reinstate the fairness doctrine likely would be met with constitutional challenge those opposing the doctrine would argue that it violates their first amendment rights in 1969 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine but applied lower standard of scrutiny to the first amendment rights of broadcasters than it applies to other media since that decision the supreme courts reasoning for applying lower constitutional standard to broadcasters speech has been questioned furthermore when repealing the doctrine the fcc found that as the law stood in 1987 the fairness doctrine violated the first amendment even when applying the lower standard of scrutiny to the doctrine reviewing court has examined the validity of the agencys findings on the constitutional issue therefore whether newly instituted fairness doctrine would survive constitutional scrutiny remains an open question

years the federal communications commission required broadcast licensees to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in manner that was fair and balanced this requirement came to be known as the fairness doctrine in practice it required broadcasters to identify issues of public importance decide to cover those issues and then to afford the best representatives of the opposing views on the issue the opportunity to present their case to the community many broadcasters complained that the fairness doctrine was overly burdensome and inhibited their ability to cover issues of public importance those in favor of the doctrine believed that it ensured vibrant discussion over the public airwaves after number of proceedings examining the effects of the fairness doctrine on broadcasters the fcc abolished the doctrine in 1987 the fcc reasoned that increased competition in the marketplace first amendment concerns and evidence that the fairness doctrine actually chilled speech rather than facilitating it justified abandoning the policy discussion continues amongst scholars and lawmakers regarding the fairness doctrines effectiveness constitutionality and reinstatement some believe the fairness doctrine should be resurrected to promote public discourse while others believe the doctrine should never be reinstated because it inhibits the free exchange of ideas for example as recently as the 109 th congress bills were introduced in congress to reinstate the fairness doctrine on the other hand in the 110th congress there were number of bills introduced that would have prevented the fcc from reinstating the fairness doctrine this report will discuss the history of the fairne ss doctrine enforcement of the doctrine by the fcc abolition of it by the fcc efforts to effect and to prevent its reinstatement and potential constitutional issues with reinstating the doctrine as applied to broadcasters and as applied to satellite and cable television

american system for broadcasting in which licenses to broadcast are granted to private individuals or corporations1 those without license are not permitted to broadcast2 this scheme prevents interference from competing broadcasters it also guarantees that some speakers who wish to communicate via broadcast airwaves cannot do so recognizing that this structure prevented many who would wish to communicate via broadcast from doing so and that individuals who were able to obtain license had control over the content 1 see the radio act of 1927 pl 69632 ch 169 44 stat 1162 1927 2 47 usc 301

may be granted only when the licenses serve the public interest3 the fcc is charged with enforcing this provision by considering the public interest when granting licenses to broadcasters renewing them and modifying them4 furthermore the fcc is required from time to time as public convenience interest or necessity requires to promulgate such rules and regulations and prescribe such restrictions and conditions as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the communications act 5 the supreme court has noted that these provisions provide the fcc with an expansive mandate to ensure that broadcast stations operate in the public interest6 in the spirit of this broad mandate the fcc favored granting and renewing licenses to broadcast stations that presented more than one viewpoint in their programming this preference evolved over time in 1949 finding its authority in the public interest obligations imposed upon broadcasters by the communications act the fcc issued report entitled in the matter of editorializing by broadcast licensees 7 the report affirmatively established the duty of broadcast licensees to cover controversial issues of public importance in fair and balanced manner the obligation is known as the fairness doctrine8 the fairness doctrine consisted of two basic requirements 1 that every licensee devote reasonable tion of broadcast time to the discussion and consideration of controversial issues of public importance and 2 that in doing so the broadcaster must be fair that is the broadcaster must affirmatively endeavor to make facilities available for the expression of contrasting viewpoints held by responsible elements with respect to the controversial issues presented 9 these obligations were not satisfied by simply granting air time to those who requested it in order to respond to an issue previously discussed during the broadcasters regular programming10 broadcasters instead had the affirmative duty to determine what the appropriate opposing viewpoints were on these controversial issues and who was best suited to present them11 if sponsored programming was not an option the broadcasters had to provide it at their own expense12 further requirements of the fairness doctrine were eventually codified into regulation the personal attack rule stated that when personal attacks were made on individuals involved in public issues the broadcaster had to within one week of the broadcast notify the person 3 47 usc 307 4 47 usc 307 309 5 47 usc 303 6 national broadcasting co v us 319 us 190 219 1943 7 13 fcc rept 1246 1949 hereinafter

tape and allow him an opportunity to respond over the broadcasters facilities13 the political editorial rule required that when broadcaster endorsed particular political candidate the broadcaster was required to provide the other qualified candidates for the same office or their representatives the opportunity to respond over the broadcasters facilities14 congress amended section 315 of the communications act in 1959 to include what seemed to be tacit approval of the fccs fairness doctrine15 section 315 imposes the requirement upon broadcasters to grant equal broadcasting time to political candidates with certain exceptions the amendment pertaining to the fairness doctrine states the following nothing in the foregoing sentence creating exemptions from the equal time requirements shall be construed as relieving broadcasters in connection with the presentation of newscasts news interviews news documentaries and onthespot from the obligation imposed upon them under this chapter to operate in the public interest and to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance in its report on the amendment the house explained that this provision is restatement of the basic policy of the standard of fairness which is imposed on broadcasters under the communications act of 1934 16 debate arose in subsequent years over whether this addition to section 315 codified the fairness doctrine or merely stated congresss intent to avoid interference with the fccs enforcement of the fairness doctrine this debate will be addressed in full in the section of this report addressing the repeal of the fairness doctrine

violations of the fairness doctrine the fcc looked to whether the licensee had acted reasonably and in good faith to present fair cross section of opinion on the controversial issue 17 the fcc emphasized that harmless errors and honest mistakes were not actionable and that the merits of the actual competing viewpoints presented were not under review by the agency by way of example in the course of enforcing the doctrine the fcc found that the establishment of national fair employment practices commission was an issue of public importance that triggered fairness doctrine obligations as were issues such as the potential institution of pay tv nutritionist giving advice about diet and health programs describing socialist forms of government etc 18 consequences for failure to comply with the fairness doctrine could have ranged anywhere from requirement that time be granted to unaired viewpoints to punishment as severe as loss of license or substantial demerit in comparative

communications commission red lion decided in 1969 the supreme court took up two questions related to the fairness doctrine first the court addressed whether the fcc had the authority to create and to enforce the fairness doctrine20 second the court examined whether requiring broadcasters to cover issues of public importance and to present opposing views on those issues fairly violated the broadcasters first amendment rights to free speech specifically at issue in red lion were the personal attack and political editorial rules noted above two separate cases had been consolidated for revi ew by the supreme court in the first case the red lion broadcasting company pennsylvania radio station had broadcast program in which reverend billy james hargis described author fred j cook as having been fired for making false charges against city officials having worked for communistaffiliated publication having defended alger hiss and having attacked j edgar hoover 21 cook heard the broadcast and demanded reply time but the station refused the fcc found that the station had failed to meet its obligations under the fairness doctrine decision that was upheld on appeal to the court of appeals for the dc circuit the broadc ast station appealed to the supreme court the second case was direct challenge to the constitutionality of the political editorial and personal attack regulation the regulations were held to be unconstitutional under the first amendment by the seventh circuit court of appeals and the fcc appealed the supreme court found that the fcc was within its authority to implement the regulations at issue in the second case and to issue the decision in red lion 22 in the estimation of the court the agency was implementing the policy of congress r ather than embarking on frolic of its own the court traced the history of the fairness doctrine noting that broadcast spectrum was originally unregulated and the result was chaos the court found that congress decided that the best solution was to take control of access to the broadcast spectrum and regulate its allocation in manner consistent with the public interest congress granted the power to choose broadcast licensees to the fcc and instructed the agency to consider the public interest when exercising that power in order to exercise that authority the supreme court noted that the fcc needed to determine what broadcasting in the public interest meant from its inception the fcc and its predecessor agency the federal radio commission held the view that the public interest requires ample play for the free and fair competition of opposing views and the commission believes that the principle applies to all discussion of issues of importance to the public 23 enforcement of this general policy continued until the fcc issued its report in the matter of editorializing by broadcast licensees in 1949 which set out the basic requirements of the fairness doctrine as it would exist throughout its life24 then in 1959 congress chose to include in its amendment to section 315 of the communications act of 1934 specific ratification of the fairness doctrine in 20 395 us 367 1969 21

doctrine was legitimate exercise of the fccs congressionally delegated authority the broadcasters also argued that the fairness doctrine impinged upon their first amendment right to freedom of speech they contended that it was their right to broadcast whatever they chose and to exclude whom they wished from thei r frequencies the supreme court rejected this argument for number of reasons but the most often cited has come to be known as the scarcity rationale the court said because of the scarcity of radio frequencies the government is permitted to put restraints on licensees in favor of others whose views should be expressed on this unique medium but the people as whole retain their interest in free speech by radio and their collective right to have the medium function consistently with the ends and purposes of the first amendment it is the right of the viewers and listeners not the right of the broadcasters which is paramount 25 the supreme court therefore upheld the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine and the personal attackpolitical editorial regulation however the history of the doctrine would not end there

examine its application of the fairness doctrine the doctrines effects on broadcasters and the constitutionality of the doctrine in light of developments in first amendment law 26 in 1985 the fcc released an order addressing three main questions related to the fairness doctrine 1 whether the doctrine was constitutionally permissible under thencurrent marketplace conditions and first amendment jurisprudence 2 whether the doctrine actually chilled rather than encouraged free speech and 3 whether the doctrine was codified into law by either section 315 or the general public interest standard in the communications act 27 the commission acknowledged that the supreme court had upheld the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine in red lion but determined nonetheless that the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine had become suspect28 the commission looked to the development of first amendment law following the red lion decision and determined that the evolution of free speech in mass communications cases along with developments in broadcast technology potentially undermined the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine29 the fcc recognized however that it is the province of the courts to pass upon the constitutionality of its policies and declined to pass on the constitutionality of the doctrine 25 id at 390 citations omitted 26 general fairness doctrine

fairness doctrine upon broadcasters and came to the conclusion that the doctrine chilled speech substantially30 the commission noted that enforcement actions usually occurred under the second prong of the fairness doctrine in other words broadcasters most often were determined to have violated the doctrine by failing to provide all valid opposing viewpoints air time on given issue broadcasters rarely faced enforcement for failing to address issues of public importance in the first place as result broadcasters could avoid the expense of defending enforcement actions by simply refusing to cover issues of public importance as evidence the commission noted instances cited in the comments of planned coverage of issues of public importance being jettisoned for fear of fairness doctrine lawsuits 31 as well as refusals on the part of broadcasters to carry certain paid programming that they feared would trigger their fairness doctrine obligations 32 the commission could not determine however whet her the fairness doctrine had been codified by congress in section 315 of the communications act33 the agency observed that the legislative language was ambiguous as to whether congress had intended to approve the commissions authority to enforce the doctrine or to create new statutory requirement34 evidence culled from the legislative history also was of little help in determining the intent of section 31535 furthermore pending before congress at the time were bills related to the fairness doctrine accordingly the fcc declined to repeal the doctrine in 1985 and chose to wait for further guidance from congress on the issue36 despite declining to repeal the doctrine the agency made clear its belief that the most effective way to encourage the free exchange of ideas over broadcast was to have an open and unregulated marketplace of ideas in 1986 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia held that congress had not codified the fairness doctrine37 section 315 according to the court ratified the commissions longstanding position that the public interest standard authorized the fairness doctrine but did 30 id at 35422 31 for example the commission cited southern california radio station that decided not to air series on religious cults despite having already invested resources in its preparation the decision according to the radio station was based upon the assessment of costs related to potential fairness doctrine challenge id at 35427 32 specifically the commission cited comments from organizations such at the glass packaging institute and the national rifle association these commenters had documented difficulty in placing advertisements related to ballot measures due to fairness doctrine concerns id at 35429 33 id at 35453 34 id at 35448

1959 this language appears to suggest that congress did not intend to codify the fairness doctrine however in debate on the floor some members indicated their belief that the fairness doctrine amendment would codify the doctrine one member said for example that the fairness doctrine amendm ent was the one condition we could write into the law to make sure the federal communications

the fairness doctrine38 the supreme court declined to review this case following this decision congress directed the fcc to examine alternatives to the fairness doctrine and to submit report to congress on the subject39 the fcc opened proceeding seeking public comment on alternative means of administration and enforcement of the fairness doctrine40 alternatives were analyzed including abandoning casebycase enforcement approach replacing the doctrine with open access time for all members of the public doing away with the personal attack rule and eliminating certain other aspects of the doctrine41 the commission rejected each of these alternatives for various reasons this however was not the proceeding in which the commission repealed the fairness doctrine the repeal of the doctrine occurred later in 1987 in complaint against the television station wtvh syracuse ny the fcc declined to sanction the broadcast station for violation of the fairness doctrine because the agency determined that the fairness doctrine violated the first amendment42 the fcc repeated its findings from its 1985 report and argued that the scarcity rationale underpinning the supreme courts red lion decision was longer valid the agency also noted that the doctrines affirmative use of government power to expand broadcast debate would seem to raise striking paradox for freedom of speech has traditionally implied an absence of governmental supervision or control throughout most of our history the principal function of the first amendment has been to protect the free marketplace of ideas by precluding government intrusion 43 the fairness doctrine on the other hand requires the government to make subjective judgments regarding which issues are of public importance and which points of view on those issues are significant enough to require broadcasters to cover them the commission expressed discomfort with its role in the editorial decisions being made by broadcasters and posited that such government involvement in these decisions ran contrary to the first amendment 44 the commission noted that many of the regulations it applies to broadcasters would be unconstitutional if applied to print media the co mmission also recognized however that speech restrictions placed upon broadcasters were subject to lesser degree of constitutional scrutiny than restrictions placed on print media the agency therefore conducted its analysis of the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine under the standard set forth in red lion and examined 38 id 517518 39

substantial government interest45 the fairness doctrine was promulgated and enforced by the commission in order to serve the public interest in access to an open and robust marketplace of ideas the commission had determined that the doctrine chilled the speech of broadcasters and inhibited free and open debate on the public airwaves in the commissions estimation therefore the fairness doctrine actually disserved the public interest and did not advance the substantial government interest in ensuring public access to diverse debate on the airwaves 46 the commission further argued that the supreme court should reconsider its application of lower degree of first amendment protection to broadcasters and that the first amendment should protect media equally regardless of their delivery method47 this case was appealed to the dc circuit court of appeals the court upheld the order of the fcc but did not reach the constitutional issue48

because of the fcc ruling determining that the fairness doctrine violated the first amendment it is likely that any reinstatement of the doctrine either by congress or by the fcc would be met by court challenge on first amendment grounds such challenge may reach the supreme court of the united states inviting the court to reconsider red lion in reviewing the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine as applied to broadcast licensees the court would likely be faced with two questions 1 what standard of constitutional scrutiny to apply and 2 whether the fairness doctrine withstands the chosen level of scrutiny g21g157g138g151g141g138g155g141g561g152g143g561g21g140g155g158g157g146g151g162g561 government restrictions upon speech that are dependent upon the content of that speech are normally accorded strict scrutiny the highest level of constitutional analysis and the most difficult for law to survive49 the fairness doctrine is contentbased restriction on speech because it requires government agent the fcc to examine the speech of private actors and to make subjective judgments regarding the fairness of the speech in most circumstances such restriction would be reviewed under strict scrutiny which requires the government to prove that the law is necessary to achieve compelling government interest and that the law is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest 50 the supreme court has struck down laws similar to the fairness doctrine when applying strict scrutiny51 it seems therefore that if the supreme court were to apply strict scrutiny to the fair ness doctrine the doctrine would be struck down 45 id at 5049 46 id 47 id at 5058 48 syracuse peace council v fcc 867 f2d 654 dc cir 1988 49 sable communications of california inc v federal

on the speech of broadcasters should be accorded lesser standard of constitutional scrutiny known as intermediate scrutiny52 intermediate scrutiny requires the government to prove that the restriction on speech advances substantial government interest and that the law is narrowly tailored though not necessarily the least restrictive alternative to achieve that interest the supreme court reasoned that the scarcity of broadcast spectrum and the need to assure public access to variety of viewpoints over the broadcast spectrum provided basis for applying intermediate scrutiny in these circumstances 53 the fcc argued in its 1987 decision that the scarcity rationale was longer applicable54 the agency noted an increase in the number of broadcast stations since the red lion decision the agency also noted the increase in information sources and viewpoints available to the public via cable and satellite channels today party arguing against the scarcity rationale could take note of the dramatic increase in the ease of the communication of ideas via the internet it could be argued that these technological advances render the scarcity rationale obsolete the supreme court has had the opportunity to address this argument repeatedly and has consistently reaffirmed the validity of the scarcity rationale 55 despite the increased number of broadcast outlets and the increase in methods of mass information delivery including cable satellite and the internet the fact remains ac cording to the court that not every individual who wishes to operate broadcast station may do so56 the supreme court also has said that broadcast content is unique in american media57 it is free over the air to anyone with television or radio within range of signal broadcast therefore is distinct from cable satellite and the internet which are all services for which consumers must pay another possible reason the court may be disinclined to repudiate the scarcity rationale is the increased consolidation in ownership of media outlets including broadcast stations 58 if many of the broadcast stations across the country are owned by the same few large corporations the argument that there exists an increased number of information sources in the broadcast marketplace may be more difficult for the court to accept it is possible that in light of the proliferation of different types of media outlets since red lion the supreme court will abandon the scarcity rationale for applying lower standard of scrutiny to restrictions on broadcasters speech if the scarcity rationale is abandoned the court will likely begin to apply strict scrutiny to broadcaster speech restrictions like the fairness doctrine because the supreme court has struck down regulations similar to the fairness doctrine when continued newspapers to allow individuals space to reply to attacks made against them in the publication 52 red lion 395 us at 386 53 id columbia broadcasting system inc v democratic

decide whether the fairness doctrine withstands such scrutiny the court may choose to uphold red lion and the fairness doctrine under the principle of stare decisis which requires courts to adhere to precedent60 the court also may choose to analyze newly established fairness doctrine in light of evidence regarding its effects on speech that has developed since the red lion decision to do so it would have to answer two questions 1 whether th fairness doctrine advances substantial government interest and 2 whether the doctrine is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest

viewpoints and information sources in robust marketplace of ideas61 if the supreme court determines that the fairness doctrine ch ills speech rather than encourages robust exchange of ideas it is likely that the court would conclude that the fairness doctrine does not advance the governments interest in wellinformed citizenry and is unconstitutional if however the court finds that the fairness doctrine continues to advance substantial government interest the court would move on to the next step in the constitutional analysis the fairness doctrine was originally promulgated under the fccs authority to grant licenses to broadcasters that serve the public interest 62 the public interest standard in the communications act necessarily implicates the first amendment63 the fairness doctrine was intended to advance the government interest in ensuring the presence of diversity of viewpoints over broadcast stations and to prevent broadcasters from monopolizing the airwaves with their personal interests64 under this theory the publics right to receive information would be protected from any tendency on the part of broadcasters only to communicate information of which they approved or agreed citing this reasoning the supreme court in red lion upheld the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine 59 see fcc v pacifica 438 us at 748 noting that the first amendment protects

doctrine actually inhibits the free exchange of ideas over the broadcast airwaves the red lion court noted in particular that at the time the decision was rendered there was evidence that the fairness doctrine chilled speech65 the court observed that if such theory were proven true the fcc was not powerless to insist that broadcasters give coverage to issues of public importance in its 1985 report and 1987 decision repealing the doctrine the fcc cited numerous instances in which broadcasters claimed to have refused to air certain pieces or cover issues for fear of fairness doctrine enforcement66 the agency further noted that the cost of defending fairness doctrine complaints could amount to significant sums of money and manpower and could deter coverage of issues of public importance even further67 the fcc also noted the disparity between enforcement of the first prong of the doctrine which requires coverage of issues of public importance and the second prong which requires significant views on those issues to be given fair coverage 68 the agency explained that its own difficulty in enforcing the first prong arose because it received far fewer complaints regard ing the failure to cover an important issue therefore broadcasters could avoid enforcement actions for violations of the fairness doctrine by simply not covering the issue of public importa nce at all the fcc may not be able to rectify this enforcement disparity in costefficient manner because any solution would require the agency to monitor the programming of all broadcasters at all times and to know which issues are of most importance to which communities such constant and farreaching oversight may be beyond the capacity of any agency however unlike other regulations on broadcaster speech that have been struck down the fairness doctrine requires that speech be answered with more speech 69 this aspect of the doctrine has been cited approvingly by the supreme court the fairness doctrine does not single out any one point of view as objectionable or offlimits 70 instead it requires that all significant points of view on issues of public importance receive broadcast time this is tenet at the core of the first amendment and it could be argued that the doctrine achieved its goal of raising the level of debate on the broadcast airwaves despite the fccs findings in the 1980s if the supreme court is persuaded by the argument that the fairness doctrine chills speech rather than encourages robust exchange of ideas the court may find that the doctrine does not advance the governments interest in wellinformed citizenry if the court finds the doctrine does not advance that substantial government interest the court will strike it down as unconstitutional if however the court is persuaded by the argument it accepted in red lion that the fairness doctrine advances the substantial government interest in robust marketplace of ideas the court would move on to the next step in the constitutional analysis 65 red lion 395 us at 393394 66 general fairness doctrine obligations of broadcast licensees report 50 fed reg at 35418 in re complaint of syracuse peach council

governments interest under the previous enforcement regime the fcc examined each potential violation of the fairness doctrine on casebycase basis71 this tactic led to measure of flexibility in penalties for violators and in the evolution of the doctrine72 such flexibility enabled the commission to be more responsive in its enforcement and to tailor each enforcement proceeding to the facts at issue in each case in upholding the previous regime the supreme court noted that it did not approve of each and every application of the fairness doctrine but because of the chosen method of forcement such approval was not required to uphold the doctrine in general 73 if this enforcement regime is chosen once again it is likely that the court will follow its reasoning in red lion and deem the doctrine to be narrowly tailored however other methods of enforcement that are less well tailored are conceivable and have been considered by the fcc 74 whether the fairness doctrine as newly established would be narrowly tailored will therefore depend upon the enforcement regime chosen by congress or the fcc
