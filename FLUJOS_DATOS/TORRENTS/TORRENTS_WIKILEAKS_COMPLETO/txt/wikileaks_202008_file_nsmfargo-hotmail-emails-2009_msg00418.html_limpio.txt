must secure the existence of our people and future for white children house of treason reject to cut limit in abortion the upper time limit for abortions will remain at 24 weeks after mps voted against proposals to reduce it they rejected options ranging from 12 to 22 weeks in series of votes tory mp nadine dorries former nurse who proposed 20week limit said babys rights should be considered at the point it had the chance of life but prochoice campaigners said there was evidence of improved survival rates the closest vote on 22week limit was defeated by 304 to 233 ms dorries proposal for 20 week limit was defeated by 332 votes to 190 health minister dawn primarolo insisted there was evidence requiring the abortion laws to be changed and said changing it would force the small number of women seeking late abortions to go elsewhere source bbc news 21 may 2008 the british free corps position on this matter is that abortion is murder abortion is being marketed to white people and this is especially sickening when you think of the dwindling numbers of whites and that abortion surgeries are predominately owned by jewish predators abortion would be banned in national socialist britain and our women and children would be protected in addition we will promote sensible attitudes towards sex instead of the idea of using abortion as form of contraception irish viking trade centre unearthed one of the vikings most important trading centres has been discovered in ireland the settlement at woodstown in county waterford is estimated to be about 1200 years old it was discovered during archaeological excavations for road bypass for waterford city which was founded by the vikings the irish government said the settlement was one of the most important early viking age trading centres discovered in the country its working group which includes archaeologists from irelands museum and monuments service said it was of international significance and showed the community was wealthy and sought to remain at woodstown permanently almost 6000 artefacts and viking chieftains grave have been discovered at the site which was established by the year 860 the grave contains sword shield and silver mark the working group report said the discoveries of silver and lead weights showed it was apparent that woodstown falls firmly into the scandinavian tradition there can be little doubt that many if not all of the settlements occupants were either scandinavian or had strong insular scandinavian associations it said the woodstown site provides rare opportunity to study scandinavian settlement of this period outside scandinavia itself source bbc news 6th may 2008 radio station for some time now our very successful radio station union jack radio has had more and more
