organization lecture given on 23 august 1966 thank you im bulletin board today whats the date audience twentythird of august ad 16 twentythird of august ad 16 this is notable day i hope youi hope you get something out of this lecture because i had to knock off my afternoon research session to give it to you putting the ots that far behind you see make you all guilty now but the truth of the matter is that im making very good progress indeed and all is well in that quarter people who are picking on scientology at this timeyou know theyre perfectly right theyre perfectly correct from their personal point of view why what theyre doing is very dangerous yes those fellows whore picking on scientology know just what theyre doing in their insane waytheyre in danger matter of fact hco shouldnt issue suppressive orders on them but danger conditions that sounds like threat it isnt its promise well today im bulletin board ive got more people and more things im told that there are now 130 students total on the saint hill special briefing course and solo audit course highest number of students ever and plenty more coming yes we already have ot projects going you can expect to see these people start disappearing any day now of course not craig hes case supervisor you know you know that the hierarchy of the tech division now are all of them clear you know well now todaytoday im going to talk to you about organization ive never talked to you about organization before i never have during the entirety of 1965 and something into 1966 i spent literally thousands of hours on the subject of organization and out of that area of study came great deal of data and one of the first things i found out is the reason that business organization pattern would not fit scientology organization was because business organization never had isolated the principles of organization now in scientology organization you are handling commodity known as life and that is the commodity it handles and of course it is handling it with vessel made out of life and this is something on the order of trying to pour water into pitcher made out of water so it will find out at once every frailty in an organization itll find out every missing law itll find out every misplaced datum at once and quickly and it will show up very huge so that in an ordinary organization they get board of directors together and the board of directors appoint general manager and the general manager starts organizing things and he gets production engineer of some sort or another and he goes down and builds plant and they start putting the cocacola bottles through the plant and it comes out of the other end filled up full of cocacola they have sales organization they go out and sell the cocacola and then they have an accounting division to fend off income tax and thats it strain painall very smooth of course we notice strange things in an organization like this i wouldnt go so far as to say the thing was completely perfect for instance the way theythey get new head of the company is to marry the bosss daughter the way they regulate matters is usually by somebodys prejudice and all of their selection of personnel is done by system just hiring and firing they keep hiring and firing until they find somebody thatwho can hold the post down somewhat and theyre away but wog organization was based on complete ignoranceand i mean total ignoranceof all the basic laws of organization its the most clean sweep that you ever had much to do with there was one law that they did not violateone lawand that was that any organization is better than organization and thats true the individualistic efforts which have gone forward along the time track are very great and theyre very stellar and they have absolutely endurance now you get bunch of individuals operating together doing something they will always fall apart when they collide with an organized group of individuals ill give you very gory example of this spanish civil wan the government of spain was after all the government of spain it was duly elected and so forth but it had been slow slower than the rest of europe in throwing off the various suppressive shackles of aof an aristocracy that longer knew its job it isnt that aristocracy is bad or even bad system of government it is just that the aristocracy got machinegunned often enough and long enough and became so nogood they could longer do their job and they themselves were totally disorganized so that when the society itself began to organize or when groups ofof politically minded radicals became organized then the aristocracy fell apart it was not itself sufficiently organized for instance the last days of the court of whichever louis it was that lost his head in the french revolutioni didnt know him personallythey all just sort of stood around the court and wept while france was going up in flames what they should have done the king should have said hey you guys go back to yourtake over your baronies and fiefs and hang few people and get some law and order in the land and lets straighten this out they just all hung around and finally the king got hanged you see they were completely disorganized mess they had terrific organization of etiquettewho could sit on stool and who couldnt sit on stool in the court you know this was case of well fellow could practically be excommunicated for that now the french revolution was simply badly organized rabble against completely disorganized aristocracy and the resultant product was mess hah you ought to read the history of france sometime before you take any recommendation for rabbles organizing things france itself has never had government as far as i can figure out it right now has charles gaulle but it doesnt have government you want toif you want to go into just hysterics sometime pick up some short condensed history of france and try to find stable regime since 1400 its fantastic but therefore in that scene any slightly organized group could blow the head off the rest of the disorganized scene do you see badly organized group but it nevertheless was organized to some slight degree and so could take down the products of the sun king and vast history and france the court language of the world and so forth all went by the boards im not teaching you how to be revolutionary im just showing whats happened i dont have to teach you how to be revolutionary now in the spanish civil war the organization of the state did exist and it was duly elected as government and it tended to fall apart within itself and one of the reasons it fell apart within itselfthe dominant philosophy of it was anarchy now according to the capitalist an anarchist is somebody who walks around with bomb in his hands with the fuse lit that is not true the anarchist is in actual fact simply subscriber to the theory that government is unnecessary and he works out terrific organization to organize an organization that makes the organization unnecessary now the predominant military force which fought against the rebellious generals who came in and said this sort of thing cant exist and therefore we are revolting and the revolution was actually by their military when the military came in they of course were far better organized than the anarchists and they started to persevere and the anarchists were running around they couldnt even agree on who was going to be executed so they were just executing everybody and there were small groups of anarchists that every night had goal of executing so many aristocrats and they would take them out in the suburbs and line them up in ditch and shoot them and so forth there was organization even as to who was going to be shot which must have been very complex indeed so the communist being relatively suppressive character gave spain too little too late and gave communism one of the biggest setbacks by just being totally ineffectual they just used spain as proving ground for their pilots and aircraft and they didnt even throw in any infantry but outfits like the loyalist brigades and so on were the hardest fighting of the organizations but these were not russian communist type communists they were international type communists and there were very few russians in the loyalist brigade but these boys had the idea of organization and although they werent as tightly organized as let us say fascist military they nevertheless were very very tightly organized indeed and when communism started walking in against the anarchist the next thing you know there were nothing there but communists and this wasnt that the anarchists were better or worse or those who were subscribing to communism were better or worse it was the fact the communists were better organized than the anarchists and so they absorbed the revolutionary force unto themselves and then with support at all from russia of course fell on their heads and the very superior and gallant organization of the spanish military was able then to crush them rather effectively financed and helped by mussolini and others now thisthis is simplywithin living memory historical example of better organization taking over not against somebody but taking over in its own ranks the communist as sloppy and stupid as his organization was was not quite as bad as the anarchist and so it became communist dominated revolutionary force do you see now there are many examples of this particular character and if you want to look uplook for the ultimate victor in any situation you want to look for the best organized now brilliant leadership can only go so far it can only go so fan brilliant leadership needs execution of sort and where it doesnt get execution it gets failure now in communism you had progressive statistic which even carried on long after his death so long as stalin was masterminding the situation and as long as people were being shot all over the place carrying it out now theres perfectly horrible regime they could never have made it for two minutes if england and the united states had not been pouring in more war equipment than the russians could break up before they got to the front i think they were using butter to grease their tanksreal real serf man that was pretty horrible and yet they were able to hold the german military machine by weight of numbers and by tremendous support and by internal organization now the russian lost stalin but remained organized and asfor little while after stalin kicked the bucket or was shot by his own political palsthey didnt announce his death for dogs ageas long as that was going forward communism continued to have climbing statistic its statistic right now is planed off and has now dived the communist statistic has dived now that doesnt say it wont resurge but it has dived it has lost indonesia it is losing in vietnam whether anybody ever finds theres going to be anything left of those poor people in south vietnam or not they are still losing the complete disorganized state of the viet cong cannot be made up for by superior esprit and elan on the part of the viet cong and so they are being smashed down by superiorly organized military force do you see now this is not in favor of the viet cong or the communist or anything its just commentaries on various organizational patterns but the communistcommunist now departed from communism to quite marked degree russia isnt quite sure that it shouldnt be in coexistent state with the west it isnt quite sure that communism works they have had now long period of time heretheyve had something on the order of i dont know 1917 forward theyve had time enough for all the oldtime bolsheviks to die outto find out that communism does not work and it doesnt it is not workable the reason it is not workable is because there are two specialties of the two philosophies of capitalism and communism capitalism has the philosophy of reward all itall its philosophy consists of is reward reward reward reward see they dont like to punish anybody and theyre pretty softheaded they like buck they seem to have value in dead bodies and capitalism goes along at high level of production and communism does nothing but punish punish punish punish punish and they never dreamed of reward cuba right at this moment could probably solve its whole situationproduction and everything elseby just doing some rewards but it isnt solving anything its going downhill like its on toboggan because all its doing is punish punish punish the russian idea of getting factory operating is to take all the workers out of the factory shoot them and put some new workers in you know they deify the worker thats why they make him into spirit so often but there there we have an organization which has ceased to be organized the way it was organized it has departed now china is frothing it says that russia shouldnt do this and china is trying to exercise pure communism and go ahead with the proper communist organization and for poor country like china with which i have lot of acquaintance i think its absolutely fantastic theyre making any progress at all i know very well i could go fifty miles outside of the city into village and ask the head man or anybody else in the village what is communism and the fellow would look at very blankly and say oh arent the tartars still in charge they make lot of splash in the newspapers but i dont think theyre making much splash in their back country china has successfully absorbed every political philosophy and conqueror for the last several thousand years and never even noticed when he went down for the third time and thats because china has basic organization the communist now is trying to smash and china has an organization that consists of families and there are certain number of families and they are organized with head of the family the heads of those families are organized then in sort of council and then theres several of these groups in city and this goes up to higher council and then the military conqueror of china does business with the top of this he even exerts law and orders through this particular top and thats the basic organization of china which probably still exists at this moment communists organize on the basis of cells but nevertheless they are organizations and when you have an organization and its not confronted with superior organization that organization will normally winwhen its not confronted with superior organization now therefore we ask the question all right what is superior organization well it is one that is better organized well how would you better organize something well youd have to find out something about the laws of organization now man doesnt happen to know anything about the laws of organization and if i ever have had picnic it was trying to go through the mass and morass of material that made up the bulk of organizational technology that is used on this planet i tell you the american management association itself oddly enough for many many years has slavishly copied everything we put out organizationally if you dont believe it look at their congress program sheets and their seminars and so forth they even copy it to the number of lectures and all that sort of thing its really fantastic but we havent fed them any real data on the subject of organization because beyond book or two very early on we didnt actually release any of our organizational data now today after years sprint on this subject and great deal of practical work and that all followed many many many years experience in this line we have stack of policy lettersi wouldnt adventure to say how many feet high it is but it is feet high and it actually contains writeup of the whole subject of organization and its pretty good to be able to get it into set of policy letters just few feet high let assure you because this is an interesting subject an organization is complex mechanism its made up of associated individuals who have an agreed upon goal or intention theyre going along in some direction which they do not too violently disagree with and it will make progress to the degree that it stays in agreement and holds its form and to the degree that it refines its form to meet new threats to its existence and so it will survive now regardless of the historical lines organization is as good as it functions and i can tell you this right now if i havent already that there is such thing as really perfect organization and theres not even actually such thing as good organization and even with all of our policy and all of our materials and so forth there will never be an organization matter how carefully we run it which approaches perfect organization that is because it is dealing with individuals in its organizational pattern who are to greater or lesser degree informed of the laws or rules of the organization and who have greater or lesser degree of agreement with what the organization is doing and who to greater or lesser degree are skilled now i was very struck with set of statistics not too long agoless than year about half year ago i think it wasi started to look over these statistics and i found out that the statistic of each division was in direct ratio to the state of case of the divisional secretary they were being successful or unsuccessful just exactly to the degree of whether they were low level releases or if they were moving up on the vi course and so forth their statistics their overall statistics were dependent upon their state of case now this was not an absolute observation but is an indicator and it tells you then that democracy amongst bunch of completely uneducated hill tribes would be complete bust it tells you that an organization must to some degree consist of sentient and educatable beings and when you have them very much at each others throats you cant have an organization so the basic unit of the organization is still the individual and when you look at some country and say well were going to give it democratic independence with new constitution and look around and find out how many headhunters theyve still got in their hill country that will tell you pretty well the state of the thing what level of literacy does this have well we know at once the spanish revolution could never have succeeded it could never have depended upon its people in an organized group because its level of literacy is terrible the level of literacy of spain is awful mr franco right now has been trying desperately to pick this up he finally got the word theyll never be selfgoverned until theyre at least literate enough to be able to read the proclamations pasted on the walls you know and so this basic unit this basic unit of the organization is the individual you take now democracy such as england and its high level of education and so on that level of democracy is of course very high and advanced democratic level and is all due respects to this or that pretty good now unfortunately for england she went mad twice since the beginning of this century and she got involved in two fantastic catastrophic wars and then got involved in the reconstruction of countries which could be her trade competitors and then let all of her machinery wear out so that she couldnt compete and thats about where she is right this minute now in this particular case the management has been fantastically knuckleheaded so an organization can go downhill with knuckleheadedness at the management level and never lose sight of that fact so here we have two factshere we have two facts we have that an organization is composed of individuals and it can be better than the mean average of its individuals and it can get ahead very rapidly led by highcaliber leader and can also deterioratebut not as rapidly as other thingsby lowcaliber leaden and some of the leaders which they elected into power since the beginning of the century and so forth have been not quite as good as they needed you take chamberlain and chaps like this and so forth eli sits therehe had the intelligence reports on his desk they were actually stacked on his desk as the exact intentions of nazi germany and yet he went to munich he never read the intelligence reports and he gave hitler just that breather hitler needed this is just bum leadership see now were getting sort of panic leadership at this particular time and frankly its my real belief that conditions in england have never been better than they are at this minute business potential production potential finance potential what the country could do for itself how it could clean itself up the way it is going forward its simply somebody is falsifying the statistics i look around and compare this england to an england i knew in 1952 ah its much better country than it was its production figures are up do you see we have management that isright now that is crying wolf well theyre not being too vicious to us at the moment so i shouldnt be critical of them but they have far far better organization here than they realize and theyre suffering little bit at the upper story right at the present time i dont know what would happen if the queen suddenly took oven shes quite an able administrator but its cinch that what you read in screaming headlines in the newspaper about economic crisis in england do not compare in actual fact with the true state of england at this moment and one of the reasons for that is is the average level of the individuals of england is high now the united states which has put more pressure on education even than england hasand it hasand which has more natural resources and which has heterogeneous population whose prejudices were so many and so varied that hardly anything could get into stampede you see by the time youve taken lot of czechs and germans and poles and all kinds of chaps from various countries and youve pushed them all together each one with their own mores and customs and each one with their own screaming prejudices youll find that very few of them canpractically groupvery few of them could get anywhere with its prejudices they can go and preach these prejudices and scream them from the housetops and so on and nobodys paying any attention because theyre trying to push forward their own prejudices after while why nobody listens to anybody with prejudices and america has sort of worn the rough edges of all this off and because very highly skilled people have been pushed in there and because of its verve and so on it is the richest country on the planet just now see not the least reason was however its the fact that nobodys prejudice really counted they still have some christian prejudices which were interesting enough to make them burn all the beatles records the other day this they could agree on but america is one of the tightest organized areas there is an american business is much more tightly organized even than an english business boy if you want to see organization roughshod in its roughest form and so forth you ought to take look at american business organization they shoot them quick you take big companies like standard oil and so on they put out fabulous sums in the education of their employees and they expend fabulous numbers of rounds of ammunition shooting them down when they fall slightly short management in america is tough it puts up with nothing now they are developing great strata of incompetence on the political front which may sometime cause them great deal of trouble because they have now developed philosophy of election which he who can spill the most money into the taxpayers pocket gets elected well whos got to pay it the taxpayer has of course and theyve gone out on program of being the little brother to all the world and pouring everybodys pockets full of money and thereby inflating all their currency theyve got political hierarchy going which is probably going to be the death of them one fine day but in spite of that last yearin spite of everything elseamerica is supposed to have had the greatest year in its history and i think if somebody had looked at the statistics straight in england they would find england did too now this is organization now what are youwhats going to happenwhats going to happen in boojiewoojiekoojiekabloojieland huh it has tradition of an entirely different type of organizationentirely different type of organization and suddenly youre going to throw new organizational pattern down its throat that it has familiarity with and agreement with its education and literacy level is zero and youre just going to set them adrift maybe theyll make it maybe they wont make it maybe this desperate action is the thing they need maybe it isnt but the main point is is here we are going dead against and dead into the teeth of the former political system in other words weve changed the mores and customs of the people you can only go so far with that actually law which is passed which is in the teeth of the mores and customs of the individual will be eventually enforceable it can be enforced little bit but it cant be enforced very much so we get one of these countries suddenly going into tribal organizationits not in democratic organization its in tribal organization although it is democracy in its organization the only people who can stand for office be elected or hold office or be civil servant are the members of the presidents tribe well that isnt democracy and i dont think anybodys pointed it out to them and they quickly and almost instantly revert to military dictatorship but they have simply reverted to the type of organization that they are accustomed to they feel safer in this they dont like this idea of the changing head of state all the time because they know what happens when new head of state comes in he kills everybody who was an enemy of the old head of state so now you dont know who to be the friend of because if the state head changes why hes going to shoot everybody and therefore you cant be his friend because hes going to be out one of these days and youll be shot for having been his friend and you should just see how some poor people ive seen out in the world sit with their chin cupped in their palms looking very gloomy and you say whats the matter whats the matter dont you like all this new freedom yeah its all right but we dont know whos going to be in charge next well youll think immediately theyre talking about revolution theyre talking about election election looks like revolution so theyre having to get used to this kind of thing the basic building block is the individual now if those individuals were selfsupportive and did not need to be supported if they were actually working in culture with which they were familiaryou know theyve got western culture being shoved down their throats and so on im talking about india africa even south america you get situation where they not only have new culture but they have new political organization and then as individuals they dontarent able to fit into this new political organization and then the head of states fool now what youre going to get out of something like this man youre going to get mess but oddly enough even an organization as bad as that is superior to disorganized group of the same types of individuals and thats the only excuse an organization has is in the long run it is better for individuals and better for their survival and better for the culture and better for its survival to have things organized organization has tremendous drawbacks the drawbacks most of the time do not offset the things it has in its favor but never lose sight of the fact that any organization has drawbacks it limits the power of choice of the individual it very often swallows up the talents and potential contribution of the individual it very often plays hob with the very principles its trying to forward wrongly led it becomes machine that goes straight over the cliff to destruction but at the same time organizations endure better than disorganized activities now i dont like to talk much about the whole track but it is true that the only great societies of outer space are those which have continued under organized ots now theyre merely released ots which is quite remarkable but they have tremendous duration and thats the only place where ots surviveorganized ots but youd say these fellows are completely unorganizable because they have total differences of opinions and so forth yes yes yes they have total differences of opinion but they also recognize its better to be organized than to be disorganized they also recognize the liabilities of organization its very interesting on an ot organization to see the shift about of posts in the upper hierarchy of them those posts shift and they shift up and they shift down and back and forth and they shuffle around amongst themselves this sort of thing but theyre great minority theyre minority group in charge of fantastic majorities now if you took on all by yourself as released otwe dont know anything about cleared ots but as released ot we can merely guessif you were to take on any part of this civilization and i would say even the worst wogdom that had just been organized as new democracy i think you would eventually come cropper because its the individual up against the organization i dont care how powerful the individual was thats interesting thats interesting as fact and is the only thing in actual fact which excuses organization it has endurance it has survival the average fates of the individuals in it are preferable to disorganized activities theres nothing more can be said for one but imagine an organization organized by people who knew noknew slightest part of the laws of organization now that would be ruddy old mess you know laws of organization and yet you organize an organizationi think youd get radio set that wouldnt play very well if you didnt know anything about how to put together radios and you put together radio i think itd be mess and thats true about organizations now unfortunately i have not had time due to the breakneck pace of research and so on to isolate out of all of this mass of material the basic laws which monitor it those basic laws are strewn through the material occurring where they are pertinent but there are whole set of basic laws and those occur where they occur in the policy letters now they arent even phrased to be highsounding laws sometimes but when youre studying this material you look through it and you will find out that some law has been stressed more than others sometimes law has been placed in solid caps the whole paragraph and you will find one now here is law which is of interest large organization is composed of groups and small organization is composed of individuals now ive just got through telling you that the basic building block 0 any organization is of course its individual membersthats perfectly true but when you get just so many of these individual members you lose touch between the head of the organization and the individual member so that he then depersonalizes the individual member and tends to treat him as cog in the machine and goes the way the communist is going the fellow is nothing but number he has feelings he can be stamped on at will and so on well thats because the hugeness of the communist state is so muchwell is incomparable magnitude to the individual communist or even communist cell so you get the magnitude of the state versus really the cell whichwhich may only be composed of five or six members you see thats too great the comparable magnitude there is all out and it makes the individual feel oppressed and that is what is wrong with the socialist state and that is really all that is wrong with the socialist state it is the state governing the individual you know this old law whereby when you stamp on the earth then the earth moves to that tiny degreeyesand so on and then moves back against your heel did you ever have the physics professor that let you in on that bunk well you know ive stamped on planets and stamped on them and ive never had them move ive stood outside of few few lives ago and had them move but incomparable magnitude its like grasshopper you say well if grasshopper hit ball often enough and long enough and so forth the ball would eventually move the funny part of it is the ball does not move and you get this state as huge bowling ball running down across the little ant or the individual citizen and he is smashed and he is smashed right now now they got this going in the roman empire to point where there was place to hide and they can talk all they want to about the drop and decay of the empire and why it pulled all of its troops out of every place and place could defend itself any more and it was dependent upon the imperial troops to defend the community and when they disappeared why of course that colony fell in they can theorize like this but how come the community couldnt organize to defend itself with the imperial troops gone how come eventually were they only able to employ barbarians as imperial troops perfectly true praetorian guard eventually got to be nothing but solid barbarians and that was because the state had leaned on the individual so long that they had smashed him flat he longer had spirit enough to defend himself or anything else because the individual citizen could be leaned on by the state they thought nothing of issuing an imperial decree against sergeant of the guardas i once experienced to my sorrow incomparable magnitude what is all of this huge organization called the people bringing charge against john jones for stealing bottle of milk aw john jones just goes flat he looks at all thewow see its mechanism which sort of tries to make paranoid out of him you see everybodys against him you get crime you get dispirited citizenry you get people going around saying why should i vote my vote doesnt have any count on anything anyhow point in voting any more and so on these are the signs of decay which you see when you have merely individuals and the state and its the primary reason why communism will fail socialism will inevitably fail now where you have permitted companies to existi know the russians have collectivestheyre kind of joke where you have companies the state has to deal with the companies and the roughness with which the united states deals with companies like standard oil right today is horrifying boy theyre in there with hobnailed boots stamping all over the place you know those companies by the way maintain whole accounting departments that youd have to see the end ofyou could only see the end of with spyglass you know just mobs of people doing nothing but taking care of the government claims and pressures on the company now if government can stamp all over company to this degreeand sometimes they put them out of business with this stampingwhy what can they do to an individual well in the roman empire nobody had any place to go the only civilized area of the world was already owned by rome there was nothing but barbarians who ate sour milk outside the borders of it in all directions you had place to go and you were crushed so the ideal organization is not an organization which is composed of individuals only its composed of individuals formed into subgroups and you must compose the individuals into subgroups so we get this law large organization is composed of groups and small organization is composed of individuals now that law is so much law that if you try to expand an organization which is only composed of individualsyou know everybodys wearing everybody elses hat and theyre all very skilled and all very fine individuals and they try to expand upjust you know bring theirtheir volume up 20 percentthey all go appetite over tin cup they go all to pieces they cant make it you see because large organization is composed of groups and small organization is composed only of individuals so the small organization being composed only of individuals will remain small organization as long as its only composed of individuals you see the law works in reverse it limits the size of the organization and so whenever you have socialism or communism where you have this huge thing called the state governing this little tiny fellow called the individual it eventually starts shrinking do you see you get shrinkage and the state will actually get less and less powerful and more and more confused now income tax is the total violation today of the government ruling the individual every individual has to report to the government every year and that is direct violation of it so income tax willynilly will make country grow smaller it will bring down it hasnt anything to do with economics see its the fact that every individual in it can be jumped on by this huge thing called the government every individuals got his chest bared to the government he hasnt got any senior he can go to for any buffer or protection well therefore the state inevitably will suffer for it and will become smaller and smaller activity thats volume will have begin begun to suffer now it hasnt set in in the united states as fast as it has set in in england but england has had income tax active longer than the united states itll catch up with the united states too because it violates that law smallyou see what i mean about these laws you know it is law it isnt an observation and it operates any way that you apply it small organization is composed of individuals large organization is composed of groups well how would you make large organization be composed of groups well you would try to cut off the organization versus the individual and get the organization versus the group do you see you would have the individual as part of small group and that small group is what is leaned on by larger group which is what is leaned on by slightly larger group what is what is leaned on by slightly larger group and so we say larger group smaller group what are we talking about well group does have an optimum size if manager wants to work himself mad he has about seven or eight things under him now if he is very good he could have seven or eight things under him so that he came into contact with seven or eight separate individuals or seven or eight groups who are represented each one by one individual do you see hed work like mad well if he only had two under him hed loaf like mad and so its someplace between two and eight now this depends to large degree upon the individual capability of the manager in handling thewhat number is the manager so bad he can only handle two or is he so good he can handle eight so we take rough average of this that more or less holds good and we say its five you can have manager and five or head of group and five and so we get downhow big is big group then would be ten you know too big see but big and small group would be two three two three what well either two or three subunits or two or three individuals down at the lowest unit so we get the optimum size of group of individuals which would be five now by the time you get five and then you expand and you add number six and number seven and number eight by that time youd better split the thing into couple of groups so were really studying how do you split things up into groups and hold them that way and that in actual fact is the hardest task i have in scientology organizations is making secretary take responsibility for division and divisional members only look to the secretary and that broken down even further that members of section look to their section leader and the director only looks to section leaders and the secretary only looks to directors and yet because things are ratatat and tippy and emergencies come up and danger conditions occur then they make danger conditions and real danger condition would be secretary giving direct orders to one of the people of section officer bypassing the chain of command because immediately youre going to make the organization smaller the organizations going to get smaller the more you do of that the less size your organizations going to have because it violates that basic law now if you follow this basic law you actually can move it on out to where your group could contain the populai mean your organization could contain the population of the planet size doesnt mean anything as long as you know that one law therefore you need an expansional system which is expansionable and contractiblethe thing has got to be made bigger or smaller its got to fit little organizations or big organizations youve got to have some kind of pattern which is expansionable one time i hoped to get this pattern down to as few as two staff members but i find out that that is not possible it can be gotten down to the basic size of group which is an optimum group and could be gotten down to five or six people and you can fit this organizational pattern on it but you cant get them down to two because two isnt group really its pair now when you get state which is breaking down the family even breaking down the family as group if theres nothing substituted for it you see every time you getthe state is death on business the state is death on the family the state is death on any of these group formationsyou get this type of vendetta you see the state is death on social groups or death on the church and by the way communist states are death on lot of these things and youll see them shrink they become unmanageable they become very unhappy they are very miserable to be around they are awful to try to work with and they will eventually come appetite over tin cup they will come unstuck so chain of command may be looked upon as one means and only one means of just making people miserable and giving people status and making somebody better than somebody else but in actual fact without it you do not have an expansionable groupthe group will never grow in size now what contracts group in size is its managers become overworked when manager becomes just too overworked he ceases to expand he sees to it that he doesnt expand he becomes too overworked so one of youryour greatest liability then is an overwork of manager if you want your group to expand then you had better fix it up so your managers arent overworked so that if you were to set together group that was going appetite over tin cup you probwould be very foolish as an efficiency expert and if you knew this and if youd worked in scientology organization and knew these policy letters youd go out and frankly general managers and heads of departments and so forth would look at you with round eyes they would say good heavens wheres this come from because this is true you know this is true ive worked with it yes you know and theyd be agreeing with you all over the place diving in your front door actually one of the heaviest drives i got in scientology in rhodesia was trying to teach people organization scientology organization they wanted to know all about this this was interestingvery applicable to what they were doing so that an individual going into group would be very foolish and the efficiency expert can cut his own throat by going down and doing timemotion and stopwatch studies and telling workers what to do without consulting their foremen and violating things in other ways any gm that thinks he can hire somesome efficiency expert and not pay any attention to whats being made efficient is crazy you see because hell eventually get unhappy with him the only person i would work with would be the gm and preferably the chairman of the board and one of the first things i would do would be to hire him more stenographers and more clerks and set him up communication center well just by doing that all by itself you would improve the business it would follow automatically and then you could start breaking the organization down into its proper groups well we get down to what is proper group well oddly enough our seven divisional system which we have here today this seven division system that you see posted on your big org boards and that sort of thing thats very very interesting pattern because if itself is very much violated why things again wont expand there are all kinds of odd little laws about this you cant have section that isnt dependent on some other section group must be interdependent you cant have division which sets up autonomous activities which then require further service from the rest of the organization the second that you set up unit here which is going to float free itll float free and collapse it must have service and communication with the remainder of the organization its all very well somebody says all of sudden hes out someplace hes setting up some hospitals that weve inherited or something like this and hes setting these up well he wants his own purchasing unit and so forth well he could have his own purchasing unit providing it came from our treasury division not to him but for his treasury division see you get violations of this and you will get yourself trouble interdependency these must be interdependent now i dont care what you call them we call them divisions now there are seven divisions and they go one two three four five six seven because its circle it isnt twodimensional plane its sort of cylinder and proper org board would be drawn on huge cylinder it meets itself coming or going so to emphasize that fact we put division seven up in front of division one now the entrance to an organization is in the first department of the first division now weirdly enough this thing is organized so as to impel particle from the first division right straight on out the back door and any particle entered early will shunt late and that is the way that thing works and regardless of how you try to stop it it eventually will it will enter and eject now as they come around to seven seven doesnt necessarily catchwhich is another reason its thereit doesnt necessarily catch whats ejected over here at six so there is way out but this is sort of aso there is an ejecting flow here and you start it in here bzzzppp itll go out the back now if you violate the position of anything on this chart you cut your throat which is fascinating every once in while somebody will begin to have great deal of trouble and he wont know why hes having trouble and hes having trouble because hes got section or function wrong on the org board and they are actually found by trial and error once they were put down in this order then they had to be adjusted and readjusted we got enormous troublewe got into enormous trouble because we tried to put what was essentially originor construction down here in department nine and every time we tried to put it into department nine it obviously didnt belong in department nine it actually belonged way up at the front here at origin the least place it could have been put was department one that was as deep as you could have gone into the organization but it came back here towards source and you had to get construction back towards source otherwise it just wouldnt work you see so if something is mispositioned on the board it will be nonfunctional and cease to work so thats the first test of whether or not something is properly organized is does it function now thisthesethese are not named according to master name chart that i drew up on this thing but these divisions actually are the various actions which would take place if you were setting up factory government service activity or anything these are the native basic things that must be set up and they must be set up in this sequence all youd have to do is get to be an expert on scientology organization and you could go run rings round any efficiency expert on the planet right this minute its fantastic what suddenly starts showing up but remember to learn well what you learn you start learning our communication systems you got our communication systems going in some offices and so on i just put it into total wog office and boy i had trouble getting it in oh man did i have trouble getting it in i finally got it in and once i got it in why it was just all smooth as glass and they didnt ever know how they had ever worked under anything else they kept trying to tell that it hasnt been like that in offices weve worked in letters would come in and just lie in the middle of desks undelivered and nothing ever logged and nothing ever filed and each girl when she typed letter had little file of her own on her desk and nobody ever checked anything i dont know how they lived that was the organization that they were used to which was organization at all now as we look this over we see that this first division in actual fact is the communications division its called hco with us but its the communications division now this is analogous to getting things communicating as you would have to do in putting together any plant or factory youd first have to start something where people could get into communication with somebody about what you were doing you see otherwise nothing would happen thereafter and then with the communications youve got to have some kind of dissemination well in factory or something you might have to sell stocks and bonds or something to get finance thatd be dissemination youd have to tell people what you were going to make and all kinds of things of this character and that would come under the general heading dissemination your next one is really your organization division we call it treasury now but its actually the division which organizes the actual mest of the production activities it gets together the sand to make the glass for the bottles and the sugar and saccharin for the candy and so forth it does the assembly of this type of action and it also has the idea of money assets what it makes and so forth all must come in at this point you must have your money before you can buy the sand for the glass and so on and then we get into whatwe call it technical in actual fact the right name is productionyour production division and that is your division four and then your next one is not really qualifications but correction should be called the correction division or the adjustment division but qualifications would also serve and then we get the distribution division where they get rid of it you see but in the process of getting rid of it theyve got to have full salespersonal sales organization and that sort of thing so when theyre busy getting rid of it they are also making new customers who enter in here you say how about seven doesnt anything go through seven well yes everything tries to go through seven like on an emeter so we get athe organization here that keeps the machine going that gives the machine sufficient authority in order to travel and resolves the various problems and bugs it runs intoit sits up here at the head of the line but it can equally sit at the bottom of the line now the departments all have names and these names have nothing really to do with any name that you have heard as the names of departments and these are the first one would really be the office of the executive director or the general manager or something of that character it would be the person who was in charge of it now this could beif the chairman of the board or somebody like this were actually the manager of the company and some such action then his office would be there now ideally this would be source and this would also be the person who had developed the product and youll notice that that often happens in companies and so on but the main thing that man had never solved and the reason you have all different kinds of politics and disorganizational patterns and so on is because man never solved the problem of succession you know you get whole bunch of redhots and royalists and everything else together and you ask them whats the ideal form of the government and they say benign monarchy and they all tell you this and you say whats wrong with benign monarchy well you cant succeed it so therefore its good thats their only contest with it you ought to try it out sometime you get bunch of guys matter what their political affiliations are arguing and they will eventually agree that its benign monarchy andbut it cant be succeeded well actually weve worked out succession in our particular case and so on because what is developed by these other two offices here becomes approved by the lrh communicator according to policy and he approves anything that is not against policy if its not directly against policy why he can approve it so therefore you get management and you dont have to have succession which i consider quite interesting because the internecine warfare which has occurred amongst man and the whole destruction ofrome and so forth all occurred because of succession so there was normally somebody who started the company and in the united states that ought to be the office of george washington got the idea i dont know who was the first bloke over here in this present racial strain in england but it would be somebody i suppose it would be william i guess itd be bill bill the bastard and that ought to be his office and that ought to be going strong and they would have saved themselves all kinds of bloodshed and civil war and all kinds of things and so on but he also would have had to have written up lot of policy letters anyhow so this is source now each one of these departments has its proper name and its source existence conditions recognition communication perception orientation understanding enlightenment energy adjustment body prediction activity production result review ability purposes clearing realization and thats the lot and its because of those successive names that it actually regulates the function of the department and if you understood this adequately you could understand the department much more easily by noticing its tag its action now it doesnt fully explain it and so forth but nevertheless it gives you the code word of the department for instance the department of routing appearances and personnel is recognition and thats essentially what it does it recognizes it says hello it lets other people recognize what it is and let them see where the door is and few minor things of this character you see so you get communication then you get perception this is your department of inspection and reports department three you can go down here you pick any of them up not to go over them all because you can have patterns of this you get department eleven the department of training and its activity now why activity and why production well you actuallyyour productionthis moot point whether or not we should have training in department twelve or training in department eleven you have to decide on what were actually producing well the ultimate production of scientology is not auditors but is states of case and so of course we get department twelve being production now all of this pattern is put together in that fashion now each one of these departments have five sections and it shouldnt have more than five if it has more than five it should be written up again and some of those sections put in and then those sections are divided into subsections and then really patternwise are divided into units at the moment why theyre dividing sections directly into units well one fine day they will have to divide it into subsections divide it into units to subunits and so forth in order to make enough space and personnel but this in actual sober fact is flow chart and if things dont flow on it theres something wrong so we get one of these other primary laws of an organization which is fascinating and which i have the hardest possible time teaching anybody and the one i have the awfulest time teaching anybodyits terrible trying to get this point acrossits the fast flow system of management and of course everybody sits there and says oh great fast flow system sure everythings got to go fast yeah we understand it man probably it ought to be called something very complex so theyd think they had to grind away to understand it because the truth of the matter is is fast flow system of management is dont inspect until it goes wrong and the trouble with every bleeding blinking organization since the beginning of time has been that when it was right they inspected it and all they did was hold it up and hold it up and you get blanket arbitrary laws being thrown into the organization continuously something like this well lets just make sure we dont get any suppressives aboard lets make everybody who comes in to take any training or processing immediately take suppressive test you see what that does that instantly stops your flow so anything that stops your flow is antiorganization and every time you find something being inspected which hasnt been found wrong youre going to get some kind of slowdown this is typical mankind action one sailor is late coming back for liberty so the captain of the ship issues an order saying all sailors hereinafter may have liberty typical typical suppressive human action so we find one pc has managed to skid by certs and awards with the wrong certificate so we put certificate checker in to make sure that each pc that goes through certs and awards has his certificate checked afterwards well that isnt the way you run an organization that is going to expand the way you run an organization that is going to expand requires nerve something like world war i fighter pilot dont be so damn nervous when something is found to be wrong swoop down on it from the executive secretarial from the secretarial and every other level inspect it crossinspect it scream shoot execute and so forth after it has been found to be wrong do you see then act dont fail to act at that point but just let it run giddy as hell right up to that moment pcs are tearing past the examiner at mad rate not even checked not even checked it goes on day after day after day it goes on week after week after week and all of sudden we turn up with some guy who didnt even go near the auditor getting past the examiner at that moment the executive secretaries the secretaries involved the section officers involved the guardian everybody else involved descend on that point it wont happen again for another year and your flow will come out but dont put in permanent preventers on the line and you get flowing organization so an organization regardless of what it is must produce something thats why you dont have government that is any damn good on the whole planet because they produce nothing their total production is paper they must produce something and you cannot have an organization that isnt staticized the wrong people always get shot every eager beaver thats making little more motion than anybody else being little more critical he instantly is going to get shot in any organization that isnt staticized what do we mean by statistics that means every person in the organization has got to have statistic as long as the statistic is not in terrible state of decay and is going up why the guy is safe and if it starts to decay and cave in hes not safe now if you dont have that system you cant have justice in an organization because all the guys who are doing their jobs and so on are relatively safe inside the organization the people who are not doing their jobs become very unsafe but of course theyre making everybody else unsafe too their fellow staff members and the organization itself is suffering so organizations which are not staticized are very very dangerous to be around thats why governments are very dangerous to be around today theyre not staticized there is way i tried to tell the head of committee in parliamentary body how to staticize his civil service he was head of committee which was going to do something desperate with the civil service and i said well why dont you staticize them and i spent two or three hours explaining to him what statistic was and boy it was going in one ear and sticking right straight in the meat he told somebody the next day he couldnt tell what i was all about well he had some basic law that hadnt even vaguely come up for air i suppose the basic thing that was out on him was he didnt realize that anybothinganybody should expect anything from anybody else i suppose you know that he wasnt up to point of realizing that an organization should expect something from an individual or something of this character you know something wild was out therebig you know so anyway the way the pattern is organized its organized to flow and its organized to expand for to give you more than just few comments at this time is very very adventurous indeed but i do want to tell you thatjust these few little things that ive already told you about organization is better than organization organization is any good but its better than not having any an efficient and effective organization is survival organization and its better for the individual to be member of an efficient and effective organization than an inefficient ineffective onenaturally that organizations should flow that they should be expandable they should be contractible and that their primary thing that gets violated is people start inspecting things that dont need inspection and therefore interfering with things that dont need to be interfered with and basically that the scientology pattern of organization which is in use today if understood in its basic fundamentals and if studied from that line is applicable to any business or any activity or any government reg and i had ball down one time working this over on basis of asuddenly dawned on that we might possibly have governmentor it dawned on himthat this might be governmental pattern and sure enough it works out to governmental pattern it would be government that would take into itself every company there and i suddenly realized that in this we have something which is far more socialistic than socialism far more communistic than communism and we can say with some sneer to the socialists and communists au pif bunch of conservative we could say do you know there are people in russia today who are not staff members theyre secondrate staff members theyre called citizens when they do have it you know the united states it only has citizens staff members leaves man completely on his own so actually this is much further to the left than anybody has ever gone what youd do would be to introduce individual companies into your production and activity units as service or production units you see one last thing ill tell you this actually is based on something that is in actual fact trillions of years old and it is an old old old old old organization that gave the basic clue on which to go and it is an organization which lasted itself about 80 trillion years and is still going strong and the reason you see threeyou see there could easily be eight there could easily be fifteen departments in divisionbut the reason there are three and the reason it goes into units of three and so on is because you have mind body product if you want to understand this the basismechanism on which it is organized you have the thetan with mind and body and product so you have secretary who has mind body product and when you put together your little units and that sort of thing and so on it goes mind body product theres somebody in charge of the mind the body and the product and if you want to look at some secretary and wonder why she isnt doing too well recognize she doesnt have things laid out on the basis of mind body product if you want to know why typist isnt doing well she really doesnt have these three things she doesnt have mind body product she doesnt figure out what shes going to do you see there is body of anything with which to perform it and she doesnt look on anything shes doing as product or one of these things will be missing and that however is not graphable and it is good enough to have caused civilization to have lasted 80 trillion years but it isis not graphable because you just try and graph it sometime to put thetan with mind body product with thetan with mind body product inside thetan with mind body product we used to do it with lenses not on twodimensional graphit was done with multiple lensesand it actually was galactic type government that carried planetary systems and planets and nation was almost too small to be flyspeck you see big populations involved but it was all on thetan mind body product and this is refined version of it which works at our level and which gives us very broad view of what were trying to do youre perfectly at liberty to curse organization youre perfectly at liberty to find all kinds of faults with organization and while youre doing so just remember that there is such thing as perfect organization and that any organization is better than organization thank you
