bridge publications inc newsletter date cause level the first ladder to ot well i did have something to talk to you about now that i think it over very carefully and whats wrong with youtheres something wrong with you of courseis just this youre so birddogged onto the dazzling glories of ot that youre going to leave the rest of the human race hanging in midair between the bottom rung of the ladder to ot and the ground because the bottom rung of ot does not sit on the ground theres large gap between the ground and the bottom rung and theres another ladder there and you try to climb the upper ladder without letting anybody climb the lower ladder or try to get people to climb the upper ladder without letting them climb the lower ladder or showing its there theres going to be an awful lot of people walking around in circles thinking youre nuts or were nuts or it doesnt work or its too horrible or something is all wrong and itd be something like theres big amusement park but they cant find the gate to get in dont you see theres all kinds of weird randomity and devt is about to develop on this one point because most everybody is thinking and gets birddogged onto and fixated with the idea that ot starts from the ground and ot doesnt start from the ground it starts from the top of another ladder so that the public at large is going to have its attention centered on the second ladder and everybodys going to be sweating and working to get them to climb this second ladder and selling this second ladder and talking to them about the second ladder and getting them all whipped up about the second ladder dont you see and hell they cant find any second ladder there isntcant find any ladder at all because their attention is not being directed to the first ladder and the first ladder could be called cause level l ron hubbard excerpted from the saint hill new civilization series lectures birddogged in state of seeking out or searching for something diligently doggedly or with great intensity balancing the use of force and intelligence an article by l ron hubbard from the saint hill new civilization series lectures and what were doing actually so you wont be in the dark is were closing out very long cycle of long losing cycletremendous lengthof the ot the cycle of loss of the ot and being now had to come to point where he believedand couldnt do otherwisethe only safe place to be was in one of these meatbody civilizations complete with airplanes and that that was the more or less winning side of the ledger and there was real possibility of being free of that economic duress bethese twobit games these accelerated aberrative conditions as they march forward there was going and sitting on mountaintop quietly for few thousand years and catching your breath the fight had been lost in order words in other words strata and quality and character of life had been lost that is defeat you dont see any ots walking around right now well its very peculiar that they reach almost to modern timesalmost to modern times as you audit pcs youll be quite surprised now and then to find one that was ot five hundred years ago you look on this normally as something that occurred on the very very far backtrack something that occurred in the dimmest beginnings of history but in actual fact this is not true at all these reach right up practically to present time but losing all the way there was method of retaining and maintaining stability and eventually here you sit and what are you doing here well what youre doing here is youre in meat body and you see the airplanes flying around overhead and you realize that the continuous association with meat body is just continuous concatenation of collecting engrams like mad and keying in things like crazy and that its the downward spiral with accelerated jets behind it what made that condition how come this took place well all battles are won by combination of two elements and these are force and intelligence and given enough force of course there is opposing sideeverybody hopes the united states in world war ii eventually got up to the idea of small task force had to practically raise the level of water of the pacific ocean before they would make an attack tremendous tremendous force tremendous force and of course you take something like an atomic bomb that can obliterate an entire country that is tremendous tremendous force and it succeeds in shortterm winsshortterm wins and that is all you ever get from tremendous force is shortterm win never longterm win never the longterm win is achieved by balance between force and intelligence now intelligence alone in active action is not enough the wise men of tibet were just few years ago driven out of their mountain fortresses by the dumbest infantrymen the world has known for some time isnt that interesting they were infinitely wise and their infinite wisdom brought them total defeat so when you take these two elements if you are sometime trying to solve the problem of whether you did right or whether you did wrong take these two elements and look them over in relationship to what you did and youll find out that there is an imbalance in any defeat there was an imbalance of intelligence and force these two things were out of gear youre either using all force and practically grasshopper intelligence or youre using monumental intelligence and saying god will protect forgetting at the same time that you were the only god around to do any protecting its sort of pathetic this ot sitting down on the vatican steps saying god will protect when he may very well have started the whole myth where does he think he still is now all of your losses were contributed to by these two elements out of balance and any coordinated civilization plowing forward using technology combining that technology with force keeping some sort of balance between these two things can make monkey out of an otliterally there was an implant four galaxies over that taught you you came from apes darwinthats the whole of the darwinian theory is implanted there in the course of about day and everybody bought it you know you come up through the mollusk and sloth and ape and all this sort of thing and theres not damn word of truth in it see you see that nothing to do with it l ron hubbard excerpted from the
