eesa division of hr 1424 pl 110 343 permits the secretary of the treasury to purchase and insure troubled assets to provide stability and prevent disruption in the economy and financial system the act established two organizations to provide broad oversight for the programa financial stability oversight board fsob and congressional oversight panel cop the act also placed audit responsibilities for the program with two individualsa new special inspector general ig for the troubled asset relief program tarp and the comptroller general cg of the united states who heads the government accountability office gao several aspects of the fsob do not appear to be cl early delineated in the act including where the fsob is established within the federal government whether it is covered by variety of general management laws and how the fsob is to be funded and staffed the act is also unclear regarding certain aspects of the special ig for the tarp including where the office of the special ig is to be established or housed how or when its authorized appropriation is to be provided and its specific investigative authorities the duties of both oversight panels and both audit organizations overlap in several key areas and some of the reporting requirements also overlap although 18 types of eesa reports are required none of them specifically require disclosure of how the funds are used by the recipients and only one report is required to be made to the public the special ig for the tarp and the initial members of the cop were not named until midnovember 2008 and the special ig was not confirmed until december 8 2008more than two months after eesa was enacted the nature of the troubled assets being purchased have changed since eesa was enacted perhaps necessitating reassessment of the acts oversight mechanisms finally it is unclear what effect the various oversight and audit mechanisms will have on the balance of power between congress and the executive branch congress gave itself expedited legislative procedures to disapprove actions by the secretary but only after the first 350 billion has been obligated if the president supports the actions of the secretary of the treasury and vetoes disapproval resolution overcoming the veto will require twothirds vote in both houses of congress both gao and the cop raised concerns about the operation of the tarp in their initial reports and several members of congress have expressed concerns about the department of the treasurys operation of the programeven suggesting that the second 350 billion in tarp funds should be denied unless the banks can show that the funds provided thus far are being used for lending this report will be updated when additional information or perspectives become available regarding the acts oversight mechanisms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34713g7g150g142g155g144g142g151g140g162g561g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g21g157g138g139g146g149g146g163

eesa division of hr 1424 pl 110343 is to immediately provide authority and facilities that the secretary of the treasury can use to restore liquidity and stability to the financial system of the united states1 section 101 of the act purchases of troubled assets authorizes the secretary of the treasury to establish the troubled asset relief program or tarp to purchase and to make and fund commitments to purchase troubled assets from any financial institution on such terms and conditions as are determined by the secretary and in accordance with this act and the policies and procedures developed and published by the secretary the term troubled assets is defined in section 39 of the act as residential or commercial mortgages and any securities obligations or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages that in each case was originated or issued on or before march 14 2008 the purchase of which the secretary determines promotes financial market stability and b any other financial instrument that the secretary after consultation with the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote financial market stability but only upon transmittal of such determination in writing to the appropriate committees of congress the act requires the secretary of the treasury to implement the program through an office of financial stability within the departments office of domestic finance the office is to be headed by an assistant secretary appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate although the law permits the secretary to appoint an interim assistant secretary without senate confirmation2 the secretary is authorized in section 101c to take such actions as the secretary deems necessary to carry out the authorities in this act however section 101d requires the secretary to publish program guidelines within two business days after the first purchase of troubled assets3 those guidelines are required to include mechanisms for purchasing troubled assets methods of pricing and valuing troubled assets procedures for selecting asset managers and criteria for identifying troubled assets for purchase section 115 of the act initially permits the secretary to purchase up to 250 billion of troubl ed assets and up to total of 350 billion of assets upon written certification by the president that the secretary needs additional authority4 subsequently if the president submits written plan to congress and if congress does not object within 15 calendar days through joint resolution of disapproval described in subsection 115c the secretary may purchase up to 700 billion in troubled assets section 102 of the act insurance of troubled assets states that if the secretary establishes the program authorized in section 101 then the secretary shall establish program to guarantee troubled assets originated or issued prior to march 14 2008 including mortgagebacked 1 for more information on eesa and related issues see crs report rl34730 the emergency economic stabilization act and current financial turmoil issues and analysis by baird webel and edward v murphy 2 on october 6 2008 the secretary of the treasury named assistant secretary neel kashkari as interim assistant secretary for the office of financial stability 3 on october 28 2008 the

timely payment of up to 100 of the principal and interest related to the assets g17g159g142g155g156g146g144g145g157g561g138g151g141g561g3g158g141g146g157g561g15g142g140g145g138g151g146g156g150g156g561 eesa established two organizations to provide broad oversight for the stability programa financial stability oversight board fsob and congressional oversight panel cop the act also placed audit responsibilities for the progra m with two individualsa new special inspector general ig for the tarp and with the comptroller general cg of the united states who heads the government accountability office gao5 many of the audit and reporting responsibilities delineated in the act specifically reference the actions required in sections 101 and 102 of the act to purchase troubled assets and to insure those assets6 questions have been raised by some observers as to whether these oversight and audit responsibilities are complimentary to one another or are contradictory7 this report provides preliminary comparison and analysis of the specific authorities and responsibilities of the fsob and the cop and also compares and analyzes the roles and responsibilities of the special ig and the cg as described in the act

g17g159g142g155g156g146g144g145g157g561g18g138g151g142g149g561 as described in eesa the fsob and the cop are similar in some respects but different in other respects also the act is unclear with regard to several key aspects of one or both of these entities the discussion below and in table 1 at the end of this report compares the fsob and the cop on several relevant dimensions 5 gaos responsibilities in the act are in addition to its existing responsibilities for example 31 usc 7121 requires the cg to investigate all matters related to the receipt disbursement and use of public money and 31 usc 717b states that the cg shall evaluate the results of program or activity the government carries out under existing law for more information on gao see crs report rl30349 gao government accountability office and general accounting office by frederick m kaiser 6 the act also requires certain reports from the office of management and budget omb and the congressional budget office cbo for example section 202a requires omb to report to the president and the congress within 60 days of the first exercise of authority under section 101a or by december 31 2008 whichever comes earlier and semiannually thereafter on how much the troubled asset program is costing how that cost estimate was derived and how the estimate changed from the previous report cbo is required to assess the omb reports within 45 days of their submission to the congress also section 201 of the act authorizes cbo and the joint committee on taxation to receive all information used by the secretary in connectio n with activities authorized under this act to assist congress with its oversight responsibilities 7 see for example gibson dunn crutcher llp financial markets in crisis sectionbysection analysis of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 available at httpblogslawharvardeducorpgovfiles200810100208analysiseconomicsabilizationact08pdf the authors note that the oversight entities overlap considerably and that while congress may want multiple perspectives the potential for these oversight entities to trip over each other in the course of their work is great

of the legislative branch in contrast section 104a of the act simply says that the fsob is established but does not indicate whether the board is part of the executive or legislative branches all five members of the fsob are from the executive branch the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the secretary of the treasury the director of the federal housing finance agency the chairman of the securities and ex change commission and the secretary of housing and urban development therefore one could reasonably presume that the fsob is an executive branch entity even if one makes that presumption however it is unclear whether the fsob is intended to be subunit within the department of the treasury or some other agency or whether the board is intended to be freestanding independent entity the organizational placement of the fsob may have number of implications including whether the board is covered by variety of statutory management and transparency requirements such as the federal records act the federal advisory committee act the freedom of information act the government in the sunshine act and various human resources management and ethics requirements 8 legislative branch entities like the cop are generally not subject to these requirements g20g142g156g153g152g151g156g146g139g146g149g146g157g146g142g156g561 the listed responsibilities of the fsob in section 104a of the act and the cob in sections 125b and of the act are similar both in gene ral and with regard to particular elements for example both entities are broadly responsible for reviewing the secretarys actions in carrying out the requirements of the act and both are specifically responsible for examining the effect of those actions on home ownership financial markets and costs to the taxpayers as discussed in more detail later in this report both are also required to report to congress on their findings however only the fsob is charged with 1 making recommendations to the secretary of the treasury regarding the use of his authorities under the act and 2 reporting any suspected fraud misrepresentation or malfeasance to the special ig or the attorney general of the united states on the other hand only the cop is specifically 1 permitted to hold hearings take testimony receive evidence and administer oaths and affirmations to witnesses and 2 required to report on the extent to which the information on transactions has contributed to market transparency also if so authorized by the panel any individua l member or agent of the cop is authorized to take action on behalf of the panel such individualization of authority is permitted by the fsob 8 see for example crs report rl32592 general management laws and the 911 commissions proposed office of national intelligence director nid and national counterterrorism center nctc by clinton t brass and curtis w copeland that report indicated that more general management laws would appear to cover the nid and nctc if they were independent entities in the executive branch than if they were placed within the executive office of the president if the fsob is considered part of federal department or agency or an independent agency then most of these general management laws would appear to apply fo r more information about these management statutes see crs report rl30795 general management laws compendium

responsibilities from any federal department or agency and the heads of those departments or agencies are required to provide the information requested by the chairperson of the panel as noted previously the cop is also permitted to take testimony and administer oaths and affirmations to witnesses the act provides the fsob similar right to information from federal departments or agencies and there does not appear to be any obligation on the part of those departments or agencies to provide that information to the fsob neither the fsob nor the cop have subpoena authority and neither is authorized to request the attorney general to compel agencies to provide needed information9 g15g142g150g139g142g155g156g145g146g153g561 as noted previously section 104b of the act states that the fsob is comprised of the heads of five executive branch departments or agencies the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the secretary of the treasury the director of the federal housing finance agency the chairman of the securities and exchange commission and the secretary of housing and urban development because the secretary of the treasury is also charged with implementing the tarp his role on the fsob essentially requires him to oversee his own actions provision is made for these agency heads to allow alternates to substitute for them section 125c of the act is less directive regarding the members of the cop merely specifying how members are to be appointed ie one each by the speaker of the house of representatives the minority leader of the house the majority leader of the senate and the minority leader of the senate and one by the speaker and the majority leader of the senate after consultation with the minority leaders in each house the act does not require that members of the cop be from congress or even from the legislative branch but it clearly contemplates members of congress as potential members section 125c3 specifies that members of the cop who are members of congress or fulltime officers or employees of the federal government will receive additional pay allowances or benefits the act does not require that the members of the cop be appointed by certain date although as discussed below the cop is required to submit its first regular report within 30 days after the first exercise of the secretarys authority under section 101a or 102 of the act and is required to submit special report on regulatory reform by january 20 2009 10 on november 14 2008 democratic congressional leaders named the first three members of the panel11

the members of the board but the act excludes the secretary of the treasury from having vote in that election according to the interim assistant secretary for the office of financial stability on october 7 2008 the members of the board selected the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system to be chairman of the fsob 15 in contrast although chairperson of the cop is clearly contemplated by eesa eg section 125c7 of the act authorizes the chairperson to call meetings the legislation does not indicate how that chairperson is to be selected at the panels first meeting on november 26 2008 elizabeth warren was reportedly elected chairperson of the cop 16 g18g138g162g561g143g152g155g561g15g142g150g139g142g155g156g561 the act is silent regarding pay for members of the fsob but presumably they would simply receive their regular salaries as the heads of the five agencies on the other hand section 125c2 of the act states that each member of the cop shall be paid at the daily rate of basic pay for level i of the executive schedule the cabinet secretary level which is 191300 per year in 2008 for each day that the member is performing duties vested in the commission the act does not indicate what commission is referenced here but the context suggest that the word panel should have been used instead of commission as noted previously members of the cop

the cop is not required to meet at any specific time section 125c7 of the act states that its meetings are held at the call of the chairperson or majority of its members however because the cop is required to submit its first regular report within 30 days after the first troubled assets are purchased or insured meetings of the panel are likely before the report is submitted section 125c5 specifies that four members of the cop constitute quorum although the act states that lesser number may hold hearings 13 gregg withdraws from reform panel mcconnell expected to name successor bna

first exercise of purchase authority of the secretary of the treasury and monthly thereafter however the act does not mention what constitutes quorum for fsob action according to the interim assistant secretary for the office of financial stability the fsob met on october 7four days after the legislation was enacted and before the exercise of any purchase authority in addition to selecting the chairman of the federal reserve to be chairman of the fsob the members reportedly adopted the boards bylaws and reviewed the tarps initial work streams 17 the fsob met again on october 13 2008 and on

hire experts or consultants nevertheless the interim assistant secretary for the office of financial stability testified on october 23 2008 that the fsob had appointed staff to the board including an executive director general counsel and secretary 20 in contrast section 125d of the act permits the cop to appoint and fix the pay of any personnel the commission considers appropriate again the context suggests that the word panel should have been used instead of commission the cop is also permitted to procure temporary and intermittent experts and consultants for up to one year and use

other entities but several provisions in the act specify that certain reports are to be sent to the cop for example 1 section 104g of the act requires the fsob to provide to the cop its quarterly reports to congress 2 section 105d states that any report to congress by the secretary that is required by section 105 eg tranche reports for each 50 billion of purchases and regulatory modernization

section 117d requires the cgs report on margin authority to be provided to the cop 5 sec tion 121f3 provides that reports by the special ig for the tarp shall also be submitted to the cop and 6 section 129e states that the report to certain congressional committees on exercise of loan authority shall also be provided to the cop g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561 the act does not indicate whether and if so how the fsob is to be funded in contrast the act specifies in section 125g that the cop is authorized such sums as may be necessary for any fiscal year and specifies that half of the funds are to be derived from the applicable account of the house of representatives and half from the contingent fund of the senate the act goes on to state in section 125h that an amount equal to the expenses of the cop shall be promptly transferred by the secretary from time to time upon the presentment of statement of such expenses by the chairperson of the panel the funds are to be taken from funds provided to the secretary under the act and sent to the applicable fund of the house of representatives and the contingent fund of the senate 23 as noted earlier in this report the department of

responsibilities of the special ig for the tarp and the comptroller general are similar in some respects but differ in other ways also certain elements of the special igs operations appear to be undefined the discussion below and in table 2 at the end of this report compares the roles of the special ig and the cg with regard to several relevant dimensions

that gao is legislative branch agency and can have significant executive branch functions26 however although section 121a of eesa established the office of the special ig for the tarp the act does not indicate where in the government that office is to be housed legislation establishing other special inspectors general while not specifying organizational placement contains other indications of where the entity was housed for example the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction was established by section 3001 of pl 108106 which provided that the ig was appointed by the secretary of defense after consultation with the secretary of state and reported to the head of the coalition provisional authority 27 the act is also unclear where the special igs offices are to be located section 116a2a requires the secretary of the treasury to provide gao with appropriate audit space and facilities in the department of the treasury but the act contains similar requirement for the special ig however section 121d1 of the act says that in carrying out the duties delineated in the act in subsection c the special inspector general shall have the authorities provided in section 6 of the inspector general act of 1978 section 6 of the inspector general act codified at 5 usc appendix states in relevant part that the head of an establishment shall provide the office within such establishment with appropriate and adequate office space at central and field locations of such establishment together with such equipment office supplies and 26 bowsher v synar 478 us 714 at 734 1986

the special ig is determined to be located within the department of the treasury then the secretary may be required to provide the special ig with space and facilities

describes the responsibilities of the special ig the general responsibilities of both the cg and the ig are similar although stated somewhat differently for example once the tarp is established the cg is to commence ongoing oversight of the activities and performance of the tarp including the performance of the tarp in meeting the purposes of this act the special ig is to conduct supervise and coordinate audits and investigations of the purchase management and sale of assets by the secretary of the treasury under any program established under section 101 nd the management of the secretary of any program established under section 102 the two audit organizations specific responsibilities are similar but also differ in some ways for example while both the cg and the special ig are required to identify the troubled assets acquired under the program only the special ig is charged with describing why the secretary deemed it necessary to purchase each asset and to list with detailed biographical information each person or entity hired to manage the troubled assets the cg on the other hand is the only entity specifically required to examine the in ternal controls of the tarp to examine the efficiency of tarp operations and contracting procedures and to review the tarps efforts to minimize conflicts of interest the act gives two responsibilities to the cg that are not given to the special ig section 116b1 of the act requires the cg to audit the tarps financial statements and section 117 requires the cg to determine the extent to which leverage and sudden deleveraging of financial institutions was factor behind the financial crisis including the roles of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the securities and exchange commission the secretary of the treasury and others g25g145g142g151g561g3g158g141g146g157g156g561g4g142g144g146g151g561 section 121b1 requires the president to nominate the special ig as soon as practicable after the establishment of any program under sections 101 and 102 according to an interim final rule issued by the board of governors of the federal reserve system on october 14 2008 the secretary of the treasury announced program with in the tarp to provide capital to eligible financial institutions 28 therefore it appears that program triggering the nomination of the special ig was established at that point however the president did not submit nomination for the position until november 14 2008 and the nominee was not confirmed by the senate until december 8 2008 also section 121e of the act indicates that the office of the special ig is to be provided 50 million from the proceeds of the sale of securities including treasury bills and 28 see us department of the treasury tarp ca pital

somewhat 31 section 116a2b states that consistent with applicable law the cg has access to any information or things belonging to the tarp and to its officers employees or agents section 121e4 requires the heads of other agencies to furnish the special ig with any requested information or assistance th at is practicable and not in contravention to law therefore the cg appears to have specific access rights to information from the tarp whereas the special ig appears to have specific access only to information from other agencies also the act requires that the cg be given full facilities for verifying transactions with the balances or securities held by depositaries fiscal agents and custodians and is permitted to make and retain copies of any records similar rights are specifically afforded the special ig as noted previously however section 121d1 of the act says that in carrying out the duties delineated in the act in subsection c the special inspector general shall have the authorities provided in section 6 of the inspector general act of 1978 section 6 of the inspector general act states in relevant part that each inspector ge neral is authorized to have access to all records reports audits reviews documents papers recommendations or other material available to the applicable establishment which relate to programs and operations with respect to which that

as he or she deems necessary but the selection classification and pay of those employees is governed by the requirements of current civil service law in title 5 united states code that section also permits the special ig to employ experts and consultants at rate not to exceed gs15 of the general schedule the top end of which is currently 149000 per year in washington dc and to enter into contracts for other audits or studies these authorities are similar to those provided to other statutory inspectors general under the inspector general act of 1978 the act contains similar provisions for the cg but gao already has similar abilities under its existing statutory authorities 32 g20g142g153g152g155g157g156g561 both the cg and the special ig are required to submit reports regarding their audit activities to the appropriate committees of congress but some of the specifics are unclear and appear to be different for example section 116a3 requires the cg to submit gaos reports at least every 60 days but does not specifically indicate when the first 60day period begins as discussed in more detail later in this report gao issued its first report regarding the tarp on december 2 2008 33 section 121f1 requires the special igs reports to include detailed statement of all purchases obligations expenditures and revenues associated with any program established by the secretary of the treasury under sections 101 an d 102 in contrast the cg is simply required to submit reports of findings under this section the cg is required to submit gaos reports to the special ig among others the special ig is not required to reciprocate but is required by section 121f3 of the act to submit its reports to the cop notably in contrast to reports from statutory inspectors general the special igs reports are not required to be sent to the secretary of the treasury or any other executive branch official g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561 section 116a2c of the act requires the department of the

funds from the proceeds of the sale of securities under section 118 be prov ided to the special ig to carry out his or her responsibilities section 118 of the act states that the secretary may use the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31 united states code for the authorities granted in the act and the cost of administering those authorities chapter 31 of title 31 public debt includes treasury bills savings bonds and savings certificates and other instruments however the timing and mechanics of the transfer of funds to the special ig are unclear eg whether the special ig gets onetime payment of 50 million at the time the office is established or whether that amount is to be provided over longer period of time as determined by the secretary of the treasury g22g142g155g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g561 section 121h of the act specifies that the office of the special ig terminates on the later of 1 the date the at the last troubled asset acquired under section 101 has been sold or transferred or 2 the date of expiration of the last insurance contract under section 102 35 section 116e says that the cgs oversight audit and reporting requirements under the act also terminate on those dates also section 116a2a states that the secretary of the treasury is to provide the cg with audit space and facilities until the termination date specified in section 120 which is december 31 2009 subject to extension there are requirements in the act that either the cg or the special ig preserve any records or prov ide means by which the

troubled assets was very short and contained oversight provisions instead it stated that decisions by the secretary pursuant to the authority of this act are nonreviewable and committed to agency discretion and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency36 several members of congress and many others including both of the major party presidential candidates called for increased oversight of the program for example senator john mccain said we wont solve problem caused by poor oversight with plan that has oversight37 as enacted on october 3 2008 however eesa cont ained an elaborate oversight system with general oversight responsibilities given to the fsob and the cop and with detailed auditing responsibilities assigned to the comptroller ge neral and new

and responsibilities of both oversight panels and both audit organizations overlap in several key areas for example both the fsob nd the cop are broadly required to review how the secretary of the treasury uses the acts authorities likewise the special ig and the cg have similar general responsibilities eg to oversee the activities and performance of the tarp and to audit the purchase management and sale of assets under any section 101 program as well as similar specific responsibilities 39 even where the entities responsibilities differ it is not clear why certain responsibilities were given to one organization instead of another some of the eesa reporting requirements also appear to overlap even for the same entity for example section 105a of the act requires the secretary of the treasury to report to the appropriate committees within 60 days after the first use of his authority in sections 101 and 102 and every 30 days afterward on all actions taken by the secretary including all agreements transactions and insurance contracts section 105b requires the secretary to report to the same committees on the same transactions within seven days of each 50 billion in commitments to purchase troubled assets section 116 requires the comptroller general to oversee the activities of the tarp and report on his findings at least every 60 days which would presumably include tarprelated agreements transactions and insurance contracts section 121 requires the special inspector general to report every quarter on his audits of among other things all troubled assets purchased or sold under section 101 and the management of any insurance program under section 102 congress may have wanted these overlaps and divisions of responsibility to occur providing it with differing perspectives on the same issues however in practice the areas of overlap may prove to be counterproductive particularly if the bodies are not sharing relevant information and as result are reaching different conclusions based on incomplete or variable data and methods also with duplicative and uncoordinated oversight the secretary of the treasury and other officials responsible for implementing the financial rescue plan may spend the bulk of their time responding to requests for information from multiple entities asking the same questions one author commented that once it was clear that some type of oversight was needed in eesa consensus seemed to have been reached by including everyones favorite idea in the bill with one thinking hard about how all of them fit together and whether more oversight is necessarily better than less 40 38 for complete listing of the reports required by eesa see crs report rl34740 reporting requirements in the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 by curtis w copeland 39 for example the cg is to describe the characteristics and disposition of acquired assets the special ig is to provide description of the categories of troubled assets purchased or procured by the secretary and listing of the troubled assets in each category 40 alan morrison plugging leaks in the bailout legal times november 10 2008 p 46

numerous oversight and audit requirements notwithstanding it is unclear how effective they will be in ensuring that the underlying purpose of the tarp is being met or that the program is transparent to the public none of the 18 types of reports delineated in eesa are specifically required to address one of the central issues that have been raised about the purchases of these troubled assetshow the funds provided by the secretary of the treasury are being used by the recipients of those funds initially the secretary of the treasury indicated that troubled assets would be purchased to increase lending by the banks 41 he later said that he decided to purchase stock in financial institutions instead of bad assets because buying those assets would take too long to recapitalize the banks for lending42 however number of questions have been raised by members of congress and others about whether the banks that received tarp funds were using the money to pay dividends to stockholders to pay bonuses to corporate executives or to finance the purchases of smaller banksnot to increase lending 43 although none of these activities are prohibited uses of the funds it is notable that none of the reports specifically require the disclosure of how the money is being used senator richard shelby was quoted as saying that we dont know whos benefitting from th is or where the moneys going44 the special inspector general for the tarp reportedly said he believes that he has the statutory authority needed to determine how the banks spent the money45 but he is not specifically required to include that information in any of his reports also only one of the 18 types of eesa reports is required to be made to the public46 all of the other reports are required to be submitted to congress the appropriate committees of congress or to one of the oversight or auditing bodies while either the preparers or the recipients of these reports may be able to make them public they are not required to do so47 concerns have been raised about perceived lack of transparency in various aspects of the financial system rescue 41 for example in his statement upon the passage of eesa the secretary of the treasury said that the authority provided in the act gives us the ability to protect and recapitalize our financial system as we work through the stresses in our credit

enactment of eesa49 then the special ig was not confirmed until december 8 2008 largely because of hold that was placed on the nomination by senatormore than two months after eesa was enacted by that time substantial portion of the 700 billion in tarp funds had already been committed to purchase bank stock and other troubled assets the cop was required to submit its first regular report within 30 days of the secretarys first purchase of troubled assets which occurred on october 28 2008 however because of the delay in appointments to the cop the panel di d not issue its first report until december 10 2008more than two weeks after the deadline50 also the cop is required to submit its special report by january 20 2009 analyzing the regulatory system and its effectiveness at overseeing the participants in the financial system and making recommendations for reform eesa requires the first report by the special ig to be submitted within 60 days after confirmation because the special ig was not confirmed until december 8 2008 this report is not required to be submitted until february 6 2009 also the act states that the special ig is to be provided 50 million from the proceeds of the sale of securities to carry out the acts requirements but it is unclear when those payments are to be made and in what amounts at hearing before the senate finance committee on november 17 2008 the special inspector general nominee said he was unsure whether 50 million would be enough to fund the offices operations 51 before the confirmation of the special ig the inspector general for the

the oversight and auditing requirements may need to be reassessed given the changed nature of the tarp when eesa was enacted on october 3 2008 the type of troubled assets that were generally expected to be purchased under the tarp were those fitting the first definition in section 39 of the actie residential or commercial mortgages and any securities obligations or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages54 the composition of some of the oversight bodies and the specific oversight and auditing responsibilities given to those entities appear to have been predicated on this expectation55 however on october 14 2008less than two weeks after eesa was enactedthe secretary of the treasury announced that initial funds authorized by the act would be used to purchase preferred shares of stock in certain banks56 congress had authorized the secretary to take such action when it defined troubled asset in section 39 of eesa as both mortgagebased financial instruments as well as any other financial instrument that the secretary determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote financial stability subsequent developments seemed to confirm this shift in direction on october 25 2008 the washington post reported that the department of the treasury was dramatically expanding the scope of its bailout of the financial system with plan to take ownershi p stakes in the nations insurance companies 57 treasury officials were also reportedly in discussions about using tarp or other funds to address liquidity problems facing state and local governments58 as well as us automakers59 then on november 12 2008 the secretary of the treasury announced that the department longer planned to buy troubled mortgagebased assets from financial firms but would instead provide aid to banks and other firms that issue student auto and credit card loans in part by jump starting the market that provides financing for these companies60 firms that reportedly could be eligible for this new round of capital purchases include insurers and specialty lenders for small 54 for example the legislation was described as having granted authority to purchase up to 700

finance agency and the secretary of housing and urban development section 116a1 of the act states that the cg is to describe the characteristics of transactions and commitments entered into including transaction type frequency size prices paid and all other relevant terms and conditions and the timing duration and terms of any future commitments to purchase assets the cg is also required to

buying mortgagebased assets would take too long to recapitalize the financial institutions and that buying equity in these firms would be more powerful incentive for them to lend61 while the oversight and audit responsibilities of the cop the fsob the cg and the special ig may still generally apply to these new tarprelated programs the makeup and the nature of their specific responsibilities may need to be reconsidered and redefined in light of the type of troubled assets being purchased and the other types of programs being considered for example given the current focus on purchasing bank stock instead of mortgagebased securities members of the fsob could be appointed based on their expertise in the banking industry eg the head of the federal deposit insurance corporation or the comptroller of the currency in addition to or instead of those appointed to the board based on their housingrelated expertise in addition to the extent that the secretary establishes programs based on statutory authorities outside of sections 101 and 102 of eesa the audit responsibilities of both the cg and the special ig may need to be redefined to ensure that they cover all aspects of the program for example section 116a1 defines the cgs scope of oversight as the activities and performance of the tarp and of any agents and representatives of the tarp as related to the agent or representatives activities on behalf of or under the authority of the tarp including vehicles established by the secretary under this ac t section 38 of the act defines the tarp as the troubled asset relief program established under section 101 similarly section 121c of the act defines the duties of the special ig as audits and investigations of the purchase management and sale of assets by the secretary of the treasury under any program established by the secretary under section 101 and the management by the secretary of any program established under section 102 since all of these audit functions are geared to sections 101 and 102 of the act it is unclear whether the cg or the special ig can audit or investigate programs established pursuant to other sections of the act eg the proposed program to guarantee troubled mortgages under section 109 62 however during senate hearings on his nomination to be special ig for the tarp several senators reportedly told neil m barofsky that he should assume that he has authority for all aspects of eesa63 legislation was introduced late in the 110th congress that would give the special ig broad authority regarding actions taken under eesa authority64 61

aspects of these oversight and auditing organizations may need to be clarified for example it is currently unclear where the fsob is located within the federal government or whether it is covered by variety of general management and transparency requirements also unlike the cop the act does not provide the fsob with statutory right to information from federal departments or agencies when the fsob meets it is not clear whether all or majority of members must be present to take action as the act does not specify what constitutes quorum the act does not indicate whether and if so how the fsob is to be funded or staffed or whether it can employ consultants to help it carry out its mission as result it may be difficult for the board to carry out some of the tasks that it has been assigned eg reporting evidence of fraud or malfeasanceparticularly since several members of the fsob are likely to change at the end of this administration although the fsob is required to report quarterly the act does not specify when those quarterly periods begin the fsob also does not appear to receive any of the various reports that are provided to the cop eg reports by the special ig or the cg in addition although the act states that the office of the special ig is established it does not indicate where the office will be housed and in c ontrast to the provisions regarding gao there is specific requirement in the act that the secretary of the treasury or any other department or agency provide the office with space or facilities however if the office of the special ig is considered part of the department of the treasury then the secretary may be required by the inspector general act of 1978 to do so finally the act indicates that both the office of the special ig and gaos audit and reporting responsibilities under the act terminate on the date that the last asset is sold or the last insurance contract expires whichever is later it is therefore unlikely that reports of the special ig will reflect all relevant transactions as some period after those dates will likely be needed to summarize the information and provide complete historical record gaos final report however could address those transactions under the cgs general authority in 31 usc 712 and 717 65

mechanisms will have on the balance of power between congress and the executive branc h eesa gave the secretary of the treasury broad authority to purchase troubled assets and defined that term to include any financial instrument that the secretary deems necessary to promote financial market stability congress gave itself expedited legislative procedures to disapprove actions by the secretary but only after the first 350 billion has been obligated 66 congress can use its regular legislative procedures to 65 as noted earlier in this report 31 usc 7121 requires the cg to investigate all matters related to the receipt disbursement and use of public money and 31 usc 717b states that the cg shall evaluate the results of program or activity the government carries out under existing law 66 as noted earlier in this report section 115a3 of the act states that if the president sends congress written report describing the secretary of the treasurys plan to spend the second 350 billion

purchases but presidential veto of any congressional action whether through regular or expedited procedures would require two thirds vote of both houses of congress to prevent the secretarys actions from taking effect also legislation has been introduced in the 110th congress to reverse the presumption and require congress to approve any expenditure over 350 billion67 but the president could veto this type of initiative as wellagain requiring twothirds majority in both houses of congress for enactment senate confirmation of agency officials is another means by which congress can provide oversight of executive branch actions and that authority will be particularly relevant regarding the nomination of the assistant secretary of the treasury for the office of financial stability however the legislation permits the secretary of the treasury to appoint an interim assistant secretary and places limit on how long that appointee may serve given the scope of the assistant secretarys responsibilities and the need for immediate action nomination for the position is unlikely during the remaining days of the 110 th congress the only other position established by eesa that requires senate confirmation is the special inspector general for the tarp g9g3g17g514g156g561g8g146g155g156g157g561g22g3g20g18g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561 as noted previously in this report on december 2 2008 gao issued its first tarp report68 and the acting comptroller general testified about the report before the house committee on financial services on december 10 200869 gao concluded that the department of the treasury had not addressed number of critical issues including how it would ensure that the tarp capital purchase program cpp was achieving its intended goals and how it would monitor compliance with limits on executive compensation dividend payments and stock repurchases among other things gao recommended that the department 1 establish systematic means of determining and reporting in timely manner whether financial institutions activities are generally consistent with the purposes of the cpp and help ensure an appropriate level of accountability and transparency 2 ensure that institutions participating in cpp comply with key program requirements and 3 develop comprehensive system of internal control over tarp 70 gao went on to say that until these issues are resolved there is heightened risk that the interests of the government and taxpayers may not be adequately protected and that the office of financial stability may not achieve its mission in an effective and efficient manner71 commenting on gaos report the department of the treasury agreed that it should develop means to determine whether financial institutions are complying with statutory and other program requirements but expressed concern about whether the actions of individual institutions use of the funds needed to be monitored however in the wake of concerns expressed by several
