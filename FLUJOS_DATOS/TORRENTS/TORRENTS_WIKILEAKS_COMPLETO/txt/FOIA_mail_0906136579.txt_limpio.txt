from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to jenkins geoff gsjenkinsmetogovuk subject re palaeo data date fri sep 18 123619 1998 dear geoff it good to hear from you by now you may know that we had small working meeting to consider the current draft of the thematic bid yesterday in london simon tett nick shackleton paul valdes and i really did get to grips with lot of the important details concerning the way in which such project might actually run we are going for joint earth scienceatmospheric science board application for 8 million to run over 5 years simon told us about your offer of some support perhaps as money perhaps as some equivelent and the spirit of the offer is much appreciated frankly the fact that you consider this worthy and valid scientific exercise is what really gives cheer we have long way to go to really sort out many of the problems with the palaeo data and with the methodology of using them in validation andor detection context but i genuinely believe this approach will yield rewards somewhere down the line i think our support from the earth science side is very probable the politics of the atmospheric board and the potential clash with other initiatives coming from reading mean that their support in any meaningful sense cant be thought of as more than possible i suppose we may have something like near 50 chance of eventually getting some money but 50 is pretty good i will now ammend the document to show an explicit requirement for formal supervisory input on the programme from the hadley centre and i acknowledge that there will be blanket release of data whatever happens i will forward the application to you soon if we get through the outline agreement stage with nerc we will surely revisit these practical details along with others for now i simply say thanks to you and john for your support and thanks for the input of simon and peter cox i will stay in touch as and when things develop even if we fail here the science imperative will mean that we find other means of working with you most likely through an ec grant on these issues thanks again and i hope you are bearing up under the strain of recent troubles keith at 1153 am 91498 0100 you wrote keith im afraid i dont have your original email abou you proposal for oa thematic programme on palaeo data we just got converted to windows nt and i have wiped my old emails by mistake we would be very supportive of programme which delivered better estimates of natural variability of climate over the past 1000 yrs globally and regionally which as i recall is the main aim what do you want us to do ie letter to someone in nerc or you from dave carson paul mason saying ho w important the topic is and that we would be immediate users of deliverables etc let know and i will draft something can you reemail what you set please sorry cheers geoff
