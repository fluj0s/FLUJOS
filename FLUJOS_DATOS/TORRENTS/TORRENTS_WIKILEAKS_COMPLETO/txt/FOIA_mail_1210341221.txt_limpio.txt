from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to michael mann mannmeteopsuedu raymond s bradley rbradleygeoumassedu subject couple of things date fri may 9 095341 2008 cc caspar ammann ammannucaredu mike ray caspar couple of things dont pass on either 1 have seen youre rc bet not entirely sure this is the right way to go but it will drum up some discussion anyway mike and caspar have seen present possible problems with the sst data in the 1940s50s and since about 2000 the first of these will appear in nature on may 29 there should be news and views item with this article by dick reynolds the paper concludes by pointing out that ssts now or since about 2000 when the effect gets larger are likely too low this likely wont get corrected quickly as it really needs more overlap to increase confidence bottom line for is that it appears ssts now are about 01 deg c too cool globally issue is that the preponderance of drifters now which measure sst better but between 01 and 02 lower than ships mean anomalies are low relative to the shipbased 196190 base this also means that the sst base the german modellers used in their runs was likely too warm by similar amount this applies to all modellers reanalyses etc there will be lot of discussion of the global t series with people saying we cant even measure it properly now the 1940s50s problem with ssts the may 29 paper also means there will be warmer ssts for about 10 years this will move the post40s cooling to little later more in line with higher sulphate aerosol loading in the late 50s and 1960s70s the paper doesnt provide correction this will come but will include the addition of loads more british ssts for ww2 which may very slightly cool the ww2 years more british sst data have also been digitized for the late 1940s budget constraints mean that only about half the rn log books have been digitized emphasis has been given to the south atlantic and indian ocean log books as an aside it is unfortunate that there are few in the pacific they have digitized all the logbooks of the ships journeys from the indian ocean south of australia and nz to seattle for refits nice bit of history here it turns out that most of the ships are us ones the uk got under the churchillroosevelt deal in early 1940 all the rn bases in south africa india and australia didnt have parts for these ships for few years so the german group would be stupid to take your bet there is likely ongoing negative volcanic event in the offing 2 you can delete this attachment if you want keep this quiet also but this is the person who is putting in foi requests for all emails keith and tim have written and received re ch 6 of ar4 we think weve found way around this i cant wait for the wengen review to come out with the appendix showing what that 1990 ipcc figure was really based on the garnaut review appears to be an australian version of the stern report this message will self destruct in 10 seconds cheers phil prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk
