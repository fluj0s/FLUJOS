divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32887strategic mobility innovation options and oversight issues summary since the george w bush administra tion announced its proposal to reduce the us military overseas basing posture strategic mobility has been the topic of many policy discussions the administrations id entification of transformation as major goal for the department of defense dod technological adva nces the quadrennial defense review qdr deployment goals and antiaccess issues also have relevance with regard to the topic of strategic mobility the issue for the 109th congress is to determine which investments should be pursued today to develop strategic mobility platforms to meet tomorrows national security strategy requirements several studies pertain to strategic mobility innovation these studies include the dods mobility requirements study for 2005 the department of armys advanced mobility concepts study amcs the institute of defense analyses assessment of the amcs defense science board dsb mobility study and the dods transformation planning guidance these studies along with current us strategic mobility inventories and strategic mobility funding trends all pertain to the discussion they examine issues such as dods milliontonmile per day requirement future mobility concepts and feasibilities the importance of decreasing the services deployment footprint transformation roadmaps the dods current strategic mobility inventories and ai rliftsealift future funding trends research identifies at least 11 potential strategic mobility platforms which include four sealift vehicles and seven airlift vehicles the four sealift vehicles assessed in this report are the shallowdraf t high speed sealift the fast sealift monohull the navy vision trimaran high speed sealift and the navy vision surface effect ship high speed sealift the seven airlift vehicles assessed are the global range transport the supershort takeoff and landing aircraft spiral development of the c17 payloadrang expansion program the ultralarge airlifter unmanned aerial vehicles th winginground effect aircraft and seaplanes strategic mobility innovation raises poten tial oversight questions for congress in the following areas 1 does congre ss have sufficient information about the dods plans for lift and potential lift platfo rms to adequately assess investment options 2 to what degree if any shoul d government funding be used to develop new lift platforms 3 what mix of lift platforms might be appropriate to both meet future us commercial lift needs and potentially assist in meeting future military strategic lift requirements 4 should any of these lift platforms be developed and procured in part to support the defense industrial base 5 should procurement of airliftsealift be ex panded beyond current dod plans and if so by how much and with what platformshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32887contents introduction 1 i s s u f r c n g r s s 1 factors affecting stra

identifying transformation as major goal for the department of defense dod th need to rapidly transport us military forces from one location to another has appeared to increase in importance consequently congress may opt to consider what the future holds in the area of strategic mobility innovation central issue for the 109th congress is the determina tion of which investments should be pursued today to develop strategic mobility pl atforms to meet tomorrows national security strategy requirements congressional decisions concerning this issue could have significant implications for future us military capabilities dod funding requirements the fense industrial base and fu ture congressional oversight of dod activities this report will examine strategic m obility innovation in ai rlift and sealift used to transport cargo nd personnel between theaters of operation intertheater factors affecting strategic mobility innovation one factor affecting strategic m obility innovation is the august 16 2004 proposal by the bush administration to si gnificantly alter the us military overseas basing posture the proposal if imp lemented would tablish new overseas operating sites and tran sfer up to 70000 us troops plus 100000 family members and civilians from europe and asia back to the united states the administration believes that the current basing arrangemen ts are not optimal for responding to future military challenges1 many analysts believe that this change in global posture may increase the need for additional strategic air lift and highspeed sealift on september 23 2004 the us european command chief marine corps ge neral james jones testified to congress that building larger array of airlift and sealift platforms is an essential component of the sweeping overhaul that would if approved httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32887crs2 2 john t bennett increased lift assets seen as key to eucom transformation plans inside the pentagon sept 30 2004 general jones gave this

force transformationposition us forces at number of sma ll dispersed bases across the european region2 second factor affecting strate gic mobility innovation is defense transformation soon after taking office the george w bush administration identified transformation as major goal for the department of defense dod since then the dod the office of force transformation oft and the services have addressed the transfor mation process some obser vers have emphasized that improving the strategic trans portation of us troops and car go is an integral part of this transformation process part of th navy and marines transformation plans include new shipdeployment approaches called sea swap and sea basing these concepts call for longduration forwar d deployments with crew rotations3 some analysts have noted that these crew rotations will rely on strategic mobility for their success part of the armys transfor mation revolves around lighter and leaner force4 it would appear that an integral pa rt of this transformation will be the ability to rapidly transport their new combat vehicles such as the stryker and the future combat system fcs the stryker and the fcs combat vehicles were originally designed so that they could be transpor ted on the air forces c130 the fcs for example is being designed with 195 ton limit which is the maximum weight limit for transportation on the c130 some critics of this idea say that past procurement practices have shown that typical wea pon system will increase in weight by 20 during development making transporta tion on the c130 impossible to date current designs have the vehicle fully combat capable at delivery weighing between 22 and 24 tons5 even if it can be transported on c130 some analysts predict that it will need an additional two c130s to transport the equipment and personnel to support its operation as the air force transf orms it will need to determine the right mix of strategic assets to support both its own operations and those of the other services to achieve this the air force is exploiting new technologies and operational concepts to improve its ability to rapidly deploy and sustain forces6 third factor is technological advan ces the main idea behind innovation is to exploit advances in technology to cr eate new platform signs new lighter weight stronger composite materials ne w advanced engines or propulsion systems new aerodynamic designs nd new advances in computer technology may allow innovative designs in stra tegic mobility assetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32887crs3 7 crs analyst says qdr should include plan for size structure of navy inside the pentagon dec 9 2004 p 13a fourth factor affecting strategi c mobility innovation is the 2001 quadrennial defense reviews qdr depl oyment goals the current qdr calls for deployment goals of the socalled 1421 and 103030 strategies the 1421 strategy is structured to simultaneously defend the single homeland conduct deterrence in four regions of the globe execute two ma jor campaigns in swift fashion winning one of them by taking over the enemys capital the other strategy calls for delivering needed forces to theater with in 10 days of depl oyment order swiftly defeating an enemy there within 30 days and resetting the force 30 days after that victory7 the next qdr is due out this fa ll 2005 its conclu sions may have significant impact on projected strategic lift requirements fifth factor is the issue of antiaccess or area denial analysts have argued that other countries could become increasingly unwilling to permit us forces to operate out of their country to carry out combined operations additionally some analysts have suggested that future adve rsaries may not freely allow us forces to buildup their forces at nearby air and sea ports as in recent wars eg desert storm and operation iraqi freedom these access issues could affect our strategic mobility and require the united states to start thinking about not having access to convenient ports and airports this concer n could drive the design of highspeed shallow draft ships aircraft that can go from forttofight globalrange transports supershort takeoff and landing aircraft in addition to planning for decreased local infrastructure organization of the report this report first examines few m obility studies conducted by the dod and some relevant back ground literature secondly th report examines innovative designs and platforms that may meet the requirement for nextgeneration strategic airlift or sealift finally this report examines the potential congressional oversight issues which could affect future us military capabilities dod funding requirements and the us defense industrial base studies and background literature mobility requirements study for 2005 in 1998 the deputy secretary of defens chartered the mobility requirements study for 2005 mrs05 mrs05 examined the number and mix of mobility systems needed to support two nearly s imultaneous major theater wars mtws in the year 2005 mrs05 investigated mobility requirements in th continental united states as well as between theaters strategic or intertheater mobility and within individual theaters t actical or intrath eater mobility it was conducted over two years and was then dods most compre hensive mobility study mrs05 washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32887crs4 8 million tonmiles per day mtmd is commonly accepted measure of performance across the transportation industry it reflects how much cargo can be delivered over given distance in given period of time 9 us department of defense mobility requirements study for 2005 jan 2001 pp 45completed in 2000 at that time of the st udys release the dods airlift capability was estimated to be approximately 44 milliontonmiles per day8 the mrs05 study gave the following overall assessment9 an airlift fleet of 497 milliont onmiles per day mtmd the level established after the 1995 mobility requirements study bottomup review update mrsburu is not adequate to meet the full range of requirements to support the warfighting dema nds of two nearly simultaneous mtws the study identified need for minimum of 511 mtmd of airlift capability this number included the airlift demands associated with deployments to the two theaters as well as support for highpriority movements within those theaters the study observed that there are likely to be other demands on the airlift system during the peak peri ods of operations early in major theater campaigns three of th additional demands or missions were judged to be highpriority missions in excess of the 511 mtmd capability needed for fighting two mtws the three missions conducting special operations deploying missile defense systems to friendly na tions and supporting other theater commanders not directly engaged in the theater campaigns would yield total airlift requirement of 545 mtmd upon examining all the possible missions and variations in assumptions the study generated range of demands up to 67 mtmd the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the service chiefs and the cincs reviewed the study and supporte d the requirement of 545 mtmd of airlift capability as the minimum moderaterisk capability to support the national military strategy the sealift investments made in response to dods 1995 mrs buru were reported to be suffi cient mrs05 found that the dods overall mob ility capab ility could be further augmented through aggressive use of commercial sealift enabled by selective containerization of unit equipment however the study noted that the cargo delivery requirements for two mtws increased by one million tons relative to the 1995 mrsburu projected amounts the study also made intertheater airlift and sealift recommendations for airlift it was recommended that the dod should develop program to pr ovide between 511 mtmd and 545httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32887crs5 10 john tirpak the airlift gap air force

it said that the programmed organic dry cargo fleet was adequate to meet projected requirements since the september 11 2001 attacks nd the administrations global war on terrorism the dod mobility requirements ar being constantly reviewed some analysts have estimated that during military operations in iraq the airlift gap between actual and required capability was at least 10 mtmd today air mobility command amc leaders say this gap is wider at least 15 mtmd perhaps 22 mtmd10 in 2004 congress asked amc to take quick look comparison of the mrs05 projection with the actual experi ence in afghanistan and iraq david merrell chief of amcs studies and anal ysis division estimated that the current requirement is fast approaching 60 mtmd11 if the new mobility capability st udy mcs due out in april 2005 corroborates the 60 mtmd figure then th ere would appear to be an additional projected gap of at least 55 mtmd bove the 545 mtmd figure estimates as of march 7 2005 have dods actual mtmd capability at approximately 45 resulting in projected airlift capability gap of between 95 mtmd and 15 mtmd according to the mrs05 amc should be able to reach 545 mtmd with 176 c17s c5 mission capable mc rate of 65 and civil reserve air fleet craf contribution of 205 mtmd currently amc has 119 c17s not including the 11 c17s in air education and training command and the c5 has mc rate of pproximately 68 according to the air force mtmday figure was not an original goal of the new mcs study but it appears that this i ssue is now being readdressed within the dod the methodology used for the new st udy is called deterministic modeling the study examines several different scenarios which all have baseline requirement and then models the options by adding additional airlift and sealift capabilities thus far preliminary data would appear to show that additional airlift capacity in the early stages of conflict will allow the us earlier delivery of cargopersonnel also it would appear th at additional sealift capacity later in conflict eg sustainment phase will help to avoid possible delivery shortfalls12 advanced mobility concepts study amcs the defense planning guidance dpg 200409 called for the advanced mobility concepts study amcs to ensu re that dods transformed forces would continue to enjoy strategic and operational mobility advantage over future adversaries by

mobility including range of scenarios they considered major regional contingencies lesser regional contingenc ies and operations other than war though the final report was completed almo st nine years ago there are several findings that some observers have noted may still be pertinent today19 the task force concluded that mobility efforts should be focused on five major areas20 shaping the force for rapid response minimize the deployed footprint ashore improving the deployment architect ure planning infrastructure and flow improving the information system support for deployment planning and execution improving the protection of th forces entering the theater improving lift and prepositioning capabilities for improving lift and prepositioning capabilities the dsb mentioned the importance of the strategic mobility lift triad which consists of airlift sealift and prepositioned forces it stressed that th needed lift and prepositioning programs will face multiple budget exercises congre sses and administrations and will needhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32887crs8 21 defense science board op cit p 82 22 ibid p 21 23 ibid p 36robust continuing support the report also mentions 1 the need to replace the fast sealift ships fss starting around 2010 2 th at worthy goal would be to replace these fss with capability to deliver forces in one half the currently planned time eg commercial initiatives for ships with 50 knot performance and 3 the need to track commercial development of very large lighterthanair craft eg 500 ton capability21 the dsb report maintains one central theme throughout the importance of minimizing the us footprint at the air and seaports of debarka tion this idea really serves two purposes 1 avoidance of back logs at the ports of debarkation pods and 2 security of us forces and materi first the report mentions that more emphasis needs to be put on minimizing the pileup of forces and material at vulnerable nodes those nodes are repres ented by the pods from strategic mobility viewpoint the most critical need is to reduce the day to day footprint at the pods22 second the report states that sea nd air pods are attractive targets since there are likely to be bottlenecks where peopl and material pileup in the gulf war 96 of all sealift cargo went through two sea ports for air cargo 78 went through five airfields many of these pods will be within range of enemy weapon systems which can disrupt operations in operati on desert shieldstorm there was attack on the us forces during the insertion and buildup of forces in theater future adversaries may not be as accommodating specifically the handoff of personnel equipment and material from ustranscom united states transportation command to the cinc commanderinchief at the ports of debarkation appears to be the critical seam where disruption of the deployment flow is most likely to occur23 the task force emphasized the need to minimize the bottleneck of exposed forces and materi at vulnerable ports when looking at typical ground force deployment it is broken up into three phases forttoport portto port and porttofoxhole the problems mentioned above are occurring in the porttofoxhole phase many analysts believe that is where our future strategic mobility platforms need to concentrate the future of strategic mobility could be to transport directly from forttofoxhole or to at least plan for port denial and to develop platforms that do not need to operate in these environments another dsb mobility study is curren tly being conducted and is due to be released in

intratheater designs with potential strategic applications there are two additional ship designs that could possibly be used for strategic lift they are the high speed catamaran and hybrid lifting

ship with midhull foil and an aft foil with twin propellers as the ship picks up speed the hull comes completely out of the water carried by the winglike foils this reduces drag and wave action thus giving it smoother ride at faster speeds in rougher seas currently navatek ships hawaiibase d firm is testing this technology on the sea flyer sea flyer is 160foot 340ton craft designed in the 1980s

speed for the same power the hybrid airship may require takeoff run that will exceed 10000 feet in some cases an unimproved field or water may be used for the takeoff run but it must be relatively

are used ula arrivals and departures could limit or shutdown aircraft operations effect airflow and decrease throughput amcs analysts have stated the following as issues for the ula92 ballast both variants of the airships need ballast to keep themselves within weight limits as cargo is offloaded either ballast must be added or helium must be vented into the air the most common type of ballast is water in an austere environment it may be difficult to find water or other material th at can be used as ballast offload for the prototype variant of the ula the offload and expedited offload times of 6 nd 5 hours respectively may be somewhat optimistic landing zones the ctol variant of the ula requires large landing zone due to this fact the number of ulas in one area may be limited it is estimated that the largest potential landing zone would be the equivalent of 109 f ootball fields the vtol variant would require significantly less space approximately three football fields one of the strengths of the ula is its advertised capability to operate from unimproved landing sites critics of the ulas ctol variant often mention the landing zone or footprint requirement needed for it to operate as minimum it would appear that at least 3500 feet would be required for the ctol variant to land in an 80000 square mile survey across the planet boeing analysis found that on average only 1 of this area allowed f easible landing zone of approximately 3500 feet or longer on the other hand it was found that almost 50 of this area allowed feasible landing zone of 1000 feet this data would

development spans for current weapon syst ems are any indicator eg the fa22 started development in 1986 then some observers have noted that now may be the time to examine the uav cargo transport the first hurdle commonly mentioned is access to the national airspace system nas in particular if uav cargo transport is to fly it would most likely need access to the 18000 feet to 40000 feet flight levels to operate freely in the nas uavs are going to be expected to operate identically to manned aircraft an air tra ffic controller should not even know whether or not an aircraft is manned thorough uav assessment was undertaken by combined joint aviation authorityeurocontrol uav task force over 18month period during 2003 2004 the critical yardstick that the task fo rce used in assessing uav operations was whether they met an equiva lent level of safety co mpared with conventionally manned aircraft in discu ssing airworthiness therefore the report stated that civil certificate of airworthiness or its military equivalent would be mandatory to enter civil controlled airspace100 this would mean that uav cargo transpor ts intended to be operated in the nas would have to be built in certified aircraft manufacturing plants that they would have to use approved aeronautical standards and materials be subject to all aviationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32887crs29 101 john s walker

unmanned aerial vehicles background and issues for congress by christopher bolkcom for more information on uavsinspection processes and proce dures and pass rigorous flig ht test certification the uavs would be also subject to an approve d maintenance progra m which would have to be performed by licensed personnel in airframe engines electronics etc for transport uav to fly in the nas it would be expected to file and fly instrument flight rule ifr flight plans just like manned flights the airlift uav will most likely need to rely on variety of communication navigation and surveillance cns technologies to safely and efficiently operate in civil airspace some analysts have noted that current manned cargo transports already rely heavily on automation in all areas of flight to incl ude takeoff cruise and landing as long as the uav cargo transport is equipped w ith the normal avionics associated with manned flight then the navigation and surv eillance technologies would not appear to present any significant challenges equi pment such as an onboard traffic alert collision avoidance system tcas inertial navigation and global positioning systems ins and gps realtime weather avoidance radars automated dependent surveillance broadcast adsb traffic information service tis flight control guidance system an enhanced ground proximity warning system egpws and noncooperative sensors are some of the systems that may be required these are essential for the safe secu re and reliable integration of the uav into the nas uav cns issues were recently examined at the 2004 nasa integrated cns conference and workshop held from april 26 30 2004101 the one area this conference highlighted throughout was th area of communication there are two communication links required for remotely piloted uav operations 1 the interface between the uav pilot and air traffic c ontrol 2 the interface between the uav pilot and the aerial vehicle both of thes have need for line of sight and beyond capability the specific challeng for this type of communication are latency how much of delay is acceptable security prevention of unauthoriz ed seizure of uav and to ensure protection from jammingspoofingsabotage availabilityreliability lost link problem link quality the need to provide sufficient voice quality and limited data degradation sufficient bandwidth potential for saturation of av ailable bandwidth in given geographical area these issues will need to be addresse d if the future uav cargo transport is remotely piloted but what if the uav is not remotely piloted the other alternative may be totally computercontrolled automatic flight such as the global hawk102 to develop this type of uav observers commonly mention couple of options one the dod could develop brand new uav cargo transport at minimum thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32887crs30 103 david jensen steering clear of perfect storm aviation today feb 10 2005 104 bill sweetman monster at 20 ft popular science httpwwwpopscicompopsci aviationartic le01254341026600html figure 10 wig aircrafttypical development span is about 12 years another idea that some analysts have mentioned is to modify existing aircraft though uav cargo transports are currently being developed by the dod there does appear to be commercial interest in the idea don barber senior vice president at fedex told atca air tra ffic controllers association attendees he believes that though unmanne d air freighters may not be ubiquitous soon uav cargo transport will be demonstrated reality in the near future103 for the air freight industry two of the biggest expenses are fuel and pilot salaries if the pilot could be removed signifi cant savings may be achieved though this type of technology could possibly be utilized in the ai rline industry many analysts have stated that it will be some time before passengers will permit the removal of the pilot from the cockpit winginground effect aircraft the wingin ground effect wig aircraft is designed as longrange transoceanic transport it is intended to fly as low as 20 feet above the sea and take advantage of an aerodynamic phenom enon called ground effect that reduces drag and fuel burn the aircrafts size and efficiency could allow it to carry the equivalent of current day cargo container ships but at ten times the speed it is intended to be capable of flying at the same speed and altitude as most turboprop aircraft 300 mph nd up to 20 000 feet but most of its flight pattern it will be hugging the waters surface and taking advantage of the ground effect the wig would be designed for range of 10000 nautical miles over the water source boeing phantom works the wig aircraft would be 400 feet long have wing span of 500 feet and be powered by four pairs of 80000hp turbine engi nes if built it would be the largest aircraft ever flown signs indicate it would weigh 32 million pounds with potential to carry 28 million pounds of cargo it would carry the same amount of cargo as large medium speed rollonrolloff ship at ten times the speed104 potential issues with the wig aircraft are as follows extensive weather flight planning could be required to exploit tailwinds and avoid storms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32887crs31 105 committee on aeronautics research and technology for vision 2050 securing the future of us air transportation system in peril national academies press washington 2003 p 33 106 ibidflight characteristics at low altitude may make it hard to control one of the wig designers states the controls will need to be highly automated the size of the aircraft may make maneuvering it on the ground difficult the weight of the wig may exceed the weight limits of most runways and taxiways around the world some critics of the wig have said that cruising altitude would be solow that the aircraft would be at risk from rogue waves 105 the vast size of the aircraft w ould mean tremendous investment to develop an operational pr oduct since it is very large the wig would require more power for takeoff than for cruise this would increase the mass of the engines thus reducing payload and aircraft efficiency106 seaplanes the office of naval research tasked the center for innovation in ship design cisd to conduct study on the utility of seaplanes in supporting the navys offshore sea base concept it is thought that seaplanes with heavy lift capability may be simpler to integrate with the sea base concept than conventional aircraft one of the potential missions woul d be bringing troops intertheater to meet up with their predeployed equipment production of seaplanes has been very limited since the 1960s examples of some modern era seaplanes are the canada ir cl214 waterbomber the japanese shin meiwa us1a search and rescue aircraft and the russian large multipurpose seaplanes the be200 and a40 some of the issues addressed in the ci sd final report titled use of seaplanes integration within sea base are rough water operations it is pointed out that rough water operations are crucial dur ing takeoff landing taxiing cargo transfer and aircraft survival based on open ocean wave data the report states that desirable goal for sea based seaplane will be to have full operational capability in sea state 4 below 8 feet in significant wave height with limited operation in sea state 5 below 13 feet in significant wave height rapid takeoff and landing the report suggests that rapid takeoff and landing are important for high sea state performance to allow seaplane to rapidly leave or ente r the water while avoiding adverse motions and high fuselage loadshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32887crs32 107 omar bashir jeanmarc freuler david smith matt theis josh walton brady young heavylift amphibious seaplane for enhancement of seabasing massachusetts institute of technology dec 14 2004 figure 11 seamooring and docking ideally most seaplanes are designed to be physically lifted from the water when not in use this is done to protect the aircraft and reduce maintenance as aircraft size increases this becomes progressively more difficult the alternative is to have the seaplane live in the water even then mooring and docking capabilities will be needed ability to transfer seaplanes p ayload to ship in various sea states cisd innovation cell recommended new method of transferring payload using the intermediate transfer station its concept this concept utilizes large platform deck area for cargo transfer there is high side and low side to this deck the deck would become floating seapla ne ramp which would allow seaplanes to come onboard from the low side in recent massachusetts institute of technology project team designed heavy lift amphibious seaplane that was specifically designed to meet the requirements for the sea basing concept107 their final design allowed payload of 40000 pounds and cruise range of 3000 nauti cal miles the seaplane is amphibious so it could transport cargo from remote land bases and land in the water to deliver its payload one of the unique design features of this seaplane was the way it would deliver its payload the seapla ne was designed to deliver its payload through well deck on existing amphibious warfare ships the seaplane would land taxi to the ship insert its nose into cushioned opening called the auxiliary delivery system on the well deck the cargo would then be ex tracted through its clam shell doors in the nose of the seaplane the report states that there are currently 54 naval vessels over 7 ship classes that use well decks th seaplane could also dock with floating platform and deliver cargo on beaches that are suitable for seaplane delivery it had one other unique feature the ability to deploy its landing gear in water this feature could possibly allow the seaplane to do coastal delivery by driving up water ramp another design that some analysts feel may have merit is lockheed martins surface effect aircraft sea it is primarily seaplane but uses two technologies to enhance its capabilities the concept uses winginground effect technology as well as surface effect ship principles the wig technology would assist in increasing its range capability by approximately 25 if utilized the surface effect ship technology would assist in getting the vehicle out of the water faster thus s hortening the takeoff distance and lessening propulsion requirements source lockheed martinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32887crs33 108 committee on aeronautics research and technology for vision 2050 securing the future of us air transporta tion system in peril national academies press washington 2003 p 33another innovation for the sea is modular concept the designers believe that different modules could be used depending on the type of mission the two different examples used were c onventional airlaunched crui missileunmanned aerial vehicle launcher module and cargo module the sea is designed to carry the same payload as c5 about 270000 pounds with range of 7500 to 10000 nautical miles depending on whet her it is operating in or out of surface effect it has an operational goal of 300 400 knots at less than 200 feet but can also fly at normal deploy ment altitudes ckheed martin also believes that the design ma have potential for signat ure reduction or stealth critics of the seaplane have said that they require more propulsion than similarly sized conventional aircraft to takeoff there was also concern in the takeoff and landing phase due to floating debris108 summary of potential strategic mobility

yards will have to compete for the remaining 28 ships over those six years which accounts for an average procur ement rate of 47 ships per year for these six ship yards this average procurement rate could result in relatively low work loads reve nues and employment levels119 the high speed ships examined in this report if procured may be helpful in maintaining the us industrial capabilities
