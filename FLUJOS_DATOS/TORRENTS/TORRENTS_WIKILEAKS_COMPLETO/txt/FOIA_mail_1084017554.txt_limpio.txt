from f037 mhulmeueaacuk to aiguo dai adaicgducaredu subject denial or delusion aiguos response date sat 8 may 2004 075914 0100 cc jprosperorsmasmiamiedu mhulmeueaacuk pjonesueaacuk plambouedu trenbertcgducaredu dear aiguo youve done great job in putting this together so quickly and clearly i have couple of additional comments to make on it but cant do so until tuesday you we might also like to think of the reply being multiauthored including phil pete kevin joe and myself i must say that when i first read this paper couple of weeks ago i wrote it off as so bad so so bad that it didnt even deserve response to pretend that the sahel drought didnt happen ie pure artifact of wrongful use of rainfall data is the most astounding assertion almost on par with holocaust denial try putting that proposition to the millions of inhabitants of the sahel in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s many of whom died as direct consequence and whose livelihoods were devastated adrian chappell may never have visited the region but i know clive agnew has many times and he should know better i did my phd research in the region in the early 1980s and i know exactly what the rainfall conditions were like and how much oridinary people suffered as consequence my phd was on rainfall variability and local water supplies in sudan and i visited and talked to many villagers in the region anyway phil first suggested that corrective reply was needed and i can see the value of doing so especially with ipcc ar4 approaching it just seems to such shame that such poor science is being done by some people in this case i dont think there is deeper motive on the part of chappell and agnew than pure delusion and incompetence and worse that journal like ijc will publish it thanks again for your efforts mike original message from aiguo dai adaicgducaredu dear all soon after i sent out my last email i quickly realized that there is another fundamental error in their rainfall model eq1 the regional station numbers na and nb should be replaced with regional areas this can be seen clearly in the following example suppose region has only one station whose longterm mean rainfall happens to be the same as region as mean and region b has 100 stations then their model would give the completely wrong estimate of rainfall for region ab while the areaweighted version would still work this is an obvious error but it apparently could be easily overlooked their model seems to be originated from their incorrect perception that regional rainfall has been traditionally derived using the simple arithmetic mean of all station data after reading the leader authors response to joes comments i could not believe that they still think previous analyses are simpler than theirs i also forgot to point out in my earlier draft the fact that even if their modelled time series were reasonable proxy of sahel rainfall their results would still have had little implications to previous analyses of sahel rainfall this is because their analysis maximized the effects of changing station networks by the design of their model and by choosing the boundary of the two subsahel region at 6degw whereas in most previous analyses these effects were minimized by areaweighted averaging jones and hulme 1996 sorry for the overlook of these issues in my earlier email regards aiguo dai dear all i was asked by kevin to work out rebuttal to chappell and agnew 2004 after reading it couple of times i found the main reason why they came to their results they devised sahel rainfall model eq 1 with necessary condition that the constants and b represent the mean rainfall for the west and east part of the sahel however later in their paper they estimated and b by nonlinear leastsquares fitting to observed rainfall data and their 973mm and b 142mm are nowhere near the actural mean rainfall for these subsahel regions 6455 mm and 4712mm in essense their rainfall model and thus their modelled rainfall time series are longer relevant to sahel rainfall i have seen many bad papers but this one is the worst of all not only because they misled the reader with their model intentionally or unintentionally but also because they made all kinds of unfounded pure speculations about the implications of their results i did some quick analyses using data extracted from the update ghvn2 and wrote comment paper which is attached as word file any comments will be appreciated regards aiguo phil jones wrote dear all several emails today kevins encouraging aiguo dai to write response as well so it might be worth some coordination 2 responses might be better than one though so ill leave it up to you they have dug themselves into bigger hole in their response to joe joes assessment of their reasoning is exactly right also you cant write paper saying an analysis is flawed and then say we dont dispute the local evidence for drought this is naive in the extreme and dumb ive heard this excuse several times in the past with other contentious papers the one problem there might be in response is getting quick turnaround with ijc with the response strongly worded letter should go to the editor glenn mcgregor requesting fasttrack review the journal does this as kevin says any response short be short and to the point cheers phil at 1817 06052004 0400 joseph m prospero wrote from achappell

for your email i read your paper with interest it does indeed show strong correlation with conventional estimates of mean annual rainfall however the paper implicitly assumes that the mean annual rainfall represents the variation in rainfall for the entire region our paper shows that those statistics are flawed because of the changing station networks and that those regional statistics do not show drought in the sahel our paper does not dispute the local scale evidence for drought it is too simplistic to average mean monthly rainfall for such large heterogenous region and believe that the rainfall trend is precise what might be interesting is to correlate your results against the mean annual rainfall corrected for the changing station networks regards adrian original message from
