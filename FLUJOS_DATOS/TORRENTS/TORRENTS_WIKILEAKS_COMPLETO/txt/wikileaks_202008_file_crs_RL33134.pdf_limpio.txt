louisiana mississippi and alabama in 2005 caused widespread flooding significant property damage and lost lives within two weeks congress passed two supplemental appropriations measures providing combined 623 billion for relief and recovery needs including the supplementals for the war on terror and military operations in iraq and afghanistan total supplemental appropriati ons for fy2005 to fy2008 were 5127 billion in response there is growing sentiment in congress that military operations be funded through the regular appropriations process rather than through supplemental appropriations supplemental appropriations provide additional funding to an agency during the course of fiscal year for programs and activities that are considered too urgent to wait until next years budget the major purposes of supplemental appropriations have changed over the past 28 years in the 1980s almost half of supplemental appropriations were for mandatory programs such as unemployment compensation and the rest were for discretionary spending after 1990 over 90 of supplemental appropriations have been for discretionary spending as the major purpose has shifted toward funding natural disaster relief and more recently military operations the amount of new budget authority contained in supplemental appropriations bills fell after 1981 from over 3 of total budget authority to only about 01 by 1988 except for sharp spike in 1991 to fund the first gulf war supplemental appropriations remained at less than 1 of total budget authority throughout most of the 1990s supplemental appropriations began to rise after 1998 and by 2005 reached about 6 of budget authority since fy1981 an average of 32 of the supplement appropriations were offset by rescissions after fy2002 however about 5 of the suppleme ntal appropriations were offset through rescissions it has been argued however that the offsetting rescissions were merely writeoffs of budget authority that would never be used for example cbo estimated that in the 1980s nearly half of the rescinded funds were unlikely to ever have been spent supplemental appropriations net of rescissions have usually increased the budget deficit and federal debt held by the public is larger than it would have been had the supplemental appropriations been fully offset had supplemental appropriations been fully offset since 1981 federal debt held by the public could have been reduced by about 23 or 1332 billion this could have reduced interest payments to the public by 57 billion per year on the other hand if 25 of the supplemental appropriations in fy2003 through fy2008 had been offset the average offset for previous years federal debt held by the public would have been reduced by almost 3 or about 170 billion presently reducing federal debt held by the public by 170 billion could save over 7 billion annually in interest payments to the public this report may be updated if events warrant

katrina which struck louisiana mississippi and alabama in 2005 caused widespread flooding significant property damage and lost lives within two weeks congress passed two supplemental appropriation measures providing combined 623 billion for relief and recovery needs including the supplementals for the war on terror and military operations in iraq and afghanistan total supplemental appropriations were 1604 billion for fy2005 934 billion for fy2006 1200 billion for fy2007 and 1387 billion for fy200863 45 42 and 44 of the total budget authority respectively 1 in response there is growing sentiment in congress that military operations be funded through the regular appropriations process rather than through supplemental appropriations2 supplemental appropriations often receive less scrutiny than the budget for the upcoming fiscal year as is reflected by the fact that the time from introduction to enactment is typically quite short for example for the five fy2005 supplemental appropriations acts the time from introduction to enactment varied from less than one day to three months 3 supplemental appropriation is device to provide additional funds for fiscal year already underway and has been used since the second session of the first congress however concern has been expressed over the volume of approp riations made through supplementals although supplemental appropriations are usually used to fund emergency spending congress has nevertheless attempted to control supplementals besides efforts to limit supplemental appropriations to dire emergencies congress has tried to mitigate the effects of supplementals with offsetting rescissions since 2003 however bout 5 of supplemental appropriations have been offset many in congress have expressed concern about the impact of supplemental appropriations on the federal budget deficit and federal debt in 2001 the federal budget ran surplus equal to 13 of gross domestic product gdp three years later the federal budget was in deficit as outlays increased somewhat and receipts fell the budget deficit was equal to 36 of gdp in 2004 and the 2008 budget deficit was about 32 of gdp 455 billion furthermore federal debt held by the public as percentage of gdp increased from 33 to about 37 between 2001 and 2008 4 this report examines supplemental appropriati ons since 1981 the trends in and the budget rules and laws applicable to supplemental appropriations are briefly reviewed in addition the impact of supplemental appropriations on budget deficits and federal debt is estimated the report does not focus on the reasons why supplemental appropriations have followed particular trend 1 see congressional budget office cbo data on supplemental budget authority for the 2000s at

appropriations provide additional funding to an agency during the course of fiscal year for programs and activities that are considered too urgent to wait until next years budget they often include spending for items authorized after the annual regular appropriations process over the past 25 years congress and the president have enacted one to eight supplemental appropriations or rescissions each year the major purposes of supplemental appropriations have changed over the past 25 years in the 1980s almost half of supplemental appropriations were for mandatory programs such as unemployment compensation and the rest was for discretionary spending one large discretionary item in supplemental appropriation during this time was civilian pay raises the purposes of supplemental appropriations shifted dramatically in the 1990s toward funding natural disaster relief as agencies were required to absorb the full amounts of pay raises 5 after 1990 over 90 of supplemental appropriations were for discretionary spending the president is authorized to submit to congress proposed deficiency and supplemental appropriations the president decides are necessary because of laws enacted after submission of the budget or that are in the public interest6 supplemental appropriations however are generally discouraged for example the office of management and budget omb directs agencies to make every effort to postpone ac tions that require supplemental appropriations7 omb further states that it will only consider requests for supplementals and amendments when existing law requires payments within the fiscal year eg pensions and entitlements an unforeseen emergency situation occurs eg natural disaster requiring expenditures for the preservation of life or property new legislation enacted after the submission of the annual budget requires additional funds within the fiscal year increased workload is uncontrollable except by statutory change or liability accrues under the law and it is in the governments interest to liquidate the liability as soon as possible eg claims on which interest is payable8 supplemental appropriation bills often contain funding requests for several purposes with varying levels of urgency for example the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and tsunami relief 2005 pl 10913 provided 762 billion for additional defense spending 58 billion for additional nondefense spending and 15 billion in rescissions which permanently cancel budget authority included in the bill were emergency 5 congressional budget office

atmospheric administration the public health and social services emergency fund and the office of federal housing enterprise oversight among others supplemental and regular appropriations have been subject to variety of budgetary rules over the years9 prior to 2003 the budget enforcement act of 1990 bea set discretionary spending caps and payasyougo paygo requirement for mandatory spending the bea was revised and extended throughout the 1990s and the limits expired at the end of fy2002 before 1990 the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 set deficit target and established sequestration process to enforce the targets 10 in addition the 1987 and 1989 budget summits focused on reducing the deficit by limiting the amounts congress could appropriate spending determined to be for an emergency by both the president and congress has been effectively exempt from the deficit targets budget caps and paygo requirements however at one point in the negotiations during the 1989 budget summit negotiators discussed limiting supplemental appropriations by requiring all additional discretionary spending be offset unable to reach agreement on new language the fina l agreement left intact the exemption for supplemental appropriations in the case of emergencies from the 1987 budget summit11 many times the emergency designation has proven controversial and some lawmakers have been concerned that the emergency spending exemption has been used mainly to evade beas constraints rather than respond to unanticipated needs 12

appropriations have va ried from 13 billion to 1619 billion which corresponds to 01 to over 6 of total budget authority see the solid line in figure 1 13 the amount of new budget authority contained in supp lemental appropriations bills fell after 1981 from over 3 of total budget authority to 01 in 1988 the early 1980s were characterized by high inflation and then severe recession the double digit inflation of 1980 and 1981 led the federal reserve board to adopt tight monetary policy to reduce inflation this policy action contributed to the severe 19811982 recession both the high inflation and the recession led to greater than expected outlays as the price increases made programs more expensive to administer and the recession increased outlays for unemployment compensation and meanstested transfers to the unemployed some of the unexpected spending was funded through supplemental appropriations as the economy recovered after 1982 the need to meet unanticipated outlays was removed and supplemental appropriations fell cbo argued that provisions in the congressional 9 see crs report 98721 introduction to the federal budget process by robert keith and crs report rs21035

congress and the president where it was agreed that supplemental appropriations would not be considered except for dire emergencies except for sharp spike in 1991 to fund the first gulf war supplemental appropriations remained at less than 1 of total budget authority throughout most of the 1990s much of the incremental cost for the first gulf war operations was eventually offset over the 1990s by burdensharing contributions from allied nations after 1998 supplemental appropriations began to rise as the federal budget began running surpluses after 2002 much of the supplemental appropriations was for funding the wars in iraq and afghanistan and the war on terrorism by 2005 supplemental appropriations reached about 6 of budget authority supplemental appropriations were 1390 billion in 2008 about 4 of budget authority of which 305 million was offset through rescissions 14 congressional budget office supplemental appropriations in the 1980s feb 1990

effect of supplemental appropriations the dashed line in figure 1 shows the supplemental appropriations net of rescissions as percentage of budget authority the level of rescissions in supplemental appropriations has varied from year to year with particularly large rescissions in fy1981 fy1986 and fy1995 in fy1995 enacted rescissions totaled 189 billion while supplemental appropriations amounted to 64 billion since fy1981 an average of 33 of the supplemental appropriations were offset by rescissions if the three years with large rescissions are omitted then about 19 of the supplemental appropriations have been offset on average deficit reduction has been of great concern since the early 1980s the large deficits of the early 1980s prompted congress to enact deficit target legislation in 1985 in 1990 the focus shifted from budget deficits per to establishing discretionary spending limits and mandatory spending paygo requirements these limits expired at the end of fy2002 table 1 reports supplemental appropriations and rescissions for the following four periods fy1981fy1985 the period before the enac tment of the deficit targets but covered by provisions of the congressi onal

limits expired for each of the four periods table 1 shows the total amount of supplemental appropriations and rescissions for the fy1981fy1985 period 22 25 in present value terms of supplemental appropriations were offset through rescissions 15 over the period covered by the deficit targets fy1986fy1990 over 40 of the supplemental appropriations were offset during the fy1991fy2002 period about one quarter of the suppl emental appropriations were offset after fy2002 however about 5 of the supplemental appropriations were offset through rescissions of which 348 billion occurred in fy2006 about 92 of total rescissions since fy2003 it has been argued that the offsetting rescissions were merely writeoffs of budget authority that would never be used for example cbo estimates that in the 1980s nearly half of the rescinded funds were unlikely to ever have been spent 16 15 the level of supplemental appropriations and rescissions varies from year to year the present value

in subsequent fiscal years these percentages are used for estimating the impact of the outlays associated with supplemental appropriations on the budget deficit to the extent that the rescissions just

year since fy1980 in fy1995 supplemental appropriations amounted to 64 billion while the new congress rescinded about 18 billion in budget authority consequently supp lemental appropriations net of rescissions have usually increased the budget deficit and federal debt held by the public is larger than it would have been had the supplemental appropriations been fully offset had supplemental appropriations been fully offset since 1981 federal debt held by the public could have been reduced by about 23 or 1332 billion this could have reduced interest payments to the public by 57 billion per year on the other hand if 25 of the supplemental appropriations in fy2003 through fy2008 had been offset the average offset for previous years federal debt held by the public would have been reduced by almost 3 or almost 169 billion presently reducing federal debt held by the public by 169 billion could save over 7 billion annually in interest payments to the public g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g156g561 reacting to disasters and other emergencies often requires high levels of funding the required funding cannot be anticipated and the length of the funding commitment is difficult to determine in advance in adopting budget rules and laws to control supplemental appropriations congress and the president have in the past provided safety valve for emergencies spending that is deemed an emergency was effectively exempt from discretionary limits and paygo requirements however what constitutes an emergency has not been without controversy 18 funding for most emergencies has come through s upplemental appropriations while most of the funds from supplemental appropriation are directed toward addressing the stated emergency funding for other purposes with varying levels of urgency are often included prior to 2003 varying amounts of supplemental appropriations were offset by reductions in other spending or increases in revenues between 1981 and 2002 about quarter of supplemental appropriations were offset through rescissions however since the expiration at the end of fy2002 of the discretionary limits and paygo requirements about 5 of supplemental appropriations have been offset even with the rescissions supplemental appropriations have generally increased the budget deficit and federal debt held by the public had all supplemental appropriations since 1981 been offset publicly held federal debt could have been about 23 lower at the end of fy2008 furthermore if just 25 of supplemental appropriations in fy2003fy2008 had been offset federal debt held by the public could have been almost 3 lower g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 thomas l
