2002 farm bill pl 107171 includes direct payments countercyclical payments and marketing loans large disparities in the relative levels of beneﬁt among these commodities have led to questions of equity this report compares support rates per unit total payments payments per harvested acre payments as share of the value of production and payments as share of the total cost of production in addition price and income support levels are compared to market prices by all of these measures there has been little equity across commodities however farmers often have argued for equity based on cost of production economists on the other hand would use trend market prices as the basis for setting support prices in order to avoid market distortions and resource misallocationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34053 order code rl34053 measuring equity in farm support levels june 22 2007 randy schnepf specialists in agricultural policy resources science and industry

argued for equity based on cost of production economists on the other hand would use trend market prices as the basis for setting support prices in order to avoid market distortions and resource misallocations there is little or practical or theore tical justification for equalizing support rates total payments or payments per harvested acre in fact some critics say the subsidies themselves are not justified ho wever to the extent that farm support is political reality equity is considerati on there are times when market prices drop substantially but temporar ily below trend levels at these times support may be justified to prevent unnecessa ry and undesirable resource adjustments this builds on the concept of marketbased safety net that uses market price trends as the key factor in setting support levels during the past ten years 19972006 m onthly average market prices for the major covered commodities have been below loan rates 36 of the time and below effective target prices 59 of the time however this frequency has varied substantially across crops this report calculates adjustments to policy parameters that would put each of the commodities in the money an arbitrary 30 of the time with regard to marketing loans and an arbitrary 50 of the time with regard to adjusted target prices compared to market price trends from 1997 through 2006 upland cotton rice and sorghum have disproportiona tely high effective target prices and marketing loan rates relative to the other major covered commodities barley oats and peanuts have disproportionately lower adjusted target prices and marketing loan rates the situation is mixed for corn and wheat soybean target prices and loan rates are closest to neutral according to the thresholds used in this

commodity and income support is mandated for 18 socalled covered commodities through direct payments c ountercyclical payments and marketing loans1 the levels of suppor t under each support system are specified in the law questions have been raised as to whether these commodities have been treated equitably with the benef it of hindsight it is possible to compare support prices and actual payments against seve ral standards to address stions of equity across these commodities this report compares 1 support levels in the law 2 yearly average program payments 3 program paym ents per acre 4 payments as share of crop market values 5 payments as share of production costs and 6 support levels with market price trends support prices the prescribed levels of commodity support in current law are shown in table 1 they are not equal either as specified in the law on volume basis for some and weight basis for others or when converted to common onehundred pound standard however equality in absolute price would not be reasonable standard for equity because the commoditie s have widely different nd uses and market values for example there is little reason to expect wheat used to make bread to be supported at the same price as cotton for fabrichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34053crs2 table 1 covered commodity support levels in the 2002 farm bill commodity unit of supportdirect payment

437 while the category other oilseeds received 02 of the total figure 1 again few would argue that equity would be achieved by dividing the total payments equally among commodities the allocation of payments among commodities largely is based on historical or current output which means harvested acreage is major factor in 2002 through 2005 farmers annually harv ested about 43 million acres of

payments compare on per acre basis figure 2 shows actual yearly average commodity support spending for the fy 2003fy2006 time frame per harvested acre yearly support spending averaged 10874 b illion if this had been distributed equally over all acreage the payments would have been about 48 per acre payments actually ranged from high of about 270 per acre for rice to low of about 4 per acre for the other oilseeds overlooked by this comparison is the fact that an acre of rice had market value of about 463 compared to corn at 318 or wheat at 142 therefore few farmers economists or policy makers contend that equal payments per acre would be an quitable distribution of support benefits 41022364866192213270 other oilseedssoybeanswheatother feedgrainsaveragecornpeanutscottonrice 0 50 100

economics may 1980 pp 244248 3 the maximum countercyclical payment made to farmers when market prices are below target prices is the difference between the high er target price and the lower sum of the loan rate and direct payment rate therefore the target price less the direct payment rate yields what is called the effective target price 4 john r groenewegen and kenneth c clayton agricultural price supports and cost of production american journal of agricultural economics may 1982 p271program expenditures compared to cost of production farmers have long endorsed the concep t of basing support on the cost of production because costs have to be covere d to stay in business in fact the permanent legislative authority for comm odity support programs the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 pl 75430 used prices paid for production inputs as key determinant of support prices as recently as the 1977 farm bill costs of production were built into the formula for annua lly adjusting target prices longer is cost of production explicitly included as determinant of support economists argue against basing support on production co sts first because they contend it is economically indefensible nd second because there is single cost of production production costs are different for every farm er the indefensibility argument arises because the specialized nature of some farm inputs particularly land buildings machinery makes their cost dependent on th value of the farm output this means that when earnings are above market leve ls because of subsidy the gains w ill be capitalized into the prices of the specializ ed inputs thereby raising the subsequent cost of production and leading to calls for additional subsidies2 then there is the problem of choosing which cost categorie s and levels should be covered only variable costs and only at level of the low cost highly efficient farmers national average variable costs or total costs for all farmers in spite of the theoretical opposition of economists farmers make politically appealing argument to policy makers when they plead for support to cover their costs of production how do current levels of support compare to production costs across commodities figure 4 shows effective target prices the target price minus the direct payment3 as share of national average 20022005 per unit costs of production at the high end the effectiv target price for peanuts amounts to 101 of the total cost of production at the w end the effective target price for sorghum amounts to 47 of the total cost of producti on economists groenewegen and clayton argued in professi onal journal that the rati onale for price support prices should be to allow immediate or cash ex penditures to be t price supports should not provide owners of fixed agri cultural resources the opportunity costs of those resources4 following this line of economic reasoning total costs of production may not be sound ba sis for designing support but they do facilitate comparison that shows wide disparity of support between effective target prices for some commoditieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34053crs7 5 ibid 6 usda 2007 farm bill proposals undated but released january 2007support levels compared to market prices the argument that groenewegen and cl ayton made in 1982 seems equally valid today that the level of price support should be establishe d below trend market prices5 one can think of the trend market price as reflecting the longrun equilibrium market price the logic of providing safety net may be used to set support prices at some level below the long run equilibrium price currently the law specifies fixed support levels without cons ideration for market price trends and questionable economic equity by the previous analysis in this report paraphrasing from groenewegen and clayton trend market prices as reference point should not cause the support program to attract additional resources into the sector but will provide cash flow to farmers when ma rket prices deviate substantially and temporarily below trend levels possibly in recognition of this logic the usdas farm bill proposal to the congress in january 2007 suggested that marketing assistance loan rates be set at 85 of the fiveyear olympic average with maximum loan rates as established in the hous epassed version of the 2002 farm bill647486491929398101 sorghumbarleywheat soybeansricecottoncornpeanuts 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 source primary data are from usda ers and pl 107171 effective target price is target price less the direct

for these commodities are efficient and fu lly reflect all of the market information embodied in both the us and international marketplaces the united states is generally viewed as having global comparative and competitive advantage in grain and oilseed production as result us grain and oilseed prices are gene rally viewed as representative of world market prices usda recognizes this by using posted county prices terminal prices adjusted for transportation costs from the county to the terminal as reference prices for operating its grain and oilseed marketing loan repayment provisions the situation is very different for cotton and rice in their case world prices are determined in markets outside the united states therefore to operate the marketing loan repayment provisions for cotton and rice usda first converts their international referen ce prices to us location by adjusting for transportation costs then these adjusted wo rld prices awps for cotton and for rice are used for operating the cotton and rice marketing loan repayment provisions 8 mafps are used for grains and oilseeds awps are used for cotton and rice the analytical results based on cotton and rice mafps are included for comparative purposeshow do support prices vary across commod ities in comparison to market price trends one approach is to evaluate the relative equality of commodity loan prices and target prices against benchmark market prices commodity loan prices are the basis for making loan deficiency payments ldps and target prices are the basis for making countercyclical paymen ts ccps market price trends for grain and oilseed crops in this analysis are monthly average farm prices mafp market price trends for cotton and rice are adjusted world prices awp7 these market price data are used first to examine the current level of price and income safetynet support and second to evaluate the degree of adjustment to current policy pa rameters ie loan rates and target prices needed to obtain equal levels of safetynet price and income protection across program crops comparison of loan rates comparison by commodity of monthly average market prices with the marketing loan rate provides general sense of the level of relative price s upport across program crops8 the frequency market prices fall below the loan rate suggests how often particular commodity is in the moneyie eligible for loan deficiency payments to offset low market price when such market conditions occur the marke ting loan rate is above the equilibrium market price and acts as floor or suppor t price using monthly average price smooths out daily and regional variation from grain and oils eed data these crops rely on daily posted county prices for determining actual an repayment rates and provides only general appr oximation for how often commodity actually has been in the money since cotton and rice both use calculated weekly adjusted world price only temporal smoothing occurs unde r monthly averaging fo r their price data based on 120 monthly data points for the 1997 through 2006 period market prices dropped below their corresponding loan rates 36 of the time for nine program commodities figure 5 however wide va riation appeared across commodities for example upland cotton prices were below the cotton loan rate 77 of the time in contrast the barley market price was below the barley loan rate 3 of the time simple approach to equalizing the vel of loan support across crops is to adjust the loan rates so that not more th an an arbitrary 30 of the observed markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34053crs9 prices for the period fall below the loan rates figure 6 the barley loan rate must be raised 17 to 216bu to achieve this ad hoc policy goal the wheat and peanut loan rates would be increased by 4 th corn and oats loan rates would remain essentially unchanged in contrast loan rates for rice and cotton would have to be lowered by 41 and 25 respectively to 381cwt and 3915lb the sorghum loan rate would need 9 cut while the soybean loan rate would be reduced by modest 2 comparison of ccp support countercyclical payments ccps are based on national annual average prices rather than monthly prices as result comparison of the monthly market price with the effective target price for each commodity provides stylized representa tion of countercyclical income support provided across program crops comparison and hypothetical adjustment is used to evaluate the relative levels of ccp support across major pr ogram crops again using monthly price data for the 1997 through 2006 period for all commoditie s over the entire period market prices were below their corresponding effectiv target prices 59 of the time figure 5 the range included low of 11 for barl ey and high of 95 for upland cotton ccp support levels can be equalized by adjusting target prices or direct payments upward or downward until the observed market prices for the period fall below their respective effective target prices not more than an arbitrary 50 of the time figure 7 as with the loan rate exercise the largest adjustment is needed for upland cotton the cotton target price w ould have to be lowered by 31 to 5005lb to achieve the threshold of market prices falling below the effective target price in not more than 50 of the observed months target prices for rice corn and sorghum also would have to be lowe red by respectively 24 11 and 8 to achieve equity wheat with 2 lower target price and soybeans with 3 higher target price would require the smalle st adjustments in contrast target prices for barley oats and peanuts would have to be raised by 17 12 and 4 respectively to the extent that the 1997 through 2006 time period reflects longrun market conditions this exercise suggests that upland cotton rice and sorghum growers receive disproportionately high level of both ccp and marketing loan support relative to the other major covered commodities barley oats and peanuts receive disproportionately lower ccp and marketing loan support the situation is mixed for corn and wheat soybean loan rates and target prices are the closest to neutral while the choice of loan rate and target price levels used in this analysis that would put the commodities in the money 30 of the time for loan deficiency payments and 50 of the time and counte rcyclical payments 50 are arbitrary however the relative outcome remains the same under ot her choices furthermore the levels used in this analysis are roughly the inthemoney averages for all crops under current lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34053crs10 3323322362328476677 11384049596076689295 of months mkt price lr and effective tpbarleyoatssoybeanspeanutsall cropswheatcornsorghumricecotton
