the wellrounded auditor lecture given on 29 june 1965 thank you well thank you female voice theres something i want to give you before we begin theres something here all right whats this oh oh yes this isthank you thank you very much this is declaration of release to l ron hubbard it says l ron hubbard is hereby certified has having attained the state of first second and third stage release in accordance with the hubbard communication office requirements signed department of certificates and awards well i was on power processing all this time without wearing one of those little signs you see the red r now makes it possible for you to ask questions i cant guarantee what state youll arrive at after youve asked the questions but there it is thisby the way this might interest you ive forgotten the exact date but mary sue audited to first stagewhat they get in the earlier lowerlevel processes and so forthaudited to that i think back in 1963 female voice february 24th february 24th 1963 and the needle went free and nothing would answer up and so forth and we were going for broke on the thing and we went ahead and did some other auditing and so forth and actually i hit keyedout ot at that particular time then as labor of love why i went around and did lot more research and lot more work on the general situation and plowed myself in good and heavy because the bank was completely unknown at that timethe actual r6 bankand i went ahead and floundered around in it and fell on my head and picked myself out of it and went back into it and pulled myself out of it and few things like that when the power processes came outi had to develop these processesand after they were developed it was an oddity here that the power processes actually are totally predicted they were not developed empirically one of the first pieces of data we have ever had that was totally developed 100 percent without single address to single case or anything else they were justfigured them out and there they should be and they were there and weve been running them that way ever since and the only place we get into any trouble and so forth is when we depart from that original which was interesting but i got to thinking about that after while and i said well this is pretty rough go and if im going to do lot of case supervision and write up lot of material on this why i jolly well had better have better subjective reality on this than i have so i rolled up my sleeves and i ran the power processes on solo and ran them all the way through to the end and the proper end result and so forth well oddly enough when i got to the end result all that was sitting there for reviv on the final engram and that sort of thing was just the beginning of track and the entrance to this universe and the r6 bank i found out i was trying to buck this thing with power process so id wound up in the wrong spot so i backed off little bit and that was it and that was what well know now as second stage release then i said all right there are other people going to do this if you run into the bank and that sort of thing you should be able to play tag with the r6 bank and go into it and drive the tone arm up and not walk around with this terrible liability of throwing the pc into the bank and maybe not getting them back out of it again so there must be another set of processes so i worked very hard extrapolated these processes figured those things out and we got third stage release which is selective ability you can just call your shots on what ability you want back and so forth and you can work it out with third stage release and we got three more new power processes so third stage release would be somebody who had selective ability now the funny part of it is that third stage release meets and shakes hands with r6ew and you can throw yourself back into the bank on third stage release you can again run that too far but sitting greeting you at this particular time all you get is the basic reactive bank but youre now at the correct end of it and it will start to disintegrate whether you know its pattern or not but if you try to go very far without knowing its pattern there are so many tricks in it and that sort of thing youll quickly snarl up but third stage release can push himself into and pull himself out of the r6 bank at will so this makes pretty wellmapped route at this particular time and its very interesting that the goal that weve sought actually for fifteen years what weve been trying to do and so on had just dropped out of slot with this ease were now getting an interesting reaction in organizations around why is somebody sending class vii auditor here to release us by power processing were releasing all the people we want to release on level 0 and i and ii hmm hmm hmm well actually after theyve released somebody on 0 i and ii they have made first stage release and the difference amongst these releases is simply stabilitythe degree of stability how long does this state last and so on the states arent necessarily higher one way or the otheronly they really are but you dontyou neglect that its mainly stability and first stage release very often got us into trouble on the subject of clear every once in while wed get clearing in trouble because you see at one time we called that clear and that was as close as we were to clearing clearing is on the other side of the r6 bank we know now but all the manifestations of it can occur well theres the basic manifestations of it can occurthe needle phenomenon and so forthso its keyedout clear you see but keyedout clear made with 0 i ii iii iv and so forth may be clear as bell for five minutes five days five months five years or five hundred years you just pays your money and takes your chance the fellow has been brought up to point where he can postulate and all he has to do is postulate one postulate wrong way to and the r6 bank rears up and hits him in the teeth and hes longer release so its very unstable dont you see highly unstable completely changes somebodys life and so forth and actually that is homo novis but how long does he stay there now on the power process and so forth release there is nois kickback you can feel bad and you can feel wowsy and you can feel this and that and so forth and your needle can go bit off and so on but you dont lose any of those things you dont lose any of the capabilities that youve run into you see the degree of stability is quite great now you proceed on from there there is known technology for the creation of keyedout ot we cant call one of those at will but when i notice we cant do one of these things at will why give us week but its somethingits something that happens unpredictably you may be going for power process release and find yourself with keyedout ot on your paws and this is quite interesting i wouldnt even attempt to describe keyedout ot its rather fabulous but the degree of stability there is merely because it keyed out it can key back in again but its liable to stay out and squared around for quite while if you dont fool with it too much the net gain weve gotten out of all of this is we have actually then cleared by the definitions of dianetics the modern science of mental health great many people and then by going on auditing them afterwards on ordinary processes we have just shot them to bits and its very hard on them to do this the only thing that first stage release of that type we were makingauditors wouldnt know what floating needle was theyd see the fellow reading at clear read and the needle would be floating and so on and they just kept on running the process you know and the pc wouldnt know about it he would know there was this point in some session somewhere where he felt wonderful and he never saw the meter at that time and neither did the auditor and then after that hed get arc breaky in processing and hed find out processing was very hard to do and that he didnt really want to be processed and it was upsetting to him well the only thing that could have been run on him then were the power processes you see and he could have been run on the power processes and brought to higher degree of stability in the field of release but if you were to overrun the power processes and if you were to proaudit somebody now on ordinary processes who had been power processed then you would be in trouble because theres only one thing there to hack at and thats the r6 bank really but you could come back and isolate some selective abilities with these other processes and move him on up to the third stage by selective abilities playing tag all the time with the r6 bank and eventually all there is left is your r6 materials its very interesting and i should tell you by the waynot to go on with this endlesslybut i should tell you that it is highly probable that you will not make clear unless youve been power process released the route right straight through the bank when it lies across an engram that will revivify and so forth is too hard it is too rough because youve gotyouve got an engram sitting there and youre sitting in the engram and youre trying to run the r6 bank while youre sitting in an engram youre not then in possession of all of your facilities with which to run it and youll find out the r6 bank isnt asising properly and that was the only trouble with it and so forth so if youve had dreams of just going right straight through to clear without ever being release why you might as well come off of it because thats all right you and lot of others will learn how to do class vii before youre through so it isnt too hard to do but thats the easiest and safest way and then you find out r6 materials they just run like bomb my god theres nothing to it because youre just right straight at it and everything asises like mad it is an interesting puttogether thealso it is quite fascinating to watch raw meat that is power processed this is fascinating because they dont know where the hell theyve wound up at they have inkling of that r6 bank there they dont know what wall theyre going to beat their head against dont you see and they dont know why an overrun made them feel so weird and then you fish them out and they feel terrific dont you see theyre fine but theyre not auditors you see so they dont know whats happening it tendsthey feel wonderful and full of awe so your best routeyour best route is power processes and r6 study and so forth to clear that is easily the best route through dont worry about it youll make it anyhow you could probablytherell be some small minority that will be able to make it directly and so forth only dont expect to be around and hold your hand after ive told you the horrible truth the horrible truth is that you try to run gpms and end words while youre sitting in an engram that should have been run by power processing and you get somatics and things that you cant account for there you are at the battle of the marne being shot full of bullet holes while trying to run the r6 bank the two things dont agree all right very good this is the 29th of june 1965 ad 15 all right well i probably should give you lecture today on something interesting but i forgot my notes and i dont have the reciprocal formula of the latitudinal bomb festival so i cant give you any lecture on that subject now the truth of the matter is were advancing very very fast today organizationally the technical advances were making unfortunately are out of thethis world as far as general release is concerned somebody sends an r6 set of materials through the despatch lines and ive got clerk who is dead sick and cant account for it you get the idea somebody hears the commands of the power processes and so on and decides to run them on pc or himself lying in bed at night and student doesnt appear for the next day for class you see in other words were dealingwere dealing with materials that look very elementary they look very simple nothing looks simpler than the power processes the hardest thing to teach about the power processes is that they are done just exactly as they are done and they arent done any other way and most of the instruction is just getting the few simple data in there well enough so all the other confusion blows off here and there in the auditors on staff and so on youd never see such confusion arrive inarise in your life and what theyre reoccasionally on some little point and the confusion just starts going off because the datum is too simple its too fundamental dont you see the way to run the power processes is you just run each one to its exact expected end result and how do you run them you run them muzzled and what do you do if something goes wrong you send the pc to review and what if the pc finds out its an ethicstype case youre trying to run then review sends him to ethics to get him cleaned up with the environment and its just all dadadada dadadada you know and really its trying to teach somebody how to do very very simple step when theyre used to doing adagio or something you see and they thinkthey think whats being required of them is the adagio whiadagio while standing on their heads on the back of an elephant that is galloping and actually youre asking them to stand on one spot and say the word one several times and they say well do you say it in highpitched voice or lowpitched voice now im running up againsti havent exhausted the materials of study by long ways and theres just so much data one hasnt got much chance to write it all up and put it in condensed and puttogether form that will happen too butwell now that im released you can expect things to be better but its quite interesting the study materials have more to them than would first greet the eye they are basically elementary themselves but there is great deal to observe in that particular field you could probably turn half dozen universities loose researching for the next five hundred years and they probably wouldnt exhaust all the things and stuff they would find about study its marvelous for instance i have photographer thats working here weekends and doing little bit of darkroom work and he has just taken his examinations for his professional society hes apparently just finished couple of years of fulltime study in the field of photography and so forth and hes very interesting hes very interesting to watch from the basis of study although he works as professional darkroom man in london during the week he has never really learned the fundamentals of photography and he has not learned what is important in the field of photography yet now either this was fault in study or not enough practical or something of this sort but he has not learned whats important and its very interesting that he will stand and yammer at i will be down there working on something or other while hes thereill go down and work for couple of hours on couple of days over the weekend little relaxationbut hell be yammering at about something or other and asking questions he violates the first thing he thinks he knows you see he hasnt found out that theres lot of things he doesnt know so therefore his mind is not open to learning anything so when you tell him something he goes on talking about something of the sort and ive now gotten to him to point of overwhelm where although he goes on talking about something else he will still do whats right you get the idea now thats an accomplishment but its but he keeps talking to meor he kept talking to i finally settled thisabout the enlarger theres big micromatic 5 x 7 enlarger which is called coldlight enlarger that is to say it has tubes in it instead of bulbs and this is cold light that is to say its like your fluorescent lights except very high high blue well this is very interesting enlarger its doll it sets on three different lenses and all you have to do is set it on another track and it goes up and down keeps anything in focus it does most anything you see beautiful piece of equipment well he apparently is used to some other kind of enlarger something of the sort and he keeps yammering away about this enlargerthe value of coldlight enlarger as versus condenser enlarger now you dont have to know anything about these terms just balderdash just showing you theres differences here condenser enlarger has some magnifying glasses in it to spread the light evenly but coldlight enlarger of course the light is perfectly evenly spread but coldlight enlarger does not give you any great degree of contrast like condensertype enlarger theres two types of enlargers so hes standing there worrying and worrying and worrying about the fact that this is coldlight enlarger that doesnt give high degree of contrast he kept at this he kept at it and he kept at it and i wasnt paying him much attention for while but after all i finally said what is this fellow talking about hes talking about contrast that is the blackness of the black and the whiteness of the white in negative or print and i suddenly realized what was wrong with him he didnt know that this is something you do the contrast of printwell you change the contrastthe print is dependent mainly upon film not on the enlarger and if you want to change the contrast of print you make your developer stronger or weaker or you use different grade of paper and you can change it like turning the light on and off you get the idea i mean heres this huge degree of variation that you can get out of the difference of developer and as far as the enlarger is concerned the difference is just about quarter you know tiny theres hardly any you in fact nobody without magnifying glass and densitometer and whole bunch of fancy instruments could tell the difference between condenser enlarger and coldlight enlarger you couldnt really tell the difference of course you can tell the difference on condenser enlarger because it doesnt evenly spread the light and you notice that half of your print is dimmer than the other halt so it has fault i finally rounded up on him and i said well wait minute i said in the final analysis what youre trying to get is picture and the type of enlarger that you say has all the contrast in it and so forth wont spread the light evenly enough and it spreads the light so unevenly that it ruins your prints so you dont get picture with them now i said let that be the end of it as far as if you want contrast is concerned why just go over there on the developing tray and in the developing tray double the concentration of developer or half the concentration of developer and i said youll get all the differences that you want now you got it and he was going on muttering about this but the mutter trailed off and so forth and i havent heard anything about enlargers since i thought thats all very interesting thats all very interesting because here are bunch of stuff here are bunch of considerations and so forth this man must have been taught with ferocity on the subject of enlargers and how one was contrasty and one was not contrasty with whole bunch of missing datum he must have been taught as though all of this was very important its completely unimportant hes worrying about some little scrap of something and apparently nobody taught him anything about the fact that you can produce very black blacks or just pale gray blacks dependent upon what developer you use or what concentration of developer apparently nobody taught him the essential or he missed the essential in the textbook dont you see and hes flying around over here well ive noticed about this boy that he is full of tips brother hes got more tips than you can shake stick at he knows that pressman will occasionally flash negative at wall to presensitize the film before he takes picture in darkroom this is trick that one pressman in one thousand pulls once in his lifetime do you follow trick he knows all these tricks just run off just tons of these tricks and i say dont let the temperature vary now in developing that film or youll get grainwhich is true and thats very importanthe doesnt know much about that but he knows bunch of tricks about you mix some bromide with some braruff and then you eventually get double composite positive roff roff you got the idea ive been watching this sort of thing i sighed i said well ill make photographer out of him yet but the main thingthe main thing thats of value to us and that i suddenly began to alert to is several of our study factors you see were out as he was studying and are out in his practice and the one new one that i noticed and suddenly saw very familiar amongst some very slightly acquainted auditors you know out in the fringethey hardly havent done any auditing at all they havent had much training of any kind whatsoeverboy are they hell on tricks boy theyre willing to listen to you all day long as long as you will tell them some quick shortcuts and some tricks tricks like how do you get pc to answer up the questiona trick see of some kind or another how do you detect greentype thetan from bluetype thetan without the use of an emeter see the coloration of eye change while running certain types of processes these guys are deadly on these things see theyre all completely unessential tricks theyre just bricabrac you see theyre quite interesting but theyre just brica brac and that same guy couldnt for the life of him sit down and give straight standard auditing on straight standard command so i see tricks and odd bits and so forth as sort of dispersal approach to the subject of auditing in other words approach it from the fringe and somebody whos never really studied to be an auditor will pretend great knowledge of the subject and then pick up whole bunch of fringe tricks without knowing anything about where they fit or how to use them or anything else boy he talks wonderful auditing he sounds terrifically interesting dont you see but then you get him to sit down in the chair and simply utter the auditing command and acknowledgeget it answered and acknowledge the pc and handle the pcs origin and give the next auditing commandjust good solid maincourse job of auditinghes not there all he does is pull tricks and it isnt the tricks that get anybody anyplace and that i began to realize was what was wrong with psychiatry and psychology theyre full of tricks all they do is nurse oddities they are the greatest oddity collectors that anybody ever heard of they remind you of stamp collectors here is rare stamp from bungawoolaland it was only printed once in 1899 to celebrate the cashiering of the king from the british army very rare value as far as world affairs are concerned as far as his own life is concerned zero do you see they apparently pick up all the hors doeuvres all the scraps off the floor and everything but the main dish now psychiatrists can tell you the most marvelous things about cases you listen to them and your jaw drops sometimes theyre not all dummkopftheyre all crazy but theyre not all stupid ive listened to some of their insaneasylum manifestations with the greatest of interest ialso they do very good imitation of them ive actually been entertained by the hour by these blokes but i suddenly realize i have never heard one of them utter one essential piece of information that would have led to the resolution of case fantastic hors doeuvresno main course isnt that marvelous so apparently there is another phenomenon of some kind in the world of study theres the fellow who canwho knows it and can do it and then theres the fellow who knows all the tricks concerned with it and cant do it here is an odd fringe manifestation that i have spotted so that when you get somebody to sit down and really be an honesttogod dyedinthe wool auditor who produces terrific exact resulthe or any of us have been through the same course of picking up all the tricks and asking all the questions as we moved in dont you see and these things start to blow their relative importance starts to assert themselves of course they werent important and the eventual action is that these things all blow off and youve got jolly good auditor now you go around and you ask himlets say youre new at it and so forth and you ask him now how do you gethow do you get the pc to look at you during the session and he says what how do you get the pc to look at you why do you want to know this because of course he doesnt why do you want to know this well you know youre supposed to have the pc look at you before you acknowledge well now these things can really come up the line and you say where did they get that where did that come from well in the first place its just an interesting trick which is used once in while to pc that youre occasionally worried about has he finished and once in while you get pc who will apparently finish and then go on well if you start following the procedure of that pc of waiting until he looks at you and so forth then youre pretty sure because sometimes hell look at you and his eyes will be real vague and then hell eventually give you little nod like thatyeah and you can give him the next command then without cutting off his line this is one pc in hundred you understand now where then did the line come from what is this that was just trick you see its relatively unimportant you could live all your life without knowing it but where did they get the idea that on every pcthe pc has to look at the auditor before the pc gets acknowledged because this puts an awful strain on the pc the pc asides doing the auditing command has to remember to look at the auditor or he wont get another command you got the idea now where did he get this datum and i suddenly remembered i actually dug up where the datum comes from there is another datum and ifs very important datum and that is that pc who doesnt look at the auditor will always respond very well to an arc break assessment you understand hes not always visibly arc broke but you can always get an arc break off of him and im always leery of pc who never looks at the auditor and pc who will slew around and sit sideways in the chair i dont go any further i just assess for the arc break right now and i always find it so it is just an indicator of an arc break well now just an indicator of an arc break you see well to finished auditor its worth knowing so forth there are other indicators to an arc break too he also set bad goals and he also did this and he also did that but one of them is that when youre supervising sessions or watching tv demo or something like this and you can see that pc and hes just sitting sideways you know and he never looks at the auditor he never looks at the auditor well you know that if you did an arc break assessment on him why heyoud find an arc break well this isntthis is not firstrank information its about thirdrank information but its valuable see it has some value but out of this we make the factnow we can move it upstairs then misapply it and say that never acknowledge pc until the pc has looked at the auditorthats any pc now we have got the data stretched out of shape havent we the datum is now out of focus there is longer any reason to give it this much attention but by giving it attention then we put an awful strain on practically every pc we audit see he gets introverted hes busily deeply introverted in his case and he isnt about to look at the auditor hes really quite unaware of the auditor hes back on the track someplace or another but he isnt arc broke now if we waited for that pc to look at the auditor before we acknowledged whatthis is what would happen hed sit there interested in his own case willing to talk to the auditor and so on whats the matter whats happening wonder whats up you know hes about to ask whats up and the auditor says thank you so he says well thats all right he had to pull himself all the way up the track well oddly enough if you pull this trick very often on one of the power processes why the guy would practically go around the bend because hes being pulled across too much track just to get an acknowledgment hell very shortly then go on auto hell startyou know the auditor will give him the command and hell give himself the command and then something runs it down here do you understand so theres mainline information that is real important meat this is the stuff see and then of course any subject matter islike any dinner gets surrounded byor the better dinnersgets surrounded by hors doeuvres and dessert and scraps on the floor and chamber music and you know that sort of thing but if you depended on the hors doeuvres and the scraps on the floor and the chamber music youd leave that table awful hungry do you follow so an auditor in training should differentiate should differentiate amongst types of data now theres maincourse data that is the datum dont you see that is crash see thats big important senior datum that will add up to practice its generally applicable and so forth and then theres data that you should know in order to apply the main data properly and then there is data that if you knew it you would appear very clever and that normally wraps itself around like the parsley and so forth itwell its nice but it doesnt have very great value its interesting it amplifies it its run into sometimes its of interest but whats the maincourse datum in auditing well now when somebody does shift on what maincourse datum is namely lot of people go very badly adrift well we used to teach maincourse datum on the subject of this you audit the pc in front of you very important datum in its day and if you are auditing in private practice someplace you jolly well should because theres nobody else there but that was before grading was producing results and that was before organization so an organization auditor doesnt audit the pc in front of him at all not anymore he audits the process and if he sees some bad indicator sends him to review and thats the maincourse datum and thats breeze because thats teamwork auditing the auditor is there hes to lay the exact process to the exact end phenomena when the end phenomena occursbangthats it if the end phenomena is not approaching if the bad indicators are there the goals and gains are sour the pc is breaking down somewhere or otherthats it review because the auditor iscan be part of whats wrong you dont want to take chance on this even yourself pc may be peculiarly mad at you or the pcthere might be something wrong with your comm cycle as far as the pcs concerned or theres something you havent picked up and in the case of some auditors why theyve got that wrong with them too so theyve got blind spot as far as the pc is concerned when its wrong also with the pc weird things occur on this line so lets just throw all those irregularities out and lets put the pc on standard approach and lets just take up everything with him that could possibly be wrong with case well ive just achieved that little technical trick and that was quite trick there is policy letter now of couple of days ago which has on it every possible thing that could be wrong with pc and why they arent running theres fortyfour lines on it now to get that piece of technology together and to put it in form of order of importance and likelihood and juggle it up was quite trick lot of case experience went along with this what youre going to teach every auditor in the hgc then each one of these things and to pick it up without form and without list and its all got to be done and so forth well in the first place i couldnt do it sitting there auditing that pc to be able to do onethe right one of fortyfour different possibilitiesthat sounds much particularly when the pc unbeknownst to may have an overt on as the auditor and is merely hard to audit from my point of view simply because the group is out when this possibility enters in dont you see why it tells you at once that i shouldnt be repairing any pc that i myself am auditing routinely it tells you right away that it would be athe source of the case failures when you have them that would be the reason cases failed now let show you what used to happen in the bad old days auditor goes in starts session the pc sayswhat goals would you like to set for this session the pc says none the auditor says oh well all right uhmm uhm uhm uhm uh do you have an arc break theres read do you have present time problem theres read pc says well its just that i just dont have any goals to set igo ahead and audit if you want to i just dont have any well all right ill audit you doesnt go right auditor finally takes break and goes and sees the d of p and says i got d of p down here that wouldnt set goals for this session and the d of p sort of looks at the folder and he asks the auditor some questions and they figure outand all of sudden they figure out that the guys motherinlaw and so forth audited him once and its probably restimulation of an incident in arslycus and we really ought to invent new process called whizzeroobangpup and we ought to run it but the auditor gets that process wrong and goes back and audits the pc on something else and the pc starts looking worse and this goes round and round and round with tremendous number of errors being committed all the way along the line all right now look at thislook at this as neatedup technology auditor sits down pcs sitting there auditor says what goals would you like to set for this session pc says none auditor says all right thank you very much is it all right with youanything youd care to ask or say before i end this session and the pc says whats up well im going to have to send you to review im sorry all right that is the end of session thank you all right now here come along with and it goes by estimation gets his chit takes him over to review and moves him right in over to review and review auditor who is an expert on assessment that is the main thing hes an expert on he canhe knowshes picked because he knows meter backwards he never misses read and thats it then the auditor goes back over and reports and does something useful and the d of p goes on with his room assignments and his auditor training and he is not bothered with all this and the auditor goes and files things or writes some letters in the department of schedules and somethingsomething goes on during that particular auditing period and pcs over there foroh i dont know he could be over there all day pc comes into session and says hes not going to set any goals well i dont think that the organization ought to stay it the organization didnt go out last night and get drunk so the d of pthe d of p is over there and doing his work very happily and the auditors going on and doing some useful work and theyre not disturbed by all of this figurefigurefiguregood reasons why they can dive sideways and go off standard technology and that sort of thing because it isnt standard technology at fault it never is itll be one of fortyfour things never standard technology at fault weirdly enough so the review case officer or auditor over in reviewhes in different division he didnt have to take any orders from the d of p he didnt have to take any orders from the auditor the only thing hes got to do he just takes the responsibility for the case so the preconceived ideas of the auditor now do not apply important the auditor might not like greenheaded people or something the considerations of the d of p and his conclusions theyrethey dont apply because the d of p is absolutely forbidden ever to interview pcever to interview pcever to talk to an auditor about pc never ethics chit man the d of p was seen today to be interviewing pc ethics chit two week suspension cut his buttons off on the parade ground because looking and talking to the pc isnt statistic is it only the case folder is statistic only the case folder only the amount of ta that the pc got only did he make his goals and gains only what process was run with what wording only how long was it run do you see what was the end result of running this process is there still ta in that process this is statistics statistics statisticsthats allout of the folder of course you shoot an auditor for ever giving you false attestation like he got 495 ta divisions in that particular session actually the only way that you could get that would be to hook an emeter up to helicopter but you get something like thatyou dont want any auditor thatll falsely report things and then you just depend utterly completely and only upon the case folder you do your case supervisiondont ever talk to the pc never and never talk to an auditor about pc auditor comes in what am i going to do about bill what are you going to do about bill the d of p is supposed to say who is bill well my pc hmmm one job endangerment chit youre trying to get to give you an unusual solution job endangerment thats the truth were now talking technology were not talking ethics thats the truth student who comes up to supervisor in course and says what cute little trick can i run on the pc im running at night because he keeps standing on his head in the chair well that supervisor should at that moment turn in to ethics job endangerment chit somebodys trying to persuade him to violate the rules of the road because for sure if that case is standing on its head in the chair there is trick known to man or beast because the answer youd give would be based upon the answinformation youre being given which is probably false the best place for the guy whos standing his head on chair would be in review being gone over very carefully on standard list which would pick up everything that could be wrong with case see all those things would have to be taken into account wed find nonstandard processes unflat processes broken auditing appointments arc breaks and horrendous ptpthe guy is in court every morning being divorced and we say other than that theres nothing wrong with the case you get the idea theres too many things go awry here dont you see for this cute little trick theres cute little trick that will put human being back together again theyre like humpty dumpty and were catching them all theyre in the shape of humpty dumpty right now theyve fallen several hundred trillion years and they have landed with an awful splash and putting them back together again does not consist of cute little trick of how do you flavor eggnog if this guys in trouble in his immediate environment you can count on the fact that its trouble if pc doesnt gain in processing man there are reasons why and they are not covered by cute little trick of how do you hold your little finger while youre setting your emeter that wont cover it detective agency might cover it well actually the truth of the matter is the fellow leaves the hgc every afternoon and then goes over for his turkish bath and colonics only hed never bothered to inform anybody of this hes mixing two therapies hes holding down screaming present time problem of terrible gastric upset every time hes in session do you understand so hes got present time problem processing wont gain over the top of it nobody finds this present time problem dont you see becausewhy they dont find it is just because it isnt being assessed for you can get the data but if you dont get the data youre not going to be able to do anything about it so you better go about the business of getting all the data that you can get on the case dont you see so the new method then is the auditor sits there goes into standard session expects standard responses which he will get audits standard comm cycle moves straight on up through standard grading everyafter every day turns in the case folder and the d of p he does standard dofping he looks at it whats the ta what were the goals and gains and so forth the process run now lets see last twenty minutes here we had 5 ta divisions in the last twenty minutes well how many divisions did we have yesterday oh we had lots more ta divisions than that yeah oh this process is going flat i think he probably ought to run it tomorrow to just little cognition or something like thatthat would be the standard response for an ordinary processand get the hell off of it and go onto the next indicated process up the line so thats what hed write on here and so forth and so on but as hes looking at thishe picks up the next form and hes looking at this and it says by the way what im talking to you about is not theoretical im talking to you from the hard core of practiced experience ive gotten in trouble when i havent followed these rules myself he goes into this he says pc says not to have too much trouble in this session hmm well whats the ta for this session the ta was twentyseven for 2½ hours augh pc isnt in trouble where are they on the process continue the process next thats right getting too much ta for somebody to be in trouble you understand his gains are okay and so forth just one little sour goal you know the guy was apprehensive so we didnt pay any attention to it that case is flying all right pick up the next folder and the pc sayshis goals and gains is blank the pc was very restive this session and didnt want to run any processes who smithers auditor smithers how many hours were wasted here ummmhmmmm all morning and all afternoon auditing pc with an arc break well mr smithers were going to make citizen out of you and here goes an ethics chit smithers ethics hearing running pc all day arc break not following out proper hat and sending pc instantly to review when pc wouldnt set any goals another chit pc to review total action unusual solutions next case smithers comes back the next day with blurred look in his eye and so forth and hes saying well actually i thought i could help him oh thinking huh well turn another chit in on you and thats the way you do it and the next thing you know the auditor knows exactly whats expected of him hes supposed to run the case of course theres big kick on running case like this because all of sudden you see these cases start going zoom the cases youre auditing really start winning dont you see youre not running whole bunch of oddities and little fringearea things that are getting in the road of this that and the other thing you see case ran fine for three days fell on its head and didnt run anymore rolly coaster you say oh well rolly coaster that means potential trouble source which means the person is connected with suppressive person we got the textbook answer we know exactly what it is we send him to review its all we ever send anybody we always send him to review see and over in review they go down the line and theyve got one of their lines pts of course he sees the pts because the guy rollycoastered pts yes yes hes connected to several suppressives and is member of suppressive groupcitizen of the united states has wilson as the prime minister so but review never concerns itself with this review doesnt concern itself with that just fills it in with big fat check its concerned with the case and this is part of case picture you see now when it gets back to the examiner and the examiner sees this review reportthe examiner sees that pts is checkedhe doesnt send the case back to the hgc he sends the case to ethics and the case goes over to ethics and the ethics officer sits there and the ethics officer knows his business hes only supposed to do certain things and he does those certain things just ratatattat and what the ethics officer does is say all right you seem to be potential trouble source here what suppressive are you connected with well im not really connected with any suppressive i dont know why they sent over to ethics you people think youre something dont you you know well some ethics officers could be expected to be just little bit touchy at this point and say one weeks suspension for being discourteous to an hco personnel but you wouldnt find that would be routine they would say now whos the suppressive somebody who wouldntwhos dead against scientology your being in scientology raises hell with you and so forth who is this person and so forth well nobody now heres your interesting phenomenon that guy believes this he believes this because suppressive always pulls generalities generality is the stock in trade and the suppressive becomes invisible in the environment to the person and the person cant spot the suppressive so the only thing ethics does is work this overwith or without meter to hell with it who is the suppressive suppressive person or suppressive group and hell search it and search it and search it now if ethics is good why ethics will just finally hit it and say ah soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso is that right the guy says you know that is right all right there you are ethics knows they got it because the persons face lit up like christmas tree but if you dont find the suppressive or you spot the wrong one its like indicating the wrong bypassed charge in an arc break assessment nothing happens with the case this is quite remarkable to watch you have to do one or two wrong before youre suddenly convinced of the fact you have to do somebody wrong and then bring somebodythat somebody back in couple of days later and say i must have goofed and suddenly find out that he has never informed anybody of this but he lives with his mother and his mother routinely and regularly and so forth tells him that hes being blasphemous because scientology is against god and he is after all christian and tells him this every morning at breakfast at some length but he somehow or other has just not noticed this you see we spotted the wrong suppressive the first time now the phenomenon is this you say well your uncle is suppressive and weve got that now and the person says yes my uncles suppressive yes good yes i want you to disconnect from your uncle you havent got the right one he says i donti dont see how i cdont see how idisconnect from my uncle hadnt got anything to do with it at all well you havent found the right suppressive you havent indicated the right bypassed charge you understand so you just better look further you look little bit further and so forth uncle hell ifs his boss see you all of sudden say well its your boss hes kidding you all the time about going down to the organization because youre crazy is thatis that the fellow yeah thats the fellow well that persons suppressive and here is your order now you handle or disconnect person will say oh well the hell with him yeah sure disconnect yeah nothing to it bang bang he goes right along with it zooooop the only time you find ethics laying an egg is when they just fail to spot the right suppressive thats all well ethics spots that the person does handle the situation or disconnect or arrange for the other person to be audited or do something straight awaybangstraightens it up move him back into the hgc the auditors back at the old stand now he starts out he doesnt discuss this in any way he just starts where the processing was left off and he carries on from there it however its been case remedy or something thats recommended by review he will run the case remedy before he resumes the regular grade processing and he goes away so that youre left on an assembly line which is an assembly line it just goes right down the belt pocketapocketapocketapocketa and the auditor is therehes just got to put the rivet in the right place thats all do you understand and the d of phes just right down the same line hes got to make sure theres enough auditors standing there to put the rivets in the right place and when that flat ball bearing comes up that belt they mustnt go into total psychotic break because theyve got flat ball bearing on the tech belt they just pick it up and say look flat ball bearing all right where do flat ball bearings go they go to review all right now up the line up hereup the line up here the org exec sec and so forth notices theres deterioration of statistic that is to say there arent quite so many people being processed up to certain level the statistics which are turned in by the department of inspection and reports under the new organization will show that theres declining statistic in other words processing is not as successful lately in the tech division as before now it is time to go and look at all the review chits and they find out that auditing cycles are out on several auditors they tell the d of p about it actually he sends those auditors for special training and he puts in the comm cycle on these auditors very very good and that smooths it out again do you understand now thats teamwork action and out of that action as poorly as it is in in several orgs at this particular moment its in very flimsily i wont say poorly but very flimsy they havent had sec eds on this more than couple of months do you know these outfits are starting to turn out releases on the same cottonpicking processes they were running on people before isnt this peculiar oh i should think that would be very peculiar its the same process its the same org its essentially the same personnel but its not the same result entirely different result and its gotten so bad in one org that theyre challenging any reason for the power processing theyre doing so well on the lowerlevel processes all of sudden its fantastic they havent had any new technology theyve had new org pattern theyve had new teamwork and even when thats in poorly it starts working pocketapocketapocketapocketa now lets say two class vii auditors go to hasi podunk which is small org and which is having all of its staff released but its growing well theyre the odd men out arent they this hasi has got itsits running on its assembly line on ordinary processes reviewing its ordinary see but theres review for class vii on power processes is there well of course the power processing would be done from review that is to say those two class vii would simply be attached to review and would be releasing staff one right after the other in review but how do they get around this liability well they never do their own folders each one of them is the case supervisor of the other one and by the time theyve balled up two or three cases we will have the third class vii there to be their reviewer do you see how it works out and youd be an absolute fool to do your own case folders complete fool you should never never go auditing around when you dont have review handy because you miss the main reasons for the case decline so there are several things that you want to become you want to become an absolute whizbang as review auditor just learn to assess for gods sakes just be able to take pc and assess lists and service facs and forms and lists and make lists and run an emeter so that you never miss read even for split second and so forth really make it sit up and talk you want to be darn good darn good assesser on meter and you want to know what all the processes are that are called for on form and all the processes that might possibly be run because theyre of interest and then as very very excellent review auditor be able to do in the hgc completely standard unvarying job of auditing which requires assessment requires frills and nothing but read the ta run the process handle the pcs origins start and end the session im not now talking about class vii at all im talking about ordinary runofthemill 0 to iv auditors is what im talking about and then right in that same category you want to be able to sit there and be able to knock out case folders bang bang bang bang bang know exactly what to look for in case folders and so forth be able to take over the whole load as d of p do case supervisor job to end all case supervisor jobs just learn to do it totally by statistic never miss know exactly when to send them to review and when not to send them to review know when to investigate one of your auditors comm cycles or not of course you realize that after youve had one auditor send three pcs in row to review and so forth that it might not all be pcs and youve had couple of pcs sent to review that review couldnt find anything wrong with well dont blame it on review an auditors comm cycle can louse up case might be right there in the hgc so then you start reviewing auditors learn to do those things learn to be able to sit there and do case supervisor job to end all case supervisors what is flat process what are the processes to be run how long should they be run what is the next process to be run afterwards what are the good indicators that can be read from folder what are the bad indicators that can be read from folder how much ta is ta you understand along that i could recommend course in cryptography cryptography is the skill of reading secret writing i have become quite remarkable at this i have very powerful magnifying glass that sometimes by getting the impressions on the paper i get so that i dont have misunderstood word on the thing in front of and one night i was actually able to invoke the assistance of four hco personnel and the hco exec sec and we managed to work it out and we finally found out what it was so itd be very good for you to develop certain telepathy as to what did the auditor mean of course an auditors writing fast and furious dont you see and they very often dont get all down the word is veuoooosquiggle you know now learn to do that so what are these three things learn to be perfectly marvelous review auditor be able to do an assessment to end all assessments know all the processes that have ever been run on anything anyplace to any result know them all be able to run meter so doggoned good that you just never miss read know all about metering know any process that might even vaguely or dimly be connected with that form of the review just be whizbang as far as that type of auditing is concerned the highest type of auditing there is be very good at it and be absolutely fantastically good at turning out the meat course just be terrific at turning out the meat course sit down start the session fix it up clear the auditing command get couple of buttons straightened up handle the pc into the session get the body of the session going utter the first auditing command and keep your auditing comm cycle going straight through to the end of the session without single whimper yipyap goof misduplication or failure to observe your end phenomena and so forthjust perfectly standard straight terrifically straightforward bong bong bong bong job of auditing and be able to step aside from that 100 percent and be able to do cases without ever looking at an auditor talking to an auditor or looking at pc talking to pc going around asking for any information or anything of the sort just read it right straight out of that case folder know exactly what that pcs doing and know exactly what pc to keep in session and continue and what pc to move out with that goes certain sensitivity to the frailties of certain auditors particularly on lower level you may have even i today or even 0 auditing in an hgc you can do it providing youve got your ethics in and youre cracking the whip and you know your business yes he could only run 0 process thats for sure but with proper supervision that could happen youd have to have squawkbox system for one thing youd have to have it so that you could listen in on session occasionally and find out what the hell was going on in the session and then not use the data particularly for anything but to correct your false attestations if they came through one thing is being audited but another thing is written in the folder you know that sort of thing you have to be because you find their ethical standard matches their case standard which is usually pretty low when theyre low on their classifications but you could still do it you understand but as person move up the line youll find out that some auditor youre handling nonreleased auditors dont you see and weve done it for years so it can be done and you know that this auditoryou just never never never put him to auditing another man just never hell just cut him to ribbons or you know certain auditor there if you have anything to doyouif you put this auditor on young man he will just butcher him he seems to go round the bend on this particular subject you see and you know that youve got matronly lady and you know very well that you had better never never never never never put her auditing any young person because she just chops them to bits or goes into cavein on them and you learn certain things youll gradually learn your auditors and that there are certain types of assignments theyre very successful on and certain types theyre not and therere certain types of this and that that have really nothing to do with cases but this is just auditor assignment which is another subject entirely how do you assign the auditor to the pc and then theres another one which you might dimly be interested in thea d of p of course also has to be able to assign rooms and at saint hill this is done by magicthere being rooms to assign dont you see and thats the main trick of room assignment is assigning rooms which dont exist and still getting auditing done thats the main difficulty but now if you were able to do those things and if you also knew theif you also knew the general situation with regard to the org board and the relationship of the technical division to the other divisions and if you knew those things why boy you would really be very very very successful people will really like to have you around man now you drop one of those skills out and youre that much less producing auditor its lucky hgc staff that could detach almost any one of its people to the qualifications division to act as review that would be very lucky and very very welltrained hgc generally itll be quite different some qual sec and so forth will be haggling and fooling around with the org exec sec trying to get zilch transferred from the hgc to the department of review to be the new case officer because somebody has gone up to director of review and has left hole oh you cant have him why cant i have him well hes the best auditor ive got why i ask the question at that time well whats goes with this fellow as training officer that hes got best auditor at least he ought to have three best auditors and of course youd find he was being very cooperative too because he wants good auditor over there in review otherwise his case supervision becomes unthinkably difficult his technical statistic will just go to pieces promptly and at once hell find out that then hell have to take over his own casehis own review and case supervision now we can see we can see city office just formed in north chicago or something like that which takes care of the suburb of euphoria and theythe fellow in charge of that he hadnt learned better yet but he has his own ideas about all this and theyre different than rons and thoseand hes decided that its waste of personnel to have somebody in the qualification division because theyre not big enough yet you see so therefore he has the d of p do his own review and also audit pcthats what seems logical and then he wonders why after he had sudden burst of pc signups he doesnt have any more pcs oh he doesnt have any more pcs because his tech is out and the quickest way you can get rid of pcs is not deliver good technology dont deliver good results if you dont deliver good results why you dont have any pcs thats elementary actually you can run bad hgc longer than you can run bad academy bad academyone that iswhatwhere tech is out in the academywill fold up in matter of days or weeks its the wildest thing you ever wanted to see in your life all of sudden tech goes out in the academy exclusively and then youre suddenly looking at an empty academy you wonder what happened i dont know how students get it on the grapevine i really dont and you change the d of t and you straighten it up and you get the lines in and all of sudden the academy fills up in matter of two weeks whered they all come from this is one thatactually im not joking this is bit of baffler its absolutely true its quite factual that this does happen when an academy goes bad it empties and when it goes good why it fills right up againvery quiquite quick theres comm lag there is comm lag on the hgc asive measured one as long as six months but boy when the collapse comes it takes six months to recover and if you go in an hgc without any results for six monthswithout any good standard uniform results for six monthsif you can build that place back together again in eighteen months youre doing well it happens bit slower in an hgc but its more permanent when dey kills an hgc dead wit bad technology dey kills it much deader than you would suppose possible so anyway the net gain here is that an auditor in training is not in actual fact merely being trained as an allaround auditor who does oneman band and so forth the auditor whos doing oneman banddoing his own review and his own this and then auditing his pcs all night and trying to run course and doing his own case supervision and so forthisjust gets sloppier and sloppier and sloppier and hell get tireder and tireder and next thing you know he isnt auditing and its happened to lot of people well that isnt the way you do it what you do is get in city office put it together in its proper formation and so forth and then when you are training as scientologist in the vicinity of technical and so forth remember that there are now these zones i dont expect there ever will be any additional zones therell be data philosophic organizational areas and that sort of thing oh yes but these quiteare really bit different subjects than that of being an auditor but an auditor should know very well how to do those very things that ive enumerated if an auditor cant do those things himself he really will never quite understand whats happening while he is auditing do you follow hell never quite understand whats going on or what should be going on and then his lines tend to go out because hes ignorant of whatwhich way to send the particle dont you see or whats happening hell sit and look at the folder in bemazement if hesif hes just doing routine job of auditing and he doesnt know anything about folder marking and that sort of thing and he gets his folder back and his folder says change this process hes absolutely baffled why should he change the process and so forth the thing washe wont have any reason for it well hell finally begin to believe in the implicit faith that the d of p is always right and this implicit faith is touching but is unnecessary because it happens the d of p if hes well trained will be right but the point is that theres reason to be in mystery about it the reason you change processes and do these things are very very standard reasons so you should know something about case supervision you certainly should know the main course of auditing just how do you sit down and bang one out man bang out that session just as standard as standard is standardstandard comm cycle standard processes standard responses standard auditors reports the fiendish glee with which person can knock this into shape is quite something its direction of difference to be trained in that is ahas its own rewards now the only thing that ever makes you break standard operation is when your pc goes nonstandard pc goes out and gets drunk the night before their motherinlaw comes to visit themsomething happens in their life dont you see they all of sudden come down with sciatica and you cant figure out why actually it turned out not to be sciatica but dose of fleas they got from their dog we dont care what it was the netthe net product here is the pc went nonstandard what do you do with nonstandard pc in standard session well you better send them to where they handle flat ball bearings lets not blame ourselves as to what happened lets just have the place where we handle the flat ball bearingthe qualification divisionlets have that very well functioning now the auditor himself ought to be able to know how to do one of these things not because hes going to do one in his standard sessioning because as the org grows up and as the ranks of welltrained auditors thin in the tech division theres going to obviously be need for more review auditors because youre only holding your tech line together by the dint of the factyou see now you can get veryyou can get almost sloppy because you know nothing is going to go wrong you can put anybody onto auditing practically by process of elimination why you will eventually get those off that shouldnt be there and those that are good will stay there dont you see but you should be able to do good review job good bangup review job which basically consists of hows your metering how can you assess you should know these zones but then of course if you dont know the pattern of an organization around these things then its great mystery why do you send anybody ever to ethics we shouldnt punish people god if i hear that one more time im going to pull somebodys rug out from underneath them who the hell is punishing people see were trying to make people well if youyou cant take highly enturbulated environmentits brutal to take highly enturbulated environment and try to push somebody through without ever trying to find out why or make them straighten out their environment what are we going to do with the guy just let him fall on his head if youve got technology out in an area you have to have some means of getting technology in otherwise you cant help anybody punish people if all justice had been with the same purity of scientology justice the universe would not now have to be completely overhauled by us of course i use that advisedly were not out on the big kick of course to take over this planet and take over the universe and that sort of thing because thatsthatd be pretty bad to do that were not on thiswere not on that kick you neednt worry about full conquest of the planet or something like that because frankly its nothing to worry about its just inevitable i wasthe old gag about the people that had this sector long time ago they used to call themselves the espinol united stars this quarter of the universe is ours they said it all in one breath and so forth the espinol united stars this quarter of the universe is ours and so forth so i thought for starter for starter why we ought to start somewhere up along the line in year or twoafter wed done it you see and so forthwe ought to start calling scientologynever call it just scientology see just use it all in one breath you seescientology this planet is ours see that would seem to to be an appropriate name because the funny part of it is you see nobodys taken any ownership of it you know nobody owns this planet its quite pathetic heres this planet lying here unowned people are always fighting to own it i think thats very silly why dont they just own it seems to to be much more direct but we would have to earn the right to say that in many ways and the way to earn the right to say that is just go on and do exactly what were doing right this minute and if an auditors an auditor why he ought to know these various sectors and actions and the organizational pattern weve got is working out man its just working out smooth as grease we keep on along the lines were going on right now it would inevitably happen and were on our way were on our way right this minute its mostly question of how fast do we make it or how slow do we make it and the extraordinary solutionany extraordinary solution put on the line is put on the line simply by the smallness of time still operating but anyway well try and get there before it all goes bang because i hate to see all thatall that plutonium and so forth wasted looks to to be terrific waste of the stuff because you see look at all the fresh water you could make out of sea water for angeles with it or something like that you know it has other uses other uses than surfeiting the appetites of the paranoids so i think well probably make it all right if we work hard but anyway i thought i ought to give you the word on what i considered wellrounded auditor was these days and exactly what you should be able to do in order to consider yourself well rounded and well put together and i want to thank you for your very good attention today and apologize to you for not having talked to you one of those weeks was mine oft the other one was pure pique against irs and so forth over in washington trying to seize scientology in the united states and i had to tell them and i told them and theyre told for the moment now i will draw deep breath and wind up some more steam and say little bit louder next time and then maybe they wont try again it isnt that theres huge trouble on the line its just that any time youre connected with suppressive you are to some degree potential trouble source so i didnt want to make potential trouble sources out of you last week thank you very much
