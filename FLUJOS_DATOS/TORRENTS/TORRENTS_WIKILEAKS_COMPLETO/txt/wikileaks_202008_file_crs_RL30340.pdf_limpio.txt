93 nonprofit co rporations listed in t itle 36 subtitle ii of the us code these socalled title 36 corporations such as the girl scouts of america and the national academy of public adminis tration are typically incorporated first under state law then request that congre ss grant them cong ressional or federal charter chartered corporations listed in title 36 are not agencies of the united states and the charter does not assign the corporat bodies any governmental attributes for instance the corporations debt is not guaranteed explicitly or implicitly by the full faith and credit of the united states the attraction of title 36 status for national organizations is that it tends to provide an official imprimatur to their activities and to that extent it may provide them prestige and indirect financial benefit in recent years some in congress have expressed concern that the public may be misled by its chartering process into believing that somehow the us government approves and supervises the corporations when in fact this is not the case as consequence the house judiciary committee decided upon moratorium on granting new charters the senate ge nerally defers to the house on chartering matters this moratorium has been reaffirmed by the committee at the beginning of each congress since on several recent occasions however congress has established title 36 corporations nonetheless in 1998 congress approved and the presid ent signed legislation recodifing title 36 of the code pl 105225 this revision did not substantively alter any of the provisions in title 36 rather the objective was to reorder and revise where necessary the wording of the provisions to better ensure consistency and readability this report will be updated at the beginning of each congress or to reflect

patriotic societies in this report the term title 36 corporation will be used although it should be noted that even within this category of organizations there are variations the united states constitution although not providing express power to congress to charter corporations is genera lly cited as the aut hority under article i section 8 clause 18 by which congress can pass all laws necessary and proper to implement the assigned expressed powers5 congress has authority to establish organizations within both the governmental and private sectors in the governmental sector the authority and responsibility to tablish all agencies and all offices to be filled by appointed officers of the united st ates is clear the permissible actions of all agencies and officers of the united states are determined by public law congress also has authority to tablish new forprofit and nonprofit organizations in the private sector cong ress for instance established the fully private stockholderowned communications sate llite corporation comsat in 1962 47 usc 701 76 stat 419 congressional authority with respect to organizations functioning essentially under state law how ever has not been free of controversy the basis of the controvers often comes down to fundame ntal issues of managerial accountability fiduciary responsibility and ri ghts that inhere to governmental organizations but not to private organizations such as the right to the full faith and credit of the us treasury6 title 36 corporations constitute one of the categories of corporate organizations chartered by congress7 it should be noted at the out set however that since 1994 the house judiciary committee has placed morato rium on the chartering of additional nonprofit corporate organizati ons position agreed to by the senate judiciary committee on four occasions since that time however the h ouse and senate have acted on their own plenary authority to ch arter such corporati ons additionally in 1997 the judiciary committees citing unus ual circumstances chartered two veterans organizations and then reasserted the moratoriumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30340crs3 historical and legal context there is general law of incorporation at the federal level as there is in the states and the district of columbia if congress wishes to establish or charter corporation it does so by enacting law and it is this specific legislation that provides for the mission authorities and restri ctions that will apply to the chartered corporation the general practice has been for each state and the district of columbia to exercise jurisdictional authority over th incorporation of for profit and nonprofit organizations within their boundaries this exercise of authority by states devolved from the concept that states had authority at common law to create artificial bodies for the purpose of engaging in various enterprises and carrying on certain activities historically state legislatures chartered each organization seeking corporate status on situationspecific basis in much the same way as the fede ral government does today as time passed states moved to provide for the creation of corporations pursuant to statutory procedures today states have general incorporation laws and ofte n separate laws for profit and nonprofit entities which stipulate proce dures information and standards to be met for the issuance of charter articles of incorporation fee is typically associated with the process corporations operating in the district of columbia are subject to the constitutional delegation of authority over the district of columbia as provided in article i section 8 of the united states constitution it was the practice of congress in the early years of the republic to grant franchises to district of columbia corporations on casebycase basis for example congress incorporated the trustees of the presbyterian congregati on in georgetown in 1806 2 stat 356 in 1901 congress enacted general statutory pr ocedure allowing incorporation in the district of columbia by means of filing paperwork rather than by special action of congress this procedure analogous to th at now used by the states is found in title 29 of the district of columbia code given that congress has ne ver passed general body of law applicable to the operation and powers of the forprofit nd nonprofit corporations it charters it is necessary for congress to include such provisions in each act granting charter there is considerable similarity between powers granted to federal corporations and those granted by states to their corpora tions among the powers typically provided are 1 to sue and be sued 2 to contract and be contracted with 3 to acquire hold and convey property 4 to enact bylaws 5 to have seal 6 to appoint officers and 7 to borrow money for the purposes of the corporationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30340crs4 8 see crs report rl33314 the congressional charter of the american national red cross overview hi story and analysis by kevin r kosarthere are also differences between federal charter and typical state charter one feature peculiar to federal charters is that in most instances statutes granting federal charters require the submission of periodic financ ial statements to congress on certain activities of the co rporation on the other nd states often permit actions that are not permitted federally chartere d corporations for instance under the district of columbia nonprofit act cor poration is permitted t lend money to and otherwise assist its employees other than its officers and directors dc code 29 301056 title 36 corporations can and genera lly do function simultaneously under both federal and state charters indeed in mo st instances organizations were chartered and functioned under state law be fore often long before r eceiving federal charters patriotic and national organizations subtitle ii the chartering by congress of organi zations with patriotic charitable historical educational or other eemosynary purpose is essentially 20th century practice title 36 of the us code where such corporate organizations are listed with their charters was revised in 1998 pl 105225 and in the process three subtitles of nonprofit corporate organizations were listed subtitle i patriotic and national observances and ceremonies part observances and ceremonies includes 1 the benjamin franklin tercentenary commission pl 107202 2 the brown v board of education 50th anniversary commission pl 10741 3 the jame s madison commemoration commission pl 106550 and 4 the abraham li ncoln bicentennial commission pl 106 173 part b united states government organizati ons involved with observances and ceremonies has three entries 1 the american battlefield monuments commission 2 the us holocaust memori council and 3 the presidents commission on employment of people with disabilities subtitle ii patriotic and national organizations the 93 corporate entries included under subtitle ii range from the agri cultural hall of fame to big brothers big sisters of america to the wo mens army corps ve terans association subtitle iii treaty obligation organizations this is an organizational category with one entry the american na tional red cross an rc which was first chartered in 1900 and then rechartered in 1905 the anrc is an unusual organization because the federal government has charged it with fulfilling us treaty obligations under the geneva conventions and aiding in disaster response8 the attraction of title 36 status for national organizations is that it tends to provide an official imprimatur to their activities and to that extent it may provide them prestige and indir ect financial benefithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30340crs5 9 there was an exception to the rule that congressional charters do not confer any governmental power upon or assign benefits to title 36 corporations the department of veterans affairs formerly had departmental rule that any veterans organization seeking free space and telephones in its facilities had to have congressional charter that requirement was removed in 1992 10 amy shipley senators scold usoc leader s congressional oversight urged as part of restructuring washington post january 29 2003 p d1 case could be made that the us olympic committee is misplaced being in subtitle ii its legal status and international responsibilities arguably make it similar to the anrc which is found in subtitle iiicongress in chartering patriotic ch aritable professiona l and educational organizations under subtitle ii such as the national academy of public administration 36 usc 1501 does not make these organizations agencies of the united states or confer any powers of governmental character or assign any benefits9 these organization generally do not receive direct appropriations they exercise federal powers their debts are not covered by the full faith and credit of the united states and they do not enjoy orig inal jurisdiction in the federal courts in effect the federal chartering proce ss is honorific in character this honorific character may be misleading to the public however when such organizations feature statements or display logos that they are chartered by congress thus implying direct relationship to the fede ral government that does not in fact exist in addition there may be an implication that congre ss approves of the organizations and is somehow overseeing its activities which is not the case as with nearly all generalizations about congressionally chartered nonprofit organizations there are exceptions at least one of these nonprofits receives much congressional attention of its management the us olympic committee 36 usc 2005 in early 2003 the senate co mmerce committee held hearings on reorganizing the usoc10 governmental or private while it is correct to state that the congressionally chartered nonprofit organizations in title 36 are not agencies of the united states there are instances when the boundary between the private and g overnmental sectors ar blurred at best it is possible to argue that at least in few instances the private character of the title 36 corporation is reasonably in question for many years the department of defense administered the civilian marksmanship program the program came under political pressures for various reasons and the department decided to re quest congress to privatize the program which congress agreed to in creating federally chartered corporation titled corporation for the promotion of rifle practice and firearms safety 36 usc 40701 this privatization exercise raises questions about the limits if any to congresss authority to assign privat label to functions of governmental character while the corporation has some admittedly governmental attributes eg upon dissolution of the corporati on its assets are to be so ld and revert to the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30340crs6 11 the supreme court in 1995 case michael lebron v national railway passenger corporation 513 us 374 addressed the question of wh ether congress can declare by statutory language that corporation created by congress and assigned attributes of the state is private corporation the na tional railway passenger corporation amtrak established by congress 45 usc 451 and enumerated as mixedownership corporation under 31 usc 91012 was sued by michael lebron for rejecting on political grounds an advertising sign he had c ontracted with them to display lebron claimed that his first amendment rights had been abridged by amtrak because it is government corporation and therefore an agen cy of the united states amtrak argued on the other hand that its legislation provides that it will not be an agency or establishment of the united states government and thus is not subject to constitutional provisions governing freedom of speech the court decided that while congress can determine amtraks governmental status for purposes within congresss control eg whether it is subject to statutes such as the administ rative procedure act congress cannot make the final determination of amtraks status as government entity for purposes of determining constitutional rights of citizens affected by its actions treasury congress has declared in its enabling statute that the corporation is private corporation not department ag ency or instrumentality of the us government furthermore the law provi des that an officer or employee of the corporation is not an officer or employee of the governme nt whether congress has the constitutional authority to assign an entity private status when in fact it has substantial governmental attributes s been subject to debate and judicial opinion11 in the 106th congress new entry was included in part b of subtitle ii of title 36 the national recording preservati on foundation foundation the background for this foundation requires some expl anation national recording registry established under public law 106474 2 usc 1701 is to be housed in the library of congress and managed by the librar ian of congress through an adjunct organization of the library titled the national recording preservation board board this board consists of 17 members select ed by the librarian from the organizations listed in the statute personnel working fo r the board are appointed by the librarian and are employees of the united states additionally the statute provided for the establishment of national recording preservation foundation foundation as title 36 nonprofit cor poration chapter 1524 not to be considered as an agency or establishment of the united states the purpose of the foundation is to accept and admin ister private gifts to the board the board of the foundation consists of nine members selected by the librarian with the latter serving in an exofficio capacity the foundation is governed by its own by laws the librarian appoints secretary of the board who serves as the executive director officers of the foundation are appointed and removed by the board of directors while the secret ary appoints and removes em ployees the foundation has the usual powers of corporation acting as trustee in the district of columbia the us government is not liable for any bts defaults acts or omissions of the corporation yet the foundation is authorized to directly receive appropriated funds the foundation and its relationship to the board and to the librarian of congress may raise questions as to how privat the foundation actually is at minimumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30340crs7 the foundation represents something of departure from the us ual title 36 nonprofit corporation another departure from the usual t itle 36 nonprofit corpor ation model was forthcoming in the 107th congress with its approval of the national help america vote foundation the foundation is ch aritable and nonprofit corporation and is not an agency or establishment of the u s government 36 usc 1526 116 stat 1717 the foundation which carries out its statutory mandate in consultation with the chief election officials of the several states receives its f unding through direct appropriations although it must follow pr ovisions of number of federal laws it is nonetheless to act as trustee under di strict of columbia law which permits it among other things to borrow money and i ssue instruments of indebtedness all of which suggests questions regarding who is ultimately responsible for the indebtedness is the nationa l help america vote foundati on really private with the right to declare bankruptcy those private nonprofit organizations s eeking federal charters under title 36 presumably perceive value behind such ch arters and indeed such may be the case less recognizable however are the risk s to private nonprofit organizations of having charter chartered private orga nization may lose some of its private rights and be made subject to mana gement laws and regulations generally applicable only to agencies of the united states such situation came about in 1997 when congress amended the federal advisory committee ac t 5 usc appendix 86 stat 700 so as to include two title 36 corporations the national academy of public administration and the national academ of sciences under specific provisions involving the appointment permissible activities and reports of corporation committees doing work for execu tive agencies pl 105153 this is the first instance in which congress has made title 36 subtitle ii corporations subject to the provisions of general management law and while the action may be supportable on public policy grounds it does to the extent of the applicable provisions diminish the private character of the affected organizations as such it constitutes precedent with implications congressional procedures corporate charters are granted in law by act of congress the procedure for the grant begins like any other act of congress with the introduction of bill by member of either the house of representa tives or the senate bills proposing title 36 corporate bodies are generally referred to the judiciary committees of each house if the measure is reported out of committee and approved by that house it is sent to the other house for approval and then on to the president for signature whereupon it becomes law prior to 1965 requests for congressional ch arters were considered on caseby case basis without standards or criteria for incorporation that year president lyndon johnson vetoed hr 339 89th congress bill that would have granted corporate charter to the youth councils on civil affa irs in his veto message presidenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30340crs8 12 copy of the veto message is printed as hdoc 292 89th cong 1st sess washington gpo 1965 p 1 13 us congress house committee on the judiciary standards for granting of federal charters to nonprofit corporations committee print 91st cong 1st sess washington gpo 1969johnson raised several questions about the wi sdom of continuing to grant charters on casebycase basis without the benefit of clearly established criteria as to eligibility in the presidents veto message to congress he noted for some time i have been concerned with the question of whether we are granting federal charters to private organizations on casebycase basis without the benefit of clearly established standa rds and criteria as to eligibility worthy civic patriotic and philanthropic orga nizations can and do incorporate their activities under state law it seems obvious that federal charters should be granted if at all only on selective basis and that they should meet some national interest standard12 the president requested in his veto message that the two judiciary committees conduct comprehensive study on the entir matter various proposals had been made over the years to adopt federal stat utory procedures for chartering nonprofit organizations but congre ss remained unpersuaded in 1969 in response to the presidents request subcommittees of both the house and senate judiciary committees jointly agreed to statement of policy standards for granting of federal charters this statement set forth five minimum standards to be met by private or ganization seeking federal charter from congress any private organization petitioning cong ress for the purpose of obtaining the status of federal corporation shall be required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of congress that it is an organization which is 1 operating under charter granted by state or the district of columbia and that it has so operated for sufficient period of time to demonstrate its permanence and that its activities are clearly in the public interest 2 of such unique character that chartering by the congress as federal corporation is the only appropr iate form of incorporation 3 organized and operated solely for charitable literary educational scientific patriotic and civil improvement purposes 4 organized and operated as nonpartisan and nonprofit organization and 5 organized and operated for the primary purpose of conducting activities which are of national scope and responsive to national need which need cannot be met except upon the issuance of federal charter13 the status of private nonprofit organi zation receiving federal charter does not appear to be substantially different from that of similar organization incorporated under state law under the congressional standards agreed to in 1969httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30340crs9 14 bankers trust company v texas and pacific railroad company 241 us 295 36 sct 569 60 led 1010 1916 15 harris v american

promotion of rifle practice and firearms safety created in 1996 by congress and not incorporated first in state is exempted 40707 from the audit requirements 18 in the 104th congress the subcommittee on immigration and claims became responsible for congressionally chartered organizations taking jurisdiction from the former subcommittee on administrative law and government relations in the 108th congress the title of this subcommittee was changed to subcommittee on immigration border security and claims it became minimum requirement that organizations seeking federal charter demonstrate that they have been functi oning properly under state charter and that their activities are clearly in the public inte rest however there are two elements of federal charter that appear to create some legal differences between federally chartered corporations and similar corporate bodies func tioning solely under state charters first there is matter of the citizen ship of the corporation generally corporations chartered by states are deemed to have citizenship in the state of establishment corporate body created by congress however may be designated as citizen of the united states for judicial purposes14 the latter rule has been supported in at least one instance involving title 36 corporation in that case the american legion was held not to be citizen of any state for the purposes of invoking diversity of citizenship jurisdiction under 28 usc 1332a115 further congress can itself provide for federal judicial jurisdiction in the charter16 second b ecause federal charters are laws of the united states they may only be amended by another law of the united states if an organization seeks to alter its primary purpose or change provision in its charter even minor provision it must return to congress and subject its request to the full legislative process while the process is generally routine there are occasions when making even minor legislative changes in the charter may open the orga nizations to challenge from the outside oversight of chartered corporations at present federal supervision of congressionally chartered nonprofit organizations is limited all private corporations blished under federal law as defined and listed in subtitle ii are required to have independent udits annually and to have the reports of the audits submitted to congress 36 usc 1010117 in practice the subcommittee on citizenship refugees border security and international law18 receives the audit reports of ll listed corporations and where corporations have not submitted reports in timely manner makes every effort to communicate with said organizations and remind them of their legal responsibilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30340crs10 19 see for instance us general accounting

pentagon to ban for three years agents of academy life insurance company from selling insurance on military bases the pentagon charged that academy life agents routinely presented themselves as impartial financial counselors with the nonprofit congressionally chartered non commissioned continuedmost of the corporations take this re sponsibility seriously and submit the necessary reports the house judiciary committee refers all received audits to the government accountability office gao for review19 the committees current role is strictly ministerial gao official testifie d on its review procedures in 1975 our reviews of the reports are generally restricted to desk review unless serious questions or problems arise when th is occurs we contact the independent public accountant or the organization fo r clarification the purpose of our review is to determine whether in our professional judgement the reports meet the standards for reporting set forth in law the major problems noted by us to date have been 1 lack of timely submission of reports 2 lack of sufficient expl anations in the report 3 financial statements which do not meet the stipulat ed requirements of law 4 audits not conducted by independent certified public accountants and 5 in some few cases failure to follow genera lly accepted auditing standards20 in addition corporate bodies are require d to make annual reports of their activities to the congress21 public access to the reco rds and reports of title 36 corporations varies for example the charter of the national ski patrol system 36 usc 1527 requires that its annual report be submitted each year to congress but prohibits the public printing of it trad itionally the senate judiciary committee has deferred to the house committee on these matters it is not the intention of the judiciary committees of congress or the government accountability office to look over the shoulder of these organizations or to conduct audits on their own authority congress is understandably ambivalent with respect to these chartered organizations on the one hand it attempts to protect th public interest against buse by those corporate bodies while simultaneously seeking to limit its involve ment in the internal affairs of these private organizations thus far in instance has the charter of title 36 corporations been revoked although there ve been several cont roversies in recent years involving chartered organizations and the chartering process generally22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30340crs11 22 continued officers association ncoa not as

scouts of amer ica were within their first amendment rights as private organization to excl ude from leadership position person who was in fundamental disagreement with its pur poses as an organization in this case the facts were that the boy scouts of america removed from an assistant scout master position oung man who professed and prac ticed homosexual lifestyle the national organization argued that this individual whatever his personal merits had right to hold leadership position in an organization which disavowed that lifestyle the individual involved james dale and some suppor ting organizations argued that as assistant scout master dale had performed his assigned responsibilities well and that his lifestyle irrespective of bein g contrary to one of the purposes of the organization was not gitimate grounds to deny him position of leadership to do so denied dale his rights under new jerseys public accommodations law the issue dales attorneys argued was not constitutional first amendment question several members of congre ss introduced legislation hr 4892 to repeal the federal charter of the boy scouts agains t the wishes of its sponsors however motion was brought to suspend the rules an action that would pave the way for vote in the house the tactic intended to put members on record as favoring or opposing the bill without having to vote di rectly the motion failed 12362 thereby supporting the supreme court decision and pr esumably the chartering of the boy scouts of america23 during this debate the character and utility of the chartering

in the early 1970s indicat ed an increasing leve l of dissatisfaction by members of congress respecting the intent and practice of congressional chartering of private nonprofit organi zations more organizations through sympathetic members of congress were requesting charters and the requesting organizations were often extending the definition of congressionally chartered corporations beyond that typically ssociated with patriotic and service organizations28 in april 1992 chairman barney frank announced that the house subcommittee on administrative law and government rela tions would longer consider requests for charters the reason frank said was that the charters were nuisance ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30340crs13 29 bill mcallister congressional charters abolished laws recognizing organizations seen as meaningless nuisance washington post april 9 1992 p 25 30 in the 110th congress the subcommittee on immigration citizenship refugees border security and international law has jurisdicti on of legislation on federal charters see httpjudiciaryhousegovaboutsubcommitteehtml 31 the moratorium is not to be found in the ru of the subcommittee rather the practice has been for the subcommittee move to adopt policy of not granting new charters and then to vote to approve this policymeaningless act granting charters implied that congress was exercising some sort of supervision over the groups and it was not when i first raised the issue what is federal charter the answer was federal charter is federal charter is federal charter you coul d make up an organization for the preservation of albert desalvo the boston strangler wed have way of checking into it29 moreover the subcommittee understood that the committee could be drawn into public disputes touched off by any controversial activities or statements by title 36 corporation or employees or members thereof continuing to review applications on the basis of merit with the possibility of rejection it was asserted was subjecting the subcommittee to pressures and the potential for embarrassment to both the request er and congress by indicating an end altogether of the practice of charteri ng it was hoped the subcommittee also would be leveling the playing field among worthy organizations this view was formalized in the 104th congress when the subcommittee decided that it would longer consider any legislation to grant new federal charters because such charters were unnecessary for the operations of any charitable nonprofit organization and falsely implied to the public that chartered organization and its activities somehow carried congressional seal of approval this moratorium has been continued by the house subcommittee of jurisdiction30 in each subsequent congress most recently on june 6 200731 this subcommittee moratorium did not however stop all requests for or consideration of charter requests tably it remains possible for another committee or for the full congress in its plenary capacity to charter nonprofit organizations and have them listed in title 36 indeed this has been the case in several instances in recent years in 1996 the fleet reserve association was chartered 110 stat 2760 without the legi slation being referred to the judiciary committees of the respective chambers also in recent years corporate bodies eg corporation for promotion of rifle prac tice and firearms safety 36 usc 40701 national recording preservation foundati on 36 usc 152401 have been created by congress and listed by the house offi ce of law revision counsel under title 36 in the 105th congress the moratorium notw ithstanding two additional nonprofit organizations were chartered each cas represented specific and unusual set of circumstances in the first session the senate committee on arme d forces approved bill one provision of which chartered the air force sergeants association afsa this charter proposal had not been refe rred to the judiciary committees for their review and approval when the bill reached conference the jurisdictional issues were raised and negotiate d settlement reached afsa would receive its charter inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30340crs14 32 hrept 105340 sec 1085 b reads findings congress finds that the practice of providing by statute federal charters to certain nonprofit organizations 1 may be perceived as implying government imprimatur of approval of those organizations and 2 may mistakenly lead to public perception that the united states ensures the integrity and worthiness of those organizations b sense of congress it is the sense of congress 1 that because of the perceive d implicit government imprimatur of approval conveyed by enactment of federal charter for an organization such charter should be granted only in the rarest and most extraordin ary cases and 2 that statutory federal charter should be enacted after the enactment of this act unless the charter is approved by congress upon favorable report by the committees of jurisdiction of the respective housesthis instance pl 10585 36 usc 20201 but the jurisdictional authority of the judiciary committees and thus the moratorium was reaffirmed32 in the second session of the 105th congress bill to award charter to the american gi forum was approved this time with the approval of the judiciary committees in this instance the circumst ances involved an act of discouragement by the committee toward wouldbe charte r applicant under the rules followed prior to 1989 the organization believed that it d been improperly informed and unfairly evaluated during its earlier application nd deserved to be reconsidered for chartering the committee permitted the organization to make its case and concluded that due to exceptional circumstances an exemption from the moratorium was warranted in this instance and thus charter was granted pl 105231 36 usc 21001 despite the moratorium congress charte red another veterans group the korean war veterans associated incorporated in 2008 pl 110254 hr 2852 was introduced by representative steny hoye r on june 25 2007 the bill was referred to the house subcommittee on immigration c itizenship refugees border security and international law which took action on it senator benjamin l cardin introduced s 1692 on the same date s 1692 was referred to the senate committee on the judiciary which reported it favorab ly on september 7 2007 five days later the senate passed s 1692 by unanimous consent s 1692 was received in the house of representatives on september 14 2007 nd held at the desk on june 17 2008 s 1692 was passed by voice vote under susp ension of rules president george w bush signed it on june 30 2008 conclusion the congressional practice of charte ring selected private nonprofit organizations that engage in patriotic char itable historical and educational activities was 20th century phenomenon the chartering process itself tends to send mixed signals to the public although the charter does not award any material governmental status to the nonprofit corporation eg right of eminent domain there is an understandable assumption on the part of the public that somehow the charter signifies us government approval of the corporations activities and that the corporation is being supervised neither assumption is meritedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30340crs15 the house judiciary committee the key committee in the process after some years of experience and several hearings concluded that the chartering process served useful public purpose and issued formal moratorium on requests for charters in 1992 it remains possible however for another committee or the full congress to bypass the judiciary committees and initiate on their own the approval process for chartering nonprofit organizati on this bypass strategy for chartering title 36 corporations has b een successfully pursued conc luding with presidential public law signature on severa l occasions in recent years partly in response to these actions with each new congress th house judiciary committee has reaffirmed its moratorium on approval of charters it remains to be seen however how effective this moratorium will be against the many attractions of the chartering practicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30340crs16 appendix title 36 subtitle ii patriotic and national organizations part b organizations
