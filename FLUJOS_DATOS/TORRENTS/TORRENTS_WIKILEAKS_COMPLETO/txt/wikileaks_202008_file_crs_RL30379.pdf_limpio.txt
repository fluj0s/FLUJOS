could be transferred to japan south korea and taiwan it summari zes the dod report and for clarification some of its unstated assumptions it further analyz policy implications of the reports findings and assumptions and outlines us options for missile defense in east asia because the dod report is unclassified written on tight time deadline and limited in scope it does not address certain key issues that are raised and discussed here the ability of these systems to defend against all missile threats remains stionable and it is not clear what would be required to link three separate systems for ja pan south korea and taiwan into regional system dod was not asked to address political strategic or economic issues but this crs report identifies several such issues that emer ge as possible topics for further congressional examination for more information on related legislation see crs issue brief ib98028 theater ballistic missile defense this crs report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379missile defense options for japan south korea and taiwan review of the defense department report to congress summary the fy 1999 national defense authoriz ation act pl 105261 required the secretary of defense to study the us missile defense systems that could protect and could be transferred to ja pan south korea and taiwan the secretary was directed to describe these missile defense systems nd the factors used in the study in separate classified and unclassified reports to congress in may 1999 the department of defense dod transmitted the unclassified report which provides discussion of five missile defense systems that are cu rrently being developed by the united states and could be provided to japan the republic of korea and taiwan systems similar to the us patriot pac3 navy area fense nad theater high altitude area defense thaad and navy theater wide ntw phase i with standard missile3 block i and phase ii with standard miss ile3 block ii the report weighed various combinations of these systems stating wh at number of missile defense units could reasonably be expected to provide ar ea coverage agai nst limited attack dods analysis of the individual characteristics and limitations of the five systems showed they would provide different results for different areas for japan an option like ntw block ii proved best the differi ng geography of south korea and the threat it faces indicated combinati on of thaadlike and pac3like systems would be most effective according to the dod report taiwan could be protected by one system similar to thaad ntw block i or ntw block ii however taiwans defense may well require combination of lowertier systems like pac3 or nad and uppertier systems like ntw b lock i or ii or thaad for layered defenses information in the dod report was cons trained because it was unclassified the reporting requirement was narrow and dod had relatively little time to complete the study the dod report focuses on the tmd re quirements for covera ge of particular areas considering the minimum number of firing units needed for maximum coverage it therefore remains unclear how well these us tmd systems would protect east asia against the missiles of north korea and china for instance the report does not explain the net capabilities of the defense systems against fast missiles lowflying missiles large num ber of missiles ssiles carrying weapons of mass destruction wmd or missiles with penetration aids multiple warheads or submunitions some of these issues re late to the different perspectives among foreign leaders as well as us citizens as to the technical distinctions between strategic missiles and theater missiles and between national missile defense and theater missile defense it was also beyond the scope of report requirements to evaluate the international political strategic and tactical military or foreign and domestic economic advisability of transferring particular missile defense units to japan south korea or taiwan in contex t broader than that presented by the dod report there are issues and options concerning alternative ways in which the united states could provide missile defense to ea st asia for instance it could unilaterally deploy tmd systems with us troops in asia sell tmd systems to one or more parties or codevelop and coproduce tmd or nmd systems with one or more allies or friendshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379contents v r v i w f t h d p r t m n t f d f n s r p r t 1 l g i s l t i v r q u i r m n t 1 s u m m r f t h d d r p r t

report lists number of options with each option stating what number of missile defense units of which type could reasonably be expected to provide area coverage for each defended area against limited attack by the different types of tbms likely to be arrayed against it3 in describing their technical methodology the authors of the report state the report quantifies the architecture force structure needed to provide coverage against specific theater ballistic missile threats to most of the territories for japan south korea and taiwan this defense also provides protection of the critical assets identified by the us intelligence community4 the report stressed that potential recipients would also need source of early warning such as combination of overhead surveillance and long range phased array early warning radars and communication system to determine the number of tmd units needed by each country dod used the following methodology chose potential launch sites of various types of theater ballistic missiles overlaid grid on the map of each defended territory estimated the required tmd systems and deployed them on the map portrayed the ability of threatening missiles to strike each grid ofdefended territory determined if deployed tmd systems could intercept missiles andprotect grids repeated the process to achieve the greatest defended area withfewest tmd unitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs3 5 the report and theater missile defense tmd and east asia tmd briefing for congressional research service ballistic missile defense organization march 18 1999department of defense fficials point out that the options discussed in the report are illustrative architectures based on each countrys unique politi cal and threat environment the report is not intended to be comprehensive analysis of tmd in the region the report does not suggest or imply regionwide architecture network the report does not advocate recommend deployment of any specific tmd architecture because the focus of this study is possible tmd architecture itdoes not address their feasibility or desirability from political economic or other security perspectives 5 analysis of the dod report and issues beyond its scope the following sections analyze and discuss the general approach and assumptions of the dod repor t and particular aspects of the report that apply to japan the republic of korea and taiwan in the process this paper raises some issues important to asian ssile defense that were c onsidered to be beyond the scope of the dod report this paper will then discuss tmd options for each of the three potential recipients discuss implications of the dod findings review additional issues for us cooperation in regional tmd and list options that are available to the united states tmd system requirements the dod report provides useful analys is of the types and numbers of tmd systems that would be required to cover th areas of japan south korea and taiwan it demonstrates that the unique geographic characteristics of the three and the threats posed against them lead to different tmd requirements it also points out some of the limitations of the tmd systems that were considered the limited nature of the reporting requirement the short time allowed the security classification of specific characteristics and capabilities of the tmd systems the political sensitivity of regional missile defense cooperation and other factors prevented dod from discussing some ot her related issues what are limited ballistic missile attacks the term limited ballistic miss ile attacks is ambiguous as to the nature and scope of the limitations in the debate on national missile defense the term is used with reference to unauthorized or accidental attacks by major power or attacks of the type and scale considered possible for new missile powers such attacks wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs4 6 bmdo interviewpresumably consist of fewer than 200 wa rheads and might not include sophisticated penetration aids the dod report does not use this meaning of the term but considers limited missile attacks against japan south korea and taiwan to be attacks by few less than five missiles with ranges and speeds less than those of icbms ie with ranges and speeds of tactical or theater ballistic missiles6 the dod report considers theater ballistic missiles to be those with rang less than 3500 km 2170 for this report dod also limits the threat to missiles with conventional warheads not nuclear biological or che mical conventional warheads are often much larger and heavier than warheads designed to deliver weapons of mass destruction wmd if the defense department d included missiles armed with nuclear warheads for instance some missiles woul d have had longer ranges and faster speeds and would have been more difficult to intercept with tmd system the report also does not consider missiles with penetration aids countermeasures or altered trajectories all of which would have decreased the effectiveness of the tmd options presented there are clearly benefits but also risks of designing system to defend against such limited ballistic missile attack but not against more robust attack some analysts consider this limited threat more plausible than some more sophisticated options the nature of the threat is discussed further in the country sections of this report the extent to which the attack is limited is key to findings of effectiveness of the missile defenses considered so it is important for all policy makers to agree on the meaning of the term limited ballistic missile attacks key issues regarding the threat several aspects of the future missile threat have received only limited attention in public re porting and the dod report does fill these gaps what types of missiles with what characteristics are likely to threaten japan south korea and taiwan in the year 2008 how many missiles might be launc hed against japan south korea or taiwan simultaneously at what rate will potentially hostile countries be able to launch missile s and how long are they likely to be able to sustain missile attacks these factors are important because missile defense systems are limited on the number of hostile missiles they can engage at once and over time will the missile systems of po tentially hostile countries have penetration aids such as chaff decoys infrared emitters jamming equipment multiple reentry vehicles or submunitions what warheads will the hostile missiles likely deliver could north korea use irbms and icbms on high lofted trajectory against south korea or japan in order to achieve higher speed reentry or on fast and low trajectory that tmd systems may not be able to intercepthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs5 7 crs analysts compiled the table based on unc lassified reports of the government public media and institutional data baseswill north korea be able to

ballistic missile capabilities and limitations of us tmd systems the dod report describes some of the characteristics of the various tmd systems and their ability to cover the terrain with some degree of protecti on it is constrained by its unclassified status limited time and international political sensitivities and therefore does not describe the detailed capabilities of the missile defense systems it considers for use by ja pan south korea and taiwan reader cannot determine how well th illustrative tmd systems would defend the potential recipients because the dod report does not indicate what specific missiles each tmd system is expected to be capable of defeating nor generally what types of missiles with what speeds ranges trajectories warhead s and penetration aids where the tmd units would be located especially the ship positionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs8 8 according to dod officials the guidance syst em would have to be altered to set the missile on depressed course and the missile body and reentry vehicle would have to be altered to withstand greater forces and heat genera ted while traveling in the atmospherewhat precise geographic area each tmd system is capable of defending how many incoming missiles each system could track and defeat atone time how quickly the system can be reloaded how secure each system is from emy attack and countermeasures or what percent of incoming missiles is likely to be defeated by thetmd systems described or asked another way what the probability is that all incoming missiles would be defeated the report and other dod sources i ndicate ntw can intercept only those missiles flying at more than 100 km ltitude and that thaad can in tercept only those missiles flying at altitudes of at least 40 km using maximum range trajectory ballistic missiles with rang of 300 km or less will have maximum altitude well below 100 km usin g depressed trajectory described at pages 11 and 12 short and medium range missiles may be able to reach some targets without exceeding maximum altitude of 40 km therefore it may be possible for some theater ballistic missiles to fl under the coverage of the upper tier systems if they do not have to fly long distances in the rela tively heavy atmosphere however if north korea or china were to depress the traj ectory of srbms or mrbms they would have to redesign the guidance and control systems the structural components and the reentry vehicle 8 as discussed elsewhere tmd systems also have very limited capability against fast longrange missiles such as icbms there are differing views on the issues of saturation and exhaustion of tmd systems many analysts have raised cerns about the large i nventories of missiles and missile launchers being accumulated by north korea and china as well as several middle eastern countries they ar gue that simultaneous attack by scores of missiles on relatively small target area could overwhelm saturate allied missile defenses and that over time the supply of defensive missiles c ould be exhausted in attempting to intercept all the incoming missiles some calculations by dod refute this contention multiplelayer missile fense using series of upper tier tmds in shoot look shoot engagement nd salvo of lower tier tmds would minimize the enemys ability to destroy target even if it launched large number of missiles simultaneously therefore an attacking force would require very large number of missiles and launchers to mount an effectiv missile attack and may well be deterred from doing so by the presence of an effective missile defense system enemy decoys and countermeasures could increase the number of interceptors required for an adequate defense offe nsive and defensive missile systems will continue to evolve and the balance between them will be difficult to judge at least until the specific systems have been produced and tested in realistic combat environmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs9 9 ballistic missile defense organization theater missile defense tmd and east asia tmd briefing for congressional research service march 18 1999 10 some transfers might be prohibited by th missile technology control regime mtcr or the antiballistic missile abm treaty or constrained by other factorsthree tmd systems versus regional missile defense system the legislation called for study of theater ballistic missile defense system in the asiapacific region that would have the capability to protect key regional allies of the united states the requirement coul d have been interpreted to call for study of single integrated regional tmd system dod officials have stated they did not suggest or imply regionwide architecture network9 for several reasons the dod report considered sepa rate systems for japan korea nd taiwan according to the report the study was based on the unique political and military threat environment confronting each one p 4 also if dod had discussed an integrated regional program it would have risk ed damaging us japane korean and taiwanese relations with china while at the same time raising extensive technical and political issues involved in making the vari ous command control and communication systems interoperable japan korea and taiwan pparently have plans to cooperate with each other in developing or acquiring missile defense systems indeed they have little cooperation in any area of national secu rity in august 1999 japan and korea conducted their first combined naval exerci but the lack of current cooperation would not necessarily preclude the united states from transferring some tmd assets to each recipient then integrating them w ith us early warnin g satellites and radars communications battle management and firing units to establish missile defense system that could span the region10 however it would be political necessary for japan south korea and taiwan to agree to this integration the united states already shares early warning data with japan but it is unclear that japan could currently apply it to tmd system in summary the development of re gional system would raise number of political and economic issues as well as military and technical issues but might produce more effective and efficient missile defense than would the three separate systems additional resources might be required to form regional tmd network or savings might be achieved by sharing certain systems and capabilities when integrating three separate systems into regional system many of these issues are beyond the scope of the study requirement and the dod re port but are raised in the three sections of this report on japan sout h korea and taiwan and in the section on us considerations in cooperative missile defense in its future deliberations it will be important for congress to know if there are fundamental problems that render regional missile defense infeasible impractical or unaffordable as well as if there are significant bene fits of regi onal cooperationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs10 11 ministry of foreign affairs spokesman numata said the americans call it theater missile defense tmd we call it ballistic missile defe nse bmd there is difference there in the sense that the united states tends to think of it in theaterwide terms whereas we think of it purely in the context of the defense of japan for the purpose of selfdefense march 2 1999 chinese and russian officials have co mplained that tmd systems in asia may degrade their strategic deterrence or violate the abm treaty 12 many analysts contend that ntw with dditional sensors for early warning and long range tracking would be able to intercept icbmsus missile defense systems that were not evaluated while section 1533a of the reporting requirement calls for study of the architecture requirements for the establishment and operation of theater ballistic missile defense system in the asiapacific region that would have the capability to protect key regional allies of the united states s ection 1533b1c states the report shall include description of any united states missile defense system currently deployed or under development that could be transferred to key allies of the united states in the asiapacific region to provide for their selfdefense against limited ballistic missile attacks based on its reading of the legislative requirement dod studied only us theater missile defense systems and therefore limited its discussion to systems similar to five primary us tmd weapon programs pac3 nad thaad ntw phase i and ntw phase ii because section 1533b1c refers to any us missile defense system some may suggest that additional us missile defense system s and programs should be considered such as airborne laser abl however according to dod the abl or spacebased laser sbl systems are not being considered for transfer out of the united states and for that reason and because of time c onstraints were not included in the study because the legislation calls for study of any us missile defense system to provide key allies with defense against limited ballistic missile attacks it may have been appropriate to consider systems that would protect japan republic of korea and taiwan against all classes of missiles rather than just some classes of missiles because the territories are relatively small and relatively close to the likely attacking countries some may have assumed that theater missile defense systems are effectively national missile defense systems and w ould protect these countries against all or most ballistic missile attacks japanese chinese and russian officials have indicated confusion over the terms or over the capabilities of tmd systems11 actually japan south korea and taiwan could be attacked by intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms as well as by intermediaterange mediumrange and shortrange ballistic missiles tmd systems generally are not considered effective against icbms because of the speed of the attacking missiles the united states plans not to test its tmd systems against targets traveling faster than 5 kmsec or with ranges greater than 3500 km so will not be confident of their effectiveness against icbms12 see page 14 for further di scussion when the us national missile defense nmd system is develo ped it may have the technology that if transferred or extended could protect japa n south korea and taiwan against all limited missile attacks not only does the dod report exclude discussion of certain missile defense systems abl and nmd it also does not discuss the vulnerabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs11 of japan south korea and taiwan to att ack by highspeed missiles such as icbms after the hypothetical acquisition of the tmd systems discussed how are the examples different from us tmd systems the report indicates the illustrative tmd systems are similar to us systems under development but it does not say how they might differ from us systems dod officials explained that they used the illustrative systems in the unclassified report because the precise characteristics and capabil ities of the tmd systems are classified and because of the little time that was available to coordinate the report throughout dod they also stated the ch aracteristics of the illustrative systems were relatively close to those of the systems be ing developed by the united states and that differences did not have profound ffect on the results of the study how would usdeployed tmd contribute to asian defense any tmd systems the united states deploys now or in the future with its ground sea and air forces in asia and the pacific are likely to contribute to missile defense of the region us tmd systems deployed in or near japan south korea and taiwan could provide th em some missile defense and the tmd systems they acquire could contribute to the defense of us forces whether one is studying regionwide system or three separate systems the effect s of relevant us missile defense systems fit the context of discussion what territory would be considered protected the dod report describes the tmd system s required to protect japan south korea and taiwan but does not clarify what territory would be protected the report and dod briefing materials imply that the study refers to tmd systems that would protect the four largest islands of ja pan but not necessarily the entire ryukyu archipelago sakishimagunto the archipelago that stretches almost to taiwan senkaku islands iwo jima io to or the ogasawara bonin islands the systems discussed for the defense of taiwan appa rently do not protect the islands off the chinese mainland particularly quemoy and matsu that are within artillery range of the mainland the systems described for south korea may or may not protect the islands cheju do or ullung do and accord ing to the report would not protect seoul from all north korean missiles if all th territories of the three countries are included the coverage of south koreas and taiwans tmd systems would probably overlap with japans and might benefit from coordina tion through regional tmd system how would tmd affect the regional military balance although tmd systems are inherently defensive they can also affect regional military balance by reducing the effectiveness of othe r countries deterrent and offensive combat capabilities the tmd systems may also provide missile technology and command control co mmunication and ba ttle management technology that the recipients could pply to their offensive capabilities an imbalance could lead to an arms race including missiles missile defenses wmdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs12 13 dod doctrine for joint theater missile defense joint pub 3015 february 22 1996 14 in response to north koreas august 31 1998 ballistic missile shot over japan sadaaki numata spokesman for japans foreign ministry said we are seriously concerned about this because the deployment of missiles by north korea does affect japanese security and it also affects peace and stability in northeast asia new york times september 1 1998and advanced conventional weapons china and north korea are particularly concerned that regional tmd and us nmd will threaten their security systems russia is also concerned about the effect of us nmd on its strategic forces therefore some us analysts think missile defense can be destabilizing some analysts suggest that by encouraging japan and south korea to acquire missile defense systems to counter north korean missiles the united states is undercutting its own efforts to persuade pyongyang to re linquish its long range missiles regional tmd efforts according to these analysts send signals of containment and military supremacy while us diplomatic efforts ar trying to draw north korea into normal relations others insist tmd will deter or defeat missile attacks and are therefore stabilizing other countries in their view should not be offended by our defenses such factors were not within the scope of the dod report but may be of interest to congress as it considers the advisability of supporting regional tmd programs how do tmd options suggested compare to other options the five missile defense options discu ssed in the mandated dod report address only one aspect of

the extensive ballistic missile inventory of the peoples republic of china too is potential threat to japan officially the japanese leadership has not made any public statements suggesting any connection between chinas ballistic missiles and tokyos current interests in tmd16 however security specialist with the institute of international policy studi in tokyo believes that north korea provides good excuse for tmd but as matter of fact the primary target is china17 china has two mediumrange ballistic missiles that can hit japan the css2 with range of 2800 km and the css5 with range of 1800 km conventional warhead or 2500 nuclear chinas css3 5500 km and css4 1200013000 km icbms could also reach japan and the prc continues to improve its missile force with the development of at least one new mob ile icbm df31 submarine launched missiles and new cruise missiles china has nuclear and chemical weapons and probably has biological w eapons it is known to have nuclear warheads for its strategic missiles china could attack japan with icbms which may fly too fast for the proposed tmd systems to intercept reliably also it is possible that north korea could modify the trajectory of its missiles to increase their effectiveness against missile defense system in japan conceivably north korea could launch threestage taepodong 1 or taepodong 2 on very steep lofted trajectory to high altitude so that it would ente r japanese airspace at such high speed over 5 kmsec that planned tmd systems c ould not reliably intercept it18 on lower depressed trajectory taepodong missiles could

available to locate and identify the attacking missile obtain authorization to fire the interceptor and to destroy the attacking missile19 however it is questionable wh ether north korea or china will have built missiles reentry vehicles or warheads able to withstand the heat and stress of traveling through the atmosphere for th longer periods required by depressed trajectory the additional we ight of material to streng then the missile components and protect them from heat c ould require smaller warhead or greater thrust but that additional weight should not be pr oblem for taepodong missiles that have enough thrust to send them far beyond japa n depressed trajectory also reduces accuracy20 the stress and heat generated in depressed trajectory and the possibility of the reentry vehicle colliding with rocket stages and shrouds jettisoned in the atmosphere might be reduced by shaped trajectory ie one that differs substantially from ballistic trajectory in this trajectory missile ascends on steep path then turns when outside the atmosphere to fly more nearly parallel to the earths surface discards used stages in space and reente rs the atmosphere at selected angle of descent21 north korea or china might in th future be able to defeat proposed theater missile defense systems by modifying the speed flight time and altitude of missile attacks although these modifica tions are theoretically possible and some scientists contend the united states and russia could accomplish them there is publicly available information to indicate china or north korea will attempt to or will be able to modify their missiles in these ways russia maintains sizeable missile force consisting of icbms slbms and cruise missiles that could strike japa n the missile defense system japan is contemplating and the systems discussed in the dod report do not appear to respond to the threat of russian missiles nor would they be well suited to defend against such threat the dod report does not

concluded the best miss ile defense option of those considered to defend japan against north korean n odong or taepodong 1 missiles would be shipboard ntw block iilike system one ship position is sufficient to provide full national coverage p 8 this system would be able to fire twice shootlook shoot at north korean missiles directed at the central portion of japan on the other hand four ship positions would be required for an ntw block ilike system to provide nearly complete coverage of japan with substantial shootlookshoot opportunities over much of japane territory p 8 the report also analyzed two landba sed systems based on pac3 and thaad it found that more than 100 pac3like sy stems augmented by thaadlike radar would be required for countrywide defense of japan with this system the report explained the purpose of examining the pac 3 system was simply to demonstrate the large number of fire units that woul d be required to accomplish ballistic missile defense for japan p 8 six thaad like systems or four thaadlike systems with three additional thaadlike radars woul d be required to cover all or nearly all of japan the report did not indicate how many navy area defenselike ships would be required to provide lower tier protection of japan lthough it did evaluate this system for lowertier protection of sout h korea and taiwan probably because of nads limited ability to provi protection for inla nd facilities and population centers it was not discussed for japan s defense against nodong and taepodong missiles the report does not comment on the ability of any of these missile defense systems to defend against north korean t aepodong 1 with third stage taepo dong 2 chinese mrbms with ranges greater than 2000 km or chinese or russian icbms in keeping with the abm treaty demarcation agreement the united states will not test its tmd systems against targets with the speed of strategic missile over 5 kmsec so it would not be safe to assume the tmd systems would be effective against these missiles there was also indication in the report that japan would enhance the capability of the us systems or test them against faster missiles however on page

it would thus appear that the missile defenses analyzed in the dod report were not considered as reliable defense against these faster longer range missiles but if passed the realistic tests for re alistic threats national security act of 199924 would require dod to test ntw and thaad against target missiles with velocities not less than the maximum velocity of the taepo dong i missile of north korea the bill also calls on dod to review changes to the configuration of ntw and thaad to incr ease the interceptor speed beyond three kilometers per second and to allow the interceptors to us wide variety of sensors tmd systems or at least upper tier tm d systems would presumably be able to protect against chinese mrbms css5 1800 or 2500 km and css2 2800 km fired on standard trajectory without extensive or sophisticated penetration aides but more tmd ship positions or landbased firing its and radars than envisioned in the dod architecture options would be required to defend against these chinese missiles and against future chinese slbms because they could be fired at relatively high speeds from wide range of locations in china whereas missiles launched in north korea would come from concise attack area p 7 the report does not comment on the capability of the various tmd systems to overcome modified trajector ies and penetration aids discussed on page 12 above25 depending on the expected capabilities of the north korean chinese and russian missiles any missile defense system that is to be able to defend japan must be able to overcome some or all of these countermeasures japanese considerations26 the japanese have long been intent on maintaining close security relationship with the united states based on the tr eaty of mutual cooperation and security signed in 1960 more recently japan has become interested in supplementing its own selfdefense forces with missile defense systems pr imarily to counter the north korean missile threat in august 1999 the united states and japan signed an agreement to conduct joint research on f our components of the ntw system nose cone 2nd stage propulsion sensor and kinetic warhead27 japan had committed approximately 8

stronger usjapan military ties may portend increased japanese militariza tion might degrade chinas capability to project power through missile attacks and china is particularly concerned that the japanese missile defense system might cover taiwan wh ile japan does not wish to antagonize china it has apparently concluded it needs system that is effective against north korean missiles which would also be effective against some of chinas missiles japanese leaders have also been cons trained by article ne of the countrys constitution that renounces war and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes japan has trad itionally eschewed offensive weapons and foreign deployments it has also avoide d security relationships including missile defense with its asian ne ighbors and might be reluctant to deploy its missile defenses in way that would contribute to another countrys defense or that would intrude into the territorial waters or ai rspace of another country also japan is apparently not currently c onsidering defense systems like the airborne laser abl or an equivalent to the us national missile defense nmd partly because they could be construed as offens ive or strategic systems however as mentioned above the japanese do not consider the proposed systems to be theater missile defense but missile defense of the country but ja pan may be able to adopt somewhat more aggressive missile defense measures s uch as abl spacebased laser or boost phase intercept if it appr oves legislation currently unde r consideration that would allow preemptive strikes against another nation when the threat of attack is imminent29 japanese missile defense cooperation w ith its asian neig hbors mig ht also be restricted by the three

transfers to other countries are restrain ed in conformity with the spirit of the constitution and the foreign exchange and foreign trade law30 japans preference for ntw over thaad which may employ spacebased sensors is reportedly par tially based on the countrys policy against the military use of space the dod report acknowledges that some form of early warning and long distance tracking which could be spaceba sed would be required for an effective tmd it would probably need equipment nd data in addition to the early warning the united states has been sharing with japan since 1996 japan is developing an indigenous information gathering satellite system and is acquiring some us technology for the system httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs18 31 the report describes the architecture requi rements for the defense of the rok against north korean missiles p 10 32 us department of defense prolifera tion threat and response november 1997 p 8 33 unless north korea has received extensive assistance from another country that has developed and tested nuclear weapons it is doubtful it has reliable nuclear warhead for its missiles 34 dod report p 11 and tmd briefing by bmdocost is another important factor to th japanese government acquisition and operation of comprehensive and effective missile defens system would be large and controversial expense for japans fense agency and selfdefense forces additionally japanese industr has become leery of join t development projects and sharing its commerciallyuse ful technology even though the japanese government wants the benefits of advan ced us military technology and japanese industry wants the financial and technological gains that can be associated with defense contracts thaad would also occupy much more nd scarce resource in japan and would offer less opportunity for japanese pa rticipation in system development than would ntw assessment of dod report for republic of korea missile threat to the republic of korea the dod report used only the north korean short range ballistic missile capability to represent the threat to the republic of korea while excluding the potential threat from chinese and russian missiles31 north korea has hundreds of domesticallyproduced scudb variants 100 and 300 km range and scudc 500 km missiles that could deliver high expl osive or chemical warheads or possibly biological warheads32 pyongyang is believed to have sufficient fissile material for one or two atomic weapons and may possibly have produced such weapons33 north korea also manufactures the nodong mrbm and has tested the taepodong 1 mrbm neither of which was considered the dod report said that because of the relatively small size of south korea 380 km north tosouth and 260 km eastto west the ranges of the ballistic missiles that can be used are restricted potential capabilities and limitations of tmd systems five tmd options were examined by dod and discussed in its report the best option included four thaadlike systems and seven pac3like systems this combination would provide coverage of all of the country beyond the immediate reach of very shortra nge ballistic missiles34 the critical feature for the coverage achie ved by this architecture is the minimum intercept altitude for the endoexo upper tie r thaad system able to intercept tbms flying to an apogee as low as 40 kilometers the endoexo upper tier system could reach most of the threaten ing trajectories the lower tier pac3 system would be used to prot ect seoul and its environs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs19 35 ibid pp 11 12 36 ibid 37 dod noted this omission was due to insufficient timein the case of the thaad like system the high endo minimum intercept altitude would preclude engagements for threats attacking the northern portions of the rok35 this appears to indicate that thaadlike systems could intercept north korean scudbs and cs that climb bove 40 km and that pac3like systems deployed around seoul might intercept some scuds that do not reach 40 km altitude apparently not covered by the thaadpa c3 combination are very shortrange north korean missiles perhaps frogs and other battlefield rockets as well as very shortrange scuds deployed near the dmz the very short flight time is another factor that makes it difficult to intercept missiles fired at seoul from close range even some north korean artillery is within range of seoul just 40 kilometer24 miles from the border with north korea as noted scud nodong and taepo dong missiles fired with modified traj ectory may exceed the capabilities of pac3 and thaad less effective options discusse d in the report included 25 pac3like units to cover the assets identified as critical 11 nalike ships to provide pr otection to coastal areas 1 ntwblock ilike ship and 25 pac3like units 1 ntwblock iilike ship and 19 pac3like units the report notes that larger deployme nt of pac3s woul d allow coverage of more of south korea than just the identified critical assets the navy area defense like systems could not reach far enough in land to defend all critical assets and population centers against all threat traj ectories and the ntwlike system could not defend the northern two thirds of the rok against lowflying shortrange tbmsmost north korean threats36 the report does not comment on the capability of the various tmd options to overcome modified

and russian missiles any missile defense system that is to be able to defend south korea may have to overcome some or ll of these countermeasures republic of korea considerations south korea officials are quite concerned by the north korea missile threat and maintain close military alliance with the united states while they work cautiously toward reunification of the korean peninsula since 1979 the us army has maintained one patriot surfacetoair missile battalion at air bases south of seoul to protect key us and south korean fighter aircraft capabilities korean officials considered but were not

missile defense was apparently not significant factor in seouls initial reluctance missile defenses were not the top priority of the rok military par tly because of their inability to guarantee the safety of seoul and adjacent military units also the asian financial crisis reduced funds even for higher priority military programs rok officials considered acquisition of the russian s300 theater ssile defense system which it might have been able to obtain in exchange for relief of russian debt to the country the united states strongly urged south korea not to acquire the russian system that would not be compatible with us military equipment seoul also considered the development of its own missile force to deter north korean missile attack rok officials are currently negotiating to release seoul fro m its 1979 agreement with the united states not to develop missile with range great er than 180 km south korea would prefer to join the multilateral missile technol ogy control

the use of multiple warheads could have similar effect by requiring the defense to acquire track and engage more weapons at one time58 potential capabilities and limitations of tmd systems taiwans

the upper tier systems could protect all of taiwan although it also says the upper tier systems could not defend th upper portions of south korea ntw could not defend the upper 250 km of south korea

selecting system to counter the prcs possible use of srbms as well as longer range ballistic missiles the possib ility that the missiles could carry non conventional as well as c onventional warheads may requi re greater emphasis on the interception of missiles over the prc or over the sea farther from taiwan chinese attack with lofted icbms depressed mrbms or shorter range missiles may be able to defeat the tbmds discussed it is not clear how effective seabased upper tier system would be if taiwan we re attacked with slbms launched from submarine east north or south of the island dod reports options the dod report noted that either the landbased or the seabased lower tier system could ade quately defend most of taiwans critical assets but neither system could provide any defense against longer range theater ballistic missiles thus the report said that to address the full range of threats srbms and mrbms three land and sea based upper tier options were explored the dod report found that one landbased upper tier syst em with an additional thaadlike radar could cover the entire island of taiwan nd could intercept both missiles flying inside the atmosphe re endoatmosphere and outside exo atmosphere alternativel one seabased uppertier sy stem like ntw with only one ship position could cover all of taiwan seabase d option could be the ntw sm3 block i missile with aegis spy 1 radar or the ntw block ii system59 however while the dod report found that either one landbased or one sea based uppertier option is sufficient to defend taiwan it did not compare their respective advantages or disadvantages both seabased upper tier systems are exo atmospheric and would not intercept srb ms or mrbms on trajectories that remain inside the atmosphere while thaad is ex pected to have the capability to defend against ballistic missiles flying inside the atmosphere as low as 40 km ntw has minimum intercept altitude of about 100 km p 11 on the other hand the ntw system could intercept some incoming missiles possibly w ith nonconventional warheads in their ascent midcourse nd descent phases outsi the atmosphere60 potentially farther away from taiwan th dod report also did not discuss the effectiveness and vulnerability of various possible locations of the one ship position needed for seabased uppertier option ie in the taiwan strait or east of taiwan alternative options thus taiwan may need to further enhance defenses against the prcs missiles with combin ation of both an upper tier system and another system to defend against low altitude missiles and to provide layered defenses or defenseindept h rather than the dod reports options of single system similar to thaad ntw block i or ntw block ii taiwans defense may well require set of alternative options with one or more units of each systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs26 61 us senate committee on foreign relati ons hearing on ustaiwan relations the 20th anniversary of the taiwan relations

discussed within the scope of the dod report there are limitations to taiwans pursuit of the above missile defense options first while the uppertier missile defense systems provide better protection for taiwan against chinese mrbms or high altitude srbms they are not expected to reach initial operational capab ility until after 2007 on the other hand the lowertier systems are expected to be operationa l sooner pac3 in fy 2001 and nad in fy 2003 second with the prcs reported buildup of its missile force and its range of options from limited to largescale missile firings there may be concern that taiwan could face largescale missile threat from many directions that could strain its missile defenses furthermore ballistic missile could cross the taiwan strait in only minutes making it very difficult for decisionmakers to react and missile defenses to intercept for example ballistic missile with range of 600 km such as the m9 would travel at maximum ve locity of 24 kmsecond crossing the strait in few minutes in spring 1999 assistan t secretary of defense franklin kramer provided an idea of the capability of taiwans mads system in the pac3 family to defend against many incoming missiles he told the senate foreign relations committee that the pla is expected to deploy substantial numbers of ballistic missiles which could overcome limited theater missile defense architecture assuming two interceptors are dedicated against each incoming missile and 100 percent probability of kill patriotderived mads battalion theoretically could halt near simultaneous barrage of 48 srbms directed against targets within the battalions area of coverage 100 percent probability of kill however is not likely larger srbm salvos could ensure at least some ballistic missiles reach their targets61 third apparently because the legislative requirement called for architecture requirements against limited ballistic missile attacks only the dod report did not discuss the threat of

threat than that of ballistic missiles63 the secretary of defenses report on taiwan security also confirmed that china is developing landattack cruise missiles lacms with relatively high development priority and an aggressive effort to ac quire foreign cruise missile technology and subsystems particularly from russia that dod report on taiwan security predicted that the prcs first lacm to be produced will probably be airlaunched and could be operati onal early in the 21st century moreover the prc is improving its c801 and c802 antiship cr uise missiles ascms th report warned that the pla

fo r taiwan discussed in the dod report on missile defense in east asia addre ss only one aspect of missile defense according to dod tmd is comprised of four operational pillars active defense passive defense attack operations and c4i essential for any of the other pillars65 as pointed out in the defense secretarys report on taiwan security exclusivereliance on active missile defenses and associated bmc 3i battle managementcommand contro l communications intelligence however will not sufficiently offset the overwhelming advantage in offensive missiles which beijing is projected to possess in 200566 taiwans defense planne rs may prefer to develop aspects of missile defense other than the active defense options discussed in the dod report on tmd for example there is re portedly growing support in taiwan for the development and deployment of ballistic missiles to deter chinese missile attacks by targeting the prcs major cities such as beijing and shanghai for retaliation67 similarly the dod report did not discuss other possible missile defense options suchas the airborne laser and spacebased ser boostphase inte rcept systems that could destroy the enemy missiles near their launch sites and associated structureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs28 fifth taiwan may conclude th at its pursuit of missile defense options through indigenous development us arms sales or codevelopment ma be an inefficient and expensive use of limited defense resources for example the unspecified ship position required in seabased uppertier system could be provided by the us navy and not necessarily the taiwan navy there may also be other options to lessen crossstrait tensions including dialogue and c onfidencebuilding measures provided beijing is willing to pursue meaningful exchanges political considerations and us options arguments against while beyond the scope of the dod report on tmd options there are political and security considerations concerning the possible transfer of us missile defense systems to taiwan foremost the prc favors the one china policy and objects to increases in us arms sales to taiwan especially those perceived to increase taiwans potential offensive capability the prc strenuously opposes us tmd transfers to taiwan as spurring its movement towards independence by reestablishing close us defense cooperation w ith taiwan akin to an alliance relationship that some say is more important for taiwans defense than simply acquiring weapon systems th prc also argues that missile defenses in asia would be destabilizing and would prompt the prc to engage in an arms race by responding with additional deployments of missiles some us policymakers are concerned about the negative impact on us prc relations that would obstruct the pursuit of important us in terests that require prc c ooperation including improved crossstrait relations stability in korea weapon nonproliferati on and expanded us exports to china some are concer ned about provoking the prc with narrow military solutions that derail efforts to improve crossstrait relations which ultimately provide taiwan with lasting security finally ustaiwan missile defense cooperation could complicate critical usj apan cooperation in missile defense by aggravating chinese concerns about us led coalition to contain china and any possible japanese links to taiw ans missile defense systems arguments in favor those in the united states and taiwan who support the potential deployment of ssile defense systems in taiwan point out that the prc already has been building up its offensive missile force in destabilizing manner facing such real and growing threat taiwan needs to respond with tmd systems as one way to improve its defenses against potential prc intimidation and attacks some are confident that the tmd system s proposed would significantly mitigate the prc missile threat along with missile defense systems deepened military cooperation with the united states w ould help to enhance taiwans military hardware as well as military thinking and training software improved early warning systems could improve stability in potentially volatile situation and avoid miscalculations taiwans acquisition of active defense systems may be preferable to its possible pursuit of offensive missile systems for deterrence or even warfighting some say that taiwans defense is u ltimately its responsibility and its pursuit of tmd systems is one way to shore up defe nses the taiwan relations act tra pl 968 requires that the united states will make available to taiwan such defense articles and defense rvices in such quantity as may be necessary to enable taiwan to maintain sufficient selfdefense capability sec 3a in the summer of 1999 deputy assistant secretary of defens kurt campbell tes tified to the senate foreign relations committee that the tra has been the most successful piece ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs29 68 testimony before the senate foreign relations committee aug 4 1999legislative leadership in foreign policy in recent history68 in 1999 moreover some in congress introduced the taiwan secu rity enhancement act s 693 helms hr 1838 delay specifically authorizing the pr esident to sell tmdrelated systems and other items to taiwan the international relations committee later amended the house version removing sp ecific references to part icular systems the administration and others in congress oppose the bill as unnecessary and counterpr oductive since it could jeopardize the current situation of maintaining strong but unofficial ties to taipei while pursuing engagement with beijing us options thus us policy has broa d range of options the united states could focus on development and ployment of tmd systems in asia that could cover taiwan wit hout transfers of tmd system s or technology to taiwan such development and deployment may or may not involve allies such as japan alternatively the united states could sell one missile defense system or combination of tmd systems to taiwan wit hout technology transfers on the other hand us sales may include sharing re lated technology with taiwan in co development and coproduction finally us policy may examine the possible development of other missile defense options in taiwan in addition to the active defense options discussed in the dod report us considerations in cooperative missile defense programs beyond the architecture requirements fo r establishing and operating missile defenses for east asia there are numer ous security political and economic issues policymakers might consider thorough discussion of these considerations was beyond the scope of the dod report th topics will only be mentioned here to indicate the complexity of the issue and possible implications of entering or establishing joint missile defense system associated with the acquisition of missile defense systems by japan south korea or taiwan would be improved protection of us troops and facilities abroad and possibly reduced call for us units to provide missile defense plans to establish missile fense system could provoke hostilities as north korea or china saw its offensive military capability eroding if the allies were able to establish very effective defense it might tend to dissuade north korea and china from expanding their missile forces because they woul d be of little use however marginally effective missile defense could encourage those countries to increase their missile inventories and improve their missiles ability to penetrate defenses some analysts think north korea andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs30 china are determined to modernize their missile forces regardless of allied defenses and that some level of arms r ace will continue in the region cooperation in missile defense is seen as sign of close security and political relations between the united states and its three partners many see these close relations as contributing to stability and peace in the region but china and north korea perceive them as hegemonic threatening and destabilizing american analysts disagree on the net politicalmilitary effects of east asian missile defenses depending in part on the technical characteristics and capabilities of the systems to be considered expending political capital and large sums of money on various missile defense options may occur at the expense of other political or military solutions that some analysts see as more effective cooperative missile defense provi des an opportunity for japan south korea and taiwan to shar technology and lucrative defense contracts while sharing the ec onomic burden of defending the region it has often been difficult for the united states to manage joint research and development program that is acceptable to all the businesses and governments of participating countries the transfer of cuttingedge miss ile defense technology to japan south korea or taiwan could have farreaching implications for their military and industrial capabilitie s that may or may not be in the best interest of the united st ates and could also violate us obligations under the abm treaty and the missile technology control regimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30379crs31 us options for missile defense in east asia the united states could pursue regional missile defense coope ration by sharing any of dozen systems or any combina tion of them with japan south korea or taiwan or could deploy us tmd systems in east asia without their participation the dod report discussed several of
