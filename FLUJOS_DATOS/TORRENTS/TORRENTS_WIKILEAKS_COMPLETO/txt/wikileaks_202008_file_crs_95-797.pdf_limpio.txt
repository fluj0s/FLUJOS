been introduced for the last several congresses tort law at present is almost exclusively state law rather than federa l law although as noted in the appendix to this report congress has enacted number of tort reform statutes part i of this report concludes that congress has the authority to enact tort reform legislation generally under its power to regulate interstate commerce and to make such legislation applicable to intrastate torts because tort suits generally affect interstate commerce however it may be unconstitutional for tort reform legislation to be applied to particular intrastate torts that do not substantially affect interstate commerce in concluding that congress has the authority to enact tort reform generally we refer to reforms that have been widely implemented at the state level such as caps on damages and limitations on joint and several liability and on the collateral source rule more specialized types of re forms are not necessarily immune from constitutional challenge for example some state courts have struck down statutes that provide that portion of punitive dama ges awards must be paid to state funds although other state courts have upheld such statutes part i also concludes that there would ppear to be due pr ocess or federalism or any other constitutional impediments to congresss limiting state common law right of recovery the only exception concerns requiring alternative dispute resolution that limits the right to jury trial part ii considers alternative dispute resolution alternatives some of which could have constitutional problems the seventh amendment would preclude congress from eliminating the right to jury trial in common law tort actions brought in federal court congress may however eliminate the right to bring common law tort actions in federal court or eliminate common law tort actions themselves congress apparently may creat article i tribunals such as arbitration panels to hear tort claims if it alters tort claims so that they are longer traditional common law actions but rather are like nofault workers compensation claims or if it allows novo review by an article iii court with the right to jury trial of traditional common law tort actions rather than allow merely traditional appellate review it apparently may also opt fo r middle ground by altering the common law cause of action somewhat but not wholly and by providing for something less than novo review by an article iii court provided that the article iii court is not required to be too defere ntial to the findings of the article i tribunal finally strong argument may be made that congress has the power to eliminate jury trials in tort actions brought in state court but this is uncertainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797contents introduction 1 p r t i t r t r f r m g n r l l 1 c m m r c p w r1 b d u p r c s s 4 c f d r l i s m 4 p r t i i l t r n t i v d i s p u t r s l u t i n 7

and summaries of selected statutes introduction this report considers the constitutionality of federal tort refo rm legislation such as the produc ts liability and medical malpractice reform proposals that have been introduced for the last severa l congresses tort is civil as opposed to criminal wrong other than breach of contract th at causes injury for which the victim may sue to recover damages torts include negligent acts such as medical malpractice and acts such as selling defective products for which one can be held strictly liable liable even in the absence of negligence tort law at present is almost exclusively state law rather than federa l law although as noted in the appendix to this report congress has enacted number of tort reform statutes part i of this report concludes that enactment of tort reform legislation generally would appear to be within congresss pow er to regulate commerce and would not appear to violate principles of due pr ocess or federalism however it may be unconstitutional for tort reform legislation to be applied to particular intrastate torts that do not substantially affect interstate commerce in concluding that congress has the authority to enact tort reform genera lly we refer to reforms that have been widely implemented at the state level such as caps on damages and limitations on joint and several liability and on the collateral source rule more specialized types of reforms are not necessarily immune from constitutional challenge for example some state courts have struck down statutes that provide that portion of punitive damages awards must be paid to state f unds although other stat courts have upheld such statutes part ii of this report considers alternative dispute resolution alternatives some of which could have constitutional problems part iii is conclusi on the report ends with an appendix scribing selected federa l tort reform statutes part i tort reform generally commerce power federal statute is constitutional if it is enacted pursuant to power of congress enumerated in the constitution and if it does not contravene any provision of the constitution the enumerated power pursuant to which federal tort reform could be enacted is congresss power to regulate commerce with foreign nations andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs2 1 in addition under its power to spend for the general welfare of the united states art i 8 cl 1 congress may require the states to implement tort reform as condition of their acceptance of federal funds south dakota v dole 483 us 203 206 1987 congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds and has repeatedly employed the power to further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys with compliance by the recipient with federal st atutory and administrative directives 2 in united states v lopez 514 us 549 559 1995 the supr eme court made clear that to be subject to federal regulation an activity must substantially affect and not merely affect interstate commerce 3 this power enables congress to regulate noncommercial activities that cross state lines thus in caminetti v united states 242 us 470 1917 the court upheld federal statute that it crime knowingly to transport in in terstate commerce any woman or girl for the continuedamong the several states art i 8 cl 31 one might ask however whether tort law is commerce and if it is whether fe deral tort reform legislation would be constitutional as applied to purely intrastate torts the supreme court has held that congresss power to regulate interstate commerce includes the power to regulate any activity that exerts substantial effect on interstate commerce wickard v filburn 317 us 111 125 1942 or is within class of activities within the reach of federal power perez v united states 402 us 146 154 1971 emphasis in original furthermore when congress has determined that an activity affects interstate commerce the courts need inquire only whether the finding is rational hodel v virginia surface mining reclamation association inc 452 us 264 277 19812 the supreme court has held that the business of insurance constitutes interstate commerce for purposes of the commerce clause united states v southeastern underwriters association 322 us 533 1944 nd whether or not tort reform would in fact substantially affect the business of insurance it would not appear irrational for congress to conclude that it would consequently there seems little doubt that tort reform legislation in gene ral would be within congresss commerce power however it may be unconstitutional for tort reform legislation to be applied to particular intrastate torts that arguably do not substantially affect interstate commerce an example might be an ssault by one indivi dual upon another where the assault has connection with organized crime or any commercial activity this is because in united states v lopez 514 us 549 1995 the supreme court for the first time since 1936 declared fede ral statute unconstitutional for exceeding congresss commerce clause authority in lopez it struck down the gunfree school zones act of 1990 whic h made it federal offense for any individual knowingly to possess firearm at place that the individual knows or has reasonable cause to believe is school zone the court in lopez identified three broad categor ies of activity that congress may regulate under its commerce power firs t congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce3 second congress is empowered to regulate andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs3 3 continued purpose of prostitution or debauchery or for any other immoral purpose even though the statute as interpreted by the court was not limited to commercialized vice id at 484 4 the court added while we need not adopt categorical rule against aggregating the effects of any noneconomic activity in order to decide these cases thus far in our nations history our cases have upheld commerce clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is economic in nature id at 613 by contrast the court will uphold commerce clause regulation of interstate activity that is not economic in nature see note 3 supra protect the instrumentalities of interstate co mmerce or things in interstate commerce even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities finally congresss commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having substantial relation to interstate commerce ie those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce id at 558559 citations omitted the court in lopez then noted that if the gunfree school zones act of 1990 was to be sustained it must be under the th ird category as regulation of an activity that substantially affects interstate commerce id at 559 the act however had nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise and is not an essential part of larger regulation of economic activity in which the regulatory scheme could be unde rcut unless the intrastate activity were regulated id at 561 the same apparently could be said of some torts such as the assault example suggested above but it does not appear that it could be said with respect to torts that substantially affect commerce such as the manufacture of defective products or medical malpractice since lopez the supreme court has decided two major cases on the reach of the commerce clause in united states v morrison 529 us 598 2000 the court struck down section of the violence against women act of 1994 that created federal cause of action against any person who commits crime of violence motivated by gender whether interstate or intrastate in striking down the provision the court noted that fair reading of lopez shows that the noneconomic criminal nature of the conduct at issue wa s central to our decision in that case id at 610 and gendermotivated crimes of violence are not in any sense of the phrase economic activity4 id at 613 in lopez the court noted that congress normally is not required to make formal findings as to the substantial burdens that an activity has on interstate commerce 514 us at 562 it added however but to the extent that congressional findi ngs would enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affected interstate commerce even though substantial effect was visible to the naked eye they are lacking here id at 563 in morrison the court found congress s findings substantially weakened by their reliance on butfor causal chain from the initial occurrence of violent crime to ever attenuated effect upon inters tate commerce 529 us at 615httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs4 5 fein v permanente medical group 38 cal3d 137 211 cal rptr 368 695 p2d 665 1985 appeal dismissed 474 us 892 1985 justice white dissenting roa v lodi medical group inc 37 cal3d 920 211 cal rptr 77 695 p2d 164 1985 appeal dismissed 474 us 990 1985the second recent major supreme court case on the reach of the commerce clause was gonzales v raich 545 us 1 2005 which upheld the application of the federal statute prohibiting the manufact ure and possession of marijuana to the intrastate cultivation and us of marijuana for medicinal purposes the court found that there was rational basis for concluding that the local cultivation and use of marijuana taken in the aggregate subs tantially affects interstate commerce id at 22 the court distinguished lopez and morrison on the ground that those two cases involved attempts to regulate ac tivities that were not economic whereas marijuana is commodity for which there is an established and lucrative interstate market and prohibiting the intrastate possession or manufacture of an article of commerce is rational and commonly utilized means of regulating commerce in that product id at 26 gonzales v raich appears to support congress power to regulate medical malpracti ce and products liability litiga tion because the practice of medicine and the manufactur of products are activities that constitute interstate commerce and it would be rational to conclude that litigation concerning these activities substantially affects interstate commerce b due process at one time it might plausibly have been suggested that limitations on tort liability might violate the fifth amendments protection against federal deprivations of property without due pr ocess of law however in 1978 the supreme court upholding the priceanderson acts limita tion on liability for accidents resulting from the operation of privately ow ned nuclear power plants wrote our cases have clearly established that person has property vested interest in any rule of common law the constitution does not forbid the creation of new rights or the abolition of old ones recognized by the common law to attain permissible legislative object despite the fact that otherwise settled expectations may be upset thereby indeed statutes limiting liability are relatively commonplace and have consistently been enforced by the courts duke power co v carolina environmental study group 438 us 59 88 n32 1978 citations omitted in 1985 the supreme court without written opinions upheld the constitu tionality of california statutes that pl aced caps in medical malpractice cases on respectively noneconomic damages and lawyers contingent fees5 c federalism in national league of cities v usery 426 us 833 855 1976 the supreme court held that the fair labor standards act 29 usc 201 et seq which prescribes the federal minimum wage could not constitutionally be applied to employees of state and municipal gove rnments there was contention thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs5 6 426 us at 843 quoting fry v united states 421 us 542 547 n7 1975 the tenth amendment states the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the peoplecongress commerce power was not broa d enough to encompass this sort of regulation the contention rather wh ich the court accepted was that the constitution contained an ffirmative limitation on this exercise of the commerce power the court did not name any particular provision of the constitution as imposing the limitation in this case but did quote an earlier case that said that the tenth amendment expressly declares the constitutional policy that congress may not exercise power in fashion that impairs the states integrity or their ability to function effectively in federal system6 in any event the court held that the commerce clause did not authorize congress to directly displace the states freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional gove rnmental functions id at 852 the only example the court gave of an integral governmental function was the structuring of employeremployee relationships in such areas as fire prevention police protection sanitation public health and parks and recreation id at 851 it added however that these examples are obviously not an exhaustive catalogue id at 851 n16 in garcia v san antonio metropolitan transit authority 469 us 528 1985 the court overruled national league of cities holding that the fair labor standards act could be applied to state and munici pal employees it concluded that the national league of cities test for integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions had proven both impractical nd doctrinally barren and that the court in 1976 had tried to re pair what did not need repair id at 557 the court found that it had license to em ploy freestanding conceptions of state sovereignty when measuring congressiona l authority under the commerce clause id at 550 the court did however recognize that the states ccupy special and specific position in our constitutional system and that the scope of congress authority under the commerce clause must reflect that position id at 556 subsequently the court took st ep back in the direction of national league of cities in new york v united states 505 us 144 1992 the court invalidated provision of the lowlevel radioactiv waste policy amendments act of 1985 because it required states not participating in regional waste disposal compact to take title to waste or accept liability for generators damages the court readily acknowledged that congress may regulate the interstate ma rket in disposal of low level radioactive waste but noted that the commerce clause authorizes congress to regulate interstate commerce directly it does not authorize congress to regulate state governments regulation of interstate commerce id at 166 the court discussed two methods by wh ich congress may urge state to adopt legislative program consiste nt with federal interests first under congress spending power congress may attach cond itions on the receipt of federal funds second where congress has the author ity to regulate private activity under the commerce clause we have recognized congress power to offer states the choicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs6 7 subsequently in printz v united states 521 us 898 935 1997 the court held that congress may not circumvent the prohibition on commandeering states regulatory processes by conscripting the states officers directlyof regulating that activity according to federal standards or having state law pre empted by federal regulation id at 167 but if states decline to participate in federal scheme congress may not force them to do so to have its way congress must preempt state law and regulate directly the take title provision rather than presenting states with choice between regulatory participation or accep ting federal preemption required states to choose between two unconstitutionally coercive regulatory techniques either way the act commandeers the legislative processes of the states by directly compelling them to enact and enforce federal regulatory program id at 1767 under new york v united states the only significant federalism restraint on exercise of the commerce power is that state regulatory processes may not be commandeered for federal purposes there is federalism restraint on federal regulation of businesses and individuals in areas traditionally regulated by states the fact that congress has traditionally deferred in large measure to state regulation of the insurance industry for example does not mean that congress must continue to do so congress does not invade areas reserved to the states by the tenth amendment simply because it exercises its authority in manner that displaces the states exercise of their police powers hodel v virginia surface mining reclamation association inc 452 us 264 291 1981 upholding steep slope and other federal regu lations of surface mining in spite of traditional state role in regulating land use in the case of federal tort reform propos als such as reducing awards by amounts recovered from collateral sources congress would not be commandeering state regulatory processes cong ress would merely be enacting federal law that preempted substantive state law and requiring states to enforce the federal law in new york v united states the court cited four cases that di scuss the well tablished power of congress to pass laws enforceable in state courts id at 178 the court added these cases involve more than an application of the supremacy clauses provision that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land enforceable in every state more to the point all involve congressional regulation of indi viduals not congressional requirements that states regulate federal statutes enforceable in state courts do in sense direct state judges to enforce them but this sort of federal direction of stat judges is mandated by the text of the supremacy clause id at 178179 one of the four cases the supreme court cited second employers liability cases 223 us 1 1912 involved what t oday would be called tort reform the case was challenge to the employer s liability act of 1908 which regulated the liability of common carriers by railroad to their employees it was essentially federal workers compensation statute that preempted state tort law by among other things its abrogation of the fellowservant rule the extension of the carriers liability to cases of death and the restriction of the defenses of contributoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs7 8 when congress creates new statutory public rights it may assign their adjudication to an administrative agency with which jury trial would be incompa tible without violating the seventh amendments injunction that jury tria l is to be preserved in suits at common law granfinanciera sa v nordberg 492 us 33 51 1989 9 suits based on state law may be brought in federal court only if the matter in controversy exceeds 75000 and the plaintiff and defendant ar domiciled in different states this is known as diversity of citizenship 28 usc 1332 10 the constitutions of 48 states have civil jury provisions roughly analogous in form and substance to the seventh amendment paul b weiss reforming tort reform is there substance to the seventh amendment 38 catholic university law review 737 739 1989 11 simler v connor 372 us 221 1963negligence and assumption of risk id at 49 one question before the supreme court was whether rights arising under the congressional act may be enforced as of right in the courts of the states wh their jurisdiction as prescribed by local laws is adequate to the occasion id at 55 the court answered the question as follows when congress in the exertion of the power confided to it by the constitution adopted that act it spoke for all the people and all the states and thereby established policy for all that policy is as much the policy of connecticut as it the act had emanated from its own gislature and should be respected accordingly in the courts of the state id at 57 part ii alternative dispute resolution one tort reform that may be consider ed by congress is to require that tort claims particularly medical malpractice claims be decided by alternative dispute resolution adr procedures such as binding arbitration rather than by traditional jury trials when congress creat federal cause of action it is generally free to prescribe any procedure for its enfo rcement with or without jury trial8 traditional tort actions however such as medical malpractice and products liability are not federal causes of action they are governed by state law even when they are brought in federal c ourt on diversity grounds9 state laws generally provide for jury trials in tort cases brought in state courts10 and the seventh amendment to the united states constitution generally provide s for jury trials of cases arising under state law that are broug ht in federal court11 the question has arisen therefore as to the extent to which the constitution permits congress to require alternative dispute resolution in federal or state forums of tort claims arising under state law seventh amendment if congress were to require adr procedur in lieu of jury trials then the seventh amendment would become c onsideration the seventh amendment guarantees the right to trial by jury in suits at common law where the value inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs8 12 common law refers to law created by state courts on casebycase basis 13 this does not mean that juries must operate exactly as they did at common law in colgrove v battin 413 us 149 1973 the supreme court upheld rules adopted in federal district court authorizing civil juries composed of six persons by the reference in the seventh amendment to the common law the court wrote the fr amers of the seventh amendment were concerned with preserving the right of trial by jury in civil cases where it existed at common law rather than the various incidents of trial by jury id at 155156 emphasis in original presumably allowing less than unanimous verdict would also be permissible even though unanimous verdict was required at common law 14 minneapolis st louis rr co v bombolis 241 us 211 1916 the seventh amendment does apply in district of columbia courts capital traction co v hof 174 us 1 5 1899 15 simler v connor supra note 11 16 congress pursuant to the constitution art iii 1 may from time to time ordain and establish and hence limit the jurisdiction of inf erior federal courts art i 3 directly establishes the supreme court 17 see 5 usc 8116c united states liability under feca is exclusive 28 usc 2679b1 federal employees are immune fro m tort actions arising under state law 18 mountain timber co v was hington 243 us 219 235 1917controversy shall exceed twenty dollars12 tort actions are suits at common law so the seventh amendment applies to them13 however the seventh amendment unlike most of the bill of rights does not apply in state courts14 where most tort actions are brought it does apply however to cases arising under state law that are brought in federal c ourt on diversity grounds15 therefore congress may not eliminate the right to jury trial in common law tort actions brought in federal court it may however eliminate the right to bring common law tort actions in federal court one way to do this would be to abolish diversity jurisdiction in tort suits ie to prohibit tort suits arising under state law from being brought in federal courts16 another way would be to alter tort suits to the point that they could longer be consid ered suits at common law to which the seventh amendment would apply congress has done the latter with respect to torts in flicted upon federal workers in the workplace the federal employ ees compensation act 5 usc 8101 et seq provides for compensation to federal employees for disability or death resulting from workrelated injuries whether the result of tort or otherwise employees can recover without proof of fau lt on the part of the government or its employees but are prohibited from bringing tort action aris ing under state law against the government or its employees17 an injured employee seeking recovery must file claim with the secretary of labor who determines whether the employee is entitled to an award there is right to jury trial nor to judicial review the supreme court has held that such an arrangement does not violate the seventh amendment because it abolishes all right of recove ry in ordinary cases and th erefore leaves nothing to be tried by jury18httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs9 19 whether congress may require the use of nonfederally established arbitration panels is considered in section f below 20 palmore v united stat 411 us 389 408 1973 21 458 us 50 70 1982 22 id at 6470 23 id at 6970 emphasis in original citations omittedit appears therefore that congress may prohibit common law tort suits from being brought in federa l court but may not take the ss radical step of allowing them to be brought in federal court but prohibiting them from being heard by juries if congress may not require common law tort suits to be heard by federal court without jury then it also may not re quire them to be decided by federally established arbitration pane l or other federally blished nonjudicial forum19 to do so would violate not only the seventh amendment it would violate article iii of the constitution b article iii article iii section 1 provides that the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as congress may establish and that the judges of both the supreme and inferior courts shall hold life tenure during good behavior at an i rreducible compensation federal courts created under this provision ar commonly known as article iii courts in add ition however congress pursuant to its powers enumerated in article i may establish article i legislative courts in specialized areas having particularized needs and warranting distinctive treatment20 article i judges need not be granted life tenure or irreducible salaries however since only article iii courts may exercise the judicial power of the united states congress power to create article i courts is limited to the above specialized areas except in these areas congress may not provide for federal judicial power to be exercised by federally established arbitrati on panels or by any federal forum other than an article iii court in northern pipeline construction co v marathon pipeline co the supreme court identified three situations in which art iii does not bar the creation of legislative courts21 these three situations are territorial courts military courts and courts created to adjudicate cas involving public rights22 with respect to the third situation marathon elaborated matter of public rights must at minimum arise between the government and others in contrast the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined is matter of private rights our precedents clearly establish that only controversies in the former category may be removed from art iii courts and delegated to legislative courts or administrative agencies for their determination privaterights disputes on the other hand lie at the core of the historically recogniz ed judicial power23httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs10 24 thomas v union carbide agricultu ral products co 473 us 568 586 1985 25 492 us 33 5455 1989 citation omitted 26 id at 52 emphasis in original citations omitted 27 id at 5354subsequently the court rejected the notion that public rights must at minimum arise between the government and others24 in granfinanciera sa v nordberg the court wrote the crucial question in cases not involving the federal government is whether congress acting for valid legislative purpose pursuant to its constitutional powers under article i has created seemingly private right that is so closely integrated into public regulato ry scheme as to be matter appropriate for agency resolution with limited involvement by the article iii judiciary if statutory right is not closely intertwi ned with federal regulatory program congress has power to enact and if th at right neither belongs to nor exists against the federal government then it must be adjudicated by an article iii court25 c article iii seventh amendment equivalence the constitutional problem with placing common law tort actions in an article i tribunal is equivalent to the constitutional problem with denying jury trials in such cases in granfinanciera sa v nordberg the court noted that congress cannot conjure away the seventh amendment by mandating that traditional legal ie common law claims be taken to an administrative tribunal in certain situations of course congress may fash ion causes of action that are closely analogous to commonlaw claims and place them beyond the ambit of the seventh amendment by assigning their reso lution to forum in which jury trials are unavailable congress power to do so is limited however just as its power to place adjudicative authority in nonarticle iii tri bunals is circumscribed26 that is the situations in which congress may deny the right to jury trial are the same situations in which congress may place matter outside of an article iii court in the courts words if statutory cause of action is legal ie common law in nature the question whether the seventh amendment permits congress to assign its adjudication to tribunal that does not employ juries as factfinders requires the same answer as the question whether article iii allows congress to assign adjudication of that cause of action to nonarticle iii tri bunal if the action must be tried under the auspices of an article iii court then the seventh amendment affords the parties right to jury trial whenever the cause of action is legal ie common law in nature conversely if congress may assign the adjudication of statutory cause of action to nonarticle iii tri bunal then the seventh amendment poses independent bar to the adjudication of that action by nonjury factfinder27httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs11 28 prohibiting states from using jury trials in to rt cases without establishing federal forum to decide such cases might be done in various ways such as by requiring binding arbitration or by allowing ordinary state court trials but requiring that j udges be

master designated by the united stat claims court ho wever the statute both alters the traditional common law action to nofault claim with limited recovery and allows dissatisfied claimant to bring traditional state tort action with some modificationsd applying article iii and the seventh amendment whether federal statute re quiring tort claims to be decided by an article i tribunal would violate article iii and whether it would violate the seventh amendment amount to the same question but what is the answer before examining some supreme court decisions that may shed light on it we should emphasize that the question arises only if congress were to tablish federal non article iii forum to hear trad itional tort claims if congress instead were simply to prohibit states from using jury trials in tort cases but did not establish an article i forum for such cases then it might raise another constitutional issue which is discussed in section f below but it would not raise an article iii seventh amendment issue28 this is because state courts were created pursuant to state laws or constitutions and do not exercise federa l judicial power and because the seventh amendment does not apply to them but to what extent may congress require that tort claims be decided by an article i tribunal in thomas v union carbide agricultural products co the supreme court noted that northern pipeline had established t hat congress may not vest in nonarticle iii court the power to adjudicate render final judgment and issue binding orders in traditional cont ract action arising under state law without consent of the litigants and subject only to ordinary appellate review29 the same undoubtedly applies to traditional tort actions arising under state law however this quotation suggests that congress may ve st tort claims in nonarticle iii forum if it does at least one of two things 1 alters tort claims so that they are longer traditional common law actions or 2 allows novo review with the right to jury trial of traditional common law tort actions rather than allow merely traditional appellate review in other words congre ss apparently may require that traditional common law tort actions initially be heard in federal nonarticle iii forum wit hout jury provided it allows dissatisfied party to then seek jury trial30 however if congress wishes to limit judicial review of tort claims then it apparently must alter tort claims so that they are longer traditional common law tort actions to what extent must congress alter tort claims in order to place them in non article iii forum and not provide novo review in granfinanciera the court held that congress may fashion causes of action that are closely analogous to common law claims and place them beyond the ga mbit of the seventh amendment if in cases not involving the federal government the private right that congress creates is so closely integrated into public regulatory scheme as to be matter appropriatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs12 31 492 us at 52 54 32 473 us at 586 33 id at 587 34 id at 572 35 id at 573 36 id at 573574 37 id at 584 38 id at 589for agency resolution with limite d involvement by the article iii judiciary31 in thomas the court indicated that such limited involvement may consist in judicial review that is something less than novo review with the right to jury trial in thomas the court rejected the notion that matter of public rights must at minimum arise between the government and others32 instead it held that practical attention to substance rather than doct rinaire reliance on form categories should inform application of article iii33 thomas involved provision of the federal insecticide fungicide and roden ticide act fifra 7 usc 136 et seq fifra requires manufacturers as precondition for registration of pesticide to submit research data to the environmental protection agency epa concerning the products health safety and environmental effects congress wished to allow the epa to consider data submitte d by one registrant to support the registration of the same or similar product by another registrant and therefore provided statutory authority for the use of previously submitted data as well as scheme for sharing the costs of data generation34 in order to avoid logjam of litigation that resulted from controversies over data compensation congress provided for system of negotiation and binding ar bitration to resolve compensation disputes among registrants35 the arbitrators decision is subj ect to judicial re view only for fraud misrepresentation or other misconduct36 the court considered several factors in determining that an article iii tri bunal was not required to resolve these disputes it found mandatory binding arbitration permissible in part because the right to compensation for shared data does not depend on or replace right to compensation under state law37 the right created by fifra is not purely private right but bears many of the characteristics of public right use of registrants data to support follow on ie subsequent registration serves public purpose as an integral part of program safeguarding the public health congress has the power under article i to authorize an agency administering complex regulatory scheme to allocate costs and benefits among voluntary partic ipants in the program without providing an article iii adjudication38 thus to use the words of the court in granfinanciera few years later thomas involved private ri ght that was closely integrated into public

fact that unwilling defendant is subjected to judicial enforcement power as result of the agency adjudication40 and that fifra while it limits judicial review it does not preclude review of the arbitration proceeding by an article iii court41 in commodity futures trading commission v schor the supreme court again emphasized that in determining whether an article iii tri bunal is required it has declined to adopt formalistic and unbending rules although such rules might lend greater degree of coherence to this area of law they might also unduly restrict congress ability to take needed and innovative action pursuant to its article i powers thus in reviewing article iii challenges we have weighed number of factors none of which has been deemed determinative with an eye to the practical effect that the congressional action will have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary42 the opinion in schor reveals how nonformalistic the courts approach is in this area among the factors upon which we have focused are the extent to which the essential attributes of judicial power are reserved to article iii courts and conversely the extent to which the nonarticle iii forum exercises the range of jurisdiction and powers normally vested only in article iii courts the origins and importance of the right to be adjudicated and the concerns that drove congress to depart from the requirements of article iii43 the court in schor upheld congressional grant of adjudicatory powers to federal agency the commodity futures trading commission cftc the court emphasized that the cftcs adjudicatory powers depart from the traditi onal agency model in just one respect the cftcs jurisdiction over common law counterclaims aside from its authorization of counterclai m jurisdiction the statute leaves far more of the essential attributes of judicial power to article iii courts than did that portion of the bankruptcy act found unconstitutional in northern pipeline 44

court found unconstituti onal the delegation to an article i tribunal the unite d states bankruptcy court of the adjudication of the right to recover contract damages lthough discharge in bankruptcy may well be public right and if it is may be delegated to an article i court the right to recover contract damages is statecreated private right and as such may not be delegated to an article i court46 in response to the argument th at the bankruptcy court is merely an adjunct to the district court and that the delegation of certain adjudicative functions to the bankruptcy court is accordingly consistent with the principle that the judicial power of the united states must be vested in art iii courts47 the supreme court observed that the judgments of th bankruptcy courts are apparently subject to review only under the more deferential clearly erroneous standard48 such limited review gave the bankruptcy courts more power than was permissible for an adjunct in granfinanciera the court held that the venth amendment requires jury trial in suit by trustee in bankruptcy to recover an allege dly fraudulent monetary transfer it reached this conclusion because bankruptcy trustees right to recover fraudulent conveyance under 11 usc 548a2 seems to us more accurately characterized as private right rather than public right as we have used those terms in our article iii decisions in northern pipeline construction co the plurality noted that statelaw causes of action for breach of contract or warranty are paradigmatic private rights even when asserted by an insolvent corporation in the midst of chapter 11 reorganization proceedings49 it was not sufficient that congress had reclassified preexisting commonlaw cause of action congress cannot liminate partys seventh amendment right to jury trial merely by relabeling the cause of action to which it attaches and placing exclusive jurisdiction in an administrative agency or specialized court of equity50 nor the court added can congress assignment be justified on the ground that jury trials of fraudulent conveyance actions would go far to dismantle the statutory scheme or that bankruptcy proceedings have been placed in an administrative forum with which the jury would be incompatible51 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs15 52 id at 63 53 473 us at 589 54 478 us at 851 55 id at 857furthermore it may be that provi ding jury trials in some fraudulent conveyance actions would impede swif t resolution of bankruptcy proceedings and increase the expense of chapter 11 reorgani zations but these considerations are insufficient to overcome the clear command of the seventh amendment52 constitutionality of establishing federal nonarticle iii forums conclusion in thomas the court upheld the use of nonarticle iii forum b ecause among other things the right created was not purely private right and limited judicial review by an article iii court was per mitted53 in schor the court upheld the use of nonarticle iii forum b ecause among other things its adjudicatory powers over common law actions were limited its orders were reviewed by an article iii court under relatively nondeferentia l standard and its legal rulings were subject to novo review in northern pipeline the court struck down the use of an article i forum because it was allowed to decide statecreated private rights and its decisions were subject only to deferentia l judicial review in granfinanciera the court struck down the use of an article i forum because the right that was adjudicated was private right these cases show that as the court wrote in schor in reviewing article iii challenges we have weighe d number of factors none of which has been deemed determinative with an eye to the practical effect that the congressional action will have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary54 however the major factors appear to be the extent to which the cause of action constitutes private right and the degree of review by an article iii tri bunal that is provided if cause of action is traditional common law cause of action not closely integrated into federal regulatory scheme then novo review by an article iii court with jury trial would apparently be required if the cause of action is altered somewhat but still resembles common law acti on then something less than novo review by an article iii court might be adequate provided the article iii court is not required to be too deferential to the finding of the nonarticle iii forum if the cause of action is altered to the point that it longer resembles common law tort and is closely integrated into federal regulatory scheme then adjudication by an article i forum without judicial review may be permissibl it does not seem possible to be more specific than this as brightline rules cannot effectively be employed to yield broad principles applicable to all article iii i

procedure civil 2303f constitutionality of prohibiting states from using jury trials without establishment of federal nonarticle iii forum as noted above if congress were to prohibit the states from using jury trials in tort cases but did not blish federal nonarticle iii forum to hear such cases then it would raise article iii seventh amendment issue but it would raise another constitutional issue this issue is whether congress even where it would otherwise have the power to regulate under the commerce clause may alter the procedures that state courts use to adjudicate state cause s of action in new york v united states discussed at page 5 above the court prohibited congress from using its commerce power to commandeer state regu latory processes although as noted this restriction would not seem to pr eclude congress from preempting substantive state law it might be argued that eliminating jury trials constituting as it would an interference with state court procedur might amount to commandeering state regulatory processes this distinction between substance nd procedure also finds support in the supreme courts approach to diversity cas which are cases arising under state law which because they are between citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds 50000 may be heard in federal court 28 usc 1332 in erie railroad co v tompkins 304 us 64 78 1937 the supreme court held that in diversity cases federal court is bound by the substantive as opposed to the procedural law of the state in which it sits whether the law of the state shall be declared by its legislature in statut or by its highest court in decision56 in guaranty trust co v new york 326 us 99 1945 the supreme court held that statutes of limitations are substantive for this purpose and that therefore federal courts must apply state statutes of limitations in diversity cases by substantive the court meant that the statute could substantially affect the outcome of the litigation statute of limitations can substa ntially affect the outcome of litigation because it can preclude an action from even being brought by contrast the right to jury trial does not have comparably subs tantial effect because in nonjury trial judge presumably applies the same law to the same facts as jury would in jury trial in diversity cases it is now clear that federal law determines whether there is right to jury trial in case in federal court and that state law is wholly irrelevant57 although the seventh amendment rather than the substan tiveprocedural distinction is

employ rules that do not impose unnecessary burdens upon rights of recovery authorized by federal laws felder v casey 487 us 131 150 1988 however federal rights of recove ry would not be at issue if congress sought to eliminate jury trials of state tort claims and the courts qualification would be irrelevant in such case 59 missouri ex rel southern railway co v mayfield 340 us 1 4 1950 the court continued however such restriction is imposed upon the states merely because the employers liability act empowers their courts to entertain suits arising under it thus not addressing the issue of the constitutionality of congress imposing such restriction action then state courts may not be pr eempted from using their own rules with respect to jury trials of state causes of action in addition the general rule bottome d deeply in belief in the importance of state control of state judicial procedure is that federal law takes the state courts as it finds them for example state rules about the ways in which claims for relief or defenses or counterdefenses must be asserted may ordi narily be applied also to federal claims and defenses and counterdefenses providi ng only that the rules are not so rigorous as in effect to nullify the asserted rights58 this general rule seems to have opera ted in 1950 case in which the supreme court held that state may deny access to its courts to persons seeking recovery under the federal employers liability act if in similar cases the state for reasons of local policy denies resort to its courts and enforces its policy impartially so as not to involve discrimination against employers liability act suits 59 there is an apparently strong argume nt however in support of congress power to eliminate jury trials in state causes of action heard in state courts the supreme court has held that section 2 of the fede ral arbitration act 9 usc 2 preempts conflicting state law this statute provides that agreements to arbitrate shall be valid irrevocable and enforceab and thus effectively liminates the right to jury trial in some state cases in southland corp v keating 465 us 1 11 1984 the supreme court found that the federal arbitration act rests on the authority of congress to enact substantive rules unde r the commerce clause and that it preempted state statute that had been interpreted to require judicial consideration of claims brought under state statute in perry v thomas 482 us 483 1987 and in doctors associates inc v casarotto 517 us 681 1996 the supreme court again found the federal arbitra tion act to preempt conflictin g state law if congress can eliminate judicial consideration of case then arguably it can eliminate jury consideration while retainin g judicial consideration httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs18 part iii conclusion tort reform generally congress has the authority to enact tort reform legislati on generally under its power to regulate interstate commerce and to make such legislation applicable to intrastate torts because tort suits generally affect interstate commerce however it may be unconstitutional for tort reform legislation to be applied to particular intrastate torts that arguably do not substantially affect interstate commerce there would appear to be due pr ocess or federalism or any other constitutional impediments to congress limiting state common law right of recovery the only exception concerns requi ring alternative dispute resolution that limits the right to jury trial b alternative dispute resolution the seventh amendment would preclude congress from eliminating the right to jury trial in common law tort actions brought in federal c ourt congress may however eliminate the right to bring common law tort actions in federal court or eliminate common law tort actions themselves congress apparently may creat article i tribunals such as arbitration panel to hear tort claims if it alters tort claims so that they are longer traditional common law actions but rather are like nofault workers compensation claims or if it allows novo review by an article iii court with the right to jury trial of trad itional common law tort actions rather than allow merely traditional appellate review it apparently may also opt for middle gr ound by altering the common law cause of action somewhat but not wholly and by providing for something less than novo review by an article iii court provided that the article iii court is not required to be too deferential to the findings of the article i tribunal finally strong argument may be ma that congress has the power to eliminate jury trials in tort actions brought in state court but this is uncertain httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95797crs19 appendix selected federal tort reform statutes employers liability act of 1908 35
