medicare part hospital update current law inpatient services provide d by acute care hospitals are reimbursed based on the inpatient prospective payment system ipps medicares payments are increased annuall by an update factor that is determined in part by the projected increase in the hospital market ba sket mb index this is fixed price index that measures the change in the price of goods and services purchased by hospitals to create one unit of output typically hospitals have received less than the mb index for an update for fy2005 nd beyond however hospitals that submit required quality data will recei ve the full mb update those that do not submit the data will receive reduction so that the update will be mb04 pe rcentage points in fy2005 and fy2006 and mb2 percentage points in fy2007 and beyond the reduction for not submitting qua lity data would apply for the applicable year and would not be taken into acc ount in subsequent years presidents proposal regardless of whether or not hospital submits quality data payments for hos pital inpatient services would be updated by mb 045 percentage points in 2007 and by mb 04 percentage points in 2008 and 2009 hospitals that do not submit quality data w ill receive the additi onal twopercentage point reduction skilled nursing facility update current law skilled nursing facility snf care is reimbursed based on prospective payment system pps the pps payments are based on daily perdiem urban or rural base payment amount that is adjusted for case mix and area wages using the hospital wage index the urban and rural federal per diem payment rates are increased annually by an update factor th at is determined by the projected increase in the snf market basket index this index measures changes in the costs of goods and services purchased by snfs for fy2004 and beyond the increase in snf payments are set at the market basket presidents proposal the snf payments would be frozen in 2007 and would increase by snf mb04 pe rcentage points in 2008 and 2009 inpatient rehabilitation facility update current law inpatient rehabilitation fac ilities irfs are paid based upon the irfpps and paid fixed amount per discharge the annual update to the payment is based on mb for rehabilitation psychiatric and longterm care thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33306crs3 update for fy2006 is 36 in fy2006 the irfipps includes onetime reduction of 19 to account for coding changes presidents proposal irf payments would be frozen for 2007 and would increase by mb04 percentage points in 2008 and 2009 hospice payment update current law payment for hospice care is base d on one of four prospectively determined rates which corre spond to four different levels of care for each day beneficiary is under the care of the hospice the four rate categories are routine home care continuous home care inpatient respite care and general inpatient care the prospective payment rates are updated annually by the increase in the hospital market basket national hospice payment rates for care furnished during fy2006 are as follows 1 routine home care at 12649 per day 2 continuous home care at 73826 for 24 hours of care or 3076 per hour 3 inpatient respite care at 13085 per day and 4 general i npatient care at 56269 per day presidents proposal the hospice payment update ie the increase in hospital market basket would be reduced by 04 percentage points in 2007 through 2009 adjust payment for hip and knee replacement current law patients receiving hip and knee replacements can receive rehabilitative care in variety of postacute care settings including snf and an inpatient rehabilitation facility generally care provided in an irf is paid at higher rate than care provided in snf presidents proposal eventually the goal would be to have siteneutral reimbursement rates for hip and knee re placement the proposal would focus on inpatient rehabilitation facilities they would be paid the average snf rate plus one third of the difference between the average irf rate and snf rate medicare part b outpatient hospital update current law hospital outpatient department hopd services are paid based on prospective payment system the unit of payment is the individual service or procedure as assigned to one of about 570 ambulatory payment classifications apcs medicares payment for hopd services is calculated by multiplying the relative weight associated w ith an apc by conversion factor the conversion factor is updated on calendar year schedule these annual updates are based on the hospital mb for cy2006 the inpatient hospital mb was 37 presidents proposal payments for hopd services would be mb045 percentage points in 2007 and mb 4 percentage points in 2008 and 2009httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33306crs4 ambulance fee schedule update current law medicare pays for ambulance serv ices on the basis of national fee schedule which is being phased in ove r transition period prior to july 2004 gradually increasing portion of the paym ent was based on the fee schedule and decreasing portion on the former payment methodology costs or charges the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernizati on act of 2003 mma established new methodology for ground ambulance services beginning july 2004 with payments through 2009 equal to the gr eater of the national fee schedule or blend of the national and re gional fee schedule amounts for july through december 2004 the blend was 20 of the national fee schedule rates and 80 of the regional rates the portion of the blend based on national rates increases each year in 2006 the blend is 60 national and 40 regional in cy 2010 and subsequently the payments in all areas will be based on the national fee schedule amount the fee schedule amounts are updated each year by the cpiu the update is 25 in 2006 mma provided an additional 2 payment increase for ru ral ambulance services and 1 payment increase for urban ambulan ce services for july 1 2004 through december 31 2006 presidents proposal the ambulance fee schedule update would be reduced by 04 percentage points in 2007 2008 and 2009 expand competitive bidding to laboratory services current law the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms tested competitive bidding process for durable medical equipment dme services under the dme demonstration medicares payments for medical equipment and supplies were based on the suppliers bids as compared with current law dme payments which are based on fee schedul cms plans to expand the process nationwide this does not pply to laboratory services presidents proposal this proposal would extend competitive bidding to medicare laboratory services eliminate indexing of threshold for incomerelated part b premiums current law currently beneficiaries enrolled in part b pay premiums covering about 25 of part b program costs beginning in 2007 individuals whose modified adjusted gross income agi exceeds 80000 and couples whose modified agi exceeds 160000 will be subject to higher premium amounts the increase will be phasedin over three years the income levels for determining who pays higher premium amounts would be indexed to the cpiu presidents proposal the annual income leve ls of 80000 for individuals and 160000 for couples would longer be i ndexed each year so that these levels would remain fixedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33306crs5 pay for shortterm power wheelchairs current law in general medicare pays for certain durable medical equipment dme items such as hosp ital beds nebulizers and powerdriven wheelchairs under the capped rent category suppliers ar required to transfer the title of dme equipment in the capped rental category to the beneficiary after 13 month rental period beneficiaries ve the option to purchase powerdriven wheelchairs when they are initially furnished presidents proposal the proposal would reimburse shortterm power wheelchair usage based on actual time used versus paying up front at the full purchase price limit oxygen rental period current law rental payments for oxygen equipment including portable oxygen equipment are converted to ow nership at 36 months the supplier is required to transfer the title of the equipment to the beneficiary at that time medicare will continue to make payments for oxygen contents in the case of gaseous and liquid oxygen for the period of medical need presidents proposal the proposal would move oxygen and oxygen equipment from 36month rental period to 13month period the same as the capped rental category medicare would continue to pay for refills of gaseous and liquid oxygen as medically necessary medicare parts and b home health update current law home health agencies hhas are paid under prospective payment system payment is based on 60 day episodes of care for beneficiaries subject to several adjustments with unlimited episodes of care in year the payment covers skilled nursing therapy medical social services aide visits and medical supplies the base payment amount or national st andardized 60day episode rate is increased annually by an upda factor that is termined in part by the projected increase in the home health market basket index this index measures changes in the costs of goods and servi ces purchased by hhas the 2006 update for hhas is frozen beginning in 20 07 hhas must s ubmit quality data to the secretary those hhas that submit the data will receive full mb update while those hhas that do not submit the require d data will receive an update of mb2 percentage points presidents proposal payments for hhas would be frozen in 2007 and would increase by hha mb04 percentage points in 2008 and 2009 hhas that do not submit quality data will receive the dditional two percenta ge point reductionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33306crs6 establish federal data sharing clearinghouse for medicare secondary payer current law the law authorizes data match program intended to identify cases where an insurer other than medicare is the primary payer this information is used to both facilitate recoveries when incorrect medicare payments have been made and identify secondary payer situations before dicare payments are made medicare recipients are matched against data contained in social security administration and internal revenue service files to identify cases in which working beneficiary or working spouse ma have employerbased health insurance coverage the centers for medicar and medicaid services cms sends questionnaires to certain id entified employers to deter mine which of them offers health insurance and to determine the insurance status of specific beneficiaries currently medicare has voluntary arrang ement with about 40 of employers presidents proposal the proposal would estab lish federal data sharing clearinghouse to clarify and expand medi care secondary payer instances this proposal would extend the arrangement to all employers who w ould be required to provide cms with cove rage information this information would be used to ensure that proper payments were made by the re sponsible insurer and to recover improperly made payments the data would be shared with medicare medicaid tricare the veterans administration the federal employees health benefits program indian health service and others extend medicare secondary payer status for end stage renal disease current law the medicare secondary pa yer msp program prohibits medicare payments for any item or service when payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made by th ird party payer medicare is the secondary payer to insurance plans and programs under certain conditions for beneficiaries covered through group health plan base d on either their own or their spouses current employment for individuals with medicare entitlement based on end stage renal disease esrd medicare is the s econdary payer for the first 30 months of esrd benefit eligibility after 30 months medicare becomes the primary insurer medicare entitlement based on esrd usually begins with the third month after the month in which the beneficiary star ts regular course of dialysis presidents proposal medicare secondary payment status for esrd enrollees would be extended from 30 to 60 months phaseout medicare bad debt payments current law medicare pays the costs of certain items on reasonable cost basis outside the applicab prospective payment system including the unpaid debt for beneficiaries coinsurance and deductible amounts while some providers receive 100 reimbursement for allo wable bad debt since 2001 acu care hospitals receive 70 of the reasonable costs beginning in 2006 snfs also receive 70 for only those beneficiaries who are not dually eligible for medi care and medicaid for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33306crs7 dual eligibles the bad debt reimbursement w ill remain at 100 other providers currently receiving reimbursement for bad bt include critical access hospitals rural health clinics esrd facilities federally qualified health clinics community mental health clinics and certain health ma intenance organizations among others presidents proposal this proposal would phase out bad debt reimbursement to provide rs between 2007 and 2011 there would be special exemptions for dual eligibles in snfs or in other providers premium interactions because medicare part b premiums are based on percentage of total part b costs any changes to the medicare part b program or to the calculation of medicare part b premiums will also have sec ondary budgetary effect when the higher income beneficiaries begin paying larger share of premiums medicare part b revenues will increase further some medicare beneficiaries may decide not to enroll in part b while other current enrollees may disenroll because of their larger premiums the interaction with the inde xing proposal is included as savings because the increased revenues are estimate d to translate into less spending to provide services for these hi gher income beneficiaries there is cost associated with part b benefit savings that occurs because any savings to the program are shared between the medicare progra m and beneficiaries as beneficiaries pay share generally 25 of program costs or beginning in 2007 for certain higher income beneficiaries larger share of program costs for example for those beneficiar ies paying 25 of premiums for every dollar saved the medicare outlays will be reduced by bout 075 and beneficiar ies will save about 025 the savings for the individual proposals listed in table 1 are the gross savings and the offset for savings to benefi ciaries is shown in the interaction line of the table fortyfive percent rule current law the hospital insurance h i and supplementary medical insurance smi trust funds are overseen by board of trustees who make annual reports to congress the mma section 801 requires the trustees report to include an expanded analysis of medicare expe nditures and revenues specifically determination must be made as to whether gene ral revenue financing will exceed 45 of total medicare outlays within th next seven years general revenues financing is defined as total medicare outla ys minus dedicated fi nancing sources ie hi payroll taxes income from taxation of so cial security benefits state transfers for prescription drug benefits premiums paid under parts b and d and any gifts received by the trust funds the 2005 trust ees report projected that the 45 trigger would first be exceeded in 2012 which wa s beyond the require d sevenyear test period ie 20052011 the 2005 report theref ore did not include determination of excess general revenue funding howe ver the 2012 estimated date for exceeding the trigger suggests that such determin ation could be included in the 2006 reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33306crs8 mma sections 802804 further requires that if an excess general revenue funding determination is made for two successive year s the president is required to submit legislative proposal to respond to the warning the congress is required to consider the proposal on an expedited basis however passage of legislation within specific time frame is not required presidents proposal the presidents budget includes an automatic reduction to all medicare payments if ge neral revenue financ ing is projected to exceed 45 of total medicare financing and only when that threshold is met and congress fails to act on recommendations to reduce that level in such case four tenths of 1 reduction woul d be made across the board to all medicare payments this reduction would grow by fourtenths of 1 for every year that the 45 threshold was exceeded there are threshold savings included in the fiveyear budget window the cbo estimate of the pres idents budget assumes that the trigger will be reached in fy2011 cbo estimate as shown in table 1 cbo has slightly different estimates of the medicare savings proposals included in the presiden ts budget however the cbo estimates have separate savings estimate for the medicare advantage program as result of the savings in feeforservice spending according to hhs they have incorporated the ma savings into the individual pr oposals making direct comparison of individual savings such as hospital update difficult to compare therefore it is more appropriate to compar total savings for the fiveyear budget window cbo estimates slightly higher savings of 37 b illion compared with the administrations estimate of 359 billion congressional activity senate activity the senate budget committee pa ssed its fy2007 budget resolution sconres 83 on march 9 which will now be considered by the senate the chairmans mark assumes that the authorizing committees which for medicare is the senate finance committee will continue to examine and reform programs to achieve savings and demons trate continued progress toward deficit reduction however the mark does not provide the senate finance committee with reconciliation instructions the chairmans mark provides 382 b illion for medicare in 2007 an increase of 55 billion over 2006 or 17 without gislative changes medicare spending is projected to grow to 518 billion in 2011 an average annual growth rate of 97 and total growth of 59 however the mark assumes savings in medicare spending through the repeal of the stabilization f und included in the medicare modernization act saving 7 billion over five years the mark assumes an increase in medicarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33306crs9 spending for extending the moratorium on therapy caps costing 710 million over five years the mark also includes new point of or der against direct spending legislation if and when it is determined that within seven years the gene ral fund contributions to medicare funding will exceed 45 of to tal medicare outlays and if medicare funding warning has been submitted to the senate for two consecutive calendar years direct spending proposals will not be subject to points of order if new spending is offset by changes in spending receipts or revenues the chairman may withdraw the notification when legislation to redu ce the general fund contribution to medicare is enacted the mark also includes seve ral deficitneutral reserve funds for legislation that could affect medicare incl uding reserve fund that provides incentives or other support for the adoption of health inform ation technology to improve health care quality and also provides for performan cebased payments based on an accepted clinical performance measure that improves the quality in health care the chairman of the budget committee may make adjustments in allocations and aggregates so that such legislation would not increase the deficit in 2007 or for the period of 20072011 similarly the mark includes 175 billion in reserve funds for the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to create demonstration project that assigns case manager to coordinate the care of chronically ill and other highcost medicare beneficiaries in traditional feeforservice medicare the resolution was passed by the sena with amendments on march 19 2006 some of the amendments that passed coul d affect the medicare program samdt 3004 would ensure that any savings associated with legislation that authorizes the secretary of health and human services to use the medicares collective purchasing power to negotiate prices in fallback pl ans for part d prescription drugs and by private drug plans if asked and in other circumstances but not permitting uniform formulary or price setting is reserved for deficit reduction or to improve the medicare drug benefit samdt 3073 addresses the medicare pres cription drug program if the committee on finance of the senate reports bill an amendment or conference report that 1 authorizes the secretary of health and human services to extend the initial open enrollment period under part d of title xv iii of the social security act beyond may 15 2006 2 provides funding to the centers for medicare and medicaid services and the social security administration for the purpose of conducting enrollment activities for the peri od of any extension of the initial open enrollment period 3 waives the application of the late enrollment penalty for the period of any extension of the initial open enrollment period and 4 permits beneficiaries to change their enrollment election in such part d once during the initial open enrollment period including throug hout any extension of the initial open enrollment period the chairman of the committee on the budget of the senate may make the appropriate adjustments in allocations and aggregates to the extent that such legislation would not increase the defi cit for fy2007 and for the period of fy2007 fy2011httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33306crs10 samdt 3110 would establish reserve fund for physician payment increase under medicare if 1 the committee on fina nce reports bill an amendment or conference report that has the effect of increasing the reimbursement rate for medicare physician services and 2 the committee is within its allocation as provided under section 302a of the co ngressional budget act of 1974 the chairman of the committee on the budget of the senate may make the appropriate adjustments in allocations and aggregates to the

the full house is expected during the week of april 3 based on currently available documents it is unclear whether the resolution includes any of the president s medicare proposals or other ad justments to funding for these programs it includes reconciliation instructions for the house ways and means committee which has jurisdiction over medicare as well as many other programs because the
