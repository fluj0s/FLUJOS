httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32959methamphetamine lab cleanup and remediation issues summary methamphetamine meth drug with limited medical use and high potential for abuse and addiction is subject of wi despread concern once associated mainly with the west coast and white male bluecollar workers illicit meth is now used by diverse population groups nationwide with concentrations in the west southwest and midwest meth is s upplied primarily by clandestine labs in california and mexico the drug is relatively simple to make from easily obtained recipes but access to certain ingredients s become more difficult meth production in small toxic labs stls increased in itially due to the successful closure of some superlabs labs capable of making more than 10 pounds of meth in 24hour cycle relative ease of making meth conti nuing demand for the drug and desire for potential wealth and invol vement in criminal underground social activity although the greater fraction of meth used and distributed across the nation comes from superlabs the sheer number of st ls their geographic diffusion and their residual impacts have prompted concern in congress state and local governments law enforcement agencies and real estate and other groups meth labs have many significant and widespread residual impacts according to the united states drug enforcemen t administration dea there were 9092 stls and related meth sites in 2000 and 17356 in 2003 the number has been declining since these sites can be found in wide range of pl aces such as apartments motel rooms ab andoned buildings and packed in car trunks in parks and other locations meth makers can use common items such as mason jars coffee filters hot plates overthe counter medications cont aining pseudoephedrine or ephedrine eg sudafed and some othe r nonprescription decongestants acetone hydrochloric acid and anhydr ous ammonia making meth can result in eye and respiratory irritations chemical burns ex plosions and fires toxic wastes and contaminated surroundings some residua l impacts of meth production threaten the health and welfare of children removed from meth sites this report focuses on the residual environmenta l impacts of stls cleaning and remediating meth site can cost more than 200000 depending on the magnitude of contamination state and local governments that incur expenses cleaning site can apply to the us environmental protection agency epa for reimbursement up to 25000 per in cident alternatively rather than incur costs and apply for capped reimbursement state and local governments can notify dea of

diffusion of the illicit production of methamphetamine meth has spread haza rdous manufacturing wa stes and related concerns into communities nationwide the need to reduce the potential safety health and environmental zards of these wastes by cleaning and remediating the sites of illicit production consequently also has spread na tionwide cleanup is the term often used to describe removing gro ss or largescale contaminants such as equipment and large quantities of chemicals cleanup is usually done for the purpose of securing evidence for criminal investigations and for reducing imminent hazards such as explosions or fires remedia tion is often used to describe removing residual or smallscale contaminants such as chemical residues in carpeting or walls usually for the purpose of rehabilitating facility for reoccupancy or reuse while there are many ways to make meth the most common way begins with overthecounter medicati ons containing pseudoe phedrine or ephedrine1 and often involves cooking with acetone hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide ether and anhydrous ammonia to serially concentr ate and purify the meth cooking meth which can result in eye and respiratory i rritations chemical burns explosions and fires toxic waste products and contaminat ed surroundings can be dangerous to the meth cook to the people and community around the lab and to those persons who first come upon the lab such as fire fighte rs law enforcement fficials emergency medical technicians or social welfare workers there are reports of emergency medical technicians and police officers suffering burns eye and respiratory irritations nausea and other injuries not just at meth labs but even from treating persons removed from the labs2 depending on the process used and the skill of the cook each pound of meth produces about six pounds of hazardous waste illicit meth cooks usually dump this waste into sewers streams rivers or the ground near the lab which may be farmland or land over groundwat er supplies along highwa ys in parks and forests or on hiking trails water used to extinguish lab fires also carries toxic chemicals into the environment cooking meth can so infuse carpeting

nonprescription pseudoephedrine containing decongestants common meth ingredient over time the number of states and retailers restricting access to meth ingredients increased which made the tactic of traveling to nearby state or store that did not have policy to restrict access to meth ingredients more difficult some pharmaceutical companies re formulated their nonprescription decongestants to

stat and local governments law enforcement agencies and real estate and other groups residual impacts of meth labs there generally are greater concerns bout the environmental wastes from stls than from superlabs for several reasons fi rst there is trend for superlabs and their wastes to be in mexico where the ingredients for illicit meth can be obtained more easily than in the united states second production pro cesses used in stls tend to be less efficient than those used in superlabs and smallscale cooks tend more often to be careless resulting in proportionally more contaminants in the meth and in the environment than production pro cesses in superlabs third while there are fewer superlabs there are thousa nds of stls across the united states approximately 9000 domestic

among wide range of sites ch as apartments motel rooms abandoned buildings even packed in car trunks nd moved among parks and other locations fifth the range of wastes from stls can be more varied and unpredictable than superlab wastes because smallscale independent cooks may develop new recipe or use any of number of meth r ecipes available on the internet the range of recipes and resulting wastes may be driven by the local availability of critical ingredients or equipment the range of substitutes for pure ingredients and sophisticated production equipment may include common items such as decongestants from retail and convenience stores mason jars coffee filters hot plates pressure cookers plas tic tubing and gasoline cans there is range of residual impacts of sm allscale labs children of some stl cooks have been found in residences wher their parents were making meth meth levels as high as 5000 micrograms per cubic meter of air have been measured during cook which almost ensures that anyone inc luding children in the vicinity of the cook will test positive for meth some children taken from home meth labs may show permanent damage to their respir atory tracts and possibly to their nervous systems17 the health and social welfare of these children whether with or removed from their parents are issues of concern research and cost further some meth cooks and others in th
