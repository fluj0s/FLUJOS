sanaa 01669 classified by ambassador stephen seche for reasons 14b and d 1 snf summary as the sixth war against the houthis continues to squeeze yemens conventional military the royg has looked to its us and ukfunded and trained counterterrorism forces to provide some relief to battered army forces the counter terrorism unit ctu trained to detect small terrorist cells and investigate and prevent terror attacks on civilian targets is poor tactical choice for use against longterm domestic insurgency the royg desperate to defeat the houthis at any cost has largely ignored usg concerns regarding deployment of the ctu to saada the ctu has been unable to go after genuine terrorist targets like alqaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap while it has been tied down in saada ctu involvement in royg operation against aqap on the morning of december 17 is welcome return to its core mission although it remains to be seen if this was any more than oneoff occurrence end summary signs of royg desperation in saada 2 c as the sixth war in saada now in its fifth month drags on in titfortat struggle between royg military forces and houthi rebels the royg has attempted to use its elite ct forces to provide needed extra musclexxxxx told poloff in late november that he felt his forces were being pulled into the saada conflict because of the perception that the ctu is made up of supermen that can solve any problem and defeat anybody note ctu forces were initially sent to saada in july to investigate the kidnapping of group of western aid workers post assesses that the ctu was drawn into the houthi conflict in early september end note such misperception of the ctus capabilities and mission was hurting the unit xxxxx added during the usyemen joint staff talks hosted in sanaa november 811 xxxxx publicly impressed upon brigadier general ali dahan of the yemen special operations forces ysof another elite military unit also involved in ct operations and other senior ministry of defense mod leadership the severity of the situation in saada and the toll it was taking on the ctu he told dahan you may not be feeling the hurt of this war but the ctu is fighting in saada and is taking casualties comment xxxxx was angry with dahan for stating that the ysof was ready and available for more training exercises with us forces while the ctu was being deployed in saada he believes the ysof should be doing more in saada which would allow the ctu to return to its primary mission end comment 3 snf increasingly desperate to defeat the houthis the royg continues to insist that fighting the houthis is legitimate component of ct operations thus justifying the use of ctu forces in saada the national security bureaus colonel akram alqassmi told poloffs on december 9 the war against the houthis is not distraction from the ct fight it is the ct fight xxxxx despite the injection of ctu forces into the fight three months ago the saada war drags on and according to ctu leadership the ctu is taking heavy casualties due to their lack of training for this type of warfare at the urging of ctu leadership the supreme security council agreed to move all ctu forces two platoons out of saada on december 9 xxxxx confirmed that the moi regional commander ordered elements of the ctu believed to be one platoon to remain in saada until saada city is cleared of houthi fighters ct operations constrained due to saada war 4 snf following the return of one platoon to sanaa the ctu undertook its first ct operation against aqap in four months on the morning of december 17 however according to xxxxx deployment to saada has hurt the ctus readiness capabilities ideally the unit is primed for rapid response to any ct threat in and around sanaa within 10 minutes the sanaa 00002230 002 of 002 ctu is broken into four platoons which rotate every two weeks one on leave second in training third on standby and fourth as quick reaction force qrf with one platoon in saada and another on active duty in sanaa the ctu has surge capacity xxxxx said that the ctus training and operational cycle has been disrupted by the saada war since august the qrf has been in saada taking heavy casualties because they have been engaged in heavy fighting we have only had chance to send relief team twice since the latest conflict started he said that the use of usgprovided armored vehicles and humvees has been fundamental in preventing casualties note post has repeatedly questioned royg use of us military equipment and ustrained forces intended to combat aqap in the war against the houthi rebels end note 5 snf the ctu was established just six years ago at the urging of the usg and has received substantial funding and training from us special operations forces and british conventional army trainers their training has focused on detecting and neutralizing the aqap threat not fighting longterm domestic insurgency in particular the ctu is predominantly trained for ct direct action missions in which they isolate an aqap cell and capture its members based on specific intelligence referring to the guerilla warfare tactics the houthis have been using against traditional royg military forces xxxxx us training in unconventional warfare and tactics used by the us forces in asymmetric warfare of the type encountered in the mountains of afghanistan suggesting the ctu expects to continue to use its forces in saada comment 6 snf bogged down in seemingly unwinnable war that pits conventional forces against determined rebels the royg has resorted to using its specialized ct units untrained to fight this type of conflict the overstretched ctu has reportedly sustained significant casualties missed training opportunities and been derailed from its principal mission to combat aqap while us concerns over diversion of troops and equipment have been acknowledged they have clearly not resulted in significant change of royg focus from the houthis to aqap ctu deployment to saada while distraction is not crushing blow to all potential ct activities as demonstrated by the december 17 ct operation however it remains to be seen if this indicates balancing of priorities between the houthi conflict and aqap or if it is simply momentary return to the ctus primary mission end comment seche
