vaughn analyst in southeast and south asian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade congressional research service the library of congress papua indonesia issues for congress summary the ongoing investigation into the killing of two american citizens current human rights conditions and reports of an indonesian military buildup in papua have led to increased congressional attention to indonesias easternmost territory papua for the purposes of this report refers to the resource rich western half of the island of new guinea and not the nation or people of papua new guinea which is situated on the eastern half of the island while the people of papua have been subject to human rights abuses while under indonesian rule the ongoing expansion of democracy and civil society in indonesia and the leadership of president yudhoyono hold out the possibility that the human rights situation in papua may improve some view the current improvement in the bilateral relationship between the united states and indonesia as providing an enhanced opportunity for the united states to continue to support the expansion of democracy the rule of law civil society and human rights while developing closer militarytomilitary relations with valuable partner in the war against terror and key geopolitical actor in the southeast asian region such policies by fostering more democratic and open society may also contribute to an improved human rights situation in papua others including some members of congress contend that indonesias failure thus far to bring to trial those responsible for the timika incident and other human rights abuses suggests that the indonesian military tni remains at least in part outside government control and that the united states should continue to suspend some kinds of military assistance the recent arrest of anthonius wamang who is thought to have carried out the attack which killed two americans near timika in 2002 may resolve what has been key obstacle to improved militarytomilitary ties between indonesia and the united states it also has the potential to raise further questions concerning the incident this report will be

indonesia issues for congress papua indonesia refers to the western half of the island of new guinea and encompasses the indonesian provinces of west irian jaya or irian jaya barat and papua some also refer to this region of indonesia as west papua papua has population of approximately two million and an estimated area of 422000 square kilometers which represents about 21 of the land mass and 1 of the population of indonesia about 12 million of the estimated two million inhabitants of papua are indigenous melanesian people from about 250 different tribes which are distinct from the malay people of indonesia most of the rest of the people have transmigrated to papua from elsewhere in indonesia the province is rich in mineral resources and timber1 us interest in papua congress attention to papua has largely focused on the 2002 attack against americans near timika and the human rights situation of the indigenous melanesian people of papua congress has also expressed interest in the reported military buildup in papua these interests have evolved against backdrop of greatly improved relations between the united states and indonesia in 2005 an expanded separatist movement in papua also could lead to greater violence papuan issues tend to be subsumed into overall us relations with and policy toward indonesia in 2005 there was considerable change in us relations with indonesia the february 2005 decision by the bush administration to allow indonesia to participate in international military education and training imet was followed by may 2005 decision to restart nonlethal foreign military sales fms to indonesia and november 2005 decision to waive foreign military financing fmf restrictions due to us national security concerns2 in this way past concerns over human rights in indonesia including those in papua which had limited the extent of the militarytomilitary relationship have apparently not been given as much weight by policy makers as they have previously due to indonesias democratic development and american security concerns3 to many this foreign policy issue has 1 people under the jackboot the west australian september 18 2004 2 state department

security concerns have shifted the locus of policy determinants in favor of the executive branch which currently is seeking to develop closer ties with indonesia there is concern among some that the message that the united states is still concerned with the human rights situation in indonesia needs to continue to be conveyed to indonesia so that jakarta does not view this shift in americas position as signal that america is now less concerned with human rights issues as the peace process in aceh has progressed increased attention has been focused on the human rights situation in papua in testimony before congress in march 2005 ambassador marie hutala stated that the democratic transition underway in indonesia represents an important opportunity for the us she added our first priority is to encourage continued indonesian progress on democracy human rights and justice 4 the department of states country report on human rights practices for indonesia makes the following

indonesia 6 in his statement before the senate foreign relations subcommittee on east asia and pacific affairs deputy assistant secretary of state eric g john stated that papua has suffered from separatist conflict and serious human rights abuses the indonesian government has not fully implemented the 2001 special autonomy law that was designed to address political and economic grievances john also pointed out that president yudhoyono had vowed to peacefully resolve the longstanding conflict in papua and pledged to fully implement special autonomy7 timika in august 2002 two americans and an indonesian working for the pt freeport mine subsidiary of the new orleans based freeport mcmoran cooper and gold inc were killed in an ambush near timika papua the incident occurred on road with military checkpoints leading to the freeport mine and reportedly took place over at least 30minute period8 to date circumstances surrounding the timika attack remain unclear the two americans killed were teachers at the international school at tembagapura near timika in papua they and their family and friends came under attack while on picnic outing indonesian police indicated at one point early in the investigation that elements from the indonesian military may have been involved in the attack some of those who believe that elements of the military may have played role believe that it could have been done in an effort to discredit the free papua movement opm which seeks independence for papua some propapuan independence supporters believe anthonius wamang who is believed to be an opm operational commander and has been indicted for the attack in the united states may have been an informer to the indonesian military tni9 5 department of state country report on human rights

proindonesian militia10 wamang was arrested in papua on january 12 2006 details of the 2002 incident should come to light as wamangs interrogation proceeds though some are concerned his testimony will be coerced or twisted in such way as to exonerate the military11 wamang has reportedly stated that he carried out the attack but that three men in indonesian military uniforms joined in the attack it has been reported that indonesian soldiers and disgruntled papuans have acted together against freeport at one point orchestrating riots to extract greater benefits from its huge operations wamangs statements now suggest that this same loose coalition may also have been responsible for the killing of the teachers12 it also remains unclear whether indonesia will extradite wamang to the united states it has also been reported that wamang and his group turned themselves in believing that they were to be taken by the fbi to the united states and not into indonesian custody13 congressional involvement in 2005 confusion in indonesia arose over the us position on papua because of proposed congressional legislation14 indonesian reports on proposed congressional legislation led many in indonesia to believe that the proposed legislation had already become law and that the united states government as whole was advocating the independence of papua the indonesian house of representatives reportedly warned the indonesian government to take all possible measures to discourage legislation in the united states congress on papua15 these fears in the minds of indonesians are made more understandable given indonesias colonial past and the history of east timor the former indonesian province of east timor held vote on autonomy or independence in 1999 which resulted in the independence of east timor the indonesian house of representatives dpr interparliamentary cooperation board sought clarification on us policy on papua the united states embassy responded to the

guinea papuas tribal groups are thought to speak some 15 of the worlds languages19 the indigenous melanesian people20 of papua have culture dating back by some estimates 40000 years this background differs significantly from the malay character of the rest of the indonesian archipelago the spanish were the first europeans to discover the islands in 1546 the dutch laid claim to papua in 1828 and by 1910 they had an agreement with britain and germany who controlled the southeast and northeastern parts of new guinea respectively which recognized dutch control over the western half of new guinea like indonesia papua was dutch colonial possession unlike indonesia it did not become part of newly independent indonesia at the time of indonesias independence in 1949 the dutch argued that its ethnic and cultural difference justified dutch control until later date under former president sukarno indonesia began mounting military pressure on dutch west papua in 1961 as outlined in report by the council on foreign relations in 1962 the united states pressured the dutch to turn over control of west papua to the united nations under the americanbrokered new york agreement of 1962 indonesia was to make arrangements with the assistance and participation of the united nations to give papuans an opportunity to determine whether they wished to become part of indonesia or not indonesia assumed control over papua in 1963 in the act of free choice carried out in 1969 selected delegates decided to join indonesia21 the act of free choice is generally not considered to have been

generally considered to have failed in its mission to give the people of papua an opportunity for self determination23 to some while western colonial policy was coming to an end new chapter of asiatic colonial policy was opening24 the proindependence free papua movement opm emerged as these events were unfolding it has been estimated by human rights advocate groups that 100000 papuans have died as the result of indonesian control in papua though others have more recently challenged the scale of this figure25 declassified documents released in july 2004 indicate that the united states supported indonesias take over of papua in the lead up to the 1969 act of free choice even as it was understood that such move was likely unpopular with papuans the documents reportedly indicate that the united states estimated that between 85 and 90 of papuans were opposed to indonesian rule and that as result the indonesians were incapable of winning an open referendum at the time of papuas transition from dutch colonial rule such steps were evidently considered necessary to maintain the support of suhartos indonesia during the cold war similar view was taken towards east timor26 central to the conflict in papua is its vast natural wealth most of which stems from resource extraction industry particularly mining and logging fisheries resources are another potentially valuable resource economic activity in builtup areas is dominated by malay migrants from elsewhere in indonesia traditionally only small percentage of the wealth generated by the natural resources of papua has remained in the province papua is one of indonesias poorest provinces despite its extensive natural resource wealth under the special autonomy law for papua of 2001 70 of oil and gas royalties and 80 of mining forestry and fisheries royalties are supposed to go to the province the human rights situation in papua while noting that indonesia generally made substantial progress in strengthening its democracy

increased attention on the human rights situation in papua indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono has called for political settlement within the framework of special autonomy within the unitary republic of indonesia the opm has continued to press for independence while the indonesian government has yet to fully implement previous autonomy measures and is going forward with move to divide the province28 there have been reports that funds allocated for the implementation of the special autonomy law have been used to finance military operations in papua29 in august 2005 the centre for peace and conflict studies at the university of sydney in new south wales australia published report genocide in west papua which assesses the treatment of papuans by the tni the report details series of concerns which if not acted upon may pose serious threats to the survival of the indigenous people of the indonesian province of papua it covers the threats posed by the indonesian military to the provinces stability the recent increase in large scale military campaigns which are decimating highland tribal communities the hivaids explosion and persistent papuan underdevelopment in the face of rapid and threatening demographic transition in which the papuans face becoming minority in their own land30 the report also states that culture of impunity exists in indonesia which sees its highest

stated that the situation in west papua requires much more than words34 other groups have similarly found evidence of repression report by the us eastwest center on the conflict in papua has found that the indonesian governments approach to papua has ranged from the overtly repressive to the occasionally accommodative and observed that the cycles of repression and alienation simply consolidate papuan identity and support for independence35 human rights watch hrw has described the tnis actions in papua as responding to the opm with disproportionate force adding that unarmed civilians continue to be among those injured or killed in military reprisals arbitrary detention torture disappearances and arson are widespread in this vast and isolated region of indonesia hrw has also pointed to the influx of nonmelanesian indonesians who remain largely in the towns and are mostly malay muslims as opposed to the more rural and christian native melanesian papuans and who present volatile mix susceptible to manipulation by unscrupulous political leaders36 while the 2004 report indonesian human rights abuses in west papua by the allard k lowenstein international human rights clinic at yale university law school did not offer definitive conclusion about whether genocide has occurred in papua it finds in the available evidence strong indication that the indonesia government has committed genocide against the west papuans it goes on to state that even if the violence committed against papuans were not committed with the intent to destroy the papuans as group many of these acts clearly constitute crime against humanity37 an international dimension to the conflict arose in january 2006 when group of 43 papuans fled to australia in an outrigger canoe and asked for

estimated 33 billion in direct and indirect benefits over the period 1992 to 200441 its impact is reportedly less positive at the local level direct benefits to indonesia reportedly total 26 billion from 1992 to 2004 freeport reported that it paid indonesia in excess of 1 billion in taxes royalties and dividends in 2005 freeport has also stated that it has spent approximately 200 million on freeport partnership fund for community development since 199642 it is at the local level that the environmental impact and social dislocating impact of the mines operations are felt the mine will generate an estimated 6 billion tons of waste before completion of operations much of the waste has made its way into ground water rivers and low lying wet lands rendering them according to one study unsuitable for aquatic life freeport has been accused in the past by tribal groups and western activists of environmental degradation abetting the militarys presence in papua and not sharing enough wealth with local people43 in 1995 the overseas private investment corporation withdrew freeports political risk insurance apparently over environmental concerns44 in its defense freeport reportedly has undertaken initiatives to seek to address the negative impact of the mine freeport has an avowed commitment to promoting sustainable development and reportedly spent 727 million in 2004 on environmental management and social development to minimize and mitigate negative environmental impacts and to maximize positive economic and social development freeport has stated that it does not

freeport mcmoran mining company has had financial relationship with the tni for some time after disturbances at the mine in 1996 freeport reportedly began spending on military infrastructure and set up an emergency planning department to handle the mines relationship with the military which began making direct monthly payments to indonesian military commanders freeport reportedly gave military and police officers and units close to 20 million between 1998 and 2004 these payments are thought to be in addition to tens of millions spent by freeport on military infrastructure47 such payments have been reported in the past48 payments were also reportedly made to the police two theories for attacks against freeport are that they were either part of turf war between the military and the police for access to freeport payments or that the military was reacting to potential reductions in freeport payments49 indonesian attorney general abdul rahman saleh has stated he would look into allegations that freeport made payments to the military which the indonesian government has reportedly stated are illegal freeport has said that it has broken laws by providing support to troops based near the mine50 the state ministry for the environment was reportedly planning to send team to inspect the environmental management of pt freeports operation in january 200651 the government of indonesia president susilo bambang yudhoyono has ruled out independence for papua but has at times appeared open to some degree of autonomy for the province he is also opposed to the internationalization of the conflict and views it as an internal affair for indonesia52 communications and information minister sofyan djalil stated before working group of the dpd or regional representatives council that the government of indonesia viewed papua as different situation from aceh and as such would not involve the international community in the settlement of the dispute

sutarto is reported as suspecting that there is an international conspiracy to separate papua from indonesia55 insight into president susilo bambang yudhoyonos perspective on the human rights situation in papua may be gleaned from his call for further investigation and inquiry into the death of human rights activist munir thalib who was poisoned on garuda flight from indonesia to amsterdam the president ordered new investigation after the trial of pollycarpus budihari priyanto not only found priyanto guilty of poisoning munir but also concluded that the motive was to prevent munir from criticizing the military and governments role in human rights abuses in sentencing priyanto the court made connection between him and former deputy chief of state intelligence muchdi purwopranjono56 by ordering further investigation yudhoyono appears to be making stand on human rights in indonesia measure of openness in government led to moves towards autonomy for papua in the reformasi period following the end of president suhartos authoritarian rule this led president habibie in 1999 to enact laws to allow papua to keep an increased share of locally generated wealth the indonesian peoples legislative council dpr also passed legislation granting special autonomy for papua which called for the establishment of papua peoples council and reaffirmed customary law 57 this period of openness to local autonomy lost momentum and its provisions were never fully implemented subsequently in january 2003 thenpresident megawati moved to divide the province into three provinces an action viewed by many papuans as designed to undermine and divide their cause in early 2005 the government of president susilo bambang yudhoyono apparently supported plans to divide the province further in february 2005 papuan governor jap salossa announced plans to divide papua into five provinces after courts ruled that previous plans to divide papua into three provinces contradicted the 2001 special autonomy law in its ruling the constitutional court did allow the division of papua into two provinces papua and west irian jaya provinces58 approval of the then yet to be established papuan peoples council which was to be made up of representative traditional leaders religious leaders and women was viewed as important the indonesian government reportedly accepted the governors plan to divide the

new order regime of former president suharto traces unilateral autonomy measures towards papua during the reform period which followed and also points to indonesias back sliding on promises made under the special autonomy law enacted during the reform period his analysis posits correlation between the level of power at the center relative to the fissiparous tendencies pulling at the indonesian state he also attributes the unilateral nature of the special autonomy law which emanated from jakarta as reason why the center was able to move away from its provisions for this reason he states

earlier draft of the legislation language in sec 1115 of the foreign relations authorization hr 2601 which passed the house and was placed on the calendar in the senate see below also created concern in indonesia the text of the proposed legislation noted with grave concern human rights violations by the tni particularly in areas of communal and separatist conflict and made number of findings related to papua and would if passed require reports on special autonomy for papua and on the act of free choice such proposed legislative language created much concern in indonesia and was interpreted by many there as enacted law and us policy the conference report hrept 109265 while noting that the papua language proposed by the senate sec 6109 was not included in the conference agreement does direct the secretary of state to submit report on papua as required by the senate provision the following text is drawn from hr 3057 the foreign operations export financing and related programs appropriations act 2006 as enrolled as agreed to or passed by both the house and senate the earlier public print which included section 6109 relevant language from the conference report and section 1115 of hr 2601 as placed on the calendar in the senate it should be noted that efforts to revisit the act of free choice are viewed by many in indonesia as challenge to their sovereignty over papua and are thus viewed as provocative intrusion by the united states into what they view as an internal domestic issue some analysts and practitioners would argue that americas policy toward papua should be balanced against larger policy concerns related to indonesia such as the need to support indonesias emerging democracy and the need to continue to cultivate indonesia as partner in the war against terror in southeast asia and for other geopolitical considerations others would argue that the united states must do all it can to curb human rights abuses by the indonesian military while others would argue that these two approaches can be blended crs17 appendix related legislation hr 3057 the foreign operations export financing and related programs appropriations act 2006 as enrolled

organizations and media be allowed unfettered access throughout indonesia including in papua and aceh 5 notes with grave concern that reform of the indonesian security forces has not kept pace with democratic political reform and that the indonesian military is subject to inadequate civilian control and oversight lacks budgetary transparency and continues to emphasize an internal security role within indonesia b members of the indonesian security forces continue to commit many serious human rights violations including killings torture rape and arbitrary detention particularly in areas of communal and separatist conflict and c the government of indonesia largely fails to hold soldiers and police accountable for extrajudicial killings and other serious human rights abuses both past and present including atrocities committed in east timor prior to its independence from indonesia 6 condemns the intimidation and harassment of human rights and civil society organizations by members of

and prosecution of all parties responsible for that attack b findings relating to papua congress finds the following 1 papua resourcerich province whose indigenous inhabitants are predominantly melanesian was formerly colony of the netherlands 2 while indonesia has claimed papua as part of its territory since its independence in the late 1940s papua remained under dutch administrative control until 1962 3 on august 15 1962 indonesia and the netherlands signed an agreement at the united nations in new york commonly referred to as the new york agreement which transferred administration of papua first to united nations temporary executive authority untea and then to indonesia in 1963 pending an act of free choice to permit the inhabitants to decide whether they wish to remain with indonesia crs20 4 in the new york agreement indonesia formally recognized the eligibility of all adults in papua to participate in an act of self determination to be carried out in accordance with international practice and pledged to give the people of the territory the opportunity to exercise freedom of choice before the end of 1969 5 in july and august 1969 indonesia conducted an act of free choice in which 1025 selected papuan elders voted unanimously to join indonesia in circumstances that were subject to both overt and covert forms of manipulation 6 in the intervening years indigenous papuans have suffered extensive human rights abuses natural resource exploitation environmental degradation and commercial dominance by immigrant communities and some individuals and groups estimate that more than 100000 papuans have been killed during indonesian rule primarily during the sukarno and suharto administrations 7 while the united states supports the territorial integrity of indonesia indonesias historical reliance on force for the maintenance of control has been counterproductive and longstanding abuses by security forces have galvanized independence sentiments among many papuans 8 while the indonesian parliament passed special autonomy law for papua in october 2001 that was intended to allocate greater revenue and decision making authority to the papuan provincial government the promise of special autonomy has not been effectively realized and has been undermined in its implementation such as by conflicting legal directives further subdividing the province in apparent contravention of the law and without the consent of appropriate provincial authorities 9 rather than demilitarizing its approach indonesia has reportedly sent thousands of additional troops to papua and military operations in the central highlands since the fall of 2004 have displaced thousands of civilians into very vulnerable circumstances contributing further to mistrust of the central government by many indigenous papuans 10 according to the 2004 annual country report on human rights practices of the department of state in indonesia
