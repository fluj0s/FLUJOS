from the detoxification program contained in clear body clear mind exposed to deadly poisonous gases toxins and agent orange this exmarine tells his story of recovery with the detoxification program prior to the program something was wrong objectively i was acting analytically but from time to time subjectively i would experience psychosis and neurosis in specific areas of my life which tended to hamper as being i am an exmarine who had fought in the vietnam war from 1968 to 1969 besides the constant fighting i also was exposed to deadly poisonous gases and toxins especially agent orange and some sort of nerve gas while in the service and in the vietnam war through the program these toxins were fully flushed out they had actually prevented from thinking straight and logically inhibited my perceptions and control of my body boy was i ever in for surprise during the program and after completion i had considered my environment dangerousi mean really dangerous as it was in the jungles of south vietnam but would you believe that i was still in south vietnam though i left it in 1969 i was fully brought out of it as well as oriented to my present environment by the program it really undercut everything i mean these were such very simple actions to do but powerful insofar as the results and gains i had both objectively and subjectively the program has changed my life my physical wellbeing and my attitude towards much better existence of survival i longer have to look over my shoulder for the enemy which wasnt there or walk carefully through any grassy areas looking for land mines which dont exist so that i can live another day it has opened door for mea door through which i can experience life my physical being is much better insofar as its coloration and pigment many other people have commented on how healthy i look i feel healthy and i am aware that i am in control of my body which had been hampered prior to the program by those toxins especially agent orange as vietnam vet i can say that life is definitely worthwhile to experience and create there is hope for those vietnam vets who are still in the vietnam war syndrome after being out of the war wb she stopped doing drugs 5 years ago however the lasting effects of depression lowered attention span and problems communicating continued on long after stopping she then tried the hubbard detoxification program i stopped taking drugs five years ago however every so often i would start feeling depressed for apparent reason i still found it difficult to keep my attention on what i was doing i had problems sometimes in communicating my feelings to others i found myself periodically becoming very introverted sometimes with disastrous results in my work so despite the marked improvement in my life overall i was still suffering from many of the manifestations of someone on drugs although i had stopped using them at this point l ron hubbard released the program within few weeks i started it while i was on the program i experienced many sensations such as nausea headaches and dizziness i recalled that many of these sensations were the exact ones that occurred while taking drugs including medical drugs during the first few days of the program i became really ill and actually wanted to stop and go to bed i was convinced i was physically ill this went on for three days and i just stuck it outthe best thing to do when drug is coming out of the system while on the program i recalled time when i was very ill as child and had the same symptoms shortly after this the symptoms decreased and within few hours were completely gone i found it easier to get up in the morning i lost weight my body was really getting into good shape and generally felt happier more alert and competent i was becoming better wife and mother i was even beginning to like myself more i continued with the program and thereafter experienced an increased sense of physical wellbeing all the mental and emotional manifestations of drugs plus various inabilities in handling life had vanished i felt clean healthy alert full of energy and goodwill at this point i knew i had completed the programall the drugs were gone i now handle my job easily and with great enjoyment life is challenge i enjoy meeting and i am winning at it jc once she was told by doctor that she had less than two years to live still standing

doctors to verify his diagnosis and they all concurredi had arteriosclerosis and not much life left one doctor told youd better go home and write your will i was in despair i was 25 years old just newly married that year and it suddenly appeared that all my hopes and dreams for the future were now impossibly out of reach i had learned about l ron hubbards purification program and decided to do it thinking that perhaps getting the buildup of toxins out of my body would make things easier over the following months it never occurred to that it could help handle the problems completely three weeks later when i finished the program and went back to my doctor for another checkup he was absolutely astounded he said that the results were impossible and that even though two other doctors had verified his diagnosis he must have been wrong in the first place because what had occurred was medically impossible there was trace left whatsoever of the arteriosclerosis it was completely gone i have been healthy ever since i am happily married to the same man 23 years later we have wonderful 18year old daughter and i am achieving all of my hopes and dreams bw i feel as new as the day i was
