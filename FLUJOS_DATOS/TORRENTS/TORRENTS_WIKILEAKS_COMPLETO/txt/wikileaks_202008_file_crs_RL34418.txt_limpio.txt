government and finance division estate and gift tax revenues past and projected in 2008 summary data on both past revenues and revenue projections regarding the estate tax should be interpreted with awareness of the yeartoyear changes in estate tax law from 1997 to 2011 large increases in the prevailing estate tax exemption from 675000 in 2001 and 2002 to 1 million in 2003 and 2004 and to 15 million in 2005 and 2006 led the number of taxable estate tax returns to fall by half from about 45000 in 2002 to about 22500 in 2005 and 2006 taxable estates fell from 215 percent of prioryear deaths in 2001 to 136 in 2003 and to 093 or 93 per thousand deaths in 2005 and 2006 notwithstanding the steep decline in the number of taxable returns estate taxes paid remained above 20 billion per year gift tax revenues fell by roughly half after the enactment of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 possibly many wealthy people chose to forgo the certainty of taxes on lifetime gifts hoping that the estate tax would later be repealed permanently as of 2010 and they would then be able to pass their assets along taxfree upon their death gift taxes accounted for 14 to 17 of estate and gift tax revenues in fy1999fy2001 but only 6 to 9 in fy2002fy2007 gift tax revenues of 39 billion to 47 billion per year in fy1999fy2001 fell to 14 billion to 24 billion in fy2002fy2007 the standard 10year forecasts of both revenue from the estate tax and revenue losses from permanent repeal of the estate tax should be interpreted with caution the forecasts should not be used to approximate revenues for different 10year period this is because of the changes scheduled to occur in the estate tax exemption and top tax rate from 2008 through 2011 the exemption is 2 million for decedents dying in 2008 but 35 million for 2009 under current law there will be estate tax in 2010 if egtrra is permitted to sunset at the end of 2010 the estate tax will apply again in 2011 but with an exemption of 1 million the top tax rate will revert from 45 in 20072009 to 55 with 5 surtax in certain range in 2011 and beyond revenues from estate and gift taxes were 26 billion in fy2007 contributing 10 of total federal revenue the congressional budget office projects that if the estate tax is reinstated in 2011 as currently scheduled revenue from the estate and gift taxes

the estate tax should be interpreted with awareness of the yeartoyear changes in estate tax law from 1997 to 2011 the modest changes brought about by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra pl 10534 were followed by big changes made by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 both laws provided for increases in the applicable exclusion amount commonly called the estate tax exemption as shown in the first column of table 1 egtrra also gradually lowered the maximum marginal estate tax rate from 55 plus 5 surtax in certain range in 2001 to 46 in 2006 and 45 in 20072009 as shown in the second column of table 1 exemption the estate tax exemption plays two important roles first it serves as the filing threshold for the estate tax federal estate tax return must be filed if us decedents gross estate1 before deductions equals or exceeds the exemption for the year of the decedents death second the transfer of an amount of assets up to the exemption is free from federal tax for every estate2 the value of the exemption is not indexed for inflation nor is it set in relation to any specific definition of wealth instead congress has intermittently raised the dollar amount from 1987 through1997 the exemption remained at 600000 under provisions of the economic recovery tax of 1981 erta pl 9734 tra of 1997 provided for gradual increase in the exemption over nine years under tra the exemption rose to 625000 for 1998 650000 for 1999 and 675000 for 2000 and 2001 it was scheduled to reach 1 million in 2006 before the provisions of tra were fully phased in however they were superseded for tax years 20022010 by much larger changes made by egtrra of 2001 egtrra raised the exemption to 1 million beginning immediately in 2002 1 technically the gross estate plus adjusted taxable gifts 2 in practice each estate tax return receives unified credit against the estate tax equal to the tax that would be due on the amount of the exemption the unified credit is applied against both estate and gift tax obligations crs2 and 2003 it further increased the exemption in large increments to 15 million for 2004 and 2005 2 million for 2006 through 2008 and 35 million

erta pl 9734 the exemption was 600000 in 1987 as well b provisions of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra pl 10534 tra had also provided for the exemption to increase to 700000 for 2002 and 2003 850000 for 2004 950000 for 2005 and 1 million for 2006 and beyond c provisions of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 d the revenue act of 1987 pl 100203 provided for 5 surtax to offset the benefits of both the graduated tax rates on taxable estate values below 3 million and the unified credit exemption such that the effective rate of tax on the entire estate was 55 as the result of clerical error in the final text of tra of 1997 later adopted by congress the surtax was intended to offset the benefits of only the graduated tax rates and not the unified credit exemption as well for detailed schedules of the marginal estate tax rates by year see crs report rl33718 calculating estate tax liability 2001 to 2011 and beyond by nonna noto crs3 the estate tax provisions of egtrra are scheduled to sunset on december 31 2010 along with the acts other provisions unless new legislation governing the estate tax is enacted beforehand in 2011 the law will revert to the law in effect prior to june 7 2001 the estate tax will be reinstated with an exemption of 1 million the amount that tra had provided for 2006 and beyond and the familyowned business deduction will be reinstated3 maximum tax rate from 1988 through 1997 the maximum marginal tax rate was 55 on taxable estate values over 3 million4 in addition there was surtax of 5 on taxable values over 10 million up to 21040 million from 1998 through 2001 the maximum rate remained at 55 on taxable estate values over 3 million but under tra of 1997 the 5 surtax applied from over 10 million only up to 17184 million5 in addition to raising the exemption in large increments egtrra significantly reduced the top marginal estate tax rate over period of six years column 2 of table 1 at the outset egtrra eliminated the 5 surtax and reduced the maximum tax rate from 55 to 50 effective in 2002 it subsequently reduced the top tax rate by one percentage point per year from 49 in 2003 down to 46 in 2006 and finally to 45 for 2007 through 20096 for decedents dying in 2010 there is estate tax for 2011 and beyond if egtrra sunsets the maximum tax rate will revert to 55 the 49 and 53 marginal rate brackets will be restored and the 5 surtax on taxable estate values from 10 million up to 17184 million will be reinstated 3 the taxpayer relief act created new exclusion from the estate tax for qualified family owned business interests qfobi that was in effect from 1998 through 2003 the exclusion was up to 675000 but was limited to total of 13 million in combination with the applicable exclusion amount which was scheduled to rise the familyowned business exclusion was converted to deduction by the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of 1998 pl 105206 under egtrra the familyowned business deduction was repealed in 2004 when the applicable exclusion amount for all estates was increased to 1500000 for more information see crs report 95444 history of federal estate gift and generationskipping taxes by john r luckey 4 under erta of 1981 the top marginal estate tax rate was scheduled to fall to 50 in 1985 the deficit reduction act of 1984 pl 98369 froze the top tax rate at the 1984 level of 55 until 1988 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 pl 100203 extended the maximum rate of 55 through 1992 the omnibus reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 extended the maximum rate of 55 retroactively from december 31 1992 onward see crs report 95444 history of federal estate gift and generation skipping taxes by john r luckey 5 for an explanation of the surtaxes see notes d and of table 1 6 for additional information on these changes in federal estate tax law see crs report rl31061 estate and gift tax law changes under the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 by nonna noto jan 29 2002 and crs report 95444 history of federal estate gift and generationskipping taxes by john r luckey crs4 which law is reflected in revenue for particular year the tax law that applies to an estate is the law in effect in the year of the persons death however the estate tax return is not due until nine months after the persons death and an extension of six months is not uncommon complex returns may be granted longer extension it follows that estate tax returns filed in any given calendar year will include few returns of people who died in that year mostly the returns of people who died in the previous year and some returns from deaths in prior years that are filing under an extension of estate tax returns filed in calendar years 2001 through 2005 roughly 10 were filed in the year of death 72 in the year after death 14 two years after death and 3 three or more years after death7 consequently for given filing year calendar year this report refers to the exemption that was in effect for death in the prior calendar year as the prevailing exemption for that filing year for example the prevailing exemption for most estate tax returns filed in 2006 would be the 15 million exemption in effect for deaths in 2005 revenue in particular fiscal year is most likely to reflect the estate tax law in effect in the previousnumbered calendar year recall that the estate tax return is not due until nine months after the date of death and that the fiscal year runs from october 1 of the previous calendar year until september 30 of the samenumbered calendar year so for example deaths in calendar 2006 would be reflected in estate tax returns filed on time in the last three months of 2006 and the first nine months of 2007 which comprise fy2007 unexpected patterns an increase in the estate tax exemption would be expected to reduce the number of estate tax returns filed the number of taxable returns and the total amount of estate tax paid with those returns but this is not always the case in particular from 1998 until 2000 the number of taxable returns continued to increase even though the prevailing exemption was gradually rising total estate taxes paid remained nearly the same between 2002 and 2003 even though the number of taxable returns fell by 26 and between 2004 and 2005 when taxable returns fell by 29 whether the number of taxable returns and the amount of tax revenues decline depends upon whether the increase in the exemption outpaces the increase in the value of wealthy decedents estates broad market fluctuations in the value of widely 7 the fiveyear averages were calculated by crs from annual statistics reported in brian graub recent changes in the estate tax exemption level and filing population internal revenue service statistics of income soi bulletin vol 27 1 summer 2007 figure b p 114 crs5 held assets such as stocks or real estate can override the relationship that would otherwise be expected between an increase in the estate tax exemption and the number of taxable estate tax returns filed the next year estate valuations are likely to be unusually high in years of market peaks and unusually low in years of market crashes this is likely to cause the number of taxable estate tax returns filed in the next calendar year to be higher and lower respectively than would otherwise be expected the standardized measurement of taxable estate tax returns expressed as percentage of deaths has been tracked over time as an indicator of how deeply the estate tax reaches into the population when this percentage has risen above politically unacceptable level the congress has at some point raised the estate tax exemption in order to bring the percentage back down to the typical historical level during the previous two decades for years of death from 1982 through 2003 taxable estate tax returns measured as percentage of adult deaths fluctuated within the range of just under 1 088 to 2308 increase in exemption and number of taxable returns the relationship between the increase in the prevailing exemption amount and the number of taxable estate tax returns filed each year from 1998 through 2006 is illustrated by the juxtaposition of figures 1 and 2 the data underlying these two graphs are presented in columns 1 and 2 respectively of table 2 to help highlight the relationships between these two measures columns 1 and 2 of table 3 show the percentage change from the previous year for the prevailing exemption and the number of taxable returns initially from 1998 through 2000 when the prevailing exemption was rising in annual increments of 25000 or about 4 from 600000 in 1998 to 625000 in 1999 and 650000 in 2000 the number of taxable returns nonetheless continued to rise modestly the rising pattern holds whether measured as the absolute number of returns column 2 of table 2 or standardized as tax returns as percent of deaths column 3 of table 2 the number of taxable estate tax returns rose from 47475 or 205 of deaths in 1998 to 52000 or 217 of deaths in 2000 this suggests that value of assets broadly held by wealthy decedents was generally rising more rapidly than the exemption from 1997 to 1999 the stock market for example was generally rising over this period the number of taxable returns declined very slightly by half percent in 2001 when the effect of the higher 675000 exemption first registered this suggests that at 675000 the level of the exemption had caught up with the value of assets held by wealthy decedents in 2000 between 2001 and 2002 the number of taxable estate tax returns dropped by 13 even though the prevailing exemption remained at 675000 this suggests that the value of assets widely held by wealthy decedents fell between 2000 and 2001 the stock market for example peaked in march 2000 and stock prices continued to fall until october 2002 it was not until 2002 the 8 internal revenue service statistics of

1 2 and 4 of table 2 in 2003 the number of taxable returns dropped by 26 from 45018 in 2002 to 33302 in 2003 when the prevailing exemption rose by 48 from 675000 for deaths in 2001 to 1 million in 2002 taxable returns as percent of deaths fell from 186 in 2002 to 136 in 2003 this suggests that at the 1 million level the exemption amount had outpaced the growth between 2001 and 2002 in the value of assets held by wealthy decedents in 2004 the number of taxable returns dropped further by modest 6 from 33302 in 2003 to 31329 in 2004 as the 1 million exemption continued to prevail this suggest that there was small decline between 2002 and 2003 in the value of assets held by wealthy decedents in 2005 the number of taxable returns again dropped significantly by 29 from 31329 in 2004 to 22250 in 2005 after the exemption rose by 500000 or 50 to 15 million for people dying in 2004 finally in 2006 the number of taxable returns increased slightly by 25 from 22250 in 2005 to 22798 in 2006 as the 15 million exemption continued to prevail this suggests that there was small increase in the value of assets held by wealthy decedents between 2004 and 2005 this was in contrast to the experience in 2004 when the number of taxable returns fell while the exemption remained unchanged taxable returns measured as percentage of deaths in the prior year fell below 1 to 093 or 93 per thousand deaths in both 2005 and 2006 when the prevailing exemption rose to 15 million it can be expected that both the number of taxable returns and taxable returns measured as percentage of deaths will drop substantially for returns filed in 2007 when the prevailing exemption rises to 2 million and again for returns filed in 2010 when the prevailing exemption will rise to 35 million the number of crs9 taxable estate tax returns is projected to drop far below the typical historical range of 1 to 2 of adult deaths9 number of taxable returns and total taxes paid as shown in the last columns of tables 2 and 3 total estate taxes paid moved in the same direction as the number of taxable returns filed from 1998 through 2003 both measures rose from 1998 to 2000 and fell from 2000 to 2003 then somewhat surprisingly estate tax payments rose slightly by 4 from 208 billion in 2003 to 216 billion in 2004 despite decline of nearly 2000 or 6 in the number of taxable returns even more surprising estate taxes paid rose very slightly by 03 to 217 billion in 2005 even though the number of taxable returns dropped by 29 although the number of taxable estate tax returns filed in 2005 was less than half that in 1998 essentially the same nominal not inflationadjusted amount of estate tax was paid for both years 217 billion in 2005 compared with 203 billion in 1998 what explains the persistence of revenues despite dramatic drop in the number of taxable estates while large in number the smallest estates as group contributed relatively little in estate taxes although the two lowest gross estate size classes accounted for 33179 or 64 of the 51736 taxable returns filed in 2001 they contributed only 27 billion or 11 of the 235 billion in estate taxes paid the large decrease in the total number of taxable returns between 2001 and 2005 can be explained by the elimination from taxability of the large number of estates in the two lowest gross estate size categories under 1 million and 1 million up to 15 million after the prevailing exemption rose to 1 million in filing year 2003 there was further large decrease in the number of taxable returns in the 1 million to 15 million category and smaller decrease in the 15 million to 2 million category in filing year 2005 when the prevailing exemption rose to 15 million between 2004 and 2005 the 14 billion loss in estate taxes paid by these two smallest size classes plus 07 billion loss in the 2 million to 35 million gross estate size class was more than offset by the 21 billion increase in taxes collected from the largest size class with gross estates of 20 million or more 9 for estimates made in july 2005 by the urbanbrookings tax policy center of the number of taxable estate tax returns and calculations by crs of taxable

returns increased by only 25 there was an increase in the number of taxable returns in each of the six size classes of over 15 million in gross estate this was accompanied by an increase in the amount of estate taxes paid by each of the five size classes of over 20 million in gross estate totaling an additional 29 billion gift tax revenues fell after 2001 tax act gift tax law the gift tax is levied on the taxable transfer of assets during donors lifetime10 under the law prior to egtrra the estate and gift tax exemption was unified that is the exemption could be used to protect any combination of lifetime gifts andor bequests at death that added up to the dollar amount of the exemption for the year of death under the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra the unified applicable exclusion amount or exemption for lifetime taxable gifts together with bequests rose gradually from 600000 in 1997 to 675000 in 2001 the same graduated tax rate structure that applied to estates applied to cumulative taxable lifetime gifts in excess of the exemption amount in contrast under egtrra the exemption for cumulative lifetime gifts was capped separately at 1 million effective from 2002 onward even as the combined exemption for gifts and bequests rose from 1 million for decedents dying in 2002 and 2003 up to 35 million for decedents dying in 2009 refer back to table 1 furthermore under egtrra the gift tax is to remain in place in 2010 with cumulative lifetime exemption of 1 million even when the estate tax is repealed the egtrra law means that beginning in 2002 once an individual has given away 1 million cumulatively over their lifetime they will owe gift taxes on any further gifts payable in the year following the gift any amount of the gift tax 10 under the gift tax there is an annual exclusion per donor for each donee this exclusion amount is indexed for inflation and rounded down to the nearest 1000 the exclusion is 12000 in 2008 the same as in 2006 and 2007 gifts up to this limit are not counted as taxable gifts married couple may give up to twice that amount 24000 to an individual in single year without having it count against their lifetime exclusion in addition there is an unlimited exclusion for gifts to pay for tuition or medical expenses or for transfers to political organization for the use of the organization there is also an unlimited marital deduction for most gifts between spouses only gift amounts in excess of the annual exclusion need to be reported on gift tax return gift tax return is due by april 15 of the year after potentially taxable gift is made even if tax is currently due gift tax is due until cumulative taxable gifts over the donors lifetime exceed the lifetime gift exclusion amount for more information see crs report 95444 history of federal estate gift and generationskipping taxes by john r luckey and crs report 95416 federal estate gift and generationskipping taxes description of current law by john r luckey crs12 exemption up to 1 million used by person during their lifetime is to be subtracted from the combined exemption applying in their year of death to determine the amount of the exemption remaining to protect the estate from taxation so for example if an individual who has already given away 1 million in lifetime taxable gifts died in either 2006 2007 or 2008 when the combined exemption is 2 million per decedent there would be 1 million in exemption remaining for the estate in 2010 under egtrra the maximum gift tax rate will be capped at 35 equal to the maximum individual income tax rate under egtrra on cumulative lifetime taxable transfers over 500000 this is lower than the maximum rate of 45 scheduled to apply to estates and gifts in 2007 through 2009 under the bills that would permanently repeal the estate tax by simply repealing the sunset provision of egtrra this gift tax would remain in place after 201011 gift tax revenues through fy2001 gift taxes accounted for significant percentage of combined estate and gift tax revenues12 ever since the adoption of egtrra in 2001 with its announcement of estate tax repeal in 2010 there has been substantial decline in the revenue collected from the gift tax the last column of table 6 shows that gift taxes accounted for 14 to 17 of combined estate and gift tax revenues from fy1999 through fy2001 in contrast from fy2002 to fy2007 gift taxes accounted for only 6 to 9 gift tax revenue fell by more than half from the range of 39 billion to 47 billion per year in fy1999fy2001 down to the range of 14 billion to 24 billion in fy2002fy2007 second column of table 6 this is illustrated in figure 3 11 for further explanation see crs report rl34374 estate tax legislation in the 110th congress by nonna noto 12 the revenue numbers cited in the remainder of this report differ from those presented in the last column of table 2 in at least three ways 1 they include gift taxes in addition to estate taxes 2 they are on

decline in gift taxes is that many wealthy people chose to forgo the certainty of gift taxes if they transferred assets while they were alive in the hope that the estate tax would be repealed permanently and they would then be able to pass the assets along to beneficiaries taxfree upon their death13 forecasters at the us treasury department predict that revenue from the gift tax will remain low in the years remaining prior to fy2011 but will be higher in fy2011 reflecting gifts made in 2010 before the scheduled return of the estate tax in 2011 estate and gift taxes contribute less than 2 of federal revenue as shown in table 7 revenues from estate and gift taxes combined accounted for 278 billion or 15 of total federal revenue in fy199914 their contribution remained at 14 for fy2000 fy2001 and fy2002 even though their absolute dollar amount fluctuated first above and then below their fy1999 level ever since the effects of eggtra began to register in fy2003 the share of revenue contributed by estate and gift taxes has remained below 14 from fy2003 through fy2006 it fluctuated within the range of 11 to 13 of total revenue even though the dollar amount rebounded from 220 billion in fy2003 to 279 billion in fy2006 in fy2007 estate and gift taxes fell back to 260 billion accounting for 10 of total federal revenue the percentage share of estate and gift taxes is influenced by fluctuations in other revenue sources as well 13 there is another tax advantage to delaying the transfer of assets until after death that was present in prior law and remains in practical effect for small estates under egtrra recipients are likely to owe less in capital gains taxes when they sell capital asset received from bequest after death rather than from lifetime gift because of the difference in treatment of basis under both egtrra and prior law assets transferred by gift receive carryover basis the donors purchase price in contrast to stepup in basis the value at the time of the transfer under the law in effect through 2009 while the estate tax remains in effect recipients of assets transferred at death receive stepup in basis this cancels potential capital gains tax liability on the increase in the value of the asset during the decedents period of ownership under egtrra assets transferred at death during years when the estate tax is repealed 2010 and possibly subsequent years if extended will receive modified carryover basis there is stepup allowance of 13 million per decedent plus 3 million for surviving spouse both indexed for inflation after 2010 these stepup allowances are likely to shelter most capital gains in small estates from income tax when the heirs sell the assets 14 for information on state revenues from these types of taxes see

calendar year 2010 cbo projected that estate and gift tax revenues would fall to 22 billion in fy2010 and 21 billion in fy2011 this corresponds to 08 of total federal revenue in fy2010 and 07 in fy2011 and to 01 of gdp in both years reflecting the reinstatement of the estate tax in 2011 with an exemption of 1 million cbo projected that estate and gift tax revenues would rise markedly to 55 billion in fy2012 that represents 16 of projected federal revenue higher than the 15 share they contributed in fy1999 and 03 of gdp cbo projected that estate and gift tax revenues would continue to rise steadily in nominal dollars by roughly 7 billion each year to 63 billion in fy2013 and up to 97 billion in fy2018 that represents 18 of projected total revenue for fy2013 and 21 for fy2018 because the 1 million exemption amount is not indexed for inflation after 2011 and because the wealth of individuals is assumed to grow faster than inflation cbo projected that estate and gift tax revenues would rise to 04 of gdp starting in fy2014 cbos cumulative revenue projection for the standard 10year forecast period fy2009fy2018 is 604 billion there is big difference however in the revenue expected for the first half of the 10year period versus the second half this is because of the large changes in the estate tax exemption each calendar year from 2008 through 2011 refer back to table 1 column 1 cbos revenue forecast for the first fiveyear period fy2009fy2013 is 188 billion this reflects one calendar year when the exemption is 2 million one when it is 35 million one when there is estate tax and two when the exemption is 1 million the revenue projection for the second fiveyear period fy2014fy2018 is 416 billion this projection is based on the assumption that the estate tax will be in effect for all of those years with an exemption of 1 million and that the top tax rate will be restored from 45 in 20072009 to 55 for decedents dying in 2011 and after as provided under

transfer tax as well as the modifications to the gift tax currently scheduled to be in effect for 2010 only crs18 table 9 presents estimates of the changes in federal receipts expected each year through fy2018 if legislation to repeal the sunset provision of egtrra with respect to the estate and gift taxes were enacted in 2008 to take effect in 2010 these estimates were issued by the us treasury department in february 2008 and by the joint committee on taxation jct in march 2008 the treasurys estimates of revenue loss begin in fy2008 the jcts estimates begin in fy2009 these estimates do not include the reduction in revenue expected as result of impending changes made by egttra namely the increase in the estate tax exemption to 35 million for 2009 reduced gift taxes and income taxes also expected according to treasury department analysts the revenue losses estimated for fy2008 through fy2010 stem primarily from projected decline in gift tax revenues as explained previously the estimates are based on the assumption that taxpayers would immediately begin to reduce taxable gifts during their lifetimes if they knew that the estate tax would be permanently repealed in 2010 in addition it is expected that enactment in 2008 of permanent repeal of the estate tax effective in 2010 would modestly affect revenues from the individual income tax in two opposing ways first lifetime charitable donations and accompanying tax deductions would fall thereby increasing income tax revenues second and larger in effect capital gains realizations by the elderly would fall as they wait to pass on their assets taxfree after death thereby decreasing current income tax revenue treasury projected that for fy2008 through fy2010 net reductions in income taxes would add to the decrease in revenue from gift taxes for fy2011 and beyond the loss in income taxes would add to the decrease in revenue from estate taxes as well as gift taxes16 16 these conclusions are based on

tax effective in 2010 the estimates include the projected accompanying loss of individual income tax revenue in addition to estate and gift tax revenue as explained in the text according to treasury department analysts treasurys estimates of revenue loss are lower than jcts for fiscal years 2011 and beyond primarily because treasury starts from lower baseline the projection of what revenues from the estate tax would otherwise be than the congressional budget office baseline used by jct tenyear forecast may be misleading because of changing law the us treasury department and the joint committee on taxation typically prepare revenuechange forecast for 10 fiscal years forward whenever they evaluate tax proposal similarly in its budget outlook publications cbo makes projections crs20 of specific revenue sources for the next 10 fiscal years because of the big changes in estate tax law scheduled over the next three calendar years from 2009 through 2011 the standard 10year forecast starting in fy2009 gives misleading measure of the revenue or revenue loss that would be expected if the same tax law were in effect for each of the 10 years for the hypothetical case of legislation in 2008 to make estate tax repeal permanent for 2010 and beyond the expected fiveyear revenue losses are far lower for the first five years fy2009fy2013 than they are for the second five years fy2014fy2018 when repeal of the estate tax would be fully in effect the revenue loss estimate for the second fiveyear period better reflects the longrun cost of the permanent repeal proposal 372

about 5 billion each year to 85 billion in fy2018 the jct estimated revenue loss of 77 billion in fy2013 rising by about 7 billion each year to 112 billion in fy2018 estate tax repeal accounts for

2001 and 2003 522 billion out of 2185 billion for the group the treasury estimates that the revenue loss from permanent repeal of the estate tax is just over half the size of the most costly component of the package extending the reductions in marginal individual income tax rates 522 billion compared with 1008 billion or 52 according to the joint committee on taxation the estate tax accounts for just over onequarter 278 of the projected revenue cost of making the set of 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent 670 billion out of 2414 billion for the 10year period fy2009fy2018 jct estimates that
