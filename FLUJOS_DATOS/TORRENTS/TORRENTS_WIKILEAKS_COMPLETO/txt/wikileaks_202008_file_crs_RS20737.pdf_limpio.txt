fry and the subsequent end of the milosevic regime the people of yugoslavia have opened the door to dramatic political and economic change like that already in progress in the rest of central europe and the former soviet union1 the fry however not only faces the daunting challenge of transition to free market economy and democratic system after decades of authoritarian rule but the added burden of devastated infrastructure from years of war with other former republics the nato bombing of 1999 and international sanctions responding to this situation the united states and europe have issued offers of assistance see crs report rl30371 serbia and montenegro politica l situation and us policy by steven woehrel background previous us economic assistanc to the fry due to the sanctions put in place by the international community including the united states as result of the bosnia conflict there was only limited us economic assistance to the fry in the 1990s all but humanitarian and democracy assistance were prohibited under us law humanitarian aid program mostly benefitting the vulnerable and elderly in kosovohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20737crs2 began in 1993 and in 1996 usaid launched food aid program targeted mainly toward refugees from bosnia and croatia and the poor and implemented through us privat charitable organizations and the world food program democratization efforts however continued to be stymied by the lack of us monitoring presence on the ground in the mid1990s some assistance was nonetheless provided to albanian language newspapers and civic education program was initiated in kosovo but following the lifting of bosniarelated sanctions at the end of 1996 usaid office was established in belgrade and it initiated small program to help build democracy encourage economic growth and improve the quality of life health and education projects were mostly conducted through us and local nongovernmental organizations ngos focusing on the grassroots and local government democracy programs assisted the development of independent media strengthened indigenous ngos and advised political parties economic growthrelated projects were aimed at montenegro which with the rise to power of an antimilosevic government in 1997 had shown some progre ss in adopting economic reforms among other activities usaid helped the government of montenegro privatize its economy and provided business services to entrepreneurs including microcredit assistance the 1999 war in kosovo significantly altered the us assistance program in the federal republic of yugoslavia in the aftermath of the war the province of kosovo now occupied by an international military force and administered by the united nations began to receive largescale infusio ns of us assistance aid went to such items as the administrative budget infrastructure repair and law enforcement in addition to traditional development activities kosovo is currently treated as separate entity by the us assistance program for discussion of us and international aid programs see crs report rl30453 kosovo reconstruction and development assistance montenegro as bone fide opponent of milosevic also became the focus of greater attention larger amounts of assistance and separate treatment by the us aid program following the kosov war the united states provided 15 million in balanceofpayments support and technical assistance aimed at helping montenegro survive the economic disruption and influx of kosovar refugees caused by the war as well as serbian efforts to destabilize it aid to serbia restricted by congress to humanita rian and democracy assistance was increased immediately after the war in june 1999 president clinton formally committed at least 10 million to democratization 118 million was eventually used in the months just before the fry elections most of another 25 million commitment was used these funds helped support the opposition parties by providing equipment such as computers training organizers and funding voter surveys assistance was also provided to independent media labor unions and opposition local governments with view toward strengthening opponents to milosevics rule postmilosevic us assistance since the end of the milosevic regime both the administration and congress have taken steps to assure serbia of us support as it moves toward democracy and economic reformhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20737crs3 in the first weeks after the change in government the administration ordered many financial and trade sanctions lifted including the oil embargo and flight ban

into law on november 6 hr 4811 pl 106429 removed previous appropriations language prohibiting all but democracy assistance for serbia it approved the use of up to 100 million for serbia aid an acrosstheboard rescission reduced that amount to 99780 million and in the conferee report recommended expenditure of not less than 89 million in montenegro congress also encouraged administration efforts to support fry membership in international organizations and international financial institutions sec 594 fy2001 seed appropriations for serbia are funding the following activities 249 million

emergency pension and energy costs 267 million for private sector development and macroeconomic reform technical assistance 7 million for technical assistance to municipal governments and 5 million for democracy and civil society support in its fy2002 budget request the bush administration requested 145 million for the fry serbia and montenegro on july 24 the house approved hr 2506 the fy2002 foreign operations appropriations while the legislation does not earmark funds for the fry appropriations committee report language hrept 107142 directs that 60 million be provided to montenegro on july 26 the senate appropriations committee approved its version of the bill while it has not released report or introduced legislation press release notes that 115 million is provided for serbia in the bill at the june 2001 international donor conference the united states pledged 1816 million for calendar year 2001 75 million of which are fy2002 funds not yet appropriated issues for congress constraints on us assis tance two legislative provisions contained in the fy2001 appropriations threatened to limit aid under section 594 any unobligated amounts of the 100 million provided as fy2001 bilateral aid to serbia except humanitarian and democracy aid could not be obligated after march 31 2001 unless the president certified that the fry is cooperating with the international criminal tribunal for the fry icty taking steps to abide by the bosnia peace accords or implementing policies respecting minority rights and the rule of law on april 2 the administration provided the certification required by section 594 with the qualification that the united states would be watching closely to see if the fry continued to meet the conditions section 594 also applied conditions to the us position on entry of the fry into international organizations including the world bank and the european bank ebrd which is expected to supply the bulk of largescale development assistance while montenegro has been exempted from most bilateral aid restrictions it too stands to benefit from international loans to the fry the bill instructed us representatives to these institutions to support membership once the president certified that the fry has taken steps to resolve issues related to debts and other liabilities responsibility for debts and assets of the pre1991 former yugoslavia remained in dispute among the former constituent republics until may 25 when the fry and the four other successor states reached an agreement on the division of assets step toward resolution of liability issues with donor nations us support for individual loans and other assistance from international institutions after march 31 2001 also rested on the same presidential determination governing the 100 million in bilateral aid and may now occur under section 564 assistance with the exception of humanitarian democracy cross border physical infrastructure and some other categories could be provided to countries that give sanctuary to indicted war criminals such as milosevic in the fry this section could be waived for specific programs if written determination was provided to congress because seed appropriations are provided notwithstanding any other provision of law both conditions could be ignored as they apply to seed funds however the administration did not intend to utilize that provision httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20737crs5 despite the april certification members of congress including the authors of section 594 senators leahy and mcconnell indicated that the frys record of cooperation with the tribunal must be taken into account by the administration if aid notifications and future aid requests were to go forward during his visit to the white house on may 9 president kostunica was reportedly reminded of us interest in seeing milosevic handed over to the tribunal the bush administration threatened to skip the international donors conference if further steps were taken as milosevic was being extradited on june 28 the administration announced that it would attend the june 29 conference but it has indicated that disbursement of pledges would continue to be dependent on fry cooperation with the tribunal role of other donors apart from the united states the chief potential aid donors to serbia are the european union eu its members and the multilateral financial institutions the latter especially the world bank and ebrd could be expected to supply the bulk of largescale development assistance key factor hindering assistance from these quarters had been the state of the frys debts and other liabilities the imf and world bank cannot provide assistance to countries that are not members and the fry could not become member until it settled its arrears with these institutions the fry had arrears to the ebrd and joined on december 15 2000 on december 20 following 129 million payment to the imf the fry was granted imf membership and provided with 151 million loan the loan allowed it to reimburse switzerland and norway which had advanced it the funds that enabled it to pay off its imf arrears on june 11 the imf approved standby loan for the fry of about 249 million through march 2002 although the fry currently owes the world bank 17 billion in arrears its membership in the bank was announced on may 10 when the fry met bank requirements including agreement to resolve the arrears issue prior to membership the bank had been instrumental in organizing donor coordination meeting and helping to assess fry needs in march 2001 the bank set up 30 million trust fund for the fry to provide some shortterm grant assistance prior to membership european donors launched assistance initiatives soon after the election results in yugoslavia were known the eu approved nearly 190 million in aid for urgent needs such as heating oil and supply of medicines and basic foodstuffs for the winter of 20002001 it also promised up to 21 million for restoration of navigation on the danube which will benefit the entire region together eu members the european commission and the european investment bank pledged nearly 637 million at the june donor conference as they did for kosovo and the southeast europe region the european union and the world bank organized both the december 2000 donor coordination meeting which clarified the frys priority needs and the june donor pledging conference in most parts of the world the extent of other bilateral donor assistance has little impact in determining the size of the us aid program however with congressional limitation on us aid to kosovo at 15 of total donor contributions the role of other donors could become factor in the us program in the rest of the fry especially because the united states has expressed the view that europe should take the lead in balkan development potential drawback to limiting us assistance is that it may also lessen us influence on events in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20737crs6 region at the june donor conference total of 13 billion was pledged of which the us pledge accounts for 135 eu members and institutions represent 474 of the total us aid and relations between kosovo montenegro and serbia cooperation with the international criminal tribunal is not the only major issue that remains as possible obstruction affecting us assistance to serbia serbias treatment of its sister republic montenegro and the province of kosovo are likely to influence the quality and quantity of future us aid to serbia and moves by montenegro toward independence from the fry may affect assistance to it although the united states does not formally support the independence movements of either kosovo or montenegro us aid has been employed in ways that worked to strengthen the independence of each visavis the fry us assistance to montenegro grew in tandem with montenegrin policies at variance with milosevic us aid projects fostered economic and political reform facilitating montenegrin separateness from its sister entity in kosovo us and allied aid has in effect created the framework of an independent state despite the formal and us position in resolution 1244 that the fry maintains sovereignty over the province with the change of regime in belgrade new possibilities have arisen for peaceful settlement of both relationships montenegrin officials have postponed plans for an independence referendum until perhaps early 2002 although fry leaders currently say they would not act to stop montenegrin independence the united states and eu countries oppose independence and have indicated that aid might be cut off as consequence during the past year however members of congress have indicated strong support for montenegro the appropriations committee report on hr 2506 suppor ts specific funding level for montenegro and pointedly directs that it be identified as separate line item in the administration aid report demonstrating committee disappointment with the administration for combining the serbia and montenegro budget requests into one figure in kosovo us assistance would likely support any peaceful and mutually cooperative outcome but such an outcome may not be possible and how us assistance would be used in that eventuality is unclear at this time
