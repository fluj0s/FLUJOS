at 786 from electronic mail to accessing information to watching videos to online purchasing the internet touches almost every aspect of modern life the extent to which use of the internet continues to grow however may be ffected by number of technology policy issues being debated in congress first is the availability of highspeed or broadband internet access broadband internet access gives users the ab ility to send and receive data at speeds far greater than dialup internet ccess over traditional lephone lines with deployment of broadband t echnologies accelerating congress is seeking to ensure fair competition and timely broadband deployment to all sectors and geographical locations of american society next are range of issues that reflect challenges faced by those who do use the internet such as security privacy including spyware and identity theft unsolicited commercial electronic mail spam protecting children from unsuitable material such as pornography and computer security including the vulnerability of the nations critical infrastructures to cyber attacks other issues include the internets domain name system dns which is administered by nonprofit cor poration called the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann with th department of commerce currently exercising legal authority over icann congress continues to monitor the administration of the dns particularly w ith respect to issues such as privacy governance and protecting children on the internet the evolving role of the internet in the political economy of the united states also continues to attract c ongressional attention among the issues are what changes may be needed at the federal communications commission in the internet age federal support for information technology research and development provision of online services by the government egovernment and availability and use of open source software by the government number of laws already have been pa ssed on many

internet access over existing telephone lines broadband technologies cable m odem digital subscriber line dsl satellite wireless internet and fiber are currently being deployed nationwide by the private sector while the numbers of new broadband subscr ibers continue to grow some areas of the nation particularly rural and lowincome communities continue to lack sufficient access to highspeed broadband internet service in order to address this problem the 109th congress considered but did not pass legislation to address the scope and ffect of federal broadband fi nancial assistance programs including universal serv ice and the impact of re gulatory policies and new technologies on broadband deploy ment these issues are anticipated to continue to be focus of the broadba nd policy debate in the 110th congress some policymakers believing that disparities in broadband access across american society could have adverse econo mic and social consequences on those left behind assert that the federa l government should play more active role to avoid digital divide in broadband access one approach is for the federal government to provide financial assistan ce to support broadband deploy ment in underserved areas in the 109th congress legislation was intr oduced but not enacted to provide financial assistance including loans grants and tax incentives to encourage broadband deployment for more inform ation on federal assi stance for broadband deployment see crs report rl30719 broadband internet access and the digital divide federal assistance programs by lennard g kruger and angele gilroy others however question the reality of the digital divide and argue that federal intervention in the broadband marketplace w ould be premature and in some cases counterproductive the debate over access to broadband rvices has prompted policymakers to examine range of other issues to ensure that broadband will be available on timely and equal basis to all us citizens one facet of this debate focuses on whether present laws and subsequent regulatory policies are needed to ensure the development of competition and its subse quent consumer bene fits or conversely whether such laws and regulations ar overly burdensome and discourage needed investment in and deployment of broadband services the regulatory debate focuses on number of issues including the extent to which legacy regulations should be applied to traditional providers as they enter new markets the extent to which legacy regulations should be imposed on new entr ants as they compete with traditional providers in their markets and the trea tment of new and conve rging technologies for example present law requires all incumbent local exchange telephone carriers ilecs such as verizon or sb c to open up their networks to enable competitors to lease out parts of the incumbents network these unbundling andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9867crs6 resale requirements which are detailed in secti on 251 of the telecommunications act of 1996 were enacted in an attempt to open up the local telephone network to competitors whether such open access re gulations should be applied to ilecs when they offer new nondominant services such as broadband connections or to new market entrants such as cable tele vision companies when they offer services such as voice and broadband remains under debate whet her regulators should play role to ensure that the internet remains open to all often referred to as net neutrality became major part of and is ex pected to continue to be major focus of the ongoing congressional debate equally contentious is the debate over whether legacy regulations such as the requirement that cable television companies obtain local franchise as prerequisite for offe ring video service be extended to other entrants such as telephone companies if they choose to enter the video market third and related deba surrounds the appropriate regu latory framework that should be imposed on new technologies such as voice over internet protocol voip and other internet protocol services as well as bundled service offerings the regulatory treatment of broadba nd technologies whether offered by traditional or emerging providers or incumbent or new entrants remains major focus of the policy debate cities counties nd states have taken up the issue of whether to mandate open access requirement s on local cable franchises in june 1999 federal judge ruled that the city of portland oregon had the right to require open access to the telecommunications in corporated tci broadband network as condition for transferring its local cable television franchise to att on march 14 2002 the fcc adopted declaratory ruling which classified cable modem service as an interstate information service subject to fcc jurisdiction and largely shielded from local regulation after seri of conflicting court decisions the us supreme court in june 27 2005 action national cable and telecommunications association v brand x internet services ruled that the fcc should be given deference in its decision that cable broa dband service should be classified as an interstate information service the classification of cable modem service as an interstate information serv ice will result in fcc trea tment under the less rigorous title i of the 1934 communications act similarly in an august 5 2005 action the fcc ruled that the regulatory treatment of wireline broadband services will be granted regulatory parity the fcc ruled that subject to oneyear transition period which expired in august 2006 wirelin broadband internet access services commonly delivered by dsl technology are defined as information services thereby placing telephone company dsl servi ces on an equal regulatory footing with cable modem services regulatory parity was also granted to broadband over power line bpl service when the fcc in november 2006 decision determined that such service would also be classified as an interstate information service subject to title i regulation finally emerging broadband technologies such as fi ber wireless including 3g wifi and wimax and bpl tinue to be

emergence of these and other new broa dband technologies in addition how and to what extent social regulations such as 911 requirements disability access law enforcement obligations and universal

has concern about security of and security on the internet long list of security related incidents that have received widera nging media coverage eg melissa virus the love bug and the code red nimda slammer and blaster worms represents the tip of the iceberg more recently hackers using trojan horses and other techniques were able to place keyloggi ng software on the personal computers of people with online trading accounts to rreptitiously acquire their personal account information the hackers used the info rmation to access these personal accounts to buy little known stocks in which they the h ackers had invested driving up the price the thieves then dumped their shares for profit19 every day persons gain access or try to gain access to someone elses co mputer without authoriz ation to read copy modify or destroy the information cont ained within these persons range from juveniles to disgruntled exemployees to criminals to competitors to politically or socially motivated groups to agents of foreign governments the extent of the problem is unknown mu ch of what gets reported as computer attacks are probes often conducted automatically with software widely available for even juveniles to use but the num ber of instances where someone has actually gained unauthorized access is not known not every person or company whose computer system has been compromised reports it either to the media or to authorities sometimes the vi ctim judges the incident not to be worth the trouble sometimes the victim may judge that th adverse publicity would be worse sometimes the affected pa rties do not even know their systems have been compromised there is some evidence to suggest however that the number of incidents is increasing according to the computer emergency response team cert at carnegiemellon university th number of incident s reported to it has grown just about every year since the t eams establishment from 132 incidents in 1989 to over 137000 incidents in 2003

must be checked and restored if necessary money may be stolen from acc ounts or extorted from the victim if disruptions occur sales may be lost if adverse publicity occurs future sales may be lost and stock prices may be affected estimates of the overall financial losses due to unauthorized access vary and are largely speculative estimates typically range in the billions of dollars per major event like the love bug virus or the series of denial ofservice attacks of february 200021 similar timates have been made for the code red worms estimates of losses internationally range up to the tens of

interest in the security of computers and the internet over the years this interest has been manifested in numerous hearings by multitude of committees and subcommittees in both the house and the senate legislation has also been passed the federal computer fraud and abuse statute 18 usc 1030 was initially added as part of the comprehensive crime control act of 1 984 pl 98473 this act as amended makes it federal crime to gain unauthorized access to da mage or use in an illegal manner protected computer systems including federal computers bank computers computers used in interstate and foreign commerce23 legislation specifically requiring system ownersopera tors to take actions to protect their computer systems has been confined to executive federa l agencies most recently the federal information security manageme nt act of 2002 pl 107347 title iii other legislation is primarily aimed at protec ting privacy by protecting certain personal information held by government and private sector entities and affects computer security indirectly for example the grammleachbliley act pl 106102 title v and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hippa pl 104191 title ii subtitle f require that tities have in place programs that protect the financial and healthrela ted information respectively in their possession the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 pp 107204

management operating systems and applications developers say they are paying greater attention to designing better security into their software products but it is still common to have vulnerabilities found in products after they have been put on the market in some cases patches have had to be offered at the same time new product is brought onto the market although patches typically are offered to fix these vulnerabilities many system administrators do not keep their softwarec onfigurations current many intrusions take advantage of software vulnerabilities noted many months earlier for which fixes have already been offered there are as yet agreed upon industry standards for determining how secure firms computer system s hould be or for assessing how secure it is in fact some observers speculate that it is only matter of time before owners of computer systems are held responsible for damage done to thirdparty computer as result of inadequately protecting their own systems24 nor are there any agreed upon standards on how secure vendors software product should be the federal government in cooperation with number of other countries has developed set of international common criteria for information technology security evaluation to allow certified laboratories to test security products and rate their leve l of security for government use these criteria may evolve into industry standards for certifying security products some in the security community feel that security will not improve without some requirements imposed upon the privat sector however both users and vendors of computer software suggest that th market is sufficient to address security in the most costeffective manner th bush administration as the clinton administration before it has chosen to use engagement and not regulation to encourage the private sector to improve s ecurity however both administrations did not rule out the use of regulation if necessary for discussion of the difficulties associated

management act the senate did not take up the bill similar activity is expected in the 110th congress internet privacy concerns related to internet privacy encompass wide range of issues at the center of these issues is how networks can facilitate the collection and transfer of data inexpensively and on large scale while such data transfers can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of services they can also pose great risk if the information is not appropriately protected one example is the surreptitious installation of software spyware by website operators to collect personally identifiable information pii and share that information with third parties usually without the knowledge or consent of th people concerned another example is identity theft which is form of fraud in which the personal identifying information of an individual such as social security number name or date of birth is coopted by another person to facilitate co mmitting criminal or fraudulent act by impersonating the victim spyware25 spyware is another focus of congressional concern there is firm definition of spyware but the most common exampl is software products that include method by which information is collected bout the use of the computer on which the software is installed and the user when the computer is connected to the internet the software periodically relays the information back to the software manufacturer or marketing company some spyware traces users web activity and causes advertisements to suddenly appear on th users monitor called popup ads in response typically users have knowledge that the software they obtained included spyware and that it is now resident on their computers central point of the debate is whether new laws are need ed or if industry selfregulation coupled with enforcement actions under existing ws such as the federal trade commission act is sufficient most recently the 109th congress passed the undertaking spam spyware and fraud

electronic mail29 one aspect of increased use of the inte rnet for electronic mail email has been the advent of unsolicited advertising also called unsolicited commercial email uce unsolicited bulk email junk mail or spam complaints focus on the fact that some spam contains or s links to pornography that much of it is fraudulent that it is nuisance and the volume is increasing although consumers are most familiar with spam on their personal computers it also is becoming an issue in text messaging on wirele ss telephones and pers onal digital assistants pdas in 2003 congress passed federal anti spam law the canspam act pl 108187 which became effective on january 1 2004 the act preempts state laws that specifically address spam but not state laws that are not specific to email such as trespass contract or tort law or other state laws to the extent they relate to fraud or computer crime it does not ban unsolicited commercial email rather it allows marketers to send commercial email as long as it conforms with the law such as including legitimate opportunity for cons umers to optout of receiving future commercial emails from that sender it does not require centralized do not mail registry to be created by the federal trade commission ftc similar to the national do not call registry for telemarketing the law requires only that the ftc develop plan and timetable for establishing do not email registry and to inform congress of any concerns it has with regard to establishing it the ftc reported to congress in june 2004 that without technical system to authenticate the origin of email messages registry would not reduce the amount of spam and in fact might increase it authentication is technical approach that could be used to control spam that is under study by number of groups including isps who are attempting to develop single authentication standard for the industry additionally the canspam act included provision requi ring the fcc to establish regulations to protect wireless consumers from spam30 many argue that technical approaches such as authentication and consumer education are needed to solve the spam problem that legislation alone is insufficient nonetheless there is considerable interest in assessing how effective the canspam act is in reducing spam the effectiveness of the law may be difficult to determine however if for other reason than there are various definitions of spam proponents of the law argue that consumers are most irritated by fraudulent email and that the law should reduce the volume of such email because of the civil and criminal penaltie s included therein skeptics counter that consumers object to unsolicited commercia l email and since the bill gitimizes commercial email as long as it conforms with the laws provisions consumers actually may receive more not fewer unsolicited commercial email messages thus whether spam is reduced pends in part on how it is defined httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9867crs14 31 ftc

reflect th realities of convergence but the agency is still required to adhere to the statutory requirements of its governing legislation the communications act of 1934 thus wh ile convergence has made distinguishing among types of data increasingly difficult the fcc must continue to differentiate among services based on the distinctions drawn in the 1934 act unfortunately when all data looks the same and func tionally similar services are provided by companies governed by different titles of the 1934 act questions of fairness and competitive advantage may arise as newe r technologies and serv ices are developed and deployed applying legacy regulati ons to them may begin to appear more strained the fcc has continued to address num ber of issues directly related to convergence the regulatory cl assification of services via the internet protocol eg voice over internet protocol voip nd law enforcements ability to conduct wiretaps effectively ie using the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea during the 110th congress as there was during the 109th congress there may be legislation to enact nati onal franchising system for video service providers if so this will likely require additional attention from the fcc as well the fcc will also remain focused on broadband deployment the agency will continue to monitor its policies to encour age new providers to roll out new services eg power companies will be deploying broadband over powerlines bpl as well as continue to promote deployment to underserved areas and popul ations ie rural and lowincome communities through universal service and other programs eg the erate one of the difficulties in addressing the issues facing the fcc is that so many of them now intersect so many of the broadband issues are in terrelated that it is often difficult to sort out where one issu ends and another begins for example voip calea and bpl are all tied to the concept of broadband convergence and reliance on the internet for information and it becomes difficult if not impossible to discuss one without touching on the othe rs effectively addressing these types of issues may well be the greatest

enterprise architecture and egovernment issues for in formation technology management by jeffrey w seifertimproving government information technology management practices strengthening computer security and protecting inte llectual property rights in the 110th congress the debate over open source software is anticipated to revol ve primarily around information security and intellectual property rights including the possible development of legal defin ition of open source software however issues related to cost and quality are likely to be raised as well open source software refers to comput er program whose source code or programming instructions is made available to the gene ral public to be improved or modified as the user wishes some exam ples of open source software include the linux operating system and apache web server software in contrast closed source or proprietary programs are those whose source code is not made available and can only be altered by the softwa re manufacturer in the case of closed source software updates to program are usually distributed in the form of patch or as new version of the program that the user can install but not alter some examples of closed source software include micros oft word and corel wordperfect the majority of software produc ts most commonly used such as operating systems word processing programs and databases are cl osed source programs for proponents open source software is often viewed as means to reduce an organizations dependence on the softwa re products of few companies while possibly improving the security and stability of ones computing infrastructure for critics open source software is often viewed as threat to intellectual property rights with unproven cost and quality benefits so far there ppear to be systematic analyses available that have conclusive ly compared closed source to open source software on the issue of security in prac tice computer security is highly dependent on how an application is configured maintained and monitored similarly the costs of implementing an open source solution ar dependent upon factors such as the cost of acquiring the hardwaresoftware inves tments in training for it personnel and end users maintenance and support costs and the resources re quired to convert data and applications to work in the new com puting environment consequently some computer experts suggest that it is not po ssible to conclude th at either open source or closed source software is inherently more secure or more cost efficient the official us federal government policy regarding the use of open source software by government agencies is scribed in july 2004 office of management and budget omb memorandum on softwa re acquisition m04 16 memoranda for senior procurement executives chief information officers software acquisition the memorandum states that the polic ies guiding government information technology investment deci sions are technology and vendor neutral and that agencies technology choices must be c onsistent with the agencys enterprise architecture and the federal enterprise architecture47 agencies are also instructed to take into account number of other ritbased factors in cluding information security licensing requirements and tota l cost of ownership implicit in thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9867crs27 requirements is an expectation that agencies will also make choices based on the quality of the product the growing emphasis on improved in formation security and critical infrastructure protection overall will likely be an influential factor in future decisions to implement open source solutions the rapidly changing computer environment may also foster the use of combin ation of open source and closed source applications rather than creating need to choose one option at the exclusion of anotherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9867crs28 appendix list of acronyms alphabetical listing b2b businesstobusiness b2g
