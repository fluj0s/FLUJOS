are added to the national park system by act of congress although the president may proclaim national monuments on land that is federally managed for inclusion in the system before enacting law to add unit congress might ﬁrst enact law requiring the nps to study an area typically to assess its national signiﬁcance suitability and feasibility and other management options important areas also are preserved outside the national park system through programs managed or supported by the npshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20158 order code rs20158 updated june 10 2008 national park system establishing new

nps of the depa rtment of the interior units generally are added to the national park system by act of congress although the president may proclaim national monuments on land that is fe derally managed for inclusion in the system before enacting law to add unit congress might first enact law requiring the nps to study an area typically to assess its national significance suitability and feasibility and other management options important areas also are preserved outside the national park system through programs managed or s upported by the nps this report will be updated if the processes crite ria and concerns change overview of the system the national park system contains 391 units throughout the nation they are administered by the national park service nps of the department of the interior doi as of december 31 2007 the national park system encompassed 843 million acres of land 788 million acres federa lly owned and 55 million acres of private and other public land eg state land within nps unit boundaries units range in size from less than one acre to more than 13 million acres nearly twothirds of the total acreage is in alaska in 1872 congress designated yellowstone as the worlds first national park subsequently the nation slowly developed system of nati onal parks while some new areas were administered by doi others were managed by different agencies 1916 law created the nps within doi to protect exis ting and future parks monuments and other areas it charged nps with promoting and regulating the use of those areas both to conserve them and to provide for their joyment by the public 1933 executive order furthered the development of national system by transfe rring dozens of sites to nps from other agencies the general authoritie s act of 1970 made ex plicit that all areas managed by nps were part of single syst em and gave all units of the system equal standing with regard to resource protecti on statutes authorizing particular units sometimes provide additional management direction for those units httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20158crs2 1 brief definition for each classification together with description of each unit of the system is included in us dept of the interior nati onal park service office of public affairs and harpers ferry center the national parks index 20052007 washington dc gpo 2005 2 extensions or establishment of monuments in wyoming require the authorization of congress 16 usc 431a and withdrawals in alaska exceeding 5000 acres are subject to congressional approval 16 usc 3213 units of the system generally are managed to preserve resources in their natural or historical conditions for the benefit of futu re generations thus hunting mining and other consumptive resource uses generally are not allowed however in the laws creating units congress sometimes has specified that some of those uses are allowed today there are more than 20 different signations for units of the national park system reflecting the diversity of the areas as of january 30 2008 there were 58 units called national parks the so called crown jewels of the system other commonly used titles include national historic sites 79 national monumen ts 74 national historical parks 42 national memorials 28 national recreation areas 18 and national preserves 18 some classifications s uch as national park are unique to nps while others such as national recreation area also are us ed by other land management agencies1 adding units by public law and presidential proclamation national park system units are created by act of congress except that national monuments also may be added by presiden tial proclamation the antiquities act of 1906 16 usc 431 et seq authorizes the pr esident to create national monuments on land that is already federally owned or controlled th at contains historic landmarks historic and prehistoric structures or other objects of historic or scientific interest2 presidents have designated about 120 monuments since 1906 congress has subseque ntly converted many of them such as the grand canyon to nati onal parks most monuments are managed by nps with many newer monum ents managed by the bureau of land management for more information on national m onuments see crs report rs20902 national monument issues by carol hardy vincent an act of congress creating park system unit may explain the units purpose set its boundaries provide specific directions for land acquis ition planning uses and operations and authorize appropriations for acquisition and development bills to create units generally are within the jurisdiction of the house committee on natural resources and the senate committee on energy and natural resources with appropriations typically contained in interior environment nd related agencies appropriations acts in recent years congress sometimes has enacted freestanding legislation to add units to the national park system congress also has aut horized units as part of omnibus parks and recreation laws containing dozens of recreationrelated measures measures sometimes are packaged to facilitate broad evaluation of an issue and to expedite consideration legislation creating new unit may be preceded by legislation to authorize an nps study of the area as described below provisions of law together with nps po licies govern congre sss consideration of measures to create units of the nationa l park system in 1998 congress amended existing law pertaining to creating units pl 105391 to standardize procedureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20158crs3 3 see 16

ensure congressiona l support for area studies3 current law charges the secretary of the interior with investigating studying and monitoring nationally significant areas with potential for inclusion in the system it outlines procedure for the secretary to study areas to provide congress with info rmation for deciding whether to create park units in the past the national park syst em advisory board composed of private citizens has advised the secretary of the interior on possible additions to the national park system in practice nps performs these functions assigned to the secretary recommending areas for study the secretary of the interi or is required by law to recommend annually to congress list of areas for study for potential inclusion in the national park system the list is to be submitted at the beginning of each year to the house committee on natural resources and the senate committee on energy and natural resources under the same procedure the nps also must submit to congress list of areas previously studied that contain primarily historical resources and list of areas with natural resources areas are to be ranked in order of priority fo r addition to the park system and supported by current data the nps has determined that over the past 20 years about one in every four or five studies concluded that an area was eligible for inclusion within the park system4 for this reason and because the bush administration generally has not supported expanding the park system the administration has not been submitting the annual lists5 candidates for study are identified by di verse sources such as local grassroots preservation interests elected officials nd professional evaluations in the past the secretarys annual list for congress of damage d or threatened areas on the registry of natural landmarks and the national register of historic places also has been used to identify study sites nps scr eens candidates in some cases conducting brief site visit or more detailed rec onnaissance survey to assess an ar ea in the past nps ranked areas that passed the initial screening and the highest priority areas were recommended to congress for study under 16 usc 1a5 nps mu st consider three issues in developing for congress the list of areas recommended for study 1 whether an area is nationally significant and would be suitable and feasible addition to the national park system 2 whether an area represents or includes themes sites or resources not already adequately represented in the system and 3 requests for studies in the form of public petitions and congressional resolutions the popular demand factor httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20158crs4 preparing area studies current law does not appear to explicitly require an nps area study before congress adds unit to the park system but any such study requires specifi c authorization of an act of congress 16 usc 1a5 in the past studies were prepared at the initiative of nps individual members of congress and other entities as well as required by authorization and appropria tions laws the 1998 statutory change sought to liminate these separate sources for initiating studies on the grounds that in some years funding was insufficient to cover all studies and ongoing studies sometimes were not completed because funds were earmarked for other st udies however nps may conduct preliminary activities such as resource assessments provided that they cost less than 25000 after funds are available nps must comp lete study of an area within 3 fiscal years studies are to include public involve ment with at least one public meeting held in the local area and reasonable efforts to notify affected state and local governments and landowners studies also are to comply w ith the national envir onmental policy act of 1969 nepa which requires an assessmen t of the potential impact of the proposed action on the human environment criteria for studies when congress directs the nps to prepare study the agency must consider certain factors estab lished in law to promote the consistency and professionalism of the studies nps is directed to assess whether an area contains natural or cultural resources that are nationally sign ificant constitutes one of the most important examples of type of resource and is suitable and feasible addition to the system the nps has developed criteria for determining national significance suitability and feasibility an area will be regarded as nationally significant if it is an outstanding example of resource exceptionally illustrates or interprets natural or cultural themes of our countrys heritage provides extraord inary opportunities for public enjoyment or scientific study and contains true accurate and relatively unspoiled resource in evaluating national significance the nps considers natural and cultural areas with cultural areas evaluated under the process fo r national historic landmarks 36 cfr part 65 examples of nationally significant natural areas might include refuge that is critical for the survival of species rare land form and an outstanding scenic area cultural areas might include districts sites structures or objects of exceptional quality in interpreting our nations heritage such as those with distinctive architectural types cultural entities generally excl ude cemeteries birth places graves religious properties relocated structures reconstructed buildings and properties of significance within the past 50 years in the past nps also evaluated the national significance of recreational areas but now recreational values are assessed in evaluating natural and cultural areas nps views an area as suitable if it portrays natural or cultural resource insufficiently included in the system unle ss similar area is managed for public use by another agency an area is feasible to add if it is large enough configured so as to allow longterm protection and public use and affordable to mana ge other important issues in assessing the feasibility of adding an area to the national park system include ownership of the land and the cost of acquiri ng it access current and potential land uses threats to resources public s upport and staff or developmen t requirements for instancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20158crs5 privately owned land that the owner is unwilling to sell or that would be expensive to acquire might not be viewed as feasible under 16 usc 1a5 nps studies of poten tial new areas must evaluate variety of factors including the rarity and integrity of the resources resource threats whether similar resources already are protected th costs of acquisition development and operation the socioeconomic ffects of addition the interp retive and educational uses the potential for public use the extent of public support and whethe r the configuration ensures longterm protection and use studi also usually discuss boundary possibilities other manageme nt options in studying an area nps must consider whether protection by other than nps management is appropriate options include administration by other federal agencies state or local governments native american authorities and the private sector consideration may be give n to technical or fina ncial assistance other designations including wilder ness national trail or national histor ic landmark and cooperative management between nps and another ag ency nps generally will not recommend adding an area to the park system if another arrangement already provides or could provide for sufficien t protection and public use th study must identify the best alternatives for protecting resources and llowing public enjoyment each study sent to congress must be accompanied by letter from the secretary that identifies the preferred management option for the area to minimize uncertainty about npss position issues the addition of units to the national park system sometimes has been controversial some discourage adding units arguing that the system is mature or complete while others assert that the system should evolve and grow to reflect current events new information and reinterp retations related issue is how to properly maintain existing and new units given limited fiscal and staffing resources the bush administration generally does not support the cr eation of new park units nd the expansion of existing units to focus funds on maintaining current units the administration has supported some expansions on the grounds that they could be accomplished for relatively little cost supporters of new units have charged that the older units are the most costly also in departure from the past the administration s not recommended to congress as part of its annual budget submissions that areas be studied for possible inclusion in the park system the priority has been to complete studies previously authorized by congress although the administration has testified in support of aut horizing some new studies differences exist on the relative importance of including areas reflecting our natural cultural and social history the adequacy of standards and proce dures for assuring that the most outstanding areas are included in the system also has been debated critics contend that the system has been weakened by including inappropriate areas especially where authoritative information was unavailable incomplete or disregarded in favor of political considerations others counter that there will always be disagreement over the worth of areas and that recently added areas ve been held to the same high standards as older units another issue has been whet her particular resour ces are better protected outside the national park syst em and how to secure the best alternative protectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20158crs6 alternatives to inclusion in the national park system it is generally regarded as difficult to meet the criteria and to secure congressional support and funding for expanding the nati onal park system although th ere may be hundreds or thousands of relate d inquiries to congress and the nps usually more than handful of new units are created each congress many areas are preserved outside the national park system some of these are protected with recognition or assistance by the nps certain areas that receive technical or financial aid from the nps but are neither federally owned nor directly administered by the nps have been classified by the nps as affiliated areas affiliated areas are nationally significant but do not meet the othe r criteria for inclusion in the park system under nps policy they are worthy of sp ecial nps recognition or assistance beyond existing programs are managed in accordance with standards applicable to park units and are to receive sustained resource protection as detailed in an agreement between the nps and the nonfederal manager of the area in the past the affiliated areas have included properties primarily recognized for cultura l or commemorative worth affiliated areas have been created by act of congress and by designation of the secretary of the interior national heritage areas blished by congress cont ain land and properties that reflect the history of their peopl typically they consist mainly of private properties and may include natural scenic historic cultural or recrea tion resources conservation interpretation and other activities are handled by partnershi ps among federal state and local governments and nonprofit organizations and for each area congress has recognized management entity to coordinate efforts the nps supports these efforts through technical and financial assistance and such support is not intended to be permanent supporters of heritage areas ve asserted that they reduce pressure to add new costly and possibly inappropriate areas to the national park system while opponents have feared that they could be used to extend federal control over nonfed eral land differences also have existed over whether to create comprehensive heritage program containing priorities and standards for tablishing heritage areas for more information see crs report rl33462 heritage areas background proposals and current issues by carol hardy vincent and david whiteman some programs give places honorary recogn ition cultural resour ces may be listed by the nps in the national register of hi storic places as meriting preservation and special consideration in planning for federal or federally assisted projects the secretary of the interior may designate natural areas as national natural landmarks and cultural areas as national historic landmarks na tional parks monuments and other areas of international worth may at the request of the united states be recognized by the united nations as world heritage site s or biosphere reserves the congress or the secretary of the interior may designate ri vers as components of the na tional wild and scenic rivers system and trails as part of the national trails system the nps supports local and state governme nts in protecting resources the agency may provide grants for projects including acquisition and development of recreational facilities and technical assistance for conserving rivers trails natural areas and cultural resources in addition to this range of nps programs resources are protected by the private sector state and local govern ments and other federal agencies
