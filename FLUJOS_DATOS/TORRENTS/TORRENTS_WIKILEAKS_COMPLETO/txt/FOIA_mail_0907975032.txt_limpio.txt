from rashit hantemirov rashitipaeuranru to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject short report on progress in yamal work date fri 9 oct 1998 191712 0500 replyto rashit hantemirov rashitipaeuranru dear keith i apologize for delay with reply below is short information about state of yamal work samples from 2172 subfossil larches appr 95 of all samples spruces 5 and birches solitary finding have been collected within region centered on about 67030n 70000e at the southern part of yamal peninsula all of them have been measured success has already been achieved in developing continuous larch ringwidth chronology extending from the present back to 4999 bc my version of chronology individual series indexed by corridor method attached file yamalgnr i could guarantee today that last 4600years interval 2600 bc 1996 ad of chronology is reliable earlier data 5000 bc 2600 bc are needed to be examined more properly using this chronology 1074 subfossil trees have been dated temporal distribution of trees is attached file number unfortunately i cant sign with confidence the belonging to certain species larch or spruce of each tree at present ring width data of 539 dated subfossil trees and 17 living larches are attached file yamalrwm some samples measured on 2 or more radii first letter means species l larch p spruce _ uncertain last cipher radius these series are examined for missing rings if you need all the dated individual series i can send the rest of data but the others are dont corrected as regards to missing rings residuary 1098 subfossil trees dont dated as yet more than 200 of them have less than 60 rings dating of such samples often is not confident great part undated wood remnants most likely older than 7000 years some results i think the temperature reconstruction you will done better than millenniumscale changes of interannual tree growth variability have been discovered there were periods of low 50002800 bc middle 28001700 bc and high interannual variability 1700 bc to the present exact dating of hundreds of subfossil trees gave chance to clear up the temporal distribution of trees abundance age structure frequency of trees deaths and appearances during last seven millennia assessment of polar tree line changes has been carried out by mapping of dated subfossil trees according to reconsructions most favorable conditions for tree growth have been marked during 50001700 bc at that time position of tree line was far northward of recent one unfortunately region of our research dont include the whole area where trees grew during the holocene we can maintain that before 1700 bc tree line was northward of our research area we have only 3 dated remnants of trees from yuribey river sampled by our colleagues 70 km to the north from recent polar tree line that grew during 42004016 and 33302986 bc this period is pointed out by low interannual variability of tree growth and high trees abundance discontinued however by several short 50100 years unfavorable periods most significant of them dated about 40603990 bc since about 2800 bc gradual worsening of tree growth condition has begun significant shift of the polar tree line to the south have been fixed between 1700 and 1600 bc at the same time interannual tree growth variability increased appreciably during last 3600 years most of reconstructed indices have been varying not so very significant tree line has been shifting within 35 km near recent one low abundance of trees has been fixed during 14101250 bc and 500350 bc relatively high number of trees has been noted during 7501450 ad there are evidences of moving polar timberline to the north during last century please let know if you need more data or detailed report best regards rashit hantemirov lab of dendrochronology institute of plant and animal ecology 8 marta st 202 ekaterinburg 620144 russia email rashitipaeuranru fax 7 3432 29 41 61 phone 7 3432 29 40 92 attachment converted ceudoraattachyamalrwm attachment converted ceudoraattachyamalgnr attachment converted ceudoraattachnumber
