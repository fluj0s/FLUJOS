specialist in telecommunications and internet policy resources science and industry division spyware background and policy issues for congress summary the term spyware generally refers to any software that is downloaded onto computer without the owners or users knowledge spyware may collect information about computer users activities and transmit that information to someone else it may change computer settings or cause popup advertisements to appear in that context it is called adware spyware may redirect web browser to site different from what the user intended to visit or change the users home page type of spyware called keylogging software records individual keystrokes even if the author modifies or deletes what was written or if the characters do not appear on the monitor thus passwords credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information may be captured and relayed to unauthorized recipients some of these software programs have legitimate applications the computer user wants they obtain the moniker spyware when they are installed surreptitiously or perform additional functions of which the user is unaware users typically do not realize that spyware is on their computer they may have unknowingly downloaded it from the internet by clicking within website or it might have been included in an attachment to an electronic mail message email or embedded in other software the federal trade commission ftc issued consumer alert on spyware in october 2004 it provided list of warning signs that might indicate that computer is infected with spyware and advice on what to do if it is several states have passed spyware laws but there is specific federal law thus far two bills have been introduced in the house of representatives hr 964 and hr 1525 and one has been introduced in the senate s 1625 both of the house bills have been reported and referred to the senate the senate bill was referred to committee and further action has been taken note this

108th and 109th congresses 8 109th congress 8 108th congress 8 spyware background and policy issues for congress background congress is debating whether to enact new legislation to deal with the growing problem of spyware the antispyware coalition asc1 defines spyware as technologies deployed without appropriate user consent andor implemented in ways that impair user control over 1 material changes that affect their user experience privacy or system security 2 use of their system resources including what programs are installed on their computers andor 3 collection use and distribution of their personal or other sensitive information2 the main issue for congress is whether to enact new legislation specifically addressing spyware or to rely on industry selfregulation and enforcement actions by the federal trade commission ftc and the department of justice under existing law opponents of new legislation argue that industry selfregulation and enforcement of existing laws are sufficient they worry that further legislation could have unintended consequences that for example limit the development of new technologies that could have beneficial uses supporters of new legislation believe that current laws are inadequate as evidenced by the growth in spyware incidents advocates of legislation want specific laws to stop spyware for example they want software providers to be required to obtain the consent of an authorized user of computer optin before any software is downloaded onto that computer skeptics contend that spyware is difficult to define and consequently legislation could have unintended consequences and that legislation is likely to be ineffective one argument is that the bad actors are not likely to obey any optin requirement but are difficult to locate and prosecute also some are overseas and not subject to us law other arguments are that one member of household child for example might unwittingly optin to spyware that others in the family would know 1 the asc is dedicated to building consensus about definitions and best practices in the debate surrounding spyware and other potentially unwanted technologies composed of anti spyware software companies academics and consumer groups the asc seeks to bring together diverse array of perspective on the problem of controlling spyware and other potentially unwanted technologies its members include aol cyber security industry alliance mcafee microsoft surfcontrol us coalition against unsolicited commercial email and yahoo complete list of the groups members is available online at httpwwwantispywarecoalitionorgaboutindexhtm 2 for examples of different types of spyware see httpwwwantispywarecoalitionorg documentsdefinitionsjune292006htm crs2 to decline or that users might not read through lengthy licensing agreement to ascertain precisely what they are accepting in many ways the debate over how to cope with spyware parallels the controversy that led to unsolicited commercial electronic mail spam legislation3 whether to enact new law or rely on enforcement of existing law and industry self regulation were the cornerstones of that debate as well congress chose to pass the canspam act pl 108187 questions remain about that laws effectiveness see crs report rl31953 such reports fuel the argument that spyware legislation similarly cannot stop the threat in the case of spam ftc officials emphasized that consumers should not expect any legislation to solve the spam problem that consumer education and technological advancements also are needed the same is true for spyware software programs that include spyware may be sold or available for free freeware they may be on disk or other media downloaded from the internet or downloaded when opening an attachment to an electronic mail email message typically users have knowledge that spyware is on their computers because the spyware is resident on the computers hard drive it can generate popup ads for example even when the computer is not connected to the internet one example of spyware is software products that include as part of the software itself method by which information is collected about the use of the computer on which the software is installed such as web browsing habits some of these products may collect personally identifiable information pii when the computer is connected to the internet the software periodically relays the information back to another party such as the software manufacturer or marketing company another oftcited example of spyware is adware which may cause advertisements to suddenly appear on the users monitor called popup ads in some cases the adware uses information that the software obtained by tracking users web browsing habits to determine shopping preferences for example some adware companies however insist that adware is not necessarily spyware because the user may have permitted it to be downloaded onto the computer because it provides desirable benefits spyware also can refer to keylogging software that records persons keystrokes all typed information thus can be obtained by another party even if the author modifies or deletes what was written or if the characters do not appear on the monitor such as when entering password commercial key logging software has been available for some time4 in the context of the spyware debate the concern is 3 see crs report rl31953 spam an overview of issues concerning commercial electronic mail by marcia s smith 4 the existence of keylogging software was publicly highlighted in 2001 when the fbi with search warrant installed such software on suspects computer allowing them to obtain his password for an encryption program he used and thereby evidence some privacy advocates argued that wiretapping authority should have been obtained but the judge after reviewing classified information about how the software works ruled in favor of the fbi continued crs3 that such software can record credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information that consumers type when using internetbased shopping and financial services and transmit that information to someone else thus it could contribute to identity theft5 spyware remains difficult to define however in spite of the work done by groups such as the asc and government agencies such as the federal trade commission ftc6 as discussed below this lack of agreement is often cited by opponents of legislation as reason not to legislate opponents of antispyware legislation argue that without widely agreedupon definition legislation could have unintended consequences banning current or future technologies and activities that in fact could be beneficial some of these software applications including adware and keylogging software do in fact have legitimate uses the question is whether the user has given consent for it to be installed an october 2007 report on spyware law enforcement by the center for democracy and technology cdt summarizes active and resolved spyware cases at the federal and state levels7 additionally the ftc maintains its own list of cases8 ftc advice to consumers the ftc has consumer information on spyware that includes link to file complaint with the commission through its onguard online website9 the ftc has also issued consumer alert about spyware that lists warning signs that might indicate computer is infected with spyware10 the ftc alert listed the following clues 4 continued press reports also indicate that the fbi is developing magic lantern program that performs similar task but can be installed on subjects computer remotely by surreptitiously including it in an email message for example 5 for more on identity
