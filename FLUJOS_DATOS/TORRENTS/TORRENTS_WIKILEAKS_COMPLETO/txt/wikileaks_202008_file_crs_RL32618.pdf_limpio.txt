introduction medicare has longstanding history of offering its benefi ciaries managed care coverage through private plans as an alternative to the traditional feeforservice ffs program in which payment is made for each medicarecovered service provided to beneficiary beginning in the 1970s private health plans were allowed to contract with medicare on costreim bursement basis in 1982 medicares risk contract program was created allowing private entities mostly health maintenance organizations hmos to contract with medicare then in 1997 congress passed the bala nced budget act of 1997 bba pl 10533 replacing the risk contract program with the medicarechoice mc program the mc program established new payment structure designed to achieve two major goals 1 reduce sp ending and 2 reduce the variation in payments across the country in general the program made monthly payments in advance to participating private health plans for each enrolled beneficiary in payment area typically county in exchange the plans agreed to furnish all required medicarecovered items and services except hospice services to each enrollee several legislative changes ve been enacted since 1999 to address some of the issues arising from the passage of the bba1 most recently congress made substantial changes to the mc program with the passage of the medicare prescription drug improvement and m odernization act of 2003 mma pl108173 the act creates the medicare advantage ma program to replace the mc program and introdu ces several enhancements intended to increase the availability of private plans to medicare beneficiaries in addition to the immediate payment increases to plans beginning in 2006 the ma program will change the payment structure for local plans and introduce regional plans that operate like preferred provider organizations popular option in the private health insurance market the ma program pr ovides financial incentives for plans to participate in this new regional option additionally in 2006 be neficiaries will have access to medicare part d prescription drug plan whether they are in ffs medicare or enrolled in medicare managed care2 finally beginning in 2010 limited numberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32618crs2 2 continued by jennifer osullivan hinda chaikind sibyl tilson jennifer boulanger and paulette morgan of geographic areas will be selected to examine enhanced competition among local ma plans and competition between those private plans and ffs medicare overview of payment changes in mma the mma made many changes to the payments for medicare managed care plans including immediate changes eff ective march 2004 and then other changes that do not take effect until 2006 and 2010 th is set of changes creates multitiered payment system one for local plans anot her for regional plans and then beginning in 2010 another one for local plans in areas designated as cost containment areas the immediate changes b ecame effective on march 1 2004 first fourth payment mechanism was added to the calcu lation of ma payments so that in 2004 plans are paid the highest of the floor min imum percent increase the blend or new amount see below for description of th three previous payment amounts the new payment amount is 100 of feefors ervice ffs payments made for persons enrolled in traditional medicare the ffs payment is calculated based on the adjusted average per capita costs for the ear for an ma payment area county for services covered under medicare parts nd b for beneficiarie s entitled to benefits under part enrolled in part b and not enrolled in an ma plan other immediate changes were also made to modify the statutory formulas used to calculate ma payments all of these immediate changes discussed in more detail below had the effect of increasing payments to ma plans additional changes to payments for local ma plans will be made beginning in 2006 the secretary will determine ma payment rates by comparing plan bids the plans estimated average revenue requirement ie their estimate of the cost of providing required medicare pa rts and b services to benchmark the maximum amount the federal government is willing to pay plan for providing these required benefits after plans submit their bids the secretary will have the authority to negotiate the bid amount similar to the au thority of the director of the office of personnel management opm with respect to the federal employees health benefits program the secretary will calculate the benchmark by updating the previous years payment in local area by the statutorily required increase if plans bid is less than the benchmark its payment will equal its bid plus rebate of 75 of the difference between the benchmark and the bid the rebate may be used to provide additional benefits reduce cost sharing or may be applied towards the monthly part b premium prescription drug premium or supplemental premium for services beyond required medi care benefits the remain ing 25 of the difference will be retained by the federa l government if plans bi d is equal to or above the benchmark its payment will be the benchmark amount and each enrollee in that plan will pay an additiona l premium equal to the amount by which the bid exceeds the benchmarkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32618crs3 although the program is identified as co mpetitive beginning in 2006 in fact the local benchmark will not be determined in competitive manner that is payment to one plan in an area will not be based on any other plans bid to provide the standard package of medicare services local plans will still continue to compete with one another in order to attract beneficiaries but payments to plans in local areas will continue to be based solely on statutorily defi ned increases beginning in 2006 ma plans that choose to offer prescrip tion drug coverage will also receive benchmark payment for part d prescription drug benefits the benchmark will be competitively determined based on an adjusted average of all plan bids for the area by basing the benchmark for part d benefits on the bids submitted by other plans the payment methodology applied to ma plans for providing prescription drug coverage introduces new form of competition into the program also beginning in 2006 the ma program will begin to offer ma regional plans in 26 regions across the country ma regional plans cover both in and outof network required services and have both limit on outofpocket expenses and unified parts and b deductible each year an organization will submit separate monthly bid amount for each plan it intends to offer in region the regional benchmark will include two components 1 st atutorily determined increase and 2 weighted average of plan bids as with the part d benchmark for ma plans that offer prescription drug benef it the addition of the second component introduces new form of competition among plans by basing part of the benchmark on the bids submitted by the plans similar to local plans plans with bids below the benchmark will be given re bate while plans with bids above the benchmark will require an additional enrollee premium additional financial incentives will be provided to encourage regional plan participation first starting in 2007 th mma establishes stabilization fund to provide incentives for regional plans to enter into and to remain in the ma program there will be 10 b illion in itially provided to the stabilization f und in 2007 and additional amounts will be added to the fund second during 2006 and 2007 medicare will share risk with an ma regiona l plan if its costs fall above or below statutorilyspecified risk corridor third there will be 25 million available beginning in 2006 with an increased amount each year for additional payments to certain hospitals in regional areas that demonstrate they have high costs that would otherwise prevent them from joining an ma network the mma requires the secretary to establish program for the application of comparative cost adjustment cca in cca areas the sixyear cca program is required to begin january 1 2010 and to end december 31 2015 in fixed number of geographic locations the program is designed to examine the efficiency both among local private plans and between the ma program and traditional medicare for that purpose 1 payments to local ma plans will in part be based on competitive bids similar to payments for regional ma plans and 2 part b premiums for individuals enrolled in traditional medicare may be adjusted either up of down depending on the relative costs of medicare ffs and managed care this program will be phasedin so that payments and part b premium adjustments will be fully phased in by the beginning of the f ourth year there is also 5 annual limit on the part b premium adjustment so that the amount of the adjustment for year can not exceed 5 of the amount of the m onthly part b premium in noncca areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32618crs4 3 the secretary must rebase or update 100 of ffs at least once every three years but may also choose to update as often as annually for 2005 the secretary chose to rebase ffs and as result the 2005 payment rate will be the higher of the minimum increase or the ffs amount in years in which the secretary does not rebase ffs payments ma payments will be based on the minimum increase update onlyin addition to these payment changes all ma plans will be able to offer part d medicare prescription drug coverage beginning in 2006 as part of the annual bidding process managed care organizations offering ma plans with prescription drug coverage must include their estimate for the cost of the part d prescription drug coverage for each ma plan they intend to offer plans may also choose to offer supplemental benefits such as vision or dental coverage whic h are not included in the basic medicare package plans will be required to submit bid for any supplemental benefits they intend to offer each part of the ma local regional and cca payment structure is discussed in more detail below along with an analysis of the effect of the change in the mma on medicare managed care payments for local ma plans the medicare statute for the mc prog ram set the annual managed care per capita rate for payment area for contract in calendar year at the highest of one of three amounts calculated for each county rate calculated as blend of an areaspecific local rate and national rate minimum payment or floor rate or rate reflecting minimum increase from the prior years rate the revised law for the ma program dded fourth payment type so that beginning march 2004 ma plans are paid th highest of the floor minimum percent increase the blend or new amount th new payment amount is 100 of feefor service ffs payments made for persons enrolled in traditional medicare in the county beginning in 2005 the law long er allows ma paym ents to be annually updated by the floor or blend although the increase that was applied to both the floor and blend the national growth percentage is incorporated into the minimum increase amount beginning in 2006 the mma changes the pa yment structure for ma local plans by establishing benchmarks in genera l the benchmark amount is the maximum amount that the federal government would be willing to pay to private plans in an area for the provision of required medicare parts and b benef its the benchmark amount for local plan will be calculated by increasing the previous years payment rate by the minimum increase or in certain years3 by the greater of the minimum increase or 100 of the per capita ffs amounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32618crs5 4 prior to enactment of the bba payments for ca re of medicare beneficiaries in risk health maintenance organizations hmos were based on the aapcc the aapcc represented monthly payment to cover the cost of treatmen t in medicare risk hmo it was calculated according to complex formula based on the cost of providing medicare benefits to beneficiaries in the feeforservice portion of the medicare program the per capita payment was set at 95 of the aapcc and was adjusted for certain demographic characteristics of hmo enrollees the ffs payment which was added in the mma is also based on the aapcc for an ma payment area county 5 medicare pays for the both the direct and indi rect costs of gme direct payments include payment for expenses such as salaries of residents interns and faculty the indirect adjustment accounts for factors not directly related to education which may increase the costs in teaching hospitals such as treating mo re severely ill patients and increased testingalthough many of the components of the ma payment structure are not in effect after 2004 each is described in more detail below in part to provide an historical perspective and in part to provide be tter understanding of the effect of the mma on medicare managed care the major f actors for determining medicares annual local ma per capita rates are summarized in table 1 blended rates the goal of the blended rate was to reduce variation in payments across the country by gradually shiftin g county rates away from sole ly local rates reflecting wide variations in feeforservice costs toward national average rate blending is designed to reduce payments in counties where the adjusted average per capita costs aapccs4 historically were higher than the national average rate and to increase payments in counties where aapccs were lower the blended rate in effect for 2004 was based on 50 of the annual areaspecific mc per capita rate for the year for the payment area and 50 of the input price adjusted annua l national mc per capita rate for the year the component of the blend determined by the areaspecific cal rate is based on the 1997 aapcc for the payment area with two adjustments first the areaspecific rate is reduced to remove an amount corre sponding to graduate medical education gme5 payments second rates are updated each year by national growth percentage described below the component of the blend determined by the national rate is weighted average of all local areaspecific rates this component of the blend is adjusted to refl ect differences in certa in input prices such as hospital labor costs by formula stated in the law each year the blended rates are raised or lowered to achieve budg et neutrality however there was budget neutrality adjustment for payments ffective march 2004 described below effect of mma although the blend will not be used to update payments after 2004 eliminating it will have lmost material effect on payments to plans because of the budget neutrality requireme nt the blend was used only once to update payments between 1998 and 2003 the mma waives budget neutrality for 2004 only so that plans in about 3 of coun ties covering about 8 of enrollees were paid the blend in 2004 see budget neut rality below additionally for 2004 the mma required an adjustment to the cal component of the blend to includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32618crs6 6 see discussion of national growth percentage for an explanation of how the adjustment for prior years errors actually lowered the floor payments in 2003additional payments that would have been made to plans if medicare beneficiaries entitled to benefits from facilities of the depa rtment of veteran affairs va and the department of defense dod had not used those rvices vadod adjustment including the adjustment may have increas ed payments to plans however cms did not implement this adjustment as it did not have the necessary data minimum payment floor rate each county is also subject to floor ra designed to raise payments in certain counties more quickly than would occur through the blend alone initially the bba provided for floor rate that would apply to all counties within the united states and for 2000 this minimum rate was 402 per month separate minimum was also established for areas outside ie territories the united states beginning march 2001 bipa established multiple floor rates based on popul ation and location for 2001 the fl oor was 525 for aged enrollees within the 50 states and the district of columbia residing in metropolitan st atistical area msa with population of more than 250000 for any other areas within the 50 states and the district of columbia the floor was 475 for any area outside the 50 states and the district of columbia the 525 and 475 floor amounts we re also applied except that the 2001 floor could not exceed 120 of the 2000 floor amount as required by law these payment amounts are increased annually by measure of growth in program spending see discussion of national grow th percentage below in 2002 the floor was 553 for the larger msas and 500 for any other areas within the 50 states the 2003 floors were lower than the 2002 floors 548 for the larger msas and 495 for any other areas within the 50 states6 the march 2004 floors were 614 for the larger msas and 555 for any other areas within the states effect of mma the floor will not be used to update payments after 2004 the floor amount was included in the original mc payment structure as means to achieve one of its goals reducing variation in paymen ts across the country the bba established minimum amount that could be paid to plan increasing the lowest plan payments in the country for example prior to mc the lowest payment to plan in 1997 was 221 and with the in troduction of the floor that payment was increased to 367 in 1998 jump of 67 in 1997 the gap from lowest to highest payment was 546 declining to 416 with th introduction of the floor payments for the floor were reset in 2001 which furt her decreased variation in 2004 plans in about 67 of counties c overing about 29 of enroll ees were paid based on the floor the gap from lowest to highest payment increased in 2004 to 592 and is expected to continue to increase under th new payment rules for ma plans created in the mma minimum percentage increase historically the minimum increase rule was included to protect counties that would otherwise receive only small if any increase in 1998 the minimum rate for any payment area was 102 of its 1997 aapcc for 1999 and 2000 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32618crs7 7 the blend is more difficult to assess because of the budget neutrality which prevented the blend payments from being paid in all years except 2000 and 2004 when it was eliminated 8 as previously mentioned cms is curre ntly unable to make this adjustmentincrease was 102 of the annual mc per cap ita rate for the previous year bipa applied 3 minimum update for 2001 beginni ng in march for subsequent years the minimum increase returned to an annual january update of an additional 2 over the previous years amount the minimum percentage increase was the only positive update for 2003 mc payments the mma changed the calculation of the minimum percentage increase for 2004 and bey ond the minimum percentage increase will be the greater of 2 increase over the prev ious years payment rate as under current law or the previous years payment increased by the national growth percentage discussed below effect of mma previously the national growth percentage was only applied to the floor rate or the local portion of the blend rate7 plans received the minimum update rate only if they fa red better with 2 or 3 minimum update to their previous years rate than if they received payment calculated by increasing the floor by the national growth percenta ge this was the case for minimum update counties because their payment rate from the prior year was so much higher than the floor rate under the new ma payment rules plan has its prior year amount increased by the higher of the minimum upda or the increase in the national growth percentage this could result in higher payments to plans than under the previous system adding the second component to the minimum increase the national growth percentage incorporates the increase that had been used to update the floor and blend both of which will longer be used after 2004 another difference is that the calcula tion of the national growth percentage includes an adjustment for prior years errors mma eliminated the effect of prior years errors for years before 2004 in 2004 plans in about 4 of counties covering about 23 of enrollees were paid ba sed on the new minimum increase in 2005 about 21 of counties coveri ng about 53 of enrollees are paid based on the new minimum increase in 2006 all counties will receive the minimum update payment feeforservice rate for payments effective march 2004 f ourth payment type was added the new payment amount is 100 of feefors ervice ffs payments made for persons enrolled in traditional medicare the ffs payment is calculated based on the adjusted average per capita co st for the year for an ma payment area county for services covered under medicare parts nd b for beneficiarie s entitled to benefits under part enrolled in part b and not rolled in an ma plan this payment is adjusted to remove payments for direct medical education costs and to include the vadod adjustment8 effect of mma in 2004 payments in about 26 of counties covering about 40 of enrollees were based on the ffs payments in future years the secretary must rebase ffs at least once every thr ee years but could choose to rebase more often such as each year or every two years for 2005 the secretary decided tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32618crs8 rebase ffs rebasing ffs rates means that the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms actuari recalculate the per capita ffs expenditures for each county for end stage renal disease esrd beneficiaries ffs expenditures are calculated by state so that ffs rate s reflect more recent growth in ffs expenditures in 2005 payments in about 21 of counties are ba sed on the updated ffs rates in these counties the rebased ffs local growth rates were larger than the national growth percentage used in the minimum percentage increase for that year and the ma payment increase was be based on 100 ffs service however about 80 of counties had slower or negativ growth in ffs compared to national rates and in those counties the minimum update was pplied in 2006 the secretary will not rebase ffs rates in years in which the secretary chooses to rebase more frequently than required by statute the announcemen t will be provided in the annual advance notice released 45 days prior to the first monday in april exclusion of payments for graduate medical education gme the bba required that payments for gm including both indirect and direct medical expenses must be excluded or carved out of the payments to mc plans phased in over five years by 2002 according to the bba gme payments can only be carved out of the blend payment am ount not the floor or minimum increase payment as result the gme carve out could not occur in year in which payment was based on the blended rate the mma allows gme carveout for payments to ma plans when based on 100 of ffs but only for direct medical education costs effect of mma beginning in 2005 when the blend payment is longer used to update payments for plans there w ill longer be any carveout for indirect medical education costs further any adjustment for direct medical education costs will be limited to those ma plans whose payments are based on 100 of ffs payments can only be based on 100 ffs in years in which the secretary rebases ffs however as previously discussed medicare payments to plans have rarely been based on the blend the only payment mechanism that allowed gme adjustment prior to the passage of mma therefore this change should have very little material impact on ma payments to local plans budget neutrality the bba required that once the pre liminary rate was determined for each county budget neutrality adjustment woul d be applied to dete rmine final payment rates this adjustment was made so that estimated total mc payments in given year would equal total payments that woul d be made if paymen ts were based solely on areaspecific rates budget neutrality adjustment was only applied to the blended rates because rates could not be reduced below the floor or minimum increase amounts as result of this limita tion it was not always possible to achieve budget neutrality the law made provisi on for achieving budget neutrality after all county rates were assigned either the floor or minimum increase when this situation occurred for the 1998 1999 2001 2002 and 2003 rates the centers for medicare and medicaid servi ces cms chose to waive the budgetneutrality rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32618crs9 9 in 1998 the reduction was 08 percentage points from 1999 through 2001 it was 05 percentage points and in 2002 the bbra set the reduction at 03 percentage points there is reduction after 2002 10 because bipa increased mc payments beginning in march 2001 cms calculated revised national growth percentage of 49 for 2002 to be applied to these new bipa payment levels the difference between the revi sed national growth percentage increase and the original increase is the 32 increase for bipa adjustments it was not necessary to include this 32 adjustment in the revised increase as it was already reflected in the mar 1 2001 payment levelsrather than the floor or minimum rate ru while the cost of waiving budget neutrality was not significant in 1998 and 1999 less than 100000 each year the cost was about 1 billion in 2002 and 900 million in 2003 in 2004 the mma did not allow the budget neutrality adjustment to be applied to blend payments and beginning in 2005 the blend will long er be used to update payments effect of mma budget neutrality is only eliminated for 2004 however it only affects the blend which will not be us ed after 2004 eliminating budget neutrality in 2004 ensured that the blend payment did not have to be reduced and plans in 3 of counties were able to ge t payment based on the blend national growth percentage the national per capita mc growth percen tage is defined as the projected per capita increase in total medicare expenditures minus specific reduction set in law for certain years9 because this increase is tied to total medicare expenditures it maintains link between national medicar feeforservice spending and managed care spending starting with the 1999 mc payments adjustments were also made for errors in the previous years spending projection the national growth percentage for 2001 after the reduction and adjustments was 13 however because bipa set th floor rates in 2001 the national growth percentage was not used to calculate th floor rate in 2001 it was only used to calculate the blend rate for 2001 for 2002 the estimated national growth pe rcentage increase over the prebipa payment amount used for january and februa ry of 2001 was 83 this figure was based on 56 projected per capita increas in total medicare expenditures 03 percentage point reduction set by the bbra minus 03 adjustment for errors in the previous years projection of spendi ng 1998 2001 and an increase of 32 to account for the impact of bipa10 the increase used to calculate the floor payment for 2002 was 53 reflecting only the projected per capita increase in total medicare expenditures of 56 and the 03 percentage point reduction set by the bba there was adjustment for prior year errors as the floor amounts were reset by the amounts established in bipa for 2003 the projected national growth percentage increase was actually decrease of 29 this decr ease reflected 09 increase in per capita costs and negative 38 adjustment for prior years errors the 29 factor was used tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32618crs10 11 because bipa reset the floor payments in 2001 adjustments to the floor were only made for prior year errors occurring in 2002 and beyondupdate the 2002 blend rate the 2003 update for the fl oor was 1 reflecting the same 09 increase in per capita costs but only 19 decrease for the prior year error in 2002 estimates11 because both of these update s were negative the minimum percentage increase was the only positive update for 2003 yielding the highest mc payment for most counties for 2004 the projected national growth percentage increase for january and february was 95 for the blend and 82 for the floor the revised projection due to the passage of the mma was 129 for the blend and 121 for the floor beginning in march as required by the mma the revised increases did not include an adjustment for prior years errors for 2005 the projected national growth percentage increase is 66 this increase reflects 5 correction for prior years 2004 estimates for 2006 the projected national growth percentage is 48 this increase reflects 3 correction for pr ior years 2004 and 2005 estimates effect of mma although both the blend and fl oor payments will not be used to update payments after 2004 the same incr ease that was applied to these payments every year the national growth percentage will continue to be part of the ma payment calculation as it will become one of the two possible increases to the minimum increase amount historically the adjustment for prior years errors was

adjusted to control for variations in the cost of providing health care among medicare beneficiaries for example if sicker and older patients all sign up for one plan risk adjustment is designed to compensate the plan for their above aver age health expenses the fo rmer medicare risk contract program adjusted the aapccs for demographic risk factors and when the mc program was implemented it also used these demographic risk adjusters demographic risk adjusters include those for age gender working status medicaid coverage whether the beneficiary origin ally qualified for medicare on the basis of disability and institutional nursing home status however these demographic risk ad justers accounted for only very limited portion of the variation in health care cost s and as result the bba required the secretary of hhs to develop new risk adjustment mechanism that would also account for variations in health st atus beginning in january 2000 cms implemented this new risk adjustment mechanism built on 15 principal inpatient diagnostic cost groups pipdcgs paymen ts were adjusted ba sed on inpatient data using the pipdcg adjuster and demographic factors so that this new system accounted for both demographic and healths tatus variations in addition to demographic adjustment under this mechan ism the per capita payment made to plan for an enrollee was also adjusted if that enrollee had an inpatient stay during the previous year separate demographicallybased payments were used for newly eligible aged persons newly eligible disabled medicare enrollees and others without medical history the bbra and bipa made changes to the secretarys proposed phasein schedule of this new system through 2002 plans were concerned because this new risk adjustment methodology reduced ggregate mc payments slowing down its implementation lesse ned the reduction through 2003 10 of payments included risk adjustment adding the pipdcg met hod and 90 were based solely on the older demographic method bipa made additional changes to risk adjustment in order to account for more of the variation in health status ne w risk adjustment methodology began in 2004 which adds data from ambulatory settings this new risk adjustment will be phased in at the rate of 30 in 2004 50 in 2005 75 in 2006 and 100 beginning in 2007 in march 2002 cms announced that th new risk adjustment

from the cca area if in 2010 it does not offer at least two ma local plans each offered by different ma organization if an ma local area meets the requirement for 2010 it will conti nue to be included in the cca area for subsequent years even if it longer meets the requirements as long as there is at least one ma local plan offered in the local area the benchmark for ma local plans in cca area will be calculated using formula that weights the ffs portion and local plan portion described below the ffs portion is based on the projected ffs amount for the area with certain adjustments for demographics and health st atus the local plan portion is based on weighted average of bids for plans in the area for medicare beneficiaries in ffs part b premiums in cca areas will be adjusted either up or down depending on whether the ffs amount is more or less than the cca area benchmark if the ffs amount is greater than the benchmark beneficiaries in traditional medicare ffs will pay higher part b premium than other ffs beneficiaries in noncca areas if th ffs amount is less than the benchmark the part b premium for ffs beneficiaries will be reduced by 75 of the difference these increases and decreases are subject to 5 limit that is adjustments to part b premiums in cca areas cannot exceed 5 of the national part b premium beneficiaries in traditional medicare ffs with incomes below 150

to ma plans for part d medicare prescription drug benefits beginning in june 2004 ma plans c ould begin offering medicareendorsed drug discount cards that were effective in july 2004 to their own enrollees through the newly established drug discount card program under mma the cards can provide discounts on drug prices even if the plan does not have drug benefit or if the plan benefit cap is reached beginning in 2006 ma plans may but are not required to offer part d prescription drug coverage furthermore enrollment in part d is voluntary and as result beneficiaries who chose to enroll in ma plans will not be required to enroll in an maprescription drug mapd plan however the requirements placed on ma plans could lead to situation in which the only ma plans available in an area are those offering prescription drug covera ge at least one plan offered by an ma organization in an area is required to be an mapd plan one that offers part d prescription drug coverage therefore if only one organization offers an ma plan in an area and it offers only one plan that plan would have to be an mapd and the beneficiary would have to enro ll in part d in order to enroll in an ma plan in this situation beneficiary who did not want to enroll in part d would have to receive medicare services through traditional ffs dicare if an ma organization offers more than one plan in an area only one is required to provide part d prescription drug coverage each organization in an area is subject to this standard so that even if there are multiple plans in an area each organization must offer at least one plan that includes prescrip tion drug coverage mapd plans will receive drug subsidies for their enrollees ma organizations offering prescription drug coverage will r eceive direct subsid for each enrollee in an mapd plan equal to the plans risk adjusted standardized bid amount reduced by the base beneficiary premium the plan will also receive the reinsurance payment amount21 for the federal share finally an mapd plan will also receive reimbursement for premium nd costsharing reduction for its qualifying lowincome enrollees beneficiaries who enroll in plan offeri ng part d must pay the standard part d premium however mapd plans offering rebate may use all or part of that rebate as credit toward the ma monthl prescription drug beneficiary premium the prescription drug programs offered through ma plans have the potential to be very different than coverage offered to ffs beneficiaries and as result costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32618crs32 andor enrollment in ma plans could be affected plans might be able to decrease costs or increase services thus becoming more attractive benefit for the following reasons 1 ma plans that currently offer prescription drug coverage will have more experience working with medicare beneficiaries and may be more efficient 2 ma plans could augment funds they already use for prescription drugs and offer more generous coverage than the standard benefit 3 ma plans could also transfer their old prescription drug money to offer othe r services and 4 ma plans cover parts and b benefits and may ther efore be able to realize so savings which could be passed onto the beneficiary such as reduced hospitalization from medicares prescription drug coverage on the ot her hand enrollment in ma plans could decrease if beneficiaries move from ma plans to ffs once they can receive prescription drug coverage without the restrictions of more limited provider network conclusion the mma made many substantial changes to the medicare managed care program ranging from increasing funds to creating new regional program by 2010 limited number of geographic areas w ill be selected to examine enhanced competition among local ma plans and competition between private plans and ffs medicare these changes are designed to increase private plan participation in medicare and thus provide more medicare be neficiaries with an alternative to ffs coverage the mc program had difficulty meeting similar goals and the mma changes were designed to address some of these problems as the major program changes in ma will not take effect until 2006 it will take few years at minimum to determine the success of these changes part of the success will depend on whether private plans are receptive to providing services in accordance with these new statutes
