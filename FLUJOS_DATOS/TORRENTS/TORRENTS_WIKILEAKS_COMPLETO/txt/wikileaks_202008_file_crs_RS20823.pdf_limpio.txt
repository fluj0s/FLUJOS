weiss analyst in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the european union eu data privacy directive adopted by the european parliament and counc il on october 24 1995 prevents eubased organizations public and private from transferring personal data to countries wh ere the legal protections for personal data are not deemed adequate this directive intended to harmonize national european privacy po licies allowed eu member countries three years to implement the directive to prevent the interruption of data transfers the us department of commerce doc negotiated the safe harbor agreement with the eu while the eu has recently stated that all elements of the agreement are in place safe harbor raises many significant issues of interest to congress these include the extraterritorial application of eu law nontariff barriers business costs consumer protection as well as enfor cement and dispute settlement background1 on october 24 1995 the european union eu agreed upon directive 9546 ec to harmonize differing national legisl ation on data privacy protection2 the directive creates legally binding obligation on each eu member state to implement domestic legislation conforming to unified set of standards it is expected to facilitate information flows within the eu strengthen the eus internal market and foster the development of an informationbased economy this direc tive was supplemented two years later by directive 9766ec which concerned the hand ling and privacy of pe rsonal data in the telecommunications industry httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20823crs2 on may 1 2004 ten new member states form ally joined the european union eu these nations are cyprus the czech repub lic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia nd slovenia as result eu gislation including the eu data protection directive directive 9546ec as well as the adequacy finding for the useu safe harbor framework are now binding upon the new member states the directive applies to all organizations public and private operating in the eu including affiliates of us corporations it covers the processing of all personal data whether done automatically or manually there is exception for public records such as telephone directory listings only in formation compiled for private personal household use is excluded under the directive data may be collected and used only for specified explicit and legitima purposes security and accu racy must be guaranteed individuals have not only the right to access and the right to correct errors but also to remedial measures and compensa tion if necessary the transfer of data to third parties may occur only under similarly stri ct requirements more stringent rules apply to the processing of sensitive data including data relating to race ethnic origin political religious or philosophical belie fs and health status or sex life the directive also requires the creation of data protection agencies dpas in each of the fifteen eu member states registration of data bases with these authorities nd sometimes prior dpa approval before organi zations or firms may be gin data processing the transfer of personal data to any nation outside the eu that does not meet the eu test of adequacy with regard to privacy protection is prohibited according to the eu privacy protection in the united states may fail this test the directive thus potentially threatens to disrupt or in some limited cases even prevent the transfer of data between the eu and the united states rationale for the agreement europe and the united states have fundamentally diffe rent attitudes towards the protection of personal da ta the right to privacy is fundamental human right recognized both in the european convention for the pr otection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and in the general principles of european community laws with regards to personal information europeans are more trusting of governments than the private sector it follows that european governments have turned to legislation to regulate the flow of personal information by contrast the united states has adopt ed sectorbysector approach through mix of legislation regulati on and industry selfregulation such as the federal rules applicable to medical records moreover us firms tend to view personal data as valuable commercial asse t rather than as an individual asset until recently it had been left to the marketplace to establish privacy principles on sectorbysector basis congress has increased its involvement in the privacy area most notably with the enactment of financial privacy legislation in 1999 childrens online privacy legislation in 1998 and the consideration of on line privacy legislation in the 107th congress to prevent the stoppage of data transfers from the eu to the us the us department of commerce doc negotiated the safe harbor agreement with the eu the agreement

adhere to the principles to continue crossborder data transfers with eu member states the principles are designed to serve as guidance to us organizations seeking to comply with the adequacy requirement of the directive and would provide organizations within the safe harbor presumption of adequacy and data transfers from member states of the european union could continue organizati ons would come into the safe harbor by selfcertifying that they adhere to these privacy principles in february 13 2002 working paper s ec 2002 196 the eu commission noted that all elements of the safe harbor agreement are in place current european concerns address the level of transparency needed to discern an individual firms commitment to the agreement and the fact that the dispute settlement mechanisms have not been tested other european and domestic concerns include the vagueness of adequacy determination the lack of agreement on tran sfer of personal information in financial services the possible disputed legality of ftc enforcement and the actual willingness of the ftc to prosecute us firms on behalf of the eu basics of the safe harbor framework in addition to the eu privacy directive itself the safe harbor framework encompasses seven basic principles fifteen frequently asked questions faqs the eu commissions adequacy decision an exchange of letters between the doc and

fair credit reporting act pl 91508 15 usc 1681 et seq or the recently enacted financial services modernization act pl 106102 popularly known as the grammleachbliley act provide adequate privacy protections as result negotiations between the united states and the eu to achieve an agreement covering the financial sector continue while negotiations regarding data tr ansfers in the financial services are still taking place astandstill on any eu action against data transfers from the eu to the us is in effect the us government and priv ate financial institutions have called upon the eu to grant an adequacy determination to financial services firms they argue that privacy legislation such as the fair credit reporting act the financial services modernization act and numerous state laws confer more than adequate protection of data privacy in the financial services industry5 issues for congress safe harbor is clearly intended to fac ilitate transatlantic data exchange and hence transatlantic commerce both online and off neverthele ss it raises number of policy concerns that may be of interest to congress6 extraterritoriality article 25 of the eu directive allows for individual analysis of thirdparty countries that tr ansfer personal information from europe and gives the eu the right to halt the flow of informati on if they determine that the third parties do not have adequate privacy protecti on determination of adequacy can be made by any eu member this presents two specific concerns first the directive extends eu law beyond eu boundaries not just to the us but to any nation with which eu organizations are likely to ex change personal information second some analysts are concerned that since the definition of adequacy is left vague the eu and its member states could selectively fine adequate protection thus using data privacy as form of nontariff barrier7 consumer protection in recent years the privacy issue has achieved heightened importance among consumers particularly those using the internet consumer advocates in europe worry that safe harbor falls short of eur opean data protection laws some europeans are concerned whether eu citizens who feel that their privacy rights are being violated will have the right to sue in united states courts domestically some are concerned that us firms will be extending greater protection to europeans than to our own citizens the effectiveness of business backed selfregulatory privacy programs such as bbbonline and truste has alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20823crs6 8 see pritchard timothy canada

building consumer confidence and furthering the development of ecommerce relationship to the us law while the safe harbor framework might be seen as accommodating internati onal realities ftc and dot enforcement could give safe harbor the force of law the us congress did not participate in its formulation but must contend with pr ivate sector concerns regarding its requirements moreover in extending eu law on privacy to us organizations it affects the domestic debate on privacy issues the eu directive has been seen by some as model of data privacy protec tion and reportedly played role in the january 1 2001 implementation of new privacy law in canada8 some suggest that as the internet strengthens its global pres ence and other countri such as those in europe take an active pos ition in creating standards for this new medium the importance of us standards and rules will likely diminish compliance compliance within the eu itself is uneven the eu commission took legal action against six states denmar k france germany ireland luxembourg and the netherlands for failure to comply with the directive according to one source luxembourg has been condemned by the court for its noncompliance ireland has bill in parliament but it has not been dopted yet the cases against denmark france germany and the neth erlands have since been dropped encryption the privacy of data in the comput er age is often achieved by using encryption technology thus us policy on the export of encryption technology shadows this issue even after the july 2000 libera lization allowing export of encryption products of any strength to bot h government and private sector entities in the eu export of encryption technolog remains subject to certain controls market segmentation the directive may cause firms to segregate their european operations especially their data processing from those in the united states and elsewhere this compliance could require expensive organizational changes data subject to the directive may have to be maintained and proce ssed separately and series of notices and permissions are required affiliates and subsidiaries might be considered third partiesensuing
