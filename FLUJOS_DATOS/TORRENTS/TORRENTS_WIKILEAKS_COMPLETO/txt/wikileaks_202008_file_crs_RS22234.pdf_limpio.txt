minimizing economic impacts vision 100 pl 108176 ma ndated security plan to resume ga flights at ronald reagan washington national airport dca and congressional oversight in part led to the easing of flight restrictions at the three ga airports lying within the 15mile restricted airspace around washington dc while these actions have served to enhance accessibility to the ncr by ga aircraft in furthe rance of air commerce in the region the capitol airspace enfo rcement act hr 3465 seeks to impose statutory suspensions of pilot licenses and increase civil and criminal penalties for airspace violators the bill w ould also require mandatory pilot training in an effort to curtail inadvertent airspace violations that complicate the task of defending the ncr airspace from possible aerial attack critics of this measure argue that stiff penalties will do little to curb inadvertent violations and extensive pilot education efforts are already underway3 ga advocates also worry that harsher penalties will further damage aviation related businesses in the area in august 2005 the federal aviation admin istration faa in consultation with the department of homeland security dhs and the depa rtment of defense proposed to make permanent the special flight rules that currently exist on temporary basis to monitor flights over wide area around the ncr4 ga user groups who had hoped the temporary restrictions woul d be eased or lifted have d ecried this move as largely unnecessary and overly restric tive and fear that the proposal would negatively impact ga pilots and further jeopardize aviationrelated businesses in the region5 airspace restrictions and special flight rules the airspace in the ncr has been placed under close surveillance and speci flight restrictions primarily affecting ga aircraft ever since september 11 2001 previously the airspace around washington dc was relatively open and accessible to ga as well as commercial aircraft while the airspace directly above some sensitive locations like the white house and the capitol was then and still is prohibited airspace i offlimits to all civil aircraft this comprised relatively small portion of the total airspace in the ncr before september 11 2001 ga aircraft were rou tinely permitted to operate over washington dc and the surrounding area so long as these prohibited ar eas were avoided and pplicable air traffic procedures were followed dca in clos proximity to downtown washington dc and key federal facilities was open and accessible to most ga aircraft however over the past 4 years airspace restrict ions in the washington dc regi on have gone through several significant changes to address heightened security concerns httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22234crs3 6 nautical miles are the

roughly 15 nautical mile radius the dimensions that continue to exist today for the area known as the flight restricted zone frz the maryland three airports in february 2002 the ban on ga operations

protocols in february 2005 frz restrictions were further relaxed allowing transient aircraft to fly to and from these airports provided that their pilots d passed background checks received special training and adhered to sp ecific security procedures8 the reopening of these airports has been politically sensitive issue both washington executive and potomac airports are operated by small business entities that have been significantly impacted by the flight restrictions while college pa rk airport established in 1909 as site for the wright brothers to train military aviators is considered the worlds oldest continuously operated airport the air defense identification zone adiz in february 2003 additional steps were taken to secure th skies above washington dc by establishing an outer area beyond the frz where ga flights must opera under close surveilla nce and in constant 2way radio contact with air traffic controllers this area is known as the washington dc air defense identification zone adiz the adiz came into existence not immediately following september 11 2001 as ma ny mistakenly assume but rather as part of operation liberty shield launched by the dhs to enhance homeland security during the buildup toward the war in iraq the washington adiz was established as temporary flight restricti on and similar adiz was estab lished around new york city smaller scale rest ricted area was put in place over downtown chicago during that time the temporary restrictions in new york and chicago have since been rescinded but the washington dc adiz remains in policy discussions the adiz has often been oversimplified scribed as being simply 30nautical mile ring around washin gton dc the dimensions of the adiz are in fact quite bit larger than this the adiz shown

which it completely encapsulates of more than 3000 square nautical miles the frz roughly follows 15nautical mile radius around dca and thus blankets an additional 700 square nautical miles both the adiz and th frz extend from the surface to 18000 feet vision 100 pl 108176 enacted in decem ber 2003 included language requiring the faa to justify the continued existence of the adiz and identify any possible changes to improve the operational efficiency or minimize the operational impact on pilots and controllers in january 2004 special proce dures were implemented at many of the airports on the outer edges of the adiz for aircraft departing the airspace to reduce pilot and controller workload similarly special arrival and departure procedures were instituted at two airports located on kent island in the chesapeake bay these measures had been tested during brie f trial period in october 2003 but were implemented on continuous basis beginning in january 2004 in part due to the c ongressional mandate to improve operational efficiency within the adi z since then additional changes have been made to the adiz the faas proposed special flight rules area on august 4 2005 the faa unveiled plans to create permanent special flight rules area sfra virtually identical to the temporary flight restrictions currently in place for the adiz and frz9 user groups have decried the m ove to make these restricti ons permanent questioning why such large restricted area and complex secu rity procedures are necessary on longterm basis ga users had long hoped that instea d the adiz would eventually be rescinded and fear that this proposed action will have lasting impacts on avia tionrelated businesses in the region according to the aircraft own ers and pilots association aopa business

implementing these airspace protections also involves sizable federal investment costing about 11 million annually according to faa estimates11 insofar as these measures can help deter or avert terrorist attack these costs are likely to be considered reasonable however questions remain regarding whether less costly alternatives could provide equally adequate protections the size and shape of the proposed sfra and the specific security requirements to operate within this area remain central issues in the debate over how to best prot ect assets in the ncr from possible attacks using aircraft without unduly impeding air commerce or compromising aviation safety restoring general aviation at dca while the faa has initiated action to make the security features of the ncr ai rspace permanent the transportation security administration tsa has issued rulemaking to fulfill the congressional mandate to restore ga operations at dca albeit on very limited basis initially prior to september 11 2001 dcas easy access to downtown washin gton dc and northern virginia made it popular destination for ga operators especi ally corporate and charter jets however the proximity of dca to critical federal facilities and other high profile targets has long concerned security experts these concer ns prompted special precautions for airline flights and ban on ga flights at dca follo wing the 911 attacks as result ga takeoffs and landings at dca fell from level of about 60000 in fy2000 to the current level of about 3500 annually c onducted under special waivers12 recognizing the impact of these restrictions on ga operators cong ress included the aforem entioned language in vision 100 pl 108176 requiring the dhs to develop and implement security plan to resume ga operations at dca that secu rity plan was put into effect on august 18 2005 and will accommodate up to 48 ga flights per day into and out of dca roughly 60 of pre911 levels13 operators will have to adhere to stringent requirements including submitting all flight crew to background checks vetting all passengers and crew against terrorist watchlists undergoing physical screening of all passengers crew aircraft and baggage at dca prior to depa rture or at one of 12 designated gateway airports prior to continuing to dca and posting armed security officers on each flight operators must reimburse the tsa for the cost s of these measures reimbursable security costs will vary based on the num ber of passengers but are expected to average about 500 per flight initially the program will only be available to certain charter and corporate aircraft operators the tsa may expand the pr ogram to privatelyowned aircraft in about one year although as currently implemented it is likely to be too costly and burdensome to appeal to typical ga operators curbing airspace violations while security measures are being implemented authorizing certain ga operations within th restricted airsp ace curtailing

another pilot penalty bill frederick md july 27 2005there were almost 3500 airspace incursions between january 27 2003 when the center first opened and july 17 2005 rate of almost 4 incidents per day14 on 655 of these occasions government assets were deployed or diverted to intercept the intruding aircraft based on this experience about 1 in every 5 to 6 incursions requires an intercept and this occurs about 5 times week howe ver all but one of these incidents was inadvertent15 in three high profile incidents all inadvertent the us capitol was evacuated raising concerns over the adequacy of airspace protections among lawmakers curbing inadvertent violations is likely to become increasingly important as more ga operations return to dca and the mary land three airports making the task of surveillance and tactical respons all the more critical pilot training is likely to be an important tool for mitigating these inadvertent airsp ace violations in fact significant efforts have been made already by user groups such as the aopa in coordination with the faa to increase pilot awareness and unders tanding of the airspace restrictions since these airspace violati ons are still routinely occurring spite these efforts additional measures to improve inflight situational awareness may be needed available technologies may provide ga pilots with improved pos itional awareness to avoid airspace violations for example global positioning satellite gps moving map displays can provide pilots with precise navigation capabilities these systems are now widely available for use in ga aircraft and could be programmed to include features to raise situational awareness regarding airspace restrictions and requirements more controversial option under cons ideration is stiffer penaltie s and steppedup enforcement for airspace violations user groups oppos additional punitive actions beyond those already available to the faa and point out th at the threat of shootdown is already strong enough deterrent fo r pilots to take heed16 finding the right balance determining an acceptable balance between airspace restrictions and alte rnative security measures such as vetting and security screening for certain flight operations that will maintain effective airspace protection in the ncr without unduly impeding air comme rce or compromising safety continues to play central role in policy debate over ncr airspace restrictions while most agree that blanket airspace restrictions for all nonairline users creates significant impediment to air commerce in the region there are varyin g opinions on whether the derived security benefits outweigh these concerns and whet her alternative measures create unacceptable security risks detailed riskbased assessments examining the various different types of ga operations conducted in the n cr may be undertaken to identify airspace controls and alternative security measures that strike an appropriate balance between meeting security needs and maintaining vibrant ga industry in the region
