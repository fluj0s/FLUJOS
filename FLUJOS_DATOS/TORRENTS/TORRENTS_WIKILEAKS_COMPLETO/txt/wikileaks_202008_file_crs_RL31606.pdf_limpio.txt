asylum seekers february 1999 p 1mandatory detention the changes in iirira which have led to an increase in the categories of people subject to mandatory detenti on have raised both policy and legal issues including the justness of detaining asylum seekers who try to enter the country without proper documentation and the constitutiona lity of mandatory detention aliens in expedited removal as discussed earlier the iirira of 1996 mandated that aliens who rrive without proper documen tation and claim asylum be detained prior to their credible fear hearing prior to iirira most aliens arriving without proper documentation who applied for asylum were released on their own recognizance into the united states and given work authorization practice which enabled inadmissable aliens falsely claiming persecution to enter into the country most of the fraudulent claims were made by people attempting to come here for economic or family reasons illegally rather than through legal immigration channels33 false asylum claims utilize limited resources causing those with legitimate claims to have to wait longer to have their cases processed thus many argued that the only way to deter fraudulen t asylum claims was to detain asylum seekers rather than releasing them on thei r own recognizance indeed the practice of detaining asylum seekers has reduced the number of fraudulent asylum claims however others contend that the policy of detaining all asylum seekers is too harsh they argue that there is need to inhibit fraudulent asylum claims but mandatory detention of asylum seekers cau ses more problems than it solves from april 1 1997 through september 30 2001 th ere were 34736 aliens in expedited removal who made claim of credible fear of thes 33551 have been detained34 the position of the united nations high co mmission on refugees is that detention of asylum seekers is inherently undesirable35 detention may be psychologically damaging to an already fragile populati on such as those who are escaping from imprisonment and torture in their countri often the asylum seeker does not understand why they are being detained additionally asylum seekers are often detained with criminal aliens haitians in detention as discussed above at th discretion of the attorney general many asylum seekers are parole d from detention after they demonstrate credible fear of persecution on

cases challenging the constitutionality of these provisions recent federal appellate court rulings in the third fourth ninth and tenth circuits generally found that the mandatory detention of criminal aliens pending removal proceedings was unconstitutional as applied to lawful permanent resident aliens they disagreed with an earlier decision in the seventh circuit parra v perryman which upheld mandatory detenti on the us supreme court has granted certiorari to hear one of these cases ther was also significant analytical difference among the circuits that did not uphold mandatory tention of lawful permanent residents in parra v perryman 172 f3d 954 7th cir 1999 decided before the zadvydas case discussed below with regard to indefinite detention the us court of app eals for the seventh circuit upheld mandatory detention41 as an exercise of congress broad plenary power over immigration matters nd found that aliens have liberty interest once removal proceedings have begun the zadvydas case found that congressional plenary power was s till subject to the due process rights afforded to all persons including aliens in patel v zemski 275 f3d 299 3d cir 2001 the us court of appeals for the third circuit held that mandatory detention constituted violation of the due process rights of permanent resident alien because there was individualized hearing to determine whether he posed dang er to the public and was flight risk the court found that patel d liberty interest triggering strict scrutiny analysis of his due process rights which is higher standard for government action to satisfy compared to judicialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31606crs12 deference to congressional plenary power strict scrutiny analysis means that the policy of mandatory detention of criminal aliens had to be narrowly tailored to serve the governmental interest in removing criminal aliens and preventing dangerous criminal aliens from endangering the community and not appearing at removal hearings mandatory detention of criminal aliens raises an irrebuttable presumption of dangerousness and flight risk resulting in the detention of all removable criminal aliens the court held that mandatory detention violates due process because the federal government did not show that all removable criminal aliens are dangerous and flight risks eg patel was nonviolent felon and not likely to flee because he had strong ties to the community and chance for cancellation of removal in hoang v comfort 282 f 3d 1247 10th cir 2002 the tenth circuit found that manda tory detention was not justified for lawful permanent resident aliens w ithout an individualized bail determination c ongressional plenary power over immigration matters is still subject to due process constitutional limitations like the third circuit in patel v zemski the tenth circuit adopted strict scrutiny analysis of the st atute section 236c raises an irrebuttable presumption that ll aliens subject to mandatory detention under that section are dangerous and pose flight risks which is not justified by the range of aliens to which it applies it also noted that although 236e prohibits review of the attorney generals judgment courts re tain habeas jurisdiction over constitutional challenges and that exhaustion of remedies is not required before filing petition for habeas review because the board of immigration appeals is not empowered to grant relief on may 3 2002 petition for certiorari was f iled in the us supreme court under the name comfort v hoang 011616 in kim v ziglar 276 f3d 523 9th cir 2002 the ninth circuit also held that mandatory detention of criminal aliens 236c violated the due process rights of lawful permanent resident aliens because it provides for individualized termination of dangerousness and flight risk however the court explicitly declined to find that mandatory detention 236c was unconstitutional on its face because the court did not find that it would be unconstitutional in all situations where it might apply it noted that the plenary power of congress over immigration matters was subject to constitutional limitations on the method of implemen ting policy and that aliens are entitled to the protections of due process the ninth circuit did not adopt strict scrutiny analysis instead it chose to follow the supreme court analysis in the zadvydas case noting that lawful permanent residents are favored category of aliens who have the right to reside here permanently until final removal order is entered therefore they have st rong liberty interest under due process civil detention is permitted only in certain special and narrow nonpunitive circumstances removal proceedings are civil thus detention during such proceed ings is permitted only in special circumstances the court held that the governmental reasons for mandatory detention did not constitute sufficiently strong specialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31606crs13 42 united states ex

individualized bail hearing additionally district courts in other ci rcuits have also considered the validity of mandatory detention of criminal aliens 236c w ith the majority finding it unconstitutional at least as applied to lawful permanent resident aliens but with some upholding the statute although appa rently the cases generally involve lawful permanent residents and the circuit decisions discussed above addressed the rights of lawful permanent residents in at l east one case mandatory detention 236c was found to be unconstitutional as applied to an illegal alie n in an unpublished opinion the third circuit upheld district court wh ich had held that due process required an individualized hearing even for an illegal alien42 district court in the third circuit recently criticized the ins for apparently attempting to circum vent the requirement of the patel decision when it effectively halted the release of lawful permanent resident alien who had been granted release on bond under patels required hearing for mandatory detention 236c by ppealing the bond decision then requesting inaction on the appeal43 the court ordered th release of the alien since the new 236a of the ina mandato ry detention of certified terrorists provides that an alien detained as certif ied terrorist cannot be held indefinitely unless determination is made that the alien is danger to the

us supreme court held that statute permitting indefinite detention would raise serious constitutional problems because the due process clause of the fifth amendment prohibits depriving any person including aliens of liberty without due process of law therefore in keeping with principles of statutor construction and the absence of clear congressional intent for indefinite detention the court read an implicit limitation into the postremoval detention statute such that detention is limited to period reasonably necessary to achieve an aliens removal the supreme court established 6 months after the initial 90day removal period expires as the pres umptively reasonable period after this period once an alien shows that there is good reason to believe that there is significant likelihood of re moval in the reasonably foreseeable future the government must rebut that showing with sufficient evidence the court emphasized that its holding does not mean that all alie ns must be released in 6 months and that an alien may be held until it has been determined that there is significant likelihood of removal in the r easonably foreseeable future with regard to civil matters government tention may be consistent with due process in certain special and narrow nonpunitive cases where special factors outweigh the individuals liberty interest postremoval dete ntion is civil and nonpunitive the court found that the goals of postremoval detention are not str ong enough to justify indefinite detention as administered under the statute the cour t suggested that special arguments

deportable aliens were subject to deportation proceedings after iirira exclusion and deportation proceedings were consolidated into removal proceedings but certain aliens are subject to expedited removal the salient difference between excl udable and inadmissible aliens is that aliens who entered without inspection were not consid ered excludable whereas such aliens are now considered inadmissible which means they are not entitled to the same level of rights in removal proceedings this change was made as disincentive to entering illegally since formerly the entry fiction worked in

closed hearing pursuant to the directive issued by chief immigrati on judge michael creppy of whom 419 have had more than one closed hearingwould compromise the terrorism investigati ons however the court found that the privacy and safety concerns for detainees were valid and could be addressed by permitting each detainee to choose not to ve hisher identity revealed these concerns did not apply to the names of detainees attorneys because they had expectation of anonymity and concerns about safety were speculative the court further held that the government could not withhold the identities of all material witnesses under foia or under sealing orders of court without further explanation the court found that the government had properly withheld th dates and locations of arrest detention and release since disclosure of such information could compromise the ongoing terrorism investigation and the plaintiffs were not entitled to such information under the first am endment and federal common law in accordance with the above findings the court ordered the government to disclose the names of detainees and their lawyers with in 15 days with exceptions for detainees opting to withhold their

amendment of the federal constituti on on april 3 2002 district court judge nancy edmunds granted the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction for immediate access to future removal hearings for haddad and transcripts of previous hearings and denying the defendants motion to dismiss98 in granting the preliminary injunction the cour t found that the plaintiffs had strong likelihood of success on the merits on april 18 2002 th reejudge panel of the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit denied the federal governments request for an emergency stay of the preliminary injuncti on pending consideration of its appeal of the preliminary injunction99 the government then complied with the injunction by releasing transcripts of past hearings in the haddad case on august 26 2002 the sixth circuit affirmed the granting of the preliminary injunction against blanket closure of deportation hearings in special interest cases100 the circuit court analyzed the preliminar injunction under seve ral factors the most pertinent being the plaintiffs like lihood of success on the merits of the case it rejected the federal governments contention that its plenary power over immigration warranted deferential review finding that such power is limited by the constitution including the first amendment with regard to nonsubstantive procedural immigration laws by experience and logic there is first amendment right of public access to depor tation hearings traditionally they have been open and public access ensures the integrity of the process since first amendment right is implicated the governmental action in hearing closure is subject to higher standard of judicial review than deference th government must show that closure is necessitated by compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest although the court agr eed that national security was compe lling governmental interest it found that blanket closure was not narrowly tailored to serve that interest casebycase considera tion of closure would still protect national security interests while also protecting the constitutional right to access the court found that the remaining factors for anal yzing motion for preliminary injunction also favored grant the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm if denied access to the hearings others would not be subs tantially harmed by the injunction since closure could still be obtained on casebycas basis and the public interest is best served by open hearingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31606crs30 101 0270605 ed mich sept 17 2002 102

plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction ordering the in s to hold new open bond hearing before new immigration judge or to release haddad within 10 days the district court found that haddad had likelihood of ccess on the merits because he had constitutional procedural due process right to an open bond hearing before new immigration judge accordingly new immigration judge held new bond hearing but determined that portion of the h earing should be closed to permit the introduction of evidence with national secu rity implications the reasons for the decision to close the hearing were not entered in the record of the proceedings and the plaintiffs counsel were not given an opportunity to object to the closure the news media and haddad moved to enjoin the immigration judge to detail the reasons for the closing in the record to allow the newspapers counsel to be heard to release transcripts of the closed proceedings and also copy of the governments brief and to grant haddads counsel in his challenge to the closed hearings access to certain evidence provided to his immigration counsel on october 7 2002 judge edmunds concluded that closure was necessary to protect national security but that the immigration judge should have made findings on the record as to why closure was necessary and that in the future the immig ration judge should enter such findings and reasons on the record before closing hearings102 additionally the district court found that haddads counsel should have access to information given to his immigration counsel in north jersey media group v ashcroft the plaintiffs alleged that the policy of closing removal hearings in certain sp ecial interest cases pursuant to the creppy memorandum was violation of the first amendment right of access by the press and public to such hearings and of the in s regulations concerning closed hearings on may 28 2002 district court judge john bi ssell granted the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction prohibiting the federal government from instituting blanket policy of closing hearings in all special interest cases and nying the defendants motion to dismiss103 after the third circuit court of

sixth circuit the third circuit appellate pane l found that the executive branch power over immigration proceedings is limited by first amendment interests under the constitution however unlike the sixth circ uit the third circuit found that there was first amendment right of public nd press access to deportation hearings by experience and logic the court found that the trad ition of open deportation hearings was too recent and inconsistent to support first amendment right of access the court rejected the newspape r plaintiffs contention that first amendment right of access could be found ba sed on the logic prong alone of the test for whether there is first amendment ri ght of access the court found that even if it were to adopt this position the logic pr ong of the test was not satisfied for open deportation hearings in the logic part of the test the court considered whether public access played significant positive role in deportation hearings on balance the threat to national security posed by ope n hearings outweighed the public good served by open hearings having found first amendment right of access to deportation hearings the court did not have to cons ider whether blanket closures under the creppy memorandum were narro wly tailored to protect nati onal security and whether the national scope of the dist rict courts injunction was t oo broad judge scirica the dissenter on the panel agreed with the sixth circuit that there was sufficient tradition of open deportation hearings that there was first amendment right of access and that closure should be determined on casebycase basis judge scirica did not think that the national scope of th district courts in junction was appropriate and that federal courts in ot her jurisdictions should have the opportunity to decide the issues for themselves and the us suprem court should have the chance to resolve any jurisdictional differences on the issues the split between the third and sixth circuits presents such an opportunity causing speculation in legal media and immigration circles about whether the supr eme court will be pe titioned to take one or the other or both cases and what the ra mifications may be if the supreme court takes case in response to litigation on blanket clos ure the attorney general implemented regulations effective may 21 2002 authorizing immigration judges to close hearings on casebycase basis and to issue protec tive orders for cases involving security sensitive information upon request by federal government wyers and noting that the new regulations were intended to co mplement the creppy memorandum of septembe r 21 2001107 subsequently chief immigration judge michael creppy issued memorandum on the immigration cour ts policies and pro cedures regarding these regulations citing the new regulatory criteria of substantia l likelihood that the information for which protection is granted would harm national s ecurity or us law enforcement
