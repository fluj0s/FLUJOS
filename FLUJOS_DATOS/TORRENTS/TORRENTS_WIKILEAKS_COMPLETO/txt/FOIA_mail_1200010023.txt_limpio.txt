gschmidtgissnasagov hack james j jhackornlgov xflowed dear leo thanks very much for your email i can easily make the observations bit more prominent in figure 1 as you can see from todays voluminous email traffic ive received lots of helpful suggestions regarding improvements to the figures ill try to produce revised versions of the figures tomorrow on the autocorrelation issue the models have much larger range of lag1 autocorrelation coefficients 066 to 095 for t2lt and 069 to 095 for t2 than the uah or rss data which range from 087 to 089 i was concerned that if we used the model lag1 autocorrelations to guide the choice of ar1 parameter in the synthetic data analysis douglass and colleagues would have an easy opening for criticising us aha santer et are using model results to guide them in their selection of the coefficients for their ar1 model i felt that it was much more difficult for douglass et to criticize what weve done if we used uah data to dictate our choice of the ar1 parameter and the scaling factor for the amplitude of the temporal variability as you know my personal preference would be to include in our response to douglass et something like the figure 4 that peter has produced while inclusion of figure 4 is not essential for the purpose of illuminating the statistical flaws in the douglass et consistency test such figure would clearly show the currently large structural uncertainties in radiosondebased estimates of the vertical profile of atmospheric temperature changes i think this is an important point particularly in view of the fact that douglass et failed to discuss versions 13 and 14 of your raobcore data even though they had information from those datasets in their possession however i fully agree with toms comment that we dont want to do anything to steal the thunder from ongoing efforts to improve sondebased estimates of atmospheric temperature change and to better quantify structural uncertainties in those estimates your group together with the groups at the hadley centre yale noaa arl and noaa gfdl deserve great credit for making significant progress on difficult timeconsuming yet important problem i guess the best solution is to leave this decision up to all of you the radiosonde dataset developers im perfectly happy to include version of figure 4 in our response to douglass et if we do go with inclusion of figure 4 you peter dian melissa steve sherwood and john should decide whether you feel comfortable providing radiosonde data for such figure i will gladly abide by your decisions as you note in your email our use of figure 4 would not preclude more detailed and thorough comparison of simulated and observed amplification in some later publication once again thanks for all your help with this project leo with best regards ben leopold haimberger wrote all these three figures are really very clear and leave doubts that the douglass et analysis is flawed this is true especially for fig 1 in fig 1 one has to look carefully to find the rss and uah observed trends to the right of all the model trends maybe one can make their symbols more prominent concerning fig 3 i wonder whether the uah autocorrelation is the lowest of all available data 86 is quite substantial autocorrelation maybe it is good idea to be on the safe side and use the lowest autocorrelation of all datasets models rss uah for this analysis concerning fig 4 i like peters and dians idea to include raobcore hadat2 ratpac and steves data and compare it in one plot with model output while i agree that the first three figures and the corresponding text are already sufficient for the reply they target mainly to the right panel of fig 1 in douglass et als paper the trend profile plot of fig 4 is complementary as counterpart to the left panel of their plot to see the trend amplification in in some of the vertical profiles is much more suggestive than seeing the lt trends being larger than surface trends at least for showing all available profiles adds value beyond the raobcore v12 vs raobcore v14 issue yes it is work in progress and such plot as drafted by peter makes that very clear in this paper it is sufficient to show that the uncertainty of radiosonde trends is much larger than suggested by douglass et and we do not need to have the final answer yet i have nothing against peter doing the drawing of the figure since he has most of the necessary data the plot would be needed for 19791999 however peter i will send you the trend profiles for this period bit later publishing the reply in either ijc or grl including fig 4 is fine for when we first discussed follow up of the santer et paper in october we had in mind to publish postfar climate model data up to present not just 1999 and also new radiosonde data up to present in highest ranking journal i am confident that this is still possible even if some of the new material planned for such paper is submitted already now what do you think with best regards leo peter thorne wrote all as it happens i am preparing figure precisely as dian suggested this has only been possible due to substantial efforts by leo in particular but all the other dataset providers also i wanted to give feel for where we are at although i want to tidy this substantially if we were to use it to do this ive taken every single scrap of info i have in my possession that has status of at least submitted to journal i have considered the common period of 19792004 so assuming you are all sitting comfortably grey shading is little cheat from santer et using trusty ruler see figure 3b in this paper take the absolute range of model scaling factors at each of the heights on the yaxis and apply this scaling to hadcrut3 tropical mean trend denoted by the star at the surface so if we assume hadcrut3 is correct then we are aiming for the grey shading or not depending upon ones preconceived notion as to whether the models are correct red is hadat2 dataset black dashed is the raw data used in titchner et submitted all tropical stations with 812000 climatology black whiskers are median interquartile range and max min from titchner et submission we know from complex errorworld assessments that the median undercooks the required adjustment here and that the truth may conceivably lie well outside the upper limit bright green is ratpac then and the averaging and trend calculation has been done by leo here and not so any final version id want to get the raw gridded data and do it exactly the same way but for the raw raobs data that leo provided as sanity check it seems to make miniscule 005kdecade even at height difference lime green rich raobcore 14 breaks neighbour based adjustment estimates solid purple raobcore 12 dotted purple raobcore 13 dashed purple raobcore 14 i am also in possession of steves submitted iuk dataset and will be adding this trend line shortly ill be adding legend in the large white space bottom left my take home is that all datasets are heading the right way and that this reduces the probability of discrepancy compare this with santer et figure 3b ill be using this in an internal report anyway but am quite happy for it to be used in this context too if that is the general feeling or for leos to be used whatever people prefer peter benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis and
