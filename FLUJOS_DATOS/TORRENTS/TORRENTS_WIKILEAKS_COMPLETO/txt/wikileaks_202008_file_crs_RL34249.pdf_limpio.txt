years and an additional tax on highincome individuals raising 832 billion the plan also contained ot her tax revisions for indivi duals to produce roughly revenue neutral overa ll individual tax revision ta xes were reduced for lower income individuals by 86 billion including an increase in the standard deduction an increase in the earned income tax credit for families without children and an increase in the refundability of the child credit taxes were increased for higher income individuals through restoration of the phaseout of personal exemptions and itemized deductions and re striction on miscellaneous itemized deductions for total gain of 38 billion these general pr ovisions resulted in ta x reductions for over 95 of taxpayers with increases in tax liability at very high income levels the individual section also c ontained base broadening provisions raising 61 billion the most important of these were increas ed taxes on managers of hedge fund and other investments who tend to have high incomes the proposal also extended number of expiring tax provisions for an additional year at cost of 21 billion the plan also included corporatebusine ss package that cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 305 costing 364 billion over 10 years and made an increased expensing allowance for small business equipment permanent 21 billion cost offsetting these losses were revenue raisers that resulted in small net gain of 14 billion for this portion of the plan the major revenue raising provisions were repeal of the domestic production ac tivity deduction increased taxes for multinational corpora tions and changes in inventory accounting overall the bill would lose 538 billi on over five years and 75 billion over 10 years thus over the tenyear period it is close to

lowerincome taxpayers some tax increases on highincome individuals veral base broadening pr ovisions oneyear extensions of number of expiring tax provisions and corporate and business revision package that included rate re duction and base broadening1 the 2007 amt provision the extenders and some other pr ovisions are also included in tax bill subsequently passed by the house hr 3996 the 2007 amt provision was eventually enacted in pl 110166 curre nt bills also include some provisions including some revenue raisers hr 6275 to extend the amt revision for another year and hr 6049 which includes the extension of expiring provisions major provisions table 1 shows the major provisions and categ ories of minor provisions of hr 3970 the amt provision includes one year patch that would extend

would revenues projected at 8452 billion over the 10year period fy2008fy2017 roughly ffsetting this loss is an increase in taxes on higherincome individuals in the form of an increased tax rate of 4 and 46 which would gain 8317 billion in revenues these amounts are slightly under 5 of total individual income tax revenue projected to be collected over the 10year period in addition to these major provisions th ere are 86 billion in tax cuts for lower income individuals including an increas in the standard deduction the earned income credit and the refundability of the child credit there are also additional taxes on higherincome individuals in the form of restrictions on itemized deductions and personal exemptions there are also ries of base broade ning provisions with the most

ions including eliminating tax on mortgage debt forgiven and ending the private debt collection program for the internal revenue service it also includes revenue raisers among them taxes on investment managers and delay of the worldwide interest allocation rule for the foreign tax credit discussed belowfinally the proposal reduces the top co rporate tax rate from 35 to 305 with the change offset by series of base br oadening provisions with the most important ones repealing the domestic production activities duction set of in ternational tax provisions and two inventory revisions as indicated by the table the individual section is essentially revenue neutral raising as much revenue as it loses the extenders have very small loss and the corporate revisions very small gain overall the bill has negligible effect on revenues over 10year period note howev er that these meas ures reflect the standard baseline for legisla tive proposals that assumes the 2001 tax cuts are allowed to expire were the tax cuts to be extended the revenue loss associated with the repeal of the amt would be larger or to put it another way if hr 3970 were enacted the cost of extending the tax cuts would be larger this interaction occurs because the lower tax rates enacted in 2001 were not fully realized were taken back for many taxpayers especially as time passed because these taxpayers were subject to or became subject to the amt2 the provisions in the bill that provi the amt patch through 2007 and the extenders are included in hr 3996 b ill passed by the house on november 9 2007 that deals with more immediate issues3 the revenue cost of the amt patch in that bill is 506 billion as compared to 496 billion in hr 3970 the difference apparently reflects larger increase in the amt exemption to allow for real income growth individual tax revision the individual tax revisions constitute the major portion of the bill in size of tax changes the individual tax packag is roughly revenue neutral but it redistributes tax burdens the sections be low discuss the revisions and some of the issues associated with them the final section summarizes the overall distributional effect revisions in the amt the amt has become major issue and eliminating it and paying for the resulting revenue cost is the most important feature of the bill in terms of revenue the objective of the amt was originally to impose taxes on higherincome individuals who were otherwise paying low taxes because of tax preferences ie tax benefits because amt exemptions were not indexed for inflation and because of other revisions the amt began to affect individuals in the upper middle incomeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34249crs4 4 for general discussion of the amt see crs report rl30149 the alternative minimum tax for individuals

longer affected the very highest income individuals4 increasingly the amt is tax that is triggered by provisions th at it was not originally focused on such as personal exemptions and certa in itemized deductions the bills amt provisions are in two part s an extension of the patch for 2007 costing 496 billion which increases and indexes the exemption from the amt and extends allowances of certain credits and the subsequent repeal of the amt costing 7977 billion without the patch the amt which initially applied to less than 20000 taxpayers and applied to 35 million in 2006 will affect 24 million taxpayers in 2007 these amounts will grow over time tax benefits for lowerincome individuals hr 3970 contains three provisions targ eted at lowerincom individuals that cost 86 billion overall an increase in the standard deduction an increase in the earned income credit for families without children and an increase in the refundability of the child credit5 the revenue cost of the components is shown in table 2 table 2 provisions of hr 3970 affecting lowerincome taxpayers provisionrevenue effect fy2008fy2017 billions standard deduction 479 earned income credit 291child credit refundability91 total 862 source joint committee on taxation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34249crs5 the bill would increase the standard deduction by 850 for married couples 425 for singles and 625 for heads of households the standard deductions for 2007 are currently 10700 5350 nd 7850 respectively th is change would increase the number of lowerincome taxp ayers who do not pay taxes and also decrease the share of taxpayers that itemize change that would simplify tax compliance this increase in the sta ndard deduction accounts for 479 billion of the revenue loss the proposal would also increase the earned income tax credit for single individuals and married couples without children as well as the credits phase out range these families receive small ear ned income tax credit of 765 on income up to 5590 compared to 34 credit fo r families with one child and 40 for families with two children both applicable to larger incomes the credit phases out for 2007 at 12590 for singles and 14590 for childless couples the proposal would increase the amount eligible for the credit from 5280 to 10900 and the credit rate to 153 this provision costs 291 billion some might resist the expansion of th earned income credit to families without children taking the view that the program is welfare program run through the tax system and thus should be directed at the more vulnerable population as are many other welfare programs such as medicai d and general income support programs from the viewpoint of tax equity however the restricted benef its for those without children cause poor families without child ren to pay taxes while families with children that have much higher standard of living have tax subsidies which are enhanced by the child tax credit the third proposal would increase the ref undability of the child tax credit that is the rebate of the tax for families with little or tax liability currently the child tax credit is refundable for 15 of in come over 11300 hence the credit is not refundable or fully refundable to lowinco families the proposal would decrease the threshold to 8500 and longer index it so it would continually decline in real value over time this provision costs 91 billion tax increases on highin come individuals three revenue raising provisions apply to highincome individuals and roughly offset the losses associated with the repeal of the amt tax on high adjusted gross incomes restoration of provisions that phase out personal ex emptions and itemized deductions for highincome taxpayers and an increase in the floor for miscellaneous itemized deductions the revenue impact of the provisions is shown in table 3 by far the largest of these provisi ons an 8317 billion revenue gain is proposal to impose surtax of 4 on adju sted gross income above an amount that would be set by the treasury secretary where 90 of individuals above that amount would otherwise be subject to the amt this amount would however not be less than 200000 there would be an add itional 06 tax on incomes above 500000 250000 for singles for total additional tax of 46 on such income unlike an ordinary rate increase these increased taxes would apply to adjusted not taxable income thus they would increase tax rates on all income whether or not it is eligible for preferences such as itemized deductions or lower rates capital gains andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34249crs6 dividends are taxed at maximum rate of 15 through 2010 after that point the dividend preference will end and the capital gains tax will rise to 20 table 3

exemptions and itemized deductions for highincome indivi duals commonly referred to as pep and pease under the terms of the 2001 tax cut these phase outs were to be gradually eliminated this provision has effect on revenues after fy2012 b ecause this phaseouts elimination occurs only throug h 2010 as the 2001 tax cuts sunset in 2010 but overall would raise 286 billion the third provision would increase the current 2 floor under miscellaneous itemized deductions to 5 for income over 500000 250000 for single returns this is deduction that was not allowed under the amt it raises 71 billion also included in the table is an interaction term to cover the relationships among these provisions and with the amt repeal the rationale for these increases is that the amt was aimed at higherincome individuals and thus taxes should be rais ed on these individuals to pay for amt repeal the use of adjusted gross income as base imposes the tax on items such itemized deductions and preferentially taxe d dividends and capital gains the latter very significant share of income at high income levels when the original amt was imposed the major preference subject to the amt was excluded capital gains but when capital gains preferences which were eliminated in 1986 when the capital gains exclusion was eliminated were re stored and expanded in 1997 and 2003 via lower rate they were not included as preferences that is capital gains and subsequently dividends are still taxed at th lower rate of 15 as they are under the regular tax rather than the 26 or 28 amt rate at the same time there is some resistance to increasing marginal tax rates and also resistance to increasing taxes on divi dends and capital gains which form part ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34249crs7 6 see the

the corporate rate is lowered in the proposal as well in add ition some ec onomists believe that higher capital gains taxes significantly deter capital gains realizations and may even lose revenue other researchers have however found negligible response6 individual b ase broadening the bill also includes several individual provisions that are virtually all base broadening provisions and ra ise revenue as shown in table 4 only one of these individual provisions which affects taxes on tax exempt organizations loses revenue the first provision addresses the tax trea tment of investment

posted at httpf inancesenategovsitepageshearing092607htmthere are two provisions relating to the investment in offshore hedge funds by tax exempt investors earnings of domes tic tax exempt investors are exempt from income tax but there is an unrelated business income tax ubit which applies to certain investments not related to their taxexempt purpose currently debtfinanced investments are subject to the these taxes in the case of partnership investments the flow through of attributes can result in an imposition of the ubit in the case of domestic corporations there is flow thr ough but tax is imposed at the corporate level offshore investments in some cases use corporate blocker firms that are structured to avoid corporate tax but prevent the flow thr ough of attributes so tax is applied to tax exempt investors at any point they also attract nontaxable foreign investors the first of these two provisi ons relating to offshor investments by tax exempt entities would require investment managers who have deferred compensation through these operations to be taxed currently normally where deferred compensation benefits are paid the employee is not taxed but the firm is not able to take deduction the lack of corporat deduction which gains revenue offsets the failure to tax the employee which loses revenue this offsetting revenue gain does not occur when the effective employer is tax exempt and the bills current taxation of deferred compensati on restores the tax the second provision relating to tax exem pt hedge fund investment the third provision listed in table 4 which loses revenue would eliminate the ubit for partnerships which would remove the di fferential tax treatment that encourages offshore investment in corporate bl ocker hedge funds relative to domestic partnerships the revenue loss may be small because ve ry little investment involves domestic partnership investments there is some disagreement about the direction to take for ubit the provision is this bill mirrors hr 3105 introduced by congressman levin supporters of this view may wish to reduce the incentive to invest through offshore entities or may view the inclusion of debt financed passive investment as too broad scope for the ub it an alternative approach would be to conform the offshore treatment to the domestic investment by taxing these investments under the ubit the senate finance committee which held hearings on offshore investments on september 26 2007 included witnesse s that discussed the growth of educational institution endowments in part via these offshore investments because they continued low spending rates out of these returns8 this hearing also considered direct requirements for spending as an alternative to addressing the offshore ubit issue the fourth provision in table 4 refers to sales of preciable property between related parties where any gain on the sale is taxed as ordinary income the provision treats as sale between related parties any sale where there is payment from the buyer to the seller for depreciationrelated tax benefits realized by the transferee the fifth provision in table 4 would impose the same payroll treatment on subchapter s service firms subchapter s firms are incorporated as businesses but elect to be taxed as part nerships that apply to or dinary partnerships and proprietorships in active business namely

lower middle and upper middle income taxpayers but increased on very high incomes the reduction at the lower incomes is due to the set of lowincome tax provisions the standard deduction earned income credit and refundable child credit the reduction in the middle and upper middle classes is due to th repeal of the amt while the increases at the top reflect the surtax on adjusted gross incomes in

committee on taxation jct divides extenders into those primarily affecting individuals those primarily affecting bus inesses and others excise taxes and administrative issues historically most tax provi sions were enacted on pe rmanent basis beginning in the early 1980s with the temporary res earch credit the number of extenders has grown dramatically while some provisions were enact ed on temporary basis to permit their evaluation budgetary constraints may be argued to be the major reason for the growth in the number of extenders as temporary provision has smaller revenue cost than permanent one in keeping with this growth there are 37 extenders in the bill which cost total of 21 billion over 10year period many of these provisions have negligible revenue effect the most significant one s are the research and experimentationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34249crs11 10 corporate tax issues and ad ministration discusses are discussed in detail in crs report rl34229 corporate

cost and the three provisions together account for 75 more detailed discussion of these extenders and an individual listing is presented in the appendix corporate tax provisions this section includes tax revisions that largely affect corporations although some provisions also affect unincorporat ed businesses the provisions which involve both rate reduction and broadening of the base have small net revenue gain the major tax reduction is redu ced corporate tax rate from 35 to 305 that costs 364 billion over the 10year peri od the 2001 tax cuts generally focused on individual taxes although there were so revisions in the corporate tax in 2004 and the 2003 reduction in tax rates on cap ital gains and dividends reduced the combined firm and individual tax burde n on corporate investment this proposal is the first since 1986 to include an overall corporate rate reduction proposal to cut the corporate tax and broaden the base has also been recently discussed by the administration whic h convened confer ence on july 27 2007 to address corporate issues some of that discussion focused on the expectation that other countries will lower their corporate ta x rates these discussions included the possibility of lowering the corporate statutory tax rate and broadening the base although the base broadeners in hr 3970 are different in many cases from those explored by the administration in general lower base and broader base tends to lead to smaller economic distortions from tax cut although the merits of each base broadener are relevant to evaluating the proposal there is however limit to the degree to which the statutory tax rate can be lowered without transforming the corporation into tax shelter for individuals10 the second provision that loses revenue involves the small business expensing deduction the law has permanent provi sion that allows the expensing of 25000 of equipment purchases provision that is phased out as income rises provision that increases the deduction to 125000 and i ndexes it for inflation is effective through 2010 this provision would make th higher temporary level and indexing permanent while such provision favor s small

tax professionals it distorts investment and perhaps more importantly presents difficult administrative issues which require firms that perform variety of activities and who impor t intermediate goods

that is not immediately subject to us tax such treatment essentially allows firms to use foreign tax havens to effectively shift profit out of the united states and its tax syst em the allocation rule would deny the portion of deductions associated with this income until the income is repatriated and subject to tax companies investing in nontaxhaven countries could avoid the allocation rule by repatriating income provision allocating deductions was included in the proposals of the presidents advisory pa nel on tax reform in 200514 but would have been coupled with an exemption of active dividends of foreign subsidiaries this change adopts the allocation rule but not the exemption although there has been some support for an exemption provision such change is unlikely to contribute to economic efficiency or us welfare15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34249crs14 16 these distortions are relatively complicated to explain but are discussed in more detail in jane g gravelle the 2004 corporate tax revisions as spaghetti western national tax journal vol 58 september 2005 pp 347366 17 there is also provision with negligible revenue effect that alters the time of foreign currency translation 18 see jane g gravelle the economic effects of taxing capital incom cambridge ma the mit press 1994 p 300an additional allocation pr ovision would repeal rule that involved world wide interest for the foreign tax credit when income from abroad is subject to us tax either as branch income or repatriated income foreign tax credit is allowed for foreign taxes paid up to the us tax due for firms that have more foreign taxes paid than allowable credits increasing the amount of income allocated abroad increases allowable foreign tax credits and reduces us tax liability prior to 2004 us source interest was allocated between foreign and domestic incomes based on relative magnitude of foreign and domestic assets the 2004 pr ovision included interest on foreign borrowing as well as debtfinan ced investment in the calculation which would allocate more domestic interest to domestic source income reduction in interest allocated to foreign income and resulting increase in the foreign tax credit limit while there is some argument to be made for worldwide allocation in measuring income more precisely th allocation rules produce undesirable distortionary effects16 another provision relating to international tax issues is intended to reduce treatyshopping the united states imposes withholding taxes on interest royalties and similar payments to foreigners but also engages in number of treaties with other countries where th withholding rates are re duced firm in country without treaty can benefit by setting up s ubsidiary in treaty country to avoid the withholding tax and this provi sion would eliminate that benefit17 two provisions relate to inventory accounting inve ntories are most important in the manufacturing and trade sectors of the economy18 the most significant is repeal of provision that allows lastin firstout lifo accounting for inventories in this form of inventory the good being so ld is assumed to be the last acquired and since in general prices tend to rise ove r time this method increases the cost of the good sold and reduces profit and therefore tax liability the ot her inventory method is firstin first out fifo where the good sold is assumed to be the first acquired and thus includes any price increases in in come firms must use the same inventory method for tax and book purposes and as result many firms that would find lifo advantageous nevertheless use fifo because profits reported to shareholders would be lower under lifo lifo accounting may on average result in more accurate measure of income because it has the effect of indexing cost and not capturing increases in value due to inflation at the same time when relative prices are changing such as oil prices it allows firms to avoid tax on windfall gains in general the economic consequen ces of taxing the return to inventories at higher or lower rate are probably not very important because of the short holding period for most inventories the tax on the return is very small part of the cost httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34249crs15 second inventory provision liminates the option to value inventories at market value rather than cost allowing this option permits the recognition of losses in inventory even though the items have not been sold treatment inconsistent with the general realization principle for gains and losses aside from the domestic production activ ity deduction and the foreign and inventory provisions three other provisions with significant revenue gains are amortization of intangibles the economic substance doctrine and the dividends received deduction under curre nt law acquired intangible s the excess of the value of business over the value of its physical assets are deducted over 15 year period the provision in hr 3970 increases the pe riod to 20 years the treatment for intangibles was enacted to simplify comp liance and end disputes about the proper recovery period for intangib which were not easily cl assified or separated from good will which was assumed to be nonde preciable at the time the issue was discussed there was an argument that mo st intangibles for wh ich depreciation was being argued to be appropriate by taxpayer s such as customer lists were not really depreciable since they were either selfgen erating or expenses undertaken to generate them were currently deductible thus for most intangibles recovery of acquired intangibles on acquisition is more appropriately regarded as reduction in the capital gains tax rather than depreciation issue in any case there is likely to be relatively little effect on the decision to undertake the original investment since the depreciation by subsequent pur chasers is far in the future and subject to uncertainty firms that enter into tax savings rrangements that are found not to have economic substance can have their tax bene fits disallowed by the courts under what has become known as the economic substa nce doctrine proposals to introduce legislative standards into the doctrine which is sometimes interpreted differently by different courts have been included in number of recent legislative proposals especially by the senate finance committee in manner similar to other proposals hr 3970 would require transaction to meet both an objective test profit was made and subjective test profit was intended penalties are also imposed supporters argue that the st ricter test will not only re duce tax avoidance but also make treatment more consistent across the courts some tax attorneys are concerned that more specific rules might provide roadmap to structuring arrangements that will pass the test the us treasury disputes the revenue gains projected by the joint committee on taxation and the current administration opposes the change while the clinton administration supported it the third provision relates to intercor porate dividend deductions to prevent too much double tax at the corporate level while still discouraging chains of partially owned corporations which allows one cor poration to exert cont rol over many others current law allows partial but not full deduction for certain dividends paid between corporations for firm 80 owned there is 100 dividend deduction for firms with 20 or more ownership th ere is an 80 deduction and for firms with less than 20 ownership there is 70 deduction the bill would reduce the 80 and 70 deductions to 70 nd 60 other than wholly owned subsidiaries this provision would prevent reduction in the in tercorporate tax burden as result of the rate cut these taxes would actually rise slightly for 20 owned the tax rises from 7 03 times 35 to 915 02 times 305 for less than 20 owners the tax rises from 105 03 times 35 to 122 04 times 305 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34249crs16 the remaining provisions are relatively small in revenue impact they include provision that would prevent corporations from currently excluding payments from tax that may be uncollectible in the future rather than taking these losses into account in the future the stock option provision is aimed at taxpayers who hold options in subchapter s corporations corporations that elect to be taxed as partners in combination with large share of the stock held by tax exempt employee stock ownership plan esop this treatment llows much of the s corporation to avoid tax while taxable shareholders accumulate value through options another provision would eliminate benefits for the remaining domestic international sales corporations form of organization that was eliminated in general many years ago the final provision relates to tax free spinoffs of subs idiaries by parents where tax is imposed on the parent if the parent receives value in excess of their tax basis in the subsidiary included in the definition of value is debt of the parent assumed by the subsidiary this provision would apply that tax to debt assumed prior to the spinoffhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34249crs17 19 they are also discussed in the joint committee on taxations description of the chairmans amendment in the nature of substitute of hr 3996 the temporary

sales taxes was repealed in 1986 in 2004 it was reinstated as an optional alternative to the deduction for state income tax and primarily benefits taxpayers in those states with income tax the second largest in revenue cost of the extenders is the deduction for tuition which covers some individuals who are not eligible for the permanent tuition tax credit22 there is also another educati on provision allowing deductions for classroom teachers23 three other provisions cost more than 100 million the provision allowing individuals to cont ribute to charity from their individual retirement accounts without including dist ributions in income and then deducting them was enacted in 2006 this provision was part of president bushs original charity proposals and was contained in number of
