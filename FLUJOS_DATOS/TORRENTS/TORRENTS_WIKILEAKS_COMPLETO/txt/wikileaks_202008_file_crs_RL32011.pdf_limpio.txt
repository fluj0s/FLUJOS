and implementation background the united states has recently completed or has in progress or intends to enter into negotiations with foreign countries of number of bilatera l or multilateral trade agreements establishing freetrade areas ftas since they contain modifications of nontariff as well as tariff trade barriers they require changes in us trade legislation1 for the enactment of such legisl ation and its implementation specific procedures are set out in trade law which provide for expedited congressional consideration of the releva nt measure if specified conditions required by law are complied with the expedite d consideration originally called fast track procedure but recently also named trade author ities procedures tap s provides for mandatory consideration of the measure on ce introduced with specific deadlines for each legislative phase allows amendmen ts and requires final upordown vote the statutory authority and requirements2 for the enactment and implementation of such trade agreements that have recently been concluded or are in the process of negotiation or in the planning stage are c ontained in the provisions of the bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2002 tpa ac t title xxi of the trade act of 2002 as amended by section 2004a17 of the miscella neous trade and technical corrections act of 2004 pl 108429 the legislative procedure for their implementation is set out in section 151 of the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 the tpa act authorizes the use of the trade authorities procedures for the enactment of bills implementing agreemen ts regarding tariffandnontariff barriers including freetrade agreements entered into with foreign countries by the president before july 1 2005 or july 1 2007 if the president requests such extension before april 1 2005 and either house of c ongress does not adopt an extension disapproval resolution see appendix item 1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32011crs2 3 detailed description of such cons ultation and report see crs report rl31974 trade continuedthe expedited legislative procedures trade authorities procedures taps by which such agreements would be implemented are set out principally in section 151 of the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 as amended 19 usc 2191 although this statute is permanent law it has been enacted as an exercise of the rulemaking power of either house and can be changed by either house with respect to its own procedure at any time in the same manner and to the same extent as any other rule of that house it applies only to the procedure specifically covered by it eg approval of trade agreements but in that context supersedes any other rules to the extent that they are inconsistent with it section 151a 19 usc 2191a these permanent procedural provisions are ccasionally supplemented by additional temporary ones contained in the legislative authority for the negotiation of the agreements such as various disapproval or other resolutions presented in the appendix they too are considered an ex ercise of the rulemaking power of either house of congress since the expedited procedures do not permit any amendments to the legislation once it has been introduced the final language of the implementing bill is fashioned through advance mock or nonmark markups by the re levant committees in order to arrive at legislative language that reflects the provisions of the agreement as well as congressional concerns regarding its implementation the version marked up in this manner is then transmitted together with the required statement of administrative action and other supporting doc uments by the president to congress for legislative action implementing procedure the steps in the expedited procedure for the legislative consideration and enactment of an implementin g bill and the implementati on of the underlying trade agreement are described below in their functional time sequence while care has been taken to reflect accurately the meaning of the relevant more extensively worded statutes consulting the actual language of any statute is recommended in case of any ambiguity or need for greater detail moreover because these provisions are rulemaking statutes questions concerning the interpretation of these procedures and possible parliamentary rulings pursuant to them should be referred to the house and senate parliament arians offices in this description the provisions of section 151 of the trade act of 1974 are not specifically identified in their alphanum erical designation as contained in that act provisions contained in the trade ac t of 2002 however are identified with the addition of the abbreviation ta02 1 prior consultation and report regar ding us trade remedy laws

existing laws required to implement the agreementsection 2103b3 ta02 19 usc 3803b3 expedited consideration of ta riffandnontariff implementing bills is also contingent on the presidents compliance

is requirement contained in article i section 7 of the constitution of the united states which provides that all b ills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives but the senate ma propose or concur with amendments as on other bills although in this situation id entical and nonamendable bills are introduced in both houses the measure enacted by congress and transmitted to the president consequently has to be the house bill and the enacting procedure reflects that circumstance cf the specific procedure for committee cons ideration in the senate described in item 10 2

committee in the senate it is unqualified respectively subclauses i iii and iiiii suggesting that this provision permits amendments on the house floor amendments on the house floor however are not in order pursuant to sec tion 152d2 19 usc 2192d2 of the specific expedited procedure unless that pr ovision does not apply be cause of denial on whatever grounds of its applicability 16 see footnote 12 the term traderemedy laws resolution is used in this report to avoid possible ambiguity the legisla tion uses only resolution 17 the president is required by section 2104 d3a of the trade act of 2002 19 usc 3804d3a to report to the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee at least 180 days before entering in to tariffandnontariff agreement regarding any proposals in the

remedy laws stated in section 2102b14 19 usc 3802b14 18 the adoption itself of the nonbinding resolution has objective consequences but the fact of its having been reported in either house denies the application of the expedited procedure see item 2d above to floor consideration of procedural disapproval resolution in that housec the resolution may be introduced by any member of either house is referred to the ways and means committee and the rules committee in the house and to the finance committee in the senate and is nonamendable section 2105b2a ta02 19 usc 3805b2a15 d on the floor of

as described in the re quired relevant pr esidents report17 are inconsistent with the traderemedy laws negotiating objectives of the trade act of 2002 either house may adopt onehouse nonbinding re solution finding that there exists such inconsistency section 2104d3cii ta02 19 usc 3804d3cii18 b the language of the resolution is prescribed by law section 2104d3cii ta02 19 usc 3804d3cii c the

nonamendability as applies to procedural disapproval resolution see item 2c and footnote15 above also applies under this rule to nonbinding resolution but this in practice has effect on procedural di sapproval resolution since any such effect is contingent on the nonbinding resolutions merely having been reported see item 2d above and footnote 18 up to wh ich procedural stage it is nonamendable in either house traderemedy laws resolution is also generally nonamendable in the house under the provisions of section 152d of the trade act of 1974 which applies to the consideration of such resolution
