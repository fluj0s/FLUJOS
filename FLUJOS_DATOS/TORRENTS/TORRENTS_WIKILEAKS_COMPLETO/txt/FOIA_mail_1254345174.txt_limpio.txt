from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to michael mann mannmeteopsuedu subject re attacks against keith date wed sep 30 171254 2009 cc gavin schmidt gschmidtgissnasagov tim osborn tosbornueaacuk mike i realized youd have many more bad emails as for mj2003 what we used was an average of fennoscan yamal and taymir as one of the series briffa et 2001 was just referred to in that as ref to rcs the paper also talks about n eurasia so the sites get mention at 1606 30092009 michael mann wrote hi phil lets not get into the topic of hate mail i promise you i could fill your inbox w very long list of vitriolic attacks diatribes and threats ive received its part of the attack of the corporatefunded attack machine ie its direct and highly intended outcome of highly orchestrated heavilyfunded corporate attack campaign we saw it over the summer w the health insurance industry trying to defeat obamas health plan well see it now as the us senate moves on to focus on the cap trade bill that passed congress this summer it isnt coincidental that the original mcintyre and mckitrick ee paper w press release came out the day before the us senate was considering the mccain lieberman climate bill in 05 were doing the best we can to expose this i hope our realclimate post goes some ways to exposing the campaign and preemptively deal w the continued onslaught we can expect over the next month thanks for alerting us to that detail of kaufman et which id overlooked wed already asked darrell if he could compute yamalless version of his series but as you point out hes really already done this and osborn and briffa 06 is also immune to this issue as it eliminated any combination of up to 3 of the proxies and showed the result was essentially the same fair to say this tim also is it fair to say that this particular version of keiths yamal series was not what we used in mann and jones 03 we reference briffa et 01 thanks for the help were hoping to have something up tomorrow at the latest and any updates at your end will be extremely helpful to the case mike on sep 30 2009 at 1030 am phil jones wrote mike gavin the short note may not say much as youre aware kaufman et have plot without trees their plots shows trees lakes and ice separately another issue is science by blog sites and the then immediate response mode science ought to work through the peerreview system sure youve said all these things before were getting handful of nasty emails coming and requests for comments on other blog sites one email has gone to the university registrar because of the language used keith had one that said he was responsible for millions of deaths even one reading far too much into his off ill message even though ive had loads of fois and nasty emails few in the last 2 days have been the worst yet im realizing more what those working on animal experiments must have gone through cheers phil at 1456 30092009 michael mann wrote greatthanks tim sounds like we have plan in our post which well target for tomorrow as well well simply link to whatever cru puts up and reiterate the sentiment of the temporary short response ie that there was cherrypicking careful and defensible selection procedure was used and well mostly focus on the broader issues ie that any impact of this one series in the vast array of paleoclimate reconstructions and the importance of the paleoclimate reconstructions themselves has been overstated why these sorts of attacks are not legitimate science etc mike on sep 30 2009 at 951 am gavin schmidt wrote of course were preparing bigger picture response and will link directly to cru and maybe quote from it directly gavin schmidt nasagoddard institute for space studies 2880 broadway new york ny 10025 tel 212 678 5627 email

brief holding note that cherrypicking was done and demonstrating data selection is defendable by our time tomorrow 2 longer piece with more evaluation etc in around week point is posting something that turns out to be wrong keith may post them on the cru website but presumably they could be linked to from realclimate page or if keith agrees be reproduced on realclimate cheers tim at 1416 30092009 michael mann wrote hi tim just checking if there are any further developments here ie some more info from either tom or keith gavin and i feel we need to do something on realclimate on this quickly probably by later today thanks in advance for any help you can offer mike on sep 29 2009 at 346 am tim osborn wrote hi mike and gavin thanks for your emails re mcintyre yamal and keith ill pass on your best wishes for his recovery when i next speak to keith hes been off almost 4 months now and wont be back for at least another month barring couple of lectures that hes keen to do in october as part of gradual return hopefully hell be properly back in november regarding yamal im afraid i know very little about the whole thing other than that i am 100 confident that the tree ring data was handpicked to get the desired result is complete crap having ones integrity questioned like this must make your blood boil as im sure you know with both of you having been the target of numerous such attacks though it would be nice to shield keith from this during his recovery i think keith will already have heard about this because he had recently been asked to look at ca in relation to the kaufman threads keith was coauthor on that and darrell had asked keith to help with response to the criticisms apart from keith i think tom melvin here is the only person who could shed light on the mcintyre criticisms of yamal but he can be rather loose cannon and shouldnt be directly contacted about this also he wasnt involved in the yamal chronology being discussed though he has been involved in regional reconstruction that weve recently been working towards that uses these and more data perhaps phil and i should talk with tom and also see if keith is already considering response off to lecture for couple of hours now cheers tim dr timothy j osborn academic fellow climatic research unit school of environmental sciences university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk
