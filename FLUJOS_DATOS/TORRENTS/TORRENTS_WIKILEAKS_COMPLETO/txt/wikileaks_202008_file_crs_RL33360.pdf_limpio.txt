for reducing the na vys dependence on oil for its ships include reducing energy use on navy ships shifting to alternative hydrocarbon fuels shifting to more reliance on nuclear pr opulsion and using sail and solar power reducing energy use on navy ships 2001 study concluded that fitting navy cruiser with more energyefficient electrical equipment could reduce the ships fuel use by 10 to 25 the navy has installed fuelsaving bulbous bows and stern flaps on many of its ships ship fuel use could be reduced by shifting to advanced turbine designs such as an intercooled recuperated icr turbine shifting to integrated electricdrive propulsion can reduce ships fuel use by 10 to 25 some navy ships are to use integrated electric drive fuel cell technology if successfully developed could reduce navy ship fuel use substantially alternative hydrocarbon fuels potential lternative hydrocarbon fuels for navy ships include biodiesel and liquid hydrocarbon fuels made from coal using the fischertropsch ft process 2005 naval research advisory committee nrac study and 2006 air force scien tific advisory board both discussed ft fuels nuclear propulsion oilfueled ship types that might be shifted to nuclear propulsion include largedeck amphibious assault ships and large surface combatants ie cruisers and destroyers 2005 qui ck look analysis by the naval nuclear propulsion progra m concluded that total lif ecycle costs for nuclear powered versions of these ships would equa l those of oilfueled versions when oil reaches about 70 and 178 pe r barrel respectively sail and solar propulsion kiteassisted propulsion might be an option for reducing fuel use on navy auxiliaries nd dod sealift ships two firms are now offering kiteassist systems to commercial ship operators solar power might offer some potential for augmenting other forms of shipboard power perhaps particularly on navy auxiliaries and dod sealift ships fy2007 defense authorization act hr 5122pl 109364 section

navy study examining alternatives to fossil fuels for ships defense daily november 1 2006electrical generators acc ounts for 58 of dods cons umption dod testified while marine diesel fuel accounts for 132 the navy stated in october 2006 that it uses about 41 million barrels of oil per year for all purposes about 33 of th abovementioned dod figure of 125 million barrels in fy2005 and that in fy2005 the navy spent 900 million for fuel for its ships and aircraft or bout 32 of the dod total of 283 billion for that year3 for fossilfueled navy ships reducing energy use can reduce fuel costs and increase cruising range increasing cruising range can improve operational flexibility by increasing the time between refuelings and the distance that the ship can operate away from its next refueling point it might also reduce the ships infrared signature and thus increase its survivability by reducing emissions of hot exhaust gasses if applied to significant number of ships an increase in cruising range might permit reduction in navy costs for fuelrela ted force structure eg oilers and infrastructure eg storage facilities 2001 report by defense science boar d dsb task force on improving the fuel efficiency of dod weapon platforms stated the navy has had program since 1977 to improve weapon platform fuel efficiency focused primarily on legacy systems the navy staff estimates it has reduced the fuel consumption of the ship and aircraft fleet by 15 and 6 percent respectively deployment of the tec hnologies and products has been primarily through and lowcost routes such as the normal overhaul process or procedural changes however fuel effi ciency has not been given high priority in future system design fuel consumption enters design tradeoffs as one of many components of operating cost and in most cases is one of the least important components because its benefits are so undervalued for reasons presented elsewhere in the report as result of this undervaluation and split incentives new fuel saving technologies that promise increased performance and positive return on investment do not compete well for funding if the in itial investment is high and the savings do not appear for several yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33360crs3 4 us department of defense more capable warfighting through reduced fuel burden report of the defense science board task force on

portion of the navys developmen t test and evaluation dte program categories 64 and 65 is specifically dedicated to improving the fuel efficiency of ships primarily legacy ship s this program began in the late 1970s with funding peaking at about 35m in 1984 after fuel prices dropped in 1985 the program was funded at more modest level settling to around 8m per year through the 1990s4 the dsb report listed options for powerp lant improvements that could improve fuel efficiency by 3 to 8 options for hullsystem hydr odynamic improvements that could improve fuel efficiency by another 3 to 8 and options for improvements to hull coatings and cleaning auxiliary systems sensors controls and procedures and hotel load s functions such as ligh ting and fresh water production that could lead to further improvements in fuel efficiency some of the options listed in the dsb report are discu ssed in greater detail below hotelload electrical systems dr amory lovins the director of th rocky mountain institute rmi and member of the dsb task force estimated in 2001 that as much as 30 of the navys nonaviation fuel appears to be used to generate power for hotel loads5 study conducted by rmi for the navy in 2001 of energy use on the aegis cruiser princeton cg59 found that hotel loads on these ships could be substantially reduced according to the dsb report the rmi st udy found retrofittable hotelload electric savings potential on the order of 20 to 50 percent with significant further opportunities still to be asse ssed many of the saving s opportunities were purely operational requiring little or investment6 in an online article about the rmi study dr lovins stated the naval sea systems commands navseas able engineers had estimated that 19 percent could be saved on ships of this class of which princeton was in the top one fourth for efficiency our preliminary survey found gratifyingly large potential savings perhaps if found feasible as much as several times navseas expectations princeton uses nearly 6 million worth of diesellike turbine fuel each year her gas turbines akin to those on an older passenger jet aircraft use about 23 million worth of oil to make up to 25 megawatts of electricity the rest for 80000 horsepower of propulsion the rmi team found that retrofitting motors pumps fans chillers lights and potable water systems could save an estimated 2050 percent of the ships electricity that could cut total fuel use by an estimated 1025 percenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33360crs4 7 amory b lovins all energy experts on deck available

lities ashore the rmi team started by calculating what its worth to save kilowatthour since the electricity is being made inefficiently from fuel thats mainly delivered by oiler ships the answer is an eyepopping 27 cents six times typical i ndustrial tariff ashore this high cost makes negawatts really juicy for example each percentage point of improved efficiency in single 100horsepower alwayson motor is worth 1000 year each chiller could be improved to save its own capital costs worth of electricity about 120000 every eight months bout 400000 year could be saved if under noncritical lowthreat conditions certain backup systems were set to come on automatically when needed rath er than running all the time half that saving could come just from two 125horsepower firepumps that currently pump seawater continuously aboard around the sh ip and back overboard in critical civilian facility like refinery where one wanted to be equally certain the firefighting water was always ready one would instead pressurize the pipes usually with freshwater with 2hp pump and rig the main pumps to spring into action the instant the pressure dropped princetons total electricitysaving pot ential could probably cut her energy costs by nearly 1 million year or about 10 million in present value over the ships life cycle while improving her warfighting capability7 bulbous bows bulbous bow

higherefficiency gas turbines gas turbines with greater efficiencies than the simplecycle gas turbines currently used in navy ships could substantially reduce navy ship fuel use an example of such an engine is the wr21 intercooled recuperate d icr gas turbine engine which was jointly developed between 1991 and 2000 by the us uk and french governments for potential use on futu re warships at shared total cost of 400 million the industry team for the pr oject included northrop grumman marine systems as the prime contractor rollsroy ce as the major subcontractor responsible for the design of the

late 1990s considered the wr21 for the dd21 destroyer program now the ddg1000 destroyer program23 1998 article stated that with the wr21 each dd21 vessel for example would save about 15 million year in fuel and operating costs northrop grummans icr program manager said the savings provided by the new technology could pay back the premium on the original purchase of the wr21 in two to six years improved fuel economy can translate into range of enhanced mission capabilities as well these benefits could include 30percent increase in weapons payload for the dd21 27 to 30percent reduction in fuel tankage increased speed additional days on station or greater range24 supporters of the wr21 also argued that the icr engine would result in lower exhaust temperature which could re duce the ships infrared signature the navy ultimately selected sign for the ddg1000 whose propulsion system employed the lm2500 the uk in 2000 selected the wr21 for its new 7500ton type 45 destroyer which like the ddg1000 will employ an integrated electric drive system see discussion below other advanced turbines with even higher efficiencies are viewed as technically possible25 integrated electricdrive propulsion compared to traditional mechanicaldrive propulsion system with two separate sets of turbines one for propulsion the ot her for generating electricity for shipboard use an integrated electri cdrive propulsion system can reduce ships fuel use by permitting the ships single combined set of turbines to be run more often at their most fuelefficient speeds 2000 crs report that surveyed

type and the exact propellerstern configuration used26 the navys take1 class cargo ships use an integrated electricdrive system derived from commercially available system that has been installed on ships such as cruise ships the navys lead ddg 1000 destroyers are to use an integrated electricdrive system with more adva nced motor type known as the advanced induction motor aim the navy submar ine community has expressed an interest in shifting from mechanicaldrive to electricdrive technol ogy but requires technology that is more torquedense ie more powerdense than the aim technology to be used on the lead ddg1000s candidates for more torquedense technology include permanent magnet motor pmm and hightemperature superconducting hts synchronous motor drs technologies maker of elect ricdrive propulsion equipment has proposed increasing the planned scope of the navys program for modernizing its ddg51s to include the adding some ectricdrive propulsion equipment to the ships existing mechanicaldrive propulsi on plants the added equipment which would include permanent magnet auxiliary motorgenerators would more fully interconnect the mechanicaldrive com ponents on each ship supporters of the proposal argue that the m odification would reduce ddg51 fuel use by about 15 increase the ships electrical power permit electrical power from the ships main engines to be used for other purposes reduce maintenance on the ships engines increase the propulsion plants ability to c ontinue working after being damaged by attack and reduce the ships susceptibility to attack by reducing the ships infrared signatures drs estimates that the proposal would have nonrecurring design and engineering cost of about 155 million and recurring procuremen t and installation cost of about 115 million per ship drs estimates that installation costs on each ship would be recovered by reduced fuel cost s in about three years and that installing the equipment on 20 of the navys 62 ddg51s would generate netpresentvalue npv lifecycle savings of about 200 million27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33360crs11 28 for basic information on fuel cell technology see crs report rl32196 hydrogen

substantially by generating electricity much more efficiently than is possible through combustion figure 4 is navy briefing slide comparing the relative efficiency of combustion and fuel cell electric power plants29 the navy states that the navys shi pboard gas turbine engines typically operate at 16 to 18 percent efficiency because navy ships usually sail at low to medium speeds that dont require peak use of the pow er plant the fuel cell system that onr the office of naval research is developing will be capable of between 37 to 52 percent efficiency30 as result of these relative efficiencies

operating nd support costs for nuclear and fossil fueled versions of largedeck aircraft ca rriers would equalize when the price of diesel fuel marine dfm delivered to the navy reached 55 the breakeven figures for lhalhdtype largedeck amphibious assault ships and large surface combatants ie cruisers and destroyers were 80 and 205 per barrel respectively55 as of february 2006 the price of dfm delivered to the navy was 84 per barrel since the cost of dfm delivered to the navy is roughly 15 greater than that of crude oil these figures correspond to crudeoil co sts of about 48 70 and 178 per barrel respectively the difference in the breake ven points results in part from the different amounts of energy used by each type of ship over its life time the naval reactors study was based on 40year ship life which is roughly consistent with the expected service life of an amphibious assault ship but five years longer than the 35year life the navy now plan s for its cruisers and destroyers if the calculation were done on 35year basis fo r the surface combatants the breakeven figure for those ships might shift somewhat the results for the surface combatants are for ship roughly equal in size to the navys past nuclearpowered cruisers c gns since most of these cgns were smaller than the 14500ton ddg1000cgx design the breakeven point for nuclearpowered version of the ddg 1000cgx design

comprehensive analysis might be required to decide whether to shift from fossilfueled largedeck amphibious assault ships or large surface combatants to nuclearpowered versions of these ships the results of the quick look study however suggest th at the option may be worth further exploration at least for the largedeck am phibious assault ships it may also be worth exploring the option for large surface combatants particularly if oil prices are expected to rise from current levels nd if the operational advantages of nuclear propulsion are also taken into account past nuclear ships other th an carriers and submarines the navy has not previously built nuclearpowered largedeck amphibious assault ships one approach for doing so would be to take onehalf of the twin reactor plant designed for the new cvn21 class aircraft carriers and install it on an lhalhdtype hull another option would be to design new plant specifically for this type of hull56 table 1 shows the nine nuclearpowered cruisers cgns previously built by the navy the ships include three oneo fakind designs followed by the twoship california cgn36 class and the f ourship virginia cgn38 class procurement of nuclearpowered cruise rs was halted after fy1975 due largely to desire to constrain the procurement cost s of future cruisers in deciding in the late 1970s on the design for the new crui ser that

shipbuilding now known as northrop grumman newport news ngnn implications for procurement costs of other ships naval reactors estimates that building nuclearpowered amphibious assault ship every three years or so could reduce the procurement cost of each nuclear powered carrier cvn by about 65 million and each nuclearpowered attack submarine ssn by about 20 million due to increased economies of scale in the production of nuclear propulsi on components naval react ors further estimates that if nuclearpowered surface combatants were then added to this mix of nuclear powered ships it would reduce the cost of each cvn by an additional 80 million or so and each ssn by an additional 25 million or so naval reactors also states that the additional work in building nuclearpropulsion components could help stabilize the nuclearpropulsi on component industrial base by providing extra work to certain component makers whose bus iness situation is somewhat fragile57 if nuclearpowered amphibious assault ships or surface combatants are built partially or entirely by the two nucl earconstruction yards northrop grumman newport news ngnn and ge neral dynamics electric boat division gdeb see discussion below it might further reduce the cost of cvns and ssns built at those yards by spreading the fixed overhead costs at those yards over wider workload and enabling more efficient

carried out the impact of variations in fuel prices was stressed the effect of varying the average speed was investigated product carrier was chosen as study exampl the study pointed out some of the commercial limitations of windshipapplication at present time it proved uneconomical to use windships on typi cal product carrier routes cost increase of approximately 10 was calculated when comparing the windship with an equalsized conventional product carrier the results showed that by lowering the average speed of conventional ship by 1 knot reduction of approxima tely 25 in fuel consumption could be achieved however by adding the rig of the windship on average an additional three tons of fuel per 24 hrs could be saved in the more windy areas this corresponded to 1015 of the total fuel consumption on the economical side the results may be less inspiring at first sight there is doubt that the results were both reliable and realistic however the main conclusion that emerged was that product carrier is not the preferred choice for modern windship there was economical advantage in using windship instead it cost 10 more to sail with worse yet the fuel savings were marginal under certain assumptions and conditions windship even consumed more fuel than conventional ship however on the route between rotterdam holland and new york usa an average hfo heavy fuel oil savi ng of 205 to 27 was shown depending on average speed it was only here that the average wind speed of 8 ms initially estimated during phase 1 could be found decisions on sail area etc were based on this estimate early on in phase 2 19981999 of the project at the same time the feasibility study showed that the comparison had been made at suboptimal speed for wi ndship calculations using 11 knots instead of 13 lowered the required freight rate with up to 5 due to the special requirements of the product carrier trade the larger internal volume of windship was not used to its advantage in the study taking the above issues into account we see the potential of modern windships concept if speed is reduced but same productivity is maintained due to the larger volumes carried money will be saved it is in this market segment that the windship should operate careful routing including effects of seasonal weather variations could then pr ove the windship both environmentally beneficial and economically

winds large masts create lot of drag in gales masts cause ships to heel sometimes dangerously masts and their pivoting sails take up valuable container space on the deck loading and unloading is more expensive since the cranes that lift containers must work around the masts engineers designed taller and more expensive masts some exceeding 100 metres in height to reduce their number and limit the loss of storage space but the panama canal limits masts to 60 metres and collapsable masts would be prohibitively expensive to build operate and service the cost of retrofitting cargo ship with row of masts and strengthening its hull and deck to dissipate the additional stress was estimated at euro10m 125m so the sails would have ta ken around 15 years to recoup their costs through fuel savings68 the aim of kiteassisted propulsion is to reduce or avoid these issues while taking advantage of the stronger winds that are available at heights greater than those attainable by sails on masts at least two firms the usbased firm kiteship and the germanbased firm skysails have developed kiteassist systems for potential application to commercial cargo ships nd thus by extension perhaps commercial like navy auxiliary and dod sealift ships kiteship69 figure 8 depicts commercial ship equipped with kiteships system kiteship states when fuel costs become sufficiently high andor governmental air and water quality regulations became sufficiently heinous the commercial shipping industry will look to sail power as an assist to petroleum powered vessels the industry has done this

environmental restrictions will become increasingly draconian conventional masted sail solutions have inherent limitations which will continue to delay their application l ong past the point where windassist can become cost effective the ability to sign massive sail power without need for ballast without fixed masts interfering with loading and unloading procedures without adding hundreds of

vessels cheaply and efficiently is paramount the ability to build repair and maintain systems remote from shipboard eliminating downtime is an important asset kiteship has understood these advantages for decades we have been readying appropriate technology for commercial tethered flight sailing since 197870 one of the principals of kiteship dave culp stated in 2003 interview in studying attempts to bring back commercial sailing ships in the 1980s it struck that they were doomed to fail for the same reasons commercial sail failed in the 19th century the cost of the equipment expressed as rate of amortization was far higher than powered vessels even including their fuel second the f undamental inability to schedule wind power plays havoc with effectively utilizing expensive ships motor sailing was and is possible to fix this but requires parallel systems on the boat wind plus diesel at even higher total cost kites on the other hand can be added to existing ships they take up deck space require minimal retrofitting need ballast fit under bridges and can be taken in out of the weather when not in use they can be taken off the boat for maintenance and even used on second boat whenif adverse or wind is expected aboard the first these f actors dramatically decrease the capital cost of the sailing rig thus the amortization rate if added to existing vessels especially if the vessels are partially depreciated already it becomes very cost effective to fit single ship with both power which it has and kites which are cheap it can then pure sail motor sail or straight motor as conditions dictate figure 8 kiteship concept applied to commercial cargo shiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33360crs27 71 if the site listed in the article is not availa ble see also the papers at these
