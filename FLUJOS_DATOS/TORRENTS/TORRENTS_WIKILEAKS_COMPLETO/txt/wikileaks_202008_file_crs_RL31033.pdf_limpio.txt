with unique cosystem rich in plant life and wildlife that is also one of the most prospective onshore areas in the united states for large oi l discove ries president bush has proposed opening the area to oil and natural ga s development among the numerous r ecommendations of the administration report reliable affordabl and environmentally sound energy for americas future may 2001 are proposals to open an wr foster energy efficiency and energy conservation and review automobile fuel ef ficiency some observers believe all of the administration recommended initiatives are necessary for meeting the nations future energy needs others suggest that pursuing energy efficiency and conservation initiatives ca n eliminate the need for undertaking certain production efforts that they see as posing risks to the environment or other values specifically many who oppose openin g anwr argue that the oil saved from increased energy efficiency and conservatio n throug h use of alternative fuels could do more to increase energy security and t reduce prices than exploiting any oil that might be found in anwr while als avoiding the risk of damage to the environment and wildlife and the reduction of its wilderness character this report compares the range of estimates for potential oil production fro m anwr with potential energy savings from increases in fuel economy and expanded use of ethanol it thus provides two of many possible answers to the question could energy efficiency and conservation save as much oil as anwr might supply it does not address the larger question of whether that tradeoff makes sense in light of th total energy picture the energy information administration eia says that technologydrive n projection for cars and light trucks could increase fuel economy by 36 milesper gallon by 2020 the fuel economy improvement through the first 20 years woul d generate average daily oil savings equivalent to four times the low case and three fourths of the high case projected for anwr oil production extended through 50 years the fuel economy savings would range from 10 mes the low case to more than double the high case for anwr also department of energy doe repor t projects that the development of cellulosic ethanol technology could more than double the growth in ethanol use by 2 020 by displacing gasoline the increased ethanol use would through the first 20 years generate average daily oil s avings equivalent to one fifth of the low case and 4 of the high case for anwr extended through 50 years the ethanol savings would range from threefourths of the low

considering bills to allow oil development in anwr an area i n northeastern alaska with unique ecosystem rich in plant life and wildlife current law does not allow energy development in anwr but growing oil imports and rising prices for oil and gasoline have rekindled proposals for oil development there proponents of anwr development argue that its oil production could reduce the upswing in prices lower oil imports and bolster national energy security b lessening us market exposure to recurring crises in the middle east further i t would help the economy by creating jobs for the oil industry and improving th economic viability of the transalaska pipeline also they claim that oil drillin g technology has advanced to the point where anwr oil could be developed wit h minimal environmental impacts president bush has proposed anwr development as key p art of his energy policy and it is featured in the administrations report reliable affordable and environmentally sound energy for americas future opponents argue that oil prices are set in the world market where the far greater supply and lower cost of persian gulf oil ens ures that anwr production would have little effect on imports and virtually effect on oil prices also they contend that anwr development would cause irreparable harm to the fragile tundra of the coastal plain and its wildlife broader impacts could include oil spills waste disposal and air pollution and carbon dioxi emissions further they contend that energy efficiency measures especially improved fuel efficien cy for cars and light trucks would save far more oil than anwr ca n produce thus they say energy efficiency could do more to lower oil imports and prices while reducing instead of increasing environmental impacts this report describes the range of estimates f or potential oil production from the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr the high and low estimates for n economically recoverable oil resource or reserve are then expressed in terms of an average or levelized daily production over assumed 20 and 50year reserv lifetimes also the report looks at meas ures for reducing oil use or displacing it with alternative fuels to see if any one measure or combination of measures woul d constitute an option for yielding an equivalent to the amount of oil that is projected to be available if anwr were brought into

then expressed as levelized daily value although several illustrat ions of measures and options may be possible this report is limited to discussion of only two measures fuel economy and cellulosic ethanol the report concludes with summary and comparison of anwr projection s with those for fuel economy and cellulosic ethanol it finds that fuel econom improve ment through the first 20 years would generate average daily oil saving s equivalent to about four times the low case and threefourths of the high cas projected for anwr oil production extended through 50 years the fuel economy savings would range fr om 10 times the low case to double the high case for anwr also cellulosic ethanol production thro ugh the first 20 years would generate average daily oil savings equivalent to onefifth of the low case and about 4 of the high case projected for anwr extended through 50 years the sav ings from increased ethanol use would be equivalent to about t hreefourths of the low case and about 16 of the high case for anwr potential oil production from anwr assuming an oil price of 2516 per barrel the us geological surve y1 estimates that there is 95 chance that the economically recoverable oil resources in anwr are 203 billion barrels or more of crude oil and 5 chance that th resources are greater than 937 billion barrels usgs draws careful distinctio n2 between definitions of oil resources and oil reserves for consistency wit h practice by industry and eia this memo uses the term estimated economicall recoverable oil reserves to refer to what usgs defines as resources3 time lag to first oil production the energy information administration eia estimates that from approval to develop oil from the an wr area it would take seven to 12 years until the first production of oil begins further eia notes that this4 time lag could vary significantly depending on the time required for leasing environmental and regulat ory requirements and the possibility of operational delayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31033crs3 eia anw r oil production assessment p 3 eias oil production model assume s5 developm ent rates that reach peak production in the third year at about 10 percent

and time lag to peak production once production began there would be another time lag until peak production is reached depend ing on the amount of oil present this period is determined by th development rate which in turn is determined primarily by the number of well s drilled per year however oil prices and technology advance ments can also influence5 the development rate for each reserve estimate eia assumes low and hig h development rate to show the effect of accelerated development given the range6 in estimated reserves the resultant estimates of time to peak production range from 22 to 25 years pipelin capacity constraint there is some available pipeline capacit to support oil production from anwr however usgs and eia note that higher rates of production from anwr could be limited by the lack of available pipelin capacity the transalaskan p ipeline currently supports about 1 million bd from all existing north slope oil fields and could accommodate another 12 to 14 million bd from other future sources including anwr 7 level ized oil production rates the production cycle is likely to follow growth curve with peak and declining tail however to simplify compariso n with energy efficiency and conservation measures levelized daily value i s calculated by averaging production over the entire p roductive life of the reserve for 50year case this is
