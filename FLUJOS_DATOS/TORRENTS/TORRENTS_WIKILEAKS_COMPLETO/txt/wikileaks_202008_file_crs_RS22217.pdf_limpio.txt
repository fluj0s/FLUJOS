summary during the first session of the 109th congress policymakers sought to accelerate the nations transition to digital television and to expedite the transf er of radio frequency channels from the broadcast industry to public safety and commercia l users later than 2009 broadcasters are holding spectrum in the 700 megahertz mhz band channels 5269 that they would be required to relinqui sh after the transition to digital television dtv is achieved without hard deadline the transition to digital television has been postponed meanwhile public safety offici als want 700 mhz spectrum that has been assigned to them but not delivered in orde r to build new inter operable networks while the commercial wireless indus try would like access to the spectrum for new services legislative language

report will not be updated the transition to digital television has two major policy components one set of policy decisions is concerned with how best to move television br oadcasters and their viewers to digital technology other key po licy issues deal with radio frequency spectrum management and allocati on the public interest goals for these paths are not well aligned presenting congress with difficult choices to achieve its overall objective of completing the transition briefly discussed below are key points about the transition process background the impact on broadcasting spectru m policy and recent legislative activity1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22217crs2 1 continued an overview by lennard kruger and crs report rl32622 public safety interoperability and the transition to digital television by linda k moorei background the process of regulating the introduction of di gital television dtv technology extends over more than decade dtv is considered the most significant development in television technology since color television becau of features such as better picture resolution and the more efficient use of spectrum dtv also allows broadcaster to offer multiple programs multicasting or single program of high definition digital tv the united states and countries throughout the world are actively s eeking to replace existing overtheair analog tv with dtv broadcasting the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 provided thateligibility for dtv licenses should be limited initially to existing broadcasters digital signals cannot be transmitted with existing analog television technology therefore br oadcasters were issued additional licenses for new dtv broadcast channe ls while continuing to broadcast on existing channels during the transition period the old analog licenses were to be returned to the federal government after the transition to dtv in the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 congress set deadline of december 31 2006 to complete the transition from analog to digital television but allowed several exceptions that can extend that deadline critical exception is the percentage of households by market that must be equipped to receive digital signals 85 or more given the slowerthanexpected rate of adoption for dtv in american homes the goal of overtheair dig ital television in 85 of american households by 2006 was viewed as not likely to be reached legislative language to clear spectrum and mandate the transition to digital televison by specific deadline hard date was included in both the house and senate fy2005 budget reconciliati on bills hr 4241s 1932 the house proposal was for december 31 2008 deadline the senate specified april 7 2009 the conference agreement on the s 1932 deficit reduction act of 2005 sets deadline of february 17 2009 switching from analog to digital broadcast means that broadcasters will begin to broadcast exclusively on ch annels assigned for digital use broadcasts in analog mode will be ended viewers with conventional not dtv sets will lose overtheair broadcast tv unless they either install settop converter box to convert di gital signals to analog formats or subscribe to cable or satellite service that can accommodate both technologies ii dtv and broadcasting several studies such as those mentioned below have attempted to estimate the numbe r of overtheair analog

according to the national association of broadcasters nab there are currently 2805 million analog televisions in united states of these 73 million rely on overtheair broadcasting2 key issue in the digital transition is that the millions of analogtelevisions that rely on overtheair broadcasts will longer work once the analog signal is turned off according to government accountability office survey 19 of us households 21 million do not subscribe to cable or satellite service and rely exclusively on over theair broadcasting the gao found that lowincome nonwhite and hispanic households are more likely to rely on overthe air television broadcasting 3 the federal communications commission fcc estimates that 15 of tv househol ds are exclusively overtheair4 the consumer electronics association cea has estimated that less than 13 of tv households currently re ly on overtheair tv broadcasts5 in june 2005 the consumers union and the consumer federation of america issued joint study6 that estimated that approximately 16 million households would lose all tv reception when analog signals are cut off based on an estimate of 50 price to purchase converter box the report concluded that the di rect governmentimposed costs on consumers to preserve the usefulness of analog televi sion sets would be 35 billion or more the gao estimated that the cost of ssuring overtheair broadcasting by supplying converter boxes to households that only have analog television could total from 460 million to 106 billion depending on number of variables such as the cost of th boxes and the number of householdshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22217crs4 7 gao05258t pp 1415 8 digital television diverse groups oppose must carry provisions by drew clark national journals technology daily pm edition october 17 2005eligible to receive assistance7 the gao cost estimates do not include the cost of implementing subsidy program policy issues included whether some form of financial assistance subsidies or tax credits for example should be provided by the federal government to enable overtheair households to purchase converter boxes or digital televisions whethe r such assistance should go to low income households exclusively or to all households whether subsidies if warranted should be financed by proceeds garnered by auctioning the analog spectrum how much funding subsidy program would require and how much revenue is likely to be raised by auctioning the commercial portion of the reclaimed analog spectrum many cable households might wish to continue to use analog televisions after the transition cable compan ies might offer converter boxes to these customers as an alternative it is possible that cable providers might seek authority from congress to downconvert the digital signal of selected local broadcast stations to analog format to serve customers with digital televisions cable providers would continue to provide digital signals as well in other words dua l carriage under this scenario key issue is whether and how c ongress should mandate which local broadcast stations would receive the benefit of dual carriage to cable customers and for how long related issue is whether cable sy stems and satellite televison should be required to carry all the programs of overtheair broadcasters the simultaneous broadcasting of multiple channels of programming made possible by digital technology is re ferred to as multicasting the fcc has ruled that it will not require what is usually referred to as multicasting must carry nab has announced that it accepts that there will be hard date for ending analog television broadcasts but it is pressing for multicasting must carry which nab claims is way of assuring quality and diverse programming opponents claim that this requirement would clog cable operators systems closing out many other programs and discouraging new entrants there have also been expressions of concern that multicasting must carry would accelerate media concentration and reduce the diversity of viewpoints8 iii spectrum policy the completed transition process will free up 60 mhz of spectrum in addition to freeing spectrum alread allocated for public safety or sold for commercial use among the uses proposed fo r this 60 mhz are to provide additional spectrum for public safety use to assign spectrum for unlicensed use and to auction licenses

requires the fcc to prepare study for congress evaluating whether additional spectrum should be made available for public safety and homeland security wirele ss communications section 7502 some of the channels to be vacated by broadcasters have been assigned to public safety and so have been auctioned for advanced wireless communications services there is widespread interest in using the remaining unassigned channels for broadband wireless based on actions approved to date by house and senate committees it appears that all the unallocated spectrum 60 mh z would be auctioned in 2008 although estimates vary spectrum au ctions of frequencies in the 700 mhz band have typically been pr ojected to gross 20 billion to 30 billion9 revenue potential is dependent on number of factors including timing of auctions and the date at which spectrum will be cleared and available the congressional budget office reportedly set benchmark estimate of 10 billion in revenue from auction of this spectrum10 on december 20 2005 cbo estimated auction proceeds at 125 billion11 iv legislative activity policymakers in the 109th congress have allocated part of 700 mhz auction funds toward meeting budget resolution to reduce the federal deficit by the end of fy201012 the goal is to maximize the amount of 700 mhz spectrum available in timely manner while minimizing the cost and inconvenience to tv viewers and the television industry that might result from the transition the senate passed the deficit reduction omnibus reconciliation act of 2005 s 1932 senator gregg on november 3 2005 which contains some provisions regarding dtv the house passed on november 18 2005 the ficit reduction act of 2005 hr 4241 representative nussle with more ex tensive provisions for dtv the budget reconciliation conference report on s 1932 hr ept 109362 was approved by the house on december 19 2005 and approved by the sena on december 21 2005 however because the senate removed three provisions from the conference report provisions not related to digital tele vision s 1932 again had to be pproved by the house before final enactment on february 1 2006 the house again approved s 1932 on
