reforms backed washington post june 105 1999 p 4a related issue involves the security of nuclear weapon materials at doe facilities concerns about inadequate protection of weapon materials intensified after reports that military plutonium at does rocky flats facility near denver colorado could b vulnerable to terrorist attack the director of does offic of safeguards and security3 ed mccallum and contractors responsible for security at rocky flats attempted to call attention to the problems but their concerns were reportedly not heeded by do headquart ers subsequently the contractor filed suit against doe which placed mr mccallum on administrative leave for allegedly disclosing classified information i n telephone discussions with the contractor doe maintains that security is adequate t4 rocky flats but has agreed to improve physical security at weaponsrelated sites to address problems with doe security the president issued presidential decision directive pdd61 in february 1998 in april 1998 secre tary of energy bill richardson announced new security asures for the national laboratories to address backlog of longstanding security problems on may 11 1999 secretary richardson announced reorganization that would consolidate doe security functions into new central security office in june the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board recommende d creating an autonomous or semiautonomous nuclear weapon agency richardson initially opposed creating new agency but now supports senatebacked plan to establish semiautonomous agency congress is currently considering whether these steps are adequate to address th problem s of doe security several alternatives to the administrations initial securit reform package have be introduced including legislation to move the nuclear weapons program out of doe restrict fore ign visits to the labs and improve the accountability of doe contractors on june 9 the house unanimously passed the defense authorization for fy2000 hr 1401

to do headquarters the labs are operated by contractors and exercise high degree of autonomy the high degree of autonomy often results in inconsistent implem entation of doe policies including security policy since the moratorium on nuclear testing in 1992 and signing of comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt in 1996 us nuclear weapons are maintained through the stockpile stewardship program scientis ts at the doe national labs utilize broadbased scientific approach to ensure the safety and reliability of us nuclear weapons without testing 6 the doe also utilizes nuclear and scientific expertise to support us nonproliferation and arms control policy for example the labs provide expertise n foreign nuclear programs export controls and efforts to strengthen controls on nuclear weapons and materials in russia and other fsu countries the usrussia labtolab program has played central role in us cooperat ive threat reduction programs ctr lab scientists have installed material protection control and accounting mpca equipment at numerous rus sian and fsu facilities to reduce the risk of theft or diversion in russia 7 the labs also maintain broad array of basic scientific research programs in field s such as computing materials science energy physics and others which are critical t maintaining the expertise need ed to support stockpile stewardship and the other national security missions however the free exchange of information that is typical f8 unclassified scientific research sometimes clashes with the requirements of classifie d weaponrelated activities the partici pation of foreign citizens particularly from sensitive countries such as china russia nd india in unclassified laboratory research raises concerns about the security of classified and

classified information concerns about foreign visitors and their p ossible access to classified information and failur of the nuclear materials tracking system to account for weapon usable material many of the problems have persisted for years despite repeated efforts to spur doe to take action recently the problem s have resurfaced in connection with11 reports of chinese espionage at the labs

hackers doe faces some unique problems like other agencies tha t handle classified information doe and its labs maintain separate computer systems fo r classified and unclassi fied information the technical challenge is to prevent the transfer of classified information to an unclassified system which is often in close proximity this type of transf er apparently occurred at alamos when lab employee wen ho lee reportedly copied classified files to disk and put them on an unsecure computer where they were vulnerable to unautho rized access the fbi found that the files had been accessed but have not determined by whom technical solution used by some agencies is to remove the hard drive so that nothing can be downloaded from the classified system except when authorization to install or unlock the hard drive has been granted such solution however would not prevent peopl from transferring classified information onto an unclassified computer by memorizing it or copying it on paper first the policy question is where to draw the line between classified and unclassifie d research some unclassified res earch in areas such as computing and highenergy physics is relevant to the wea

chinese s pies apparently penetrated livermore national lab and acquired information on us nuclea r weapons doe inherited the weapons program when it was created in 1974 chinese espionage at us nuclear facilities reportedl continued through the 1980s and 1990s and succeeded in acquiring detailed information on most us nuclear weapons as well as other advanced weapons 12 various executive
