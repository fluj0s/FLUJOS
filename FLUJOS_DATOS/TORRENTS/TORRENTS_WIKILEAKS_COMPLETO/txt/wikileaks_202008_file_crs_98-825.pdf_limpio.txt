current national interest through freestanding simple or concurrent resolutions called generically sense of the house sense of the senate or sense of the congress resolutions these opinions may also be added to pending legislative measures by amendments expressing the views of one or both chambers this report1 identifies the various forms these expressions may take and the procedures governing such actions see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml for more information on legislative process g515g21g142g151g156g142g561g152g143g516g561g20g142g156g152g149g158g157g146g152g151g156g561 sense of the house or senate resolutions take the form of simple resolutions because they only require the approval of one chamber sense of congress resolution on the other hand must be concurrent resolution as both the house and senate must approve such measures joint resolutions are not typically used for expressions of congressional opinion because joint resolutions generally require presidential approval sense of resolutions are considered under the normal legislative processes of each chamber applicable to any other legislative vehicle because sense of resolutions do not involve the expenditure of public funds such resolutions when reported from house committees are placed on the house calendar typically the house considers them through suspension motions by unanimous consent request or under the terms of special rule reported from the committee on rules the senate normally takes up sense of resolutions by unanimous consent or more infrequently they are automatically laid before the senate under the resolutions over under the rule process senate rule xiv sense of resolution is not legally binding because it is not presented to the president for his signature even if sense of provision is incorporated into bill that becomes law such provisions merely express the opinion of congress or the relevant chamber they have formal effect on public policy and are not considered law g515g21g142g151g156g142g561g152g143g516g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 besides expressing such views through simple or concurrent resolutions congress may attach such provisions to bill by way of floor or committee amendment in the house sense of amendment must be germane to the overall measure and to the particular portion of the bill to which it is added violations of the germaneness rule can be overcome through motions to suspend the rules or by provisions in special rule waiving certain points of order senate rules give more latitude to senators to offer sense of amendments in committees or on the floor in general the rules of the senate normally do not require amendments to be germane to the pending bill germaneness of amendments is required once the senate invokes cloture sense of congress or sense of the senate amendments offered postcloture are germane if the subject of the sense of amendment falls within the jurisdiction of the committee reporting the underlying bill sense of congress or sense of the senate amendments offered to budget 1 this report was written by paul s rundquist formerly specialist in american national

resolutions and amendments expressing the sense of one or both houses of congress have been offered on many subjects survey of sense of resolutions and amendments adopted during the 109 th congress shows that many of them focused on foreign policy matters particularly resolutions that express the sense of the senate however sense of proposals were forwarded on wide range of other subjects including stressing particular domestic policy priority recognizing historic milestone or figure honoring former senator and calling for certain federal agencies or officials to take or refrain from taking specified action although sense of proposals have force in law foreign governments pay close attention to them as evidence of shifts in us foreign policy priorities on domestic issues agencies also monitor sense of provisions because they may be an early signal that congress will alter formal statutory provisions if the informal nature of sense of provisions does not influence agency policy
