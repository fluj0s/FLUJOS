divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30519the growth of the private sector in china and implications for chinas accession to the world trade organization summary over the past 21 years economic reforms have transformed china from relatively inefficient centrally planned economy to one that is signif icantly more marketoriented the gains in efficiency resulting from free market policies have helped make china one of the worlds fastest growing economies in recent years key policy in chinas economic success has been the decentralization of economic production which has helped produce thriving private sector in china prior to 1979 chinese government policies eliminated most private enterprises however over time the central governments policy towards the private sector has evolved from prohi bition to toleration to active encouragement chinese government data show that the number of private sector employees ie those working for privatelyowned chinese company or selfemployed rose from 45 million in 1985 to an estimated 813 million in 1999 the percentage contribution of the private sector to industrial output rose from 19 in 1985 to 179 in 1997 these data indicate that the private sector in china has become major factor in chinas economic growth and development the growth of the private sector in china has occurred to large extent from the governments efforts to reform chinas money losing stateowned enterprises soes workers who have been laid off from soes have been encouraged to find jobs in the private sector or to start their own businesses yet private firms in china continue to face variety of discriminatory policies that restrict their development especially in sectors dominated by the soes however in preparation for its eventual accession to the world trade organization wto the chinese government has announced plans to end most restrictive policies against chinese private firms some analysts contend that wto membership for china serves us interests by expandin g capitalism and diminishing the governments control of the economy promoting the rule of law in china subjecting chinas trade regime to multilateral trade rules and creating new markets for us goods and services others question whether chinas membership in the wto is good for us interests especially if chinas economic development threatened us jobs at home china failed to faithfully implement its wto obligations once it became member china opposed us trade liberalization objectives in the next round of wto multilateral negotiations or if economic liberalization failed to produce improvements in human rights conditions in china either way this report indicates that the private sector is growing in china and will likely continue to expand in the near future although it is unclear whether the chinese government is prepared to truly give private firms an even playing field key question is whether chinas private sector will be kept as complimentary feature of chinas socialist market economy or whether it will it be allowed to develop into the dominant sector of that economy this report examines the changing role of chinas private sector and the outlook for its future developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30519contents background on chinas economy prior to reforms 1 the introduction of economic reforms 2 chinas economic growth since reforms 19791999 2 causes

has undertaken various economic reforms that have helped transform china from centrally planned economy to one that is considerably more marketoriented key aspect of chinas economic transformation has been the expansion of the nonstate sector economic activity not directly controlled by the central government in china including growing private sector prior to the implementation of reforms in 1979 the private sector in china was nearly nonexistent due to government policies that strongly discouraged capitalist activit ies however after economic reforms were implemented the government began removing restrictions on the private sector in recent years the central government has encouraged chinese citizens to start their own businesses especially workers who have been laid off as result of government efforts to reform and restructure unprofitable stateowned enterprises soes the changing nature of chinas economy and the potential effects on chinese economic and trade policies resulting from its possible accession to the wto could be factor in congressional debate during the year 2000 over whether to extend permanent normal trade relations pntr status to china while pntr status is not tied to chinas wto accession it will determine whether uschina trade relations are based on wto rules once china becomes member many analysts argue that wto membership would force china to substantially reform its economy including the privatization of many of its statecontrolled sectors such development it is argued would benefit us firms doing business in china namely through the reduction of government interference in the economy and expanded opportunities for us firms to develop business partnerships with chinese entrepreneurs conversely other analysts question whether china would fully implement its wto trade obligations or allow the private sector to play dominant role in chinas economy especially if such reforms undermined the financial viability of its soes background on chinas economy prior to reforms prior to 1979 china essentially maintained centrally planned or command economy large share of the countrys economic output was directed and controlled by the state which set production goals controlled prices and allocated resources throughout most of the economy during the 1950s all of chinas individual household farms were collectivized into large communes to support rapid industrialization the central government during the 1960s and 1970s undertook large scale investments in physical and human capital as result by 1978 nearly three fourths of industrial production was produced by centrally controlled state ownedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30519crs2 1 these characterizations are attrib uted to remarks made by deng xiaoping the chinese leader chiefly responsible for launching the reformsenterprises soes according to centrally planned output targets private enterprises and foreignfunded enterprises ffes were nearly nonexistent central goal of the chinese government was to make chinas economy relatively selfsufficient foreign trade was generally limited to obtaining only those goods that could not be made or obtained in china chinas real gdp grew at an estimated average annual rate of about 53 from 19601978 however government policies kept the chinese economy relatively backward and inefficient mainly because there were few profit incentives for firms and farmers competition was virtually nonexistent foreign trade and investment was severely restricted consumer goods were scarce and price and production controls caused widespread distortions in the economy chinese living standards were substantially lower than those of many other developing countries the introduction of economic reforms beginning in 1979 china launched several economic reforms the central government initiated price and ownership incentives for farmers which enabled them to sell portion of their crops on the free market in addition the government established four special economic zones for the purpose of attracting foreign investment boosting exports and importing high technology products into china additional reforms followed in stages that sought to decentralize economic policymaking in several economic sectors especially trade economic control of various enterprises was given to provincial and local governments which were generally allowed to operate and compete on free market principles rather than under the direction and guidance or assistance of state planning additional coastal regions and cities were designated as open cities and development zones which allowed them to experiment with free market reforms and to offer tax trade and other incentives to attract foreign investment in addition state price controls on wide range of products were gradually eliminated the government also attempted to initiate reforms to improve the financial performance of soes such as removing mandatory production plans and giving greater autonomy to managers and workers to run their operations over time the government has given greater emphasis to the development of the private sector in 1992 the chinese government announced that the goal of economic reform was to create socialist market economy in which market forces were to become increasingly important in determining production and prices but where the state would continue to exercise overall control of the economy as well as over key economic sectors reforms were intended to be gradual and experimental crossing the river by touching the stones1 chinas

development report various issues and drimcgrawhill world economic outlook various issues note many analysts suggest that chinas gdp growth data may be overestimated causes of chinas economic growth economists have concluded that productivity gains ie increases in efficiency were major factor in chinas rapid econom ic growth the improvements to productivity were largely caused by reallocation of resources to more productive uses especially in sectors that were formerly heavily controlled by the central government such as agriculture trade and services for example agricultural reforms boosted production thus freeing workers to pursue employment in more productive activities in the manufacturing sector chinas decentralization of the economy led to the rise of nonstat enterprises which tended to pursue more productive activities than the centrally controlled soes additionally greater share of the economy mainly the export sector was exposed to competitive forces local and provincial governments were allowed to establish and operate various enterpriseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30519crs4 3 perkins fc export performance and enterprise reform in chinas coastal provinces economic

expanding the authority of local governments to establish their own enterprises has likely been an important factor in building political support for the central governments economic reforms it enables local officials to become directly involved in such reforms and in many cases to directly benefit from such reforms financially on market principles without interference from the central government in addition foreign direct investment fdi in china brought with it new technology and processes that boosted efficiency study by fc perkins found that exportoriented firms in china have exper ienced significantly higher productivity growth than nonexporting firms and that nonstateowned enterprises have experienced higher productivity growth than the soes perkins cites autonomy in decision making and exposure to free domestic markets as the key factors in productivity growth by the nonsoes3 world bank study also attributed productivity gains to the expansion of market forces in china including the rise of the private sector in china the reforms also gave greater room for private ownership of production and these privately held businesses created jobs developed muchwante d consumer products earned important hard currency through foreign trade paid state taxes and gave the national economy flexibility and resiliency that it did not have before4 the changing composition of chinas economy central factor in chinas reform process has been the decentralization of economic policymaking in china in order to promote greater competition and efficiency in the economy key aspect of this policy has been to gradually expand the role of the nonstate sector in various sectors of the economy while attempting to improve the performance of the staterun sector prior to 1979 soes accounted for significant share of the countrys industrial production and employment private firms and foreignfunded enterprises ffes were nearly nonexistent while local enterprises were subject to state controls and supervision since the initiation of reforms the role of the soes in chinas economy has greatly diminished while the role of the nonstate sector has substantially increased beginning in the early 1980s the central government encouraged local and provincial governments to establish their own firms local officials in the cities and townships as well as groups of individuals were allowed to raise funds to establish and support wide variety of enterprises including joint ventures with foreign firms relatively free of assistance or control from central authorities over the past several years town and village enterprises tves and urban collectives which are generally owned by local governments have been one of the most dynamic sources of chinese economic growth5 the relative success of these ventures has been attributed to the fact that though government financed they are essentially run like private businesseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30519crs5 6 such enterprises existed prior to 1979 however they were not allowed to sell their products at market prices 7 initially foreign investment was permitted only in special economic zones sezs mainly located in chinas coastal regions and was limited to joint ventures in 1986 the government began to allow foreign firms to establish whollyowned enter prises in certain sectors in recent years the government has removed most geographical restrictions on foreign investment although restrictions on the scope of foreign investment are maintained in many industry and service sectors 8 australian department of foreign affairs and trade china embraces the market 1997 p 360 9 ibid p 362 10 soes continue to remain the most significant source of employment in urban areas although their importance has gradually declined from 783 in 1978 to 649 in 1995 and must compete in domestic and international markets6 local governments have strong incentives to ensure the efficient operation of such enterprises since money making firms are an important source of tax revenues and job creation while inefficient firms can drain away local financial resources restrictions on private enterprise in china have eased substantially since 1988 and the role of these enterpr ises in the economy has increased markedly see discussion below the role of ffes in chinas economy have also expanded sharply due to gradual removal of geographical and operational restrictions7 the nonstate sector is most actively involved in the consumer goods and export sectors while the state sector dominates heavy and extractive industries such as iron and steel coal mining petroleum extraction and refining as well as utilities banking tobacco processing and transportation8 while nonstate enterprises exist throughout china the most dramatic growth in the nonstate sector has occurred in the coastal regions9 soes accounted for 776 of gross industrial output in 1978 but that share fell to 649 in 1985 546 in 1990 and to 255 in 1997 the nonstate sector overtook the state sector in industrial output in 1995 accounting for 573 of total industrial output and that share rose to 745 in 1997 together tves and urban collectives constituted the largest source of industrial output in 1997 accounting for 381 of total output see table 2 the private sectors share of industrial output rose from 54 in 1990 to 179 in 1997 the share of other types of nonstate enterprises mainly ffes rose from 44 in 1990 to 184 in 1997 while the share of soe industrial output to total industrial output has fallen sharply soes have remained major source of jobs in china employment by soes rose from 745 million in 1978 to 1126 million in 1995 51 increase recent reform and restructuring of the

considerably sometimes local governments allow individuals within community to establish tve with little or direct interference from the governme nt the enterprise is run like private firm but it is technically collectively owned by the community some analysts describe tves as quasi government enterprises while others describe them as quasiprivate 12 chinese investment data for 1998 indicate that about 48 of approved fdi was for whollyowned ventures while about 51 were joint ventures 13 the chinese government in january 2000 announced it intended to conduct surveys on the private sector in china in order to develop more accurate data on its composition and sizechinas growing private sector it is difficult to measure accurately the extent of the private sector in china due to the lack of reliable chinese statistics on this sector and because of the complicated mixture of government and private involvement in the economy for example it is difficult to determine whether or which tves should be classified as private enterprises on the one hand these enterprises are generally run like private enterprises and must operate according to market principles eg without government subsidies on the other hand such enterprises are owned and controlled by local governments which often use their political influence to obtain capital for investment as well as to impose restrictions against potential competitors domestic and foreign11 some private companies in china register as tves or even soes in order to benefit from preferential government policies given to these entities and to evade discriminatory policies against private firms ffes might also fall under the private sector category since the parent company usually is private business yet while many fees in china are whollyowned venture s large number of them are joint ventures the partners of these types of ventures are mostly soes or locally owned collectives12 thus it is likely that the private sector accounts for much larger share of chinas economy than is reflected by official chinese data such as in tables 2 and 313 still even chinas official data on the private sector indicate that it is becoming an increasing important component of chinas economy the rise of the private sector in china has been the result of gradual change in attitude by the government towards the compatibility and usefulness of the private sector with chinese socialism the governments attitude toward the private sector appears to have evolved from one of prohibition to reluctant toleration and recently to active encouragement background on the rebirth and growth of the private sector in china following the communist takeover in 1949 most private firms were allowed to stay in business although they were subject to state planning and regulations in 1952 the government began series of anticapitalist campaigns that sought to under mine private entrepreneurs businesspeople were routinely condemned as counter revolutionaries and many were assessed heavy fines it is likely that such efforts were intended to make it easier for the state to take control of privatelyowned assets by 1956 the government required private firms to be jointly owned and run by the state in practice the state controlled and ran the businesses additionally the state sought to exert its control over chinas 29 million

form cooperatives collective ownership14 chinas industrial policies were essentially aimed at stamping out capitalist elements in china and establishing state control over most sectors of the economy15 as result entrepreneurship in china was held in low regard16 one of the major objectives of chinas paramount leader deng xiaoping during the initial stages of the economic reforms launched in 1979 was to revive individual businesses in urban areas in order to promote more rapid economic growth while private enterprises began to reappear in china during the early 1980s the highly negative stigma of capitalism generated in the past discouraged many individuals from starting their own businesses as result significant portion of those entering the private sector initially were exconvicts school dropouts retirees and others who had limited options for employment eventually mainstream members of society began to start their own businesses such as bike repair restaurants and beauty parlors17 prior to 1988 the private economy did not have defined legal position in china as result many private firms were registered as tves or collective enterprises in order to avoid potential interference from the central government and local governments18 in april 1988 the national peoples congress adopted an amendment to the constitution stating the state permits privately owned economic entities to exist and develop within the limits prescribed by the law the private economy is complement to the socialist public economy the state protects the legitimate rights and interest of the private economy while providing the private sector with guidance supervision and administrative regulation this represented the first time since the communist government takeover in 1949 that chinas private sector was officially awarded legal status19 the growth of the private sector was further encouraged after deng xiaopings famous southern tour of china in 1992 where he

them as coming from broad sector of society from peasants sons to managers who cut their teeth in foreign ventures to academics who are abandoning government institutes and young engineers who studied

trades transport construction and to slightly lesser extent commerce and food services and repair industries22 in 1998 about 371 of the countrys retail sales and consumer goods and 191 of industrial output were generated by the private sector23 while some large private companies exist there are 40 private firms in china having capital of over 12 million the average chinese private enterprise had

businesses in china guangdong alone accounts for about 15 of private firms in china according to one estimate in parts of chinas southern region private firms produce over 90 of the regions contributions to gdp26 increasingly private firms are becoming involved in high technology ventures due in part to the relative lack of competition from soes and the desire on the part of the central

enterprises face wide variety of problems while firms are allowed to lease property for up to 70 years private propert is not considered sacrosanct and not protected by the chinese constitution as result many private entrepreneurs do not feel safe about their wealth which may dampen their business activities28 in some instances corrupt chinese officials have forced private firms to register as soes then seized their assets as result many private entrepreneurs invest their profits overseas29 private firms often find it difficult to obtain bank loans the chinese government requires chinas state banks to provide preferential treatment to soes which as result obtained 87 of chinas bank loans in 1996 private enterprises may only get bank loans outside the official plan where they face higher interest rates around 20 than are given to soes and loan periods of just three to six months when private enterprises need more funding they must often turn to friends relatives or neighbors the interest rates in these circumstances often reach 2530 until recently most private firms have been barred from using the stock and bond markets to raise funds30 at the end of 1998 of the 745 firms listed in chinas two stock exchanges only one was genuine private company31 private firms are barred from variety of industries and services partly to avoid their competing directly with soes for

argue that chinese data on its real gdp growth is overly optimistic due in part to fabricated data provided by local governments the inability to obtain reliable economic and financial data affects the ability of firms to make efficient business decisions china maintains extens ive barriers on import trade and foreign investment while such barriers insulate many chinese firms from foreign competition they also lessen pressure to perform more efficiently import barriers raise prices for private as well as non private firms using imported inputs for production this undermines their international competiti veness in addition the central government restri cts foreign firms from investing in joint ventures with private firms recent improvements to the business climate for the private sector despite the wide variety of barriers faced by private entrepreneurs it appears that the political environment for the private sector is rapidly improving private sector growth appears to be increasingly viewed by the central government as an important facto r in maintaining healthy economic growth as well as for reforming unprofitable soes chinas soes put an increasingly heavy strain on chinas economy over half are believed to lose money and must be indirectly subsidized through the banking system while the government understands that support of unprofitable soes diverts resources away from potentially more efficient and profitable enterprises it has been reluctant to reform soes too quickly due to concerns that such reform would lead to widespread layoffs and possible political instability in september 1997 chinese president jiang zemin stated that china would take steps which if implemented would essentially privatize although referred to by the chinese as public ownership all but 1000 out of an estimated 308000 soes by cutting off most government aid and forcing them to compete on their own the plan called for the closing down of some unprofitable soes while merging others the government anticipated that such reforms would lead to layoffs for significant number of workers but expressed confidence that such individuals would be able to find

to reform and restructure the soes the government appears to be hoping that workers laid off from restructured or bankrupt plants will be able to quickly find employment in the nonst ate sector including the private sector chinese media reports indicate that the private sector is becoming increasingly important in this respect for example it was reported that during the first 11 months of 1999 the private sector absorbed 136 million workers laid off by soes38 number of recent steps have been taken by the central and local governments to promote the development of the private sector in

and raise capital through public stock offering on chinas two stock exchanges chinas accession to the wto implications for the private sector over the past several years china has been negotiating to accede to the world trade organization wto the international agency that administers multilateral trade rules part of the wto accession process involves negotiating bilateral trade agreements with major trading partners who are currently wto members including the united states until recently uschina wto talks had progressed slowly but on november 15 1999 the two sides announced that bilateral wto agreement had been reached china must reach agreements with handful of other wto members and complete negotiations with the wto working party handling its accession before the full wto can vote on its membership many observers believe china is close to wrapping up all of its negotiations and could join the wto by the end of 2000 chinas membership in the wto would require it to adhere to multilateral trade rules such as the provision of mostfavorednation or nondiscriminatory trade treatment reliance on tariffs rather than nontariff barriers when it is deemed necessary to protect domestic producers adherence to tariff rates at fixed maximum levels national treatment of foreign firms and imported products and protection of intellectual property rights the uschina bilateral trade agreement commits china upon its accession to make major cuts in tariffs on agricultural and industry products provide full trading and distribution rights for us firms in china remove quotas and other quantita tive restrictions eliminate unscientifically based sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions end export subsidies on agricultural products open service sectors many of which are currently closed to foreign firms such as distribution valueadded telecommunications insurance banking securities and professional services eliminate various import restrictions and requirements and require soes to make purchases and sales on commercial basishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30519crs15 46 ustr charlene barshefsky stated that the strengthening of the rule of law in china was the most important achievement of the uschina wto trade agreement see ustr press release november 15 1999china s accession to the wto could result in significant changes to chinas economic and trade regimes many of which are likely to benefit the private sector in china the removal of trade and investment barriers would expose greater share of chinas economy to international competition while some chinese firms could be negatively affected by such competition many more stand to gain from the expansion of free market forces for example competition from foreign banks could force china to substantially reform its banking system and financial practices compelling them to cut off loans to unprofitable soes and redirecting them towards more profitabl ventures additionally competition from foreign banks might force china to permit the growth of privatelyowned financial institutions these measures could substantially improve the ability of the private sector in china to obtain lowcos t financing reducing tariff and nontariff trade barriers would lower the cost of imports used as inputs for production while lowering barriers on services would likely improve efficiency and lower costs of services in china these measure could help boost the international competitiveness of many chinese firms wto rules require its members to maintain transparent consistent and nondiscriminatory trade rules should china be admitted to the wto it would be required to bring its trade regime in line with wto rules many analysts contend that chinas wto membership would encourage it to enact new laws on business intellectual property rights and property ownership rights as well as to develop an independent judicial system to enforce such laws advancing the rule of law in china would create more stable environment for chinese businesses to operate in and could weaken the ability of corrupt government officials to extort bribes from private businesses or use their influence to provide special treatment to businesses they own or control46 upon its accession to the wto china would have to give chinese private firms the same benefits and rights given to foreign firms such as trade and distribution rights and the ability to invest in certain sectors failure to do so would put chinese firms at an extreme disadvantage in competing with foreign firms in china liberalization of chinese trade and investment rules would expand the ability of foreign investors to choose their own chinese partners for joint ventures foreign firms would longer be forced to join up with government owned

and firms deemed to be the most dynamic and efficient under the uschina wto agreement china agreed that its soes would make purchases and sales based on commercial considerations and give us firms the opportunity to compete for sales on non discriminatory basis in addition soes would be subject to wto rules on subsidies and countervailing measures these measure would force the chinese government to end many preferential policies it now gives to the soes and hence could help create more level playing field for chinese private firms some analysts believe that chinas willingness to undertake reforms necessary for wto membership represents substantial change in chinese economic policy for example edward s steinfeld in september 1999 current history article wrote since the late 1970s chinese policymakers had attempted to tweak the socialist system by gradually introducing market forces the basic idea was to preserve the economys socialist corestate firms and banksby introducing change along the margins these incremental measures over time saw markets established state planning effectively eliminated prices liberalized and nonstateowned industry allowed to prosper but the underlying logic remained constant reforms would be introduced but always as part of an overriding effort to preserve the traditional core of the economy the concessions of 1999 represented thorough reversal of course instead of reform serving to sustain the core the core itself would be destroyed to save reform along with the growth prosperity and stability that reform has brought to china in the new view instead of using market forces to save state socialism state socialism itself would have to be sacrificed to preserve the market economy47 according to this view chinas membership in the wto will require it to essentially privatize substantial portion of its economy not only to be in compliance with wto rules but to be able to compete internationally such development it is argued would likely benefit us firms doing business in china namely through the development of the rule of law in china the reduction of government control over various sectors of the chinese economy and enhanced opportunities to develop partnerships with chinese private firms and entrepreneurs it is further argued that vibrant and growing chinese private sector will enhance economic opportunities living standards and economic freedom for the average chinese citizen which could help promote greater openness and freedom in china48 other analysts are not as optimistic over chinas entry into the wto they argue that based on chinas past record on implementing trade agreements with the united states which they view as poor china cannot be trusted to implement itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30519crs17 49 mastel greg enter china washington post january 2 2000 p a15 50 such analysts also justify this position on repeated statements by the chinese government that under socialist market economy the government permits various types of ownership but maintains control over key economic sectors and sets overall economic policies based on this ideology it is argued china would never allow the private sector to become dominant force in chinas economy 51 the asian wall street journal october 25 1999 p s14 52 soe reform has become critical centerpiece in the chinese governments efforts to reform the economy in order to ensure longterm economic growth nearly half of chinas 300000 soes lose money and must be subsidized through chinas bankin g system without such assistance many soes would go bankrupt however large portion of state bank loans to the soes are not repaid which threatens the financial solvency of the banking system many analysts argue that chinas banking system can only be reformed if the banks are allowed to cut ties to unprofitable soes and this can only be accomplished if the soes are first reformed and restructured in order to reform the soes the government must ensure that laidoff workers can find jobs in other sectors of the economywto commitments once it becomes member especially if trade reforms cause widespread bankruptcies and layoffs as some predict49 in addition many analysts doubt whether china would allow private firms to operate freely in sectors dominated by soes due to concerns that to do so would force many soes out of business50 finally some analysts argue that significant economic reforms in china cannot be made until political reforms are first implemented notes john seel vice president at morgan stanley dean witter in hong kong it is becoming clearer that its hard to have real economic liberalization without at least some political liberalizationfixing the banks gets even harder without the ability to speak out about the misallocation of their resources and fixing the state sector is harder unless you have private sector big enough and secure enough to stand up and criticize the gover nment for pumping so much money into state dinosaurs51 conclusion china has substantially expanded the role of the private sector over the past several years to large extent the chinese government appears to have gotten around the ideological problems of promoting capit alism first by describing the private sector as complimentary feature of socialist market economy then describing it as an important component this represents pragmatic approach to economic policymaking the private sector has become an ever increasingly important source of economic growth and productivity and has proven to be critical source of employment in recent years without growing and dynamic private sector to absorb displaced workers soe reform would likely prove politically destabilizing52 it is not yet clear however whether the chinese government is ready ideologically or as practical matter to allow the private sector to operate on level playing field with the state sector let alone to become the dominant force in chinas economy for example will the government tolerate the development of large privatelyowned corporations what will the governments response be when private firms begin to compete more and more with soes and possibly drive some of themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30519crs18 53 fang xinghai problems with chinas development strategy the world bank group august 1998 p1

government allow private firms to freely sell stock in chinas stock markets will the government allow individuals to buy own and sell private property finally will the government establish transparent regulatory business environment eg one that is relatively free of government graft and corruption that will enable firms to compete fairly and freely many analysts contend that the growth and development of the private sector is critical to chinas continued economic growth and ability to compete in international markets for example dr xinghai fang formerly an economist with the world bank notes that despite 21 years of reform and rapid economic growth china has produced few internationally competitive privatelyowned firms fang states i believe that the biggest difficulty that will confront the chinese economy in the near future is that internationally competitive private firms may not emerge in china for long time to come and that it will stunt chinas economic growth53 fang believes that chinas leaders while accepting the need for vibrant private sector still believe that state owned companies should play the major role in chinas development and have locked out private firms from participating in major sectors of the chinese economy thus preventing them from developin g largescale operations fang states that this strategy is severely flawed some peopl may believe that china can become an industrialized economy by properly restructuring and growing its huge number of stateowned companies this belief is certainly wrong countries may manage few stateowned companies well and make them internationally competitive such examples include singapore and france but country can run thousands and in chinas case tens of thousands of stateowned companies well54 it is difficu lt to determine what role the private sector will play in the development of chinas economy in the near and distant future premier zhu rongjis march 5 2000 economic report to the third session of the ninth national peoples congress npc barely mentioned the private sector other than to state while keeping the public sector of the economy in the dominant position sound development of the nonpublic sector including selfemployed and private businesses should be encouraged instead the reports main focus was on the modernization of soes in preparation for chinas wto accession55 however during the npc session 30 npc representatives submitted proposal that would give chinas private sector access to chinas telecommunications market prior to chinas entry into the wto while the measure was not adopted by the npc premier zhu during march 16 2000 press conference stated that there is problem and difficulty concerning allowing private businesses to take part in the telecom industry we have already promised to allow overseas private investment to take part in chinas telecomhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30519crs19 56 zhu rongji press conference march 16 2000 p 5industry why should we shut the door on our own private business people this is not logical56 it appears that chinas accession to the wto will likely create substantial new opportunities for chinese firms especially in sectors that are being liberalized as part of that accession and that the chinese government will continue to promote the development of the private sector to in order to provide jobs for workers laid off by soe restructuring and reform however it appears that central governments current main economic priority is to make soes profitable and internationally competitive especially in preparation for chinas wto membe rship thus it is likely that the chines government in the short run will continue to maintain many policies that give preferential treatment to soes however should the soes prove unable to meet foreign competition and are forced into bankruptcy the chinese government will likely have two options 1 violate its wto commitments by reimposing protective trade and investment barriers or 2 privatize most or all of the soes the first option would do little to make soes more competitive and would likely result in the imposition of trade sanctions against chinese products by other wto members the second option while likely boosting economic efficiency might prove difficult option to swallow based on current government ideology on what constitute s socialist market economy unless chinese leaders were willing to draw upon an old chinese saying attributed to deng xiaoping it doesnt matter if the cat is black or white so long as it catches mice
