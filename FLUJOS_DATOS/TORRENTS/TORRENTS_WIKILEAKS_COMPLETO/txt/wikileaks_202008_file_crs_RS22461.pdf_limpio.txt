2006 the nation was reminde d of the dangers of underground mining as 12 miners died in an explosion and fire in the sago mine in west virginia subsequently the mine safety and health administration msha issued new regulations congress has passed the first major revision of the mine safety law since 1977 nd has taken further bills under consideration and state legislatures in west virginia kentucky and illi nois have tightened their own laws these responses have emphasized factors thought to have played part in the sago tragedy including emergency oxygen supplies tracking and communication systems and deployment of rescue teams there have also been propos als to increase the penalties for violations of safety standards this report reviews the safety and health record of

for an overview of safety trends see ramani raja and jan mutmansky mine health and safety at the turn of the millennium mining engineering sept 1999 pp 2530the record past and present injuries safety in the coal industry has undergone steady trend of improvement since 1925 an era when hundreds of miners could be lost in single incident in that year there were total of 2518 fatalities in accidents wh ereas the number has since fallen almost continually down to 22 in 2005 some of this trend is explained by decrease in coal industry employment from 749000 in 1925 to 110000 currently and other structural changes in the industry but much of it by real safety improvement1 thus the overall annual fatality rate decreased over the period from 336 per thousand workers to 020 per thousand nevertheless mining of coal nd other minerals remains one of the most dangerous sectors in which to work with its fatality rate being more than seven times the average for all private industry and exceedin g that of many indus tries generally thought to be dangerous such as construction and truc king in terms of more ordinary accidents nonfatal mining is not far from the allindustry average and indeed there is less variation overall among these industry groups in what follows the concentration is on fatal accidents statistically most of the 76 per year re duction in fatalities per ton the average rate of improvement over the period 1980 to 2004 can be attributed to productivity ie fewer workers on the job most of the rest coming from reduction in fatalities per actual worker some is also attributable to an ongoing shift from underground to surface mining in truth what lies behind all thes factors is mechanization new machinery such as longwall systems have not only redu ced the total number of workers needed but done so especially at the most dangerous spots eg the active cutting face other measures which have prevented many largescale accidents include controlling coal dust monitoring methane gas which is both ex plosive and poisonous adequately supporting roofs and avoiding sp arkproducing equipment2 it would be very difficult to determine conclusively how much of the progress in safety has been due to msha although th most important safety measures are found in msha standards it could be argued th at many mines would have adopted them without that inducement and indeed safety had been increasing for long time before mshas founding be that as it may all parties involved agree that there is still room for improvement but they disagree on the specifi c course to be followed the united mine workers union has often contended that ms has not been sufficiently active it contends that there are not enough inspector s and that penalties both as proposed and as negotiated are not large enough in gene ral the union would make enforcement of standards the highest priority the minin g industry generally supports mshas existing regulatory approach although it has urged that inspections be focused on mines where problems are evident rather than regularly spread among all mines as currently requiredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22461crs3 3 notably the 435000 in

have highlighted specific areas that may merit further attention the flooding of th quecreek mine in pennsylvania in july 2002 raised questions about the accuracy of unde rground mine maps and their availability to operators of nearby mines the quecreek accident might have been avoided if the mine operator had access to the final map of near by abandoned mine that had since filled with water in response 10 million was appr opriated to msha i n labor department appropriations for fy2003 for collection nd digitization of abandoned mine maps and new technologies for detectin g underground voids in response to the jim walter 5 mine accident in alabama in september 2001 which took 13 lives msha made number of changes including new standa rd on mine emergency response the mine workers union alleges that msha had not followed up properly on numerous previous violations at the site3 the sago explosion caused by lightning that penetrated underground and set off methane explosion killed only one miner initially sixteen miners escaped 12 survived the explosion but were trapped and succu mbed ultimately to carbon monoxide from the ensuing fire the episode raised number of issues it has been suggested that communication and tracking devices currently available might have enabled the trapped miners to escape or find better refuge or rescuers to reach them more quickly emergency breathing apparatus issued to the miners were rated for only one hour and reportedly number of them did not work well also there has been criticism of the fact that it took 11 hours from the explosion until rescuers entered the mine4 ironically though one of the lessons learned from the jim walter case may have compounded the problems at sago because most of the vic tims in the former incident were responding to relatively small explosion when larger one occurred considerable time was taken at sago to verify the state of the mine atmo sphere before rescue crews were sent in illnesses accidental injuries can be quantified much more reliably than the extent of occupationally caused disease it is clear though that coal mining is causing disability much more by way of longlatency disease than by traumatic injury prime among these diseases is black lung coal workers pne umoconiosis cwp which still claims about 1000 fatalities per year down by about half since 19905 the deaths tend to occur after long progressi on so that only about one year of life expectancy is lost on average for these cases however this is usually preced ed by many years of impaired breathing and debilitating weakness as well as many more cases not count ed as fatalities ending with death by other causes as of 2002 the late st year tabulated there were 16000 cases on the rolls of the black lung progra m ie deemed totally disabledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22461crs4 6 worlds report ibid interestingly sharp drops in rates occurred at certain times for 2529 year workers the rate fell from 202 in the 19871991 survey to 54 in 1992 1996 the former cohort began their careers around 1962 the latte r around 1967 under the 1969 coal act tighter dust standards were phased in from 1970 to 1973 7 the emergency

construction workersimproved dust control require ments have led to decrease in prevalence of the disease since the 1970s among miners w ith 2024 years of work experience for example the proportion of examined mine rs who had positive xrays decreased from 232 in the mid1970s to 22 in the late 1990s6 while this is great improvement there is still dispute about whether the cu rrent dust limits should be lowered as well as questions about the degree of complian ce by mine operators with current limits regulatory regime the mine safety and health administration msha is charged with overseeing the safety of coal and other mining industr ies mshas budget of 278 million fy2006 is somewhat less than the 472 million of its sist er agency the occupational safety and health administration osha but osha is responsible for protecting far larger number of workers7 msha oversees mining industry including surface operations and all other minerals besides co of about 200000 workers whereas osha is responsible for most of the rest of the economy thus while osha must target its inspections mostly on firms with the worst accident records in few sectors notably manufacturing and construction msha is able to cover its whole industry i ndeed it is mandated to inspect each underground mine at least four times year and each surface mine twice in addition to financial penalties nd in contrast to osha ms has direct authority to immediately shut down dangerous operations substantively the regulations promul gated by msha cover wide range of equipment procedures certifications and tr aining including methane monitoring dust control ventilation noise electrical equipment diesel engines explosives fire protection roof support hoists and haulage ma ps communications and emergencies8 in the wake of the sago accident the agency was criticized by many for its slow pace of rulemaking in recent years allegedl dropping 18 proposed standards that had been pending as of january 20019 the administration has said that it was pursuing revised agenda10 and that it was being more frank by l onger listing longterm projects that had not been making much progress since the outset of 2006

and prompt notice of emergencies requests for information nd proposals were issued for communications and tracking technologies rescue chambers and rescue teams msha indicated it will revise its penalty ssessment formula and has asked the congress for an increase in the authorized maximum from 60000 to 250000 on the matter of preventing black lung and silicosis msha is expressly required by its authorizing statute to enforce dust control standard the limit is currently set by regulation at 2 milligramscubic meter as an eighthour average for each miner in the active workings of each mine althoug h niosh has recommended limit of 1 mg11 besides the limit itself there has been continual controversy bout how concentrations are to be measured in the mines and how msha will monitor operators plans and performance in july 2000 msha proposed new regulations superceded by revised proposals in march 2003 under which its inspectors would verify plans and performance by directly collecting single fullshift samples rather than the previous practice of multiple samples re trieved by the operators th is proceeding was suspended on june 24 2003 in favor of the development of

step to be followed by mo re measures for example as compared with s 2803 hr 5389 george miller rahall et s 2798 kennedy et would feature additional specific safety measures including continuous monitoring of the mine atmosphere refuges stocked with five days of supplies these measures to be enforced by withdrawal order if found to be lacking and lower limit on dust concentrations more stringent requirements for rescue teams eg that they must be composed exclusively in larger mines of mine employees and be immediately available for deployment public hearings and family involvement in accident investigations which are to be conducted inde pendently of msha if so requested by miners union or majority of affected family members stricter penalties eg 1 million penalty and
