changes which firms have implemented in recent years to improve their competitiveness have substantially affected the skill requirements of jobs the upgrading of skill requirements has in turn prompted congress to spur employerprovided training of incumbent ie employed workers through the workforce investment act and the american competitiveness and workforce improvement act this represents marked departure from the typical populations served by government training resources in this report what is known about the intensity content and incidence of companies human capital investments is explored along with the distribution of employersponsored training by business and employee characteristics then the impact on employees and employers of postschool skill acquisition is analyzed the report also examines whether employersupported training of incumbent workers is underprovided and the policy implications for congress this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30546employerprovided training summary the consensus is that the importance of skilled workforce to the economic performance of nations firms and employees has increased in recent years to compete in todays fastpaced global marketplace companies have strived to increase the efficiency of their operations through heightened utilization of technological and other workplace innovations it is widely thought that these changes have substantial ly affected the skill requirements of jobs the upgrading of job skill requirements has in turn prompted congress to spur employerprovided training of incumbent ie employed workers through the workforce investment act pl 105 220 and the american competitiveness and workforce improvement act pl 105 277 title iv this represents marked departure from the typical populations served by government training resources ie lowincome and dislocated workers employerprovided educationtraining lacks clear definition it may be tailored to the needs of given firm ie specific training or impart skills that are useful across firms ie general training training may be informal eg watching or asking others or formal eg attending onsite classes or vocational schools these and other variations can differentially affect the costs and benefits of incumbent worker training the latest available estimates which are for the mid1990s suggest that companies expenditures on formal training ranged between 42 billion and 52 billion in terms of benefits employersupported training raises employees wages or improves their job stability and increases productivity or decreases turnover at firms it appears that case can be made for government to promote general transferable skills training because firms could well underinvest in this activity however as much remains unknown about which kinds of firmsupported training are most effective and how much formal and informal training already is being provided policymakers seeking to stimulate the training of incumbent workers may want to tread warily in this new area the possibility of formal training subsidy prompting firms to substitute federal monies for their own or substituting formal for unsubsidized informal training rather than increase the total quantity of training also implies the need for caution and while the currently low unemployment rate may have contributed to policymakers focus on skill development for individuals who already have jobs incumbent workers are virtually guaranteed some degree of employer provided training in contrast unemployed persons have only their own presumably scanty resources and traditionally federal training funds to draw upon to learn new or upgrade existing skills to date it appears that congress has carefully entered the field of incumben t worker training by devoting relatively small sums to this purpose less than 80 million since 1999 including matching requirements in some instances and by prohibiting the use of government resources for training that companies would have undertaken anyway the recency of the grants awarded to stimulate employer provided training makes it unlikely that evaluations will be available shortly to shed light on the federal initiative however httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30546contents what is employerprovided training 3 the intensity content and incidence of training 5

expenditures that increase the resources embodied in people through the expansion of peoples knowledge and skills human capital investments raise productivity and income in future years1 knowledge and skill formation contribute to nations economic performance to the extent that income growth per capita is caused by increases in land and physical capital per worker the future rate of growth will slow because additional assets result in diminishing returns however the development and application of peoples scientific and technical knowledge enable economic growth to continue by raising the productivity of labor and other factors used in the production of goods and services2 the adoption adaptation and diffusion of technological and other workplace innovations in turn rely on nations having welleducated and well trained labor force3 the consensus is that the importance of knowledgeable flexible workforce to the economic performance of nations and firms has increased in recent decades the industrial age was marked by incremental changes which had minimal impact on the skill requirements of most jobs to compete in the fastpaced global marketplace of the postindustrial age firms have strived to increase the efficiency of their operations through heightened utilization of computer technology reconfiguration of the corporate structure and reorganization of production processes these quantum changes in the way business now is being conducted are widely thought to have substantially affected the skill requirements of jobs for example factory workers today might be required to operate sophisticated computerized equipment or to participate in problemsolving teams firms sometimes have found that they first must overcome deficiencies in these workers basic employability eg computation and communication skills which previously had not been much in demand before providing them with the specific skills necessary for implementation of workplace

highest year of schooling completed by linda levine 6 the increased return to education since the 1970s has prompted speculation that the distribution of training may have contributed to the growth in wage inequality according to jill constantine and david neumark training and the growth of wage inequality industrial relations v 35 4 october 1996 the increased incidence of training among more educated workers was not large enough to have substantially affected the wage structure 7 us department of labor involving employers in training literature review research and evaluation report series 97k washington dc 1997 p 13 8 in this report the terms incumbent or employed worker and employee are used interchangeably as are the terms business company employer and firmthe accumulation of knowledge and skills has come to play more important role in the labor market prospects of workers as well the premium employers pay to workers with greater educational attainment has increased considerably in the past 2 decades men women with bachelors degrees went from earning 50 41 more than men women with high school diplomas in 1979 to 92 76 more in 19985 as consequence of this trend some policymakers are interested in upgrading workers skills not only for efficiency but also for equity reasons it is hoped that additional training will mitigate the growth in wage inequality which began in the 1970s6 although educational attainment is an oftenused proxy for skill level the nature of recent workplace changes may have sped the rate at which formal education becomes obsolete observers thus assert that postschool skill acquisition is now of greater importance to adult workers who want to remain employable or to improve their earnings demographic changes are believed to bolster the case for lifelong learning as well the aging of the labor force means that for growing numbers of workers the period of formal schooling has long since passed and the increasing share of minorities who on average experience lower high school completion rates lower educational attainment scores and greater literacy problems means more workers could be unprepared for the labor markets faster growing higher paying jobs7 investments in the nations human resources are made when students attend secondary or postsec ondary educational institutions unemployed workers enter governmentsponsored training programs and when employees participate in work based learning activities this report focuses on the latter that is on the training investments firms make in incumben t workers who longer are attending school fulltime8 although nearly all of the governments training resources remain focused on lowincome or dislocated workers congress has shown increased interest since the late 1990s in expanding the amount of training that firms provide to their current employees passed in august 1998 the workforce investment act wia pl 105httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30546crs3 9 the meaning of incumbent worker training varies somewhat one solicitation for grant applications for an incumbent worker demonstration program stated that while in general the term incumbent worker training may be used to denote any existing efforts on the part of employers to provide training to currentlyemployed workers in order to help keep these employees employed the term will be used in the solicitation to describe efforts to keep firms and workers competitive by keeping workers employed averting layoffs upgrading workers skills increasing wages earned by employees and improving employees employability in the fy2001 budget request incumbent worker training not only is invoked as means of averting layoffsplant closings due to trade or technological innovations but also as synonym for lifelong learning that enables firms to build career ladders for their employees 10 basic skills or workplace literacy instruction focuses on developing reading and writing english math

competitive grant program would focus on demonstrating innovative approaches to trainingskill upgrading among nonmanagement incumbent workers9 what is employerprovided training the complexity of the activities that comprise firmsponsored educationtraining makes this question difficult to answer it is complicated subject to study for the following reasons to begin with it lacks clear definition training may be tailored to meet business particular needs but it also may impart knowledge that would be useful to employees regardless of their place of employment employers may require participation in postschool skill development or employees may voluntarily undertake it employmentbased programs may be of shorter duration and have more remedial focus10 or more occupational focus than school based programs that confer formal academic credentials alternatively some corporate educational programs grant degrees perhaps the only common feature is the involvement of the firm in some manner with the postschool knowledge acquisition of itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30546crs4 11 businesses generally may expense training investments ie account for them immediately rather than amortize them over time these investments include compensation of inhouse trainers compensation of trainees including educational assistance benefits and payments to outside training providers 12 firms do not keep good or standardized data on their training expenditures when asked to estimate the amount spent on training some firms will estimate their actual program costs while others will compute program costs plus the costs of the employees time spent in the continuedemployees the nature of employer involvement in training provision financial and otherwise varies companies may themselves develop and have inhouse personnel lead training programs or they may pay others to perform all or part of the training function at the same time they may subsidize their employees skill formation through paid timeoff from work or through tuition reimbursements the manner of government involvemen t in employersponsored training also varies firms themselves may be eligible for financial support from state governments that provide training grants or tax credits as part of their economic development efforts for example they also may be eligible for assistance through wia which permits federal funds to be spent for the first time on the training of employed persons where public announcement of closing has been made in addition forprofit firms generally may deduct training expenses when calculating their federal income tax liabilities11 the subject is further complicated because company investments in incumbent workers are of different types are delivered in various ways and are of wideranging content employersponsored education and training is informal eg an experienced employee showing newhire how to perform task or formal eg an employee attending class or seminar while informal training typically occurs at the workplace formal training may take place there or offsite eg at community college or commercial trade school in the case of onsite formal training class may be led by an instructor located at the firm or broadcast via satellite alternatively employees may learn from interactive multimedia technologies and the content of the training may relate to the performance of particular jobs eg management skills training or it may have broader applicability eg interpersonal skills training differences in such variables as the type location delivery mode and content of training could well have disparate effects on the earnings and productivity of incumbent workers two commonly used outcome measureslastly employersu pported education and training is neither transparent nor centralized rather it is an amalgam of not readily observable actions being undertaken largely on an independent basis by billions of employers other training providers and employees the lack of uniform accounting method for business investments in its employees has hampered the collection of highquality data12 moreover information needs to

class of 1972 and the current populat ion survey training supplements 1983 and 1991 which query individuals or households yield much lower incidences of informal training than the surveys of the small business administration and the employment opportunity pilot projects which query continuedobtained from two groups ie employers and employees in order to have comprehensive statistics on formal and informal training but evidence suggests that the parties sometimes provide different responses to survey questions13 thus despite widespread agreement on the importance of employmentoriented skill development among incumbent workers who longer are fulltime students large gaps remain in our understanding of the issue the sections below set forth what we know first examining the intensity content and incidence of companies human capital investments then the distribution of training by business and employee characteristics is explored next the impact on employees and employers of postschool skill acquisition is analyzed the report closes with an examination of whether employersponsored training of incumbent workers is underprovided and the policy implications for congress the intensity content and incidence of training it is difficult to measure accurately the cost of and time involved in employer provided training as well as its content and prevalence because much of it occurs informally ie learning by doing watching or by talking with others formal training ie learning by attending planned activity with defined agenda that is conducted in structured setting at least has clear start and finish which should make it easier to measure the cost of the activity14 the employees hourly compensation must be multiplied by the time spent in training to derive the opportunity cost of training to employers ie value of the output forgone while employees are being trained because it is difficult to determine how much time is spent learning informally cost information usually is limited to formal training it also is problematic to ascertain the incidence of informal training because employees may not readily recall these activities or not regard them eg getting advice from co workers as training per 15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30546crs6 15 continued employers this discrepancy suggests that workers may not remember informal training very well or they may not consider

results from the 1995 survey of employerprovided training monthly labor review june 1998trends in training costs annual approximations of formal training expenditures for the 1980s generally cluster between 12 billion and 30 billion16 the american society for training and development astd produced more recent estimate by combining data from the us bureau of labor statistics survey of employerprovided training the national household education survey and the astd benchmarking forum in 1995 firms in the private sector incurred 252 billion in direct costs and 271 billion in indirect costs related to formal training for total of 523 billion17 in contrast survey data from the us bureau of labor statistics bls show that during 1994 employers spent about 166 billion on selected direct costs of formal training18 and between may and october 1995 employers payments for selected indirect costs of formal training ie trainees wages and salaries were about 128 billion19 thus for an entire year in the mid1990s the cost of formal training was about 422 billion for the mid1990s then the latest available estimates suggest that companies expenditures on formal training ranged between 42 billion and 52 billion employers appear to have increased their commitment to the formal training of incumbent workers in recent years according to bls survey of employers in the private nonfarm sector with at least 50 employees on their payrolls 692 raised their expenditures on formal training during the early 1990s while just 52 lowered themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30546crs7 20 us bureau of

significant that any businesses teach employability skills because such training covers the very basic types of skills that public education is intended to provide29 the incidence of training informal com pared to formal almost all incumbent workers at private nonfarm establishments with 50 or more employees in the mid1990s had received informal training while with their current employers 958 formal training was less prevalent with 844 of incumbent workers having participated30 results from other sources similarly show that the incidence of informal training greatly surpasses that of formal training 1992 us small business administration sba survey of private nonfarm employers found that just 69 of newly hired employees received offsite formal training and 205 received onsite

sample of both small and large establishments were surveyedor supervisors 605 from coworkers and 645 from watching others among other things the lower incidence of formal training in the sba compared to the bls survey suggests that employers are less likely to provide training that entails substantial outlays eg on tuition or transportation to newhires than to employees with longer tenure who

direct costs of formal training as the wages and salaries of inhouse trainers payments to outside trainers tuition reimbursements and contributions to outside training funds32 in contrast smaller firms especially utilize informal training at employers with 5099 workers employees reported that they averaged 319 hours of informal training in mayoctober 1995 or almost 4 times the amount of formal training see table 1 at establishments with 100499 employees the 345 hours of informal training per employee was little more than 2½ times the amount of formal training and at companies with 500 or more employees the 260 hours of informal training was an even smaller multiple of formal training as shown in table 1 informal training accounted for about twothirds 242 billion of employers spending on the wages and salaries of participants in both formal and informal training 371 billion during 6month period in 1995 while smaller firms expenditures for both informal and formal training were less than those of larger firms the gap was widest for formal training this again indicates the considerable use of informal training among smaller firms the distribution of training the surveys from which the following findings were derived differ in number of respects and for that reason among others their results sometimes disagree different populations are surveyed eg employers as opposed to employees all establishments versus only those with at least 50 employees or nationally representative sample in contrast to one that disproportionately includes lowwage firms or is confined to young adults questions are phrased in varying ways eg how long does it typically take an employee to become fully trained and qualified for particular job versus the length of training that an employee actually engaged in and the time period referred to differs eg training undertaken while at the current employer or within the first 3 months on the job nonetheless there are several points on which the empirical literature agree who provides training it is wellestablished that larger firms more often provide training particularly formal training than smaller firms33 the positive relationship between formal traininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30546crs11 33 continued informal training is much narrower with 97 of firms employing at least 20 employees offering informal training versus 96 of

training who gets it and what are its effects research in labor economics v 13 1992 hereafter cited as lillard and tan private sector training who gets it and what are its effects and firm size even after other variables are taken into account may be due to larger companies enjoying economies of scale put another way upfront expenses could be less of barrier to training for larger firms because they have more employees across which to spread those costs that are little changed as the number of trainees increases eg the cost of course development or the salary of an inhouse instructor perhaps for the same reason small employers that are part of multi establishment firms are more likely to provide formal training that is to say multi establishment businesses could spread fixed training expenses over large number of plantsoffices and thereby keep down their smaller locations human capital costs another interpretation of the direct relationship between training and firm size is that smaller firms may be more fearful of employees being hired away by competitors moreover the production losses incurred when an employee participates in formal training program held offsite may be greater at smaller firms34 similarly larger firms may find it easier to freeup coworkers to informally train others without experiencing substantial output losses35 firms that experience comparatively high employee turnover tend to less often sponsor training training also is diminished at companies that are more sensitive to downturns in the business cycle or that are in areas with persistently high unemployment potential explanation for the inverse relationship between training and these three variables employee turnover volatile product demand and high unemployment is that employers are reluctant to invest in employees when they know chances are great that the worker will be laid off or quit before the cost of their investment can be recouped36 in contrast industries that experience rapid technological change are more likely to provide formal onthejob training to their incumbent workers generally and to do so for larger share of their employees by implication technological change may make knowledge and skills obsolete thereby promoting greater company training but because the training gap between more and less educated is estimated to narrow at firms experiencing rapid technological change it appears that the general skills of highly educated workers may enable them to adjust to new innovations with lesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30546crs12 37 bartel ann p and machum

than is needed by workers with fewer years of schooling37 other organizational transformations have been found to have similar effects on employer provided training for example firms that have implemented innovative workplace practices eg requiring employees to exercise responsibility for quality control or for problem solving not only exhibit greater probability of offering formal training but also are more likely to train greater share of their workforces the same findings hold all else being equal for businesses that are relatively capitalintensive and have comparatively welleducated workforces employersupported training thus seems to complement rather than substitute for investments in physical and human capital which suggests that concerns about businesses replacing highskilled workers with new technologies or lowskilled workers may not be wellfounded38 compan ies that try to actively maintain longterm relationship with their employees appear to sponsor more training as well according to one empirical analysis the hours of formal training are greater at establishments that offer more benefits eg employee assistance plans employerfinanced child care health insurance pensions or paid family leave and that have more innovative workplace practices eg pay for knowledge job redesign or rotation quality circles or teams39 another study similarly found that offthejob

younger than older men the effect of race on training is not apparent among women or among lowincome workers according to one analysis it also concluded that economically disadvantaged workers regardless of race are less likely to get postschool training43 studies have come to mixed conclusions about the impact of gender on training receipt in part because they have measured different things eg the intensity as opposed to the incidence of training or have disaggregated the data in different ways eg all women as opposed to women by race or marital status although some studies estimate that men and women spend about the same amount of time in training one determined that women were more likely to fill positions that require less training44 the latter finding may result from differences in job turnover by sex reflection of the weaker attachment to the labor market of women generally and of married women especially or from discrimination45 while there may or may not be much of gender gap in the overall incidence of training the sources of training do seem to vary by sex even after controlling for other variables young men are more likely to participate in company training and in apprenticeships and young women in offsite or offthejob training eg vocational schools or seminars outside of work46 agreement is widespread in the economic literature that the probability of training receipt rises with employee tenure consequently those employees who accumulate little tenure with firm because they change jobs often or enterexit the labor force frequently are less likely to be offered training at some point in the seniority or age spectrum however training tapers off this probably is in part because the payoff period for the firms investment shortens there are several reasons why firms might want to delay offering training to recently hired workers although doing so means that they forgo the return to training that would have occurred during the

after they have become acclimated to their job and to the work environment companies also might delay training until they determine who are the likely candidates for promotion and then concentrate

increase labor productivity and to decrease costly employee turnover returns to employees earnings and earnings growth empirical studies unanimously confirm major tenet of human capital theory which is that training plays an important role in wage determination48 trained workers earn higher wages and their wages rise more rapidly than those of comparable employees according to numerous nonexperimental analyses49 the timing and size of the payoff to training could vary with the kind of training specific training defined as the development of skills that enhance the productivity of worker only at the firm that offers it likely provides fairly immediate return to the worker examples of specific human capital are knowledge of the personnel policies or organization of work processes at particular employer general training defined as the development of skills that enhance the productivity of worker at many employers may provide somewhat delayed return examples of general human capital are the knowledge of computer software or automotive repair general skills development also may have larger payoff because of its greater portability across firms in other words

earnings and earnings growth of different kinds of formal training but very few surveys explicitly inquire whether training is specific or general they instead may ask about the source of the training with some sources eg the company thought to offer training with greater specific content than others eg vocationaltechnical school their results discussed below are sometimes contradictory or inconclusive one analysis found that participation in formal company training and attendance at offthejob seminars which may impart specific or general skills were positively related to wage levels51 participation in company training improved the wage growth of men and women attendance at seminars did so for men only the rate of earnings gains also was estimated to be directly related to the length of vocationaltechnical training but unrelated to its incidence this suggests that in the case of vocational training what is important to producing return on investment is not just participating in the program but actually completing it notably proprietary institutions other than vocationaltechnical schools eg correspondence courses and business schools did not appear to raise workers earnings growth at least not within the 4year period under study52 not only was formal company training estimated to have significant positive impact on earnings growth in another study but so too were apprenticeships and correspondence schools in addition business and vocationaltechnical school training as well as apprenticeships appear to have delayed impact on earnings gains these findings seemingly contradict those described in the preceding paragraph perhaps because the reference period of research must be longer to pick up the wage effects from certain training sources company training in contrast seems to have more immediate impact on wage growth but the impact lessens over time company training includes formal programs staffed inhouse vendor training held at the worksite but run by an outside training provider and outside seminars that employees leave the worksite to attend of the three only vendor training was found to have influence on wage growth53

companies are better than workers at choosing training that provides skills which are most jobrelevant if so government subsidies to promote incumbent worker training may be more effective at raising employees earnings if they are offered to firms rather than to individuals through for example vouchers but an alternative explanation of the smaller wage effect for employeefinanced schoolbased training is that individuals may elect to acquire skills that improve their career mobility in the future rather than skills that immediately raise wages on their current jobs55 another analysis also found that workers who undertook either formal company or offthejob training had higher wages than workers who did not the return was greater for company training and particularly for completed programs it did not seem to matter whether the company training took place while the worker was at the prior or current employer this result suggests that company training may not be synonymous with the development of specific skills rather company training appears to impart skills that are valued equally regardless of who is the employer56 other researchers similarly have concluded that because current employers reward employees for skills they acquired while at previous firms the skills largely are general and are recognized as such by other employers57 employment stability here too the issues are not only whether training benefits workers through reduced unemploym ent but also whether certain kinds of training are more effective than others at enabling workers to find and keep jobs studies have most often examined trainings effect on wages with much less analysis of trainings impact on job stability or on the other outcome variables discussed shortly in this report according to

training did not significantly effect the likelihood of unemployment58 returns to employers productivity the effect of training on labor productivity has been particularly difficult to empirically ascertain because surveys of individuals that include training questions do not also include questions about employers economic performance the dearth of information has led researchers to rely on very few employer surveys or to use subjective measures of productivity one study of manufacturers found those that implemented new formal training programs after 1983 experienced significant productivity increases during the 1983 1986 period however the extremely low response rate of surveyed establishments tempers the reliability of the analysis59 another employerbased study that used as training variable the number of workers involved in training in 1990 and 1993 did not find significant impact on productivity but the training variable itself probably contributed to the result as it did not capture the accumulated training of all workers in contrast the study also determined that the proportion of time spent in offthejob training was directly related to productivity in manufacturing establishments the researchers suggest this positive effect results from lower output losses because the training occurred outside work hours or from the advanced nature of this type of training in the nonmanufacturing sector computer skills development was found to have positive effect on productivity perhaps then the productivity effect at some establishments is due more to the content than to the incidence of training60 still other employerbased studies utilized firms subjective rating of its employees productivity the time spent in formal and informal training was estimated to be positively related to productivity growth61 in addition formal and informal company training received from previous employer were found to increase productivity offthejob training

in specific human capital binds workers to the firm that makes the investment expressed differently training that is very tailored to the needs of given firm is expected to discourage quits or layoffs that end the mutually beneficial relationship ie employees are paid higher wages and experience greater wage growth than they could get elsewhere because the training is not portable and employers enjoy productivity gains that exceed the workers wage an investment in general human capital in contrast is not expected to affect worker mobility because the transferability of general skills means that workers are equally productive and therefore can command the same wage levels and wage growth at any firm as anticipated employerprovided training reduces the probability of employee separations63 while this finding supports the idea that company training is specific another study estimated the negative effect of employerprovided training on employee turnover is quite small the magnitude of the mobility effect in addition to the economists finding that current employers reward employees for training received while at prior employers led them to surmise that much employerprovided is general64 in an analysis of workplace education programs it was found that firms which offered general training in basic skills were more likely to report improved employee retention rather than raising turnover as workers with readily portable skills leave for or are poached by other companies this research suggests that the acquisition of general skills may actually lower separations65 some policy implications summarizing the findings on the impact of training employersupported training benefits trainees through higher wages training firms through higher productivity and third parties who in this case are firms that hire employees with prior general training the existence of positive externalities benefits that spillover beyond the parties immediately involved in an activity imply that firms may not be offering an optimal quantity of training in deciding how much training to offer incumbent workers employers consider the costs and benefits of training to them that is to say they dohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30546crs19 66 bishop the impact of previous training on productivity and wages p 194 67 see for example the employment and training administrations press release on h1b technical skills training grants at httpwwwwdscorgsgaawards99019finalsumhtmnot take into account the positive or negative impact of their decision on others to the degree that having skilled workforce confers benefits that exceed the private return to the training firm employers will not offer the optimal amount of training ie training is said to be underprovided the markets seeming failure to provide sociall optimal level of training is rationale for government involvement in employersponsored training there is additional evidence which suggests that training not only generates benefits for other firms but also for society at large as previously discussed individuals with relatively more training have higher earnings and greater job security consequently they are more likely to pay higher taxes and less likely to utilize government services eg unemployment insurance or cash welfare and health benefits as it thus seems that employersupported training does produce thirdparty externalities and the market fails to offer it at socially optimal level modest governmental efforts to stimulate general ojt onthejob and employersponsored formal offthejob training would appear to be in order66 see the final section of this report for further elaboration on this point although employersponsored education and training has been found to benefit both employees and employers the research results demonstrate that very little is known about which kinds of training eg formal versus informal training or formal onthejob versus offthejob training are most effective for employees and firms overall or for different kinds of employees eg minorities or lowwage workers and firms eg small employers accordingly policymakers seeking to stimulate incumbent worker training may not want to be too prescriptive about its content delivery mode or target population for equity ie distributional reasons however congress may want to focus training resources on less educated employees whose relative disadvan tage upon entering the labor force is exacerbated by the current pattern of employerprovided formal training indeed demonstration programs under wia or its predecessor the job training partnership act and under acwia that focus on dislocated worker incumbent worker or skills shortages training sometimes have targeted groups that historically have needed assistance in overcoming employment barriers eg minorities disabled and lowskilled workers and they have included mixture of basic employability and occupation or industryrelated skills development67 however federal subsidy targeted at lesseducated or otherwise disadvantaged workers may not induce additional training instead it may prompt companies to substitute formal for informal training of these groups this could be the outcome of broadbased training incentive as well the result of training subsidy or mandatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30546crs20 68 barron berger and black onthejob training and bishop john h what we know about employerprovided training review of the literature center for advanced

concepts that are used in this section continuedthus may be to raise expenditures on formal training lower the amount of informal training and leave employees earnings unchanged68 this discussion assumes that policymakers would be interested in subsidizing only formal training because of the difficulty in measuring expenditures on informal training ie distinguishing it from normal work and supervision this assumption is borne out by statement in solicitations for grant applications for dislocated or incumbent worker training demonstrations that expressly prohibits the use of federal funds to pay participants salaries while trainees salaries are indirect costs of both formal and informal training they are likely to account for more of the expenditures on informal training which does not entail certain expenses associated with formal training eg payments to outside training providers for curriculum development and instruction tuition reimbursement transportation lodging or meals and purchase or maintenance of equipment and classroom space by putting offlimits the salaries of employees engaged in training the language in the grant solicitation favors the provision of formal over informal training as previously mentioned however it is not known whether the payoff to formal training is greater than to informal training and it is possible that certain types of skills may be less costly to learn ie more efficiently provided through informal means consequently the availability of formal training subsidy may reduce the efficiency of human capital production by encouraging the use of more expensive methods further since smaller firms are more likely than larger firms to train informally subsidy of formal training programs is an implicit decision to subsidize larger firms69 perhaps to compensate for this bias the labor department in one instance geared portion of incumbent worker demonstration grants to assist in the training of employees of small and mediumsized companies ie those with 500 or fewer employees70 is employersupported training underprovided the question of whether there is training deficit among incumbent workers actually is concerned

not wagetakers rather than the market determining the wage these monopsonistic firms have power over the wage and continuedtraining because the former does not impart portable skills ie skills that are useful throughout the labor market put another way firms are willing to share with their employees in the costs of specific skills development because they are fairly sure of benefitting from it as specific skills raise productivity only at the training firm employees earn higher wages than they would be able to command elsewhere specific training consequently reduces employee turnover and allows the firm to recoup its training expenses by paying wages that are less than the workers productivity in the posttraining period in contrast employers are unwilling to share in the costs of general skills development as general skills are equally useful to many companies the training firm must pay employees wages equal to their productivity in the post training period if the training firm fails to give employees the entire return to training they will leave for firms that will pay them wage commensurate with their transferable skills thus businesses do not have an incentive to pay for general training while incumbent workers do72 the human capital model predicts that employees will pay the full cost of general training by borrowing money earning lower wage during training periods or accepting lower starting wage for jobs that offer general training if these things occur there theoretically should not be underinvestment in training however employe cannot readily borrow funds to pay for general training and employees could be reluctant to selffinance training because they are uncertain of its rewards73 so if incumbent workers actually had to pay the full cost of general training underinvestment would be likely further employers may not be able to pay workers lower wage conditioned on training receipt because of such things as minimum wage legislation collective bargaining agreements or competition from other firms74 indeed there is empirical evidence which suggests that the starting wages of workers who receive training are not depressed or barely so and that posttraining wage growth is smaller than productivity improvements75 in addition there are abundant examples of companies that do not reduce their employees wages while paying the expenses associated with participation in literacy programs problemsolving classes or other general skills instruction all of this implies that contrary to standard training theory which is predicated on

beyond becker training in imperfect labor markets 78 acemoglu and pischke beyond becker training in imperfect labor markets 79 bishop what we know about employerprovided training 80 an alternative way to determine whether employerprovided training is underprovided is to compare its rate of return to that of other investments eg in education or in physical capita there is dearth of highquality data from which to develop the rate of return to employer sponsored training howeveremployers pay large share of the costs and garner large part of the returns to training77 it has been suggested that imperfections in the labor market enable firms to reap some benefit from and therefore to pay toward general training as they do toward specific training for example firm may be able to offer employees with transferable skills belowmarket wage in the posttraining period and still retain them because other businesses are unwilling to equally reward newhires for skills whose quantity and content they cannot accurately judge the fact that employer provided skill development typically is not accredited permits training firms to gain from this asymmetry of information in the labor market further the termination of an employment relationship is not costless either to the employee who must search for another job or to the employer who must hire replacement the presence of search and hiring costs thus may serve to temper employee turnover moreover general skills may complement specific skills so employers are willing to provide instruction in the former to enhance the value of the latter to the firm78 in addition each worker may have bundle of general skills in effect firmspec ific skill mix that is more useful to the current employer than to other employers and thereby reduces worker mobility79 but if employees do not foot the complete bill for general skills development and employers instead share in its cost the likely outcome given the possibility of employee turnover is underprovision of general training when deciding how much general training to offer incumbent workers profitmaximizing firm will compare its current costs for employee training with its future productivity gains the training firm will not factor into its decision any benefits that might accrue to subsequent employers to the employees who change employers or to societyatlarge but as demonstrated by the research previously reviewed employees who change companies do benefit through higher wages from the training acquired while at previous firms and similarly companies do benefit through higher productivity from those employees who received training while at previous firms the presence of these spillover effects which training firms do not consider means that employers likely err on the side of offering too little general skills training80httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30546crs23 81 grants totaling 331 million were awarded in 1999 and 2000 under title iii of the job training

program year 1998 incumbent worker demonstration program under title iii of the job training partnership actthis suggests that there is role for the federal government to play in employer sponsored training in light of the limited information available on what works and what doesnt and on how much total formal and informal training currently is being provided to employees the government may want to tread warily into this new venue for its limited training resources the possibility that firms could substitute federal monies for their own resources or substitute formal for informal training rather than increase the total quantity of incumbent worker training also implies the need for caution and while the historically low unemployment rate in recent years may have contributed to policymakers new focus on skill development for individuals who already have jobs incumbent workers are virtually guaranteed some degree of training from their employers in contrast unemployed persons have only their own presumably scanty resources and traditionally federal training funds to draw upon to learn new or upgrade existing skills up to this point it appears that congress has cautiously ventured into the area of employerprovided training in the case of wia the incumbent worker training initiatives are smallscale demonstrations and the grant solicitations explicitly state that federal funds should not to be used for training that employers otherwise are capable of undertaking or that would have been provided in the absence of the grant while there is matching requirement for wia funds going toward incumbent worker training acwia does include such requirement which mitigates the total replacement of company resources with government resources on given project between the two funding sources less than 80 million likely will have been committed to incumbent worker training through 200081 in addition the requirement that incumbent worker projects involving wia or acwia funds are to be evaluated hopefully will inform any further legislative proposals in this policy area eg the request for new incumbent worker program in the fy2001 budget the recency of many of the awards involving employerprovided training makes it unlikely that evaluations will become available shortly however82
