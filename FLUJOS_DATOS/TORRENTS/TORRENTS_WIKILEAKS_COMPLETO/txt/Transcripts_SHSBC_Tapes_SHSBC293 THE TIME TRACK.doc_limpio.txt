the time track lecture given on 16 may 1963 thank you all right this is what audience 16th may huh audience 16 may sixteen may sixteen may ad 13 thank you i got to get some backflow you know saint hill special briefing course lecture on the subject ofas it develops ah ive been scouting around and trying to keep quarter of an inch ahead of you and thats difficult but you pretty well got this taped its very funny you know sometimes we develop big piece of technology or something of the sort and all the record of the development is there and theres summation i very often never make summation at the time it becomes pass√© see its superseded in the course of development by new development dont you see and therefore concentration and economy of research timeif we had theboth the time and the resources of oh i dont know the stamp salvage collection department of the bureau of infernal ravening of the us governmentif we just had that appropriation you see we might be able to do it little more broadly but its always up to to make summation and it was with great astonishment that i found out that we had never made summation of engram running of all of the key things to leave summation missing on there were tremendous things learned about engram running andover long period of timeand it was never summated and i was quite interested last nightbefore session i was trying to get start on bulletin which summated engram runningand i was quite interested how easily it was summated theres wonder youre bit confused about engram running because it changed over period of many years there were many types of engram running there were many things done at one time in engram running which were found unnecessary in other times various mechanics and improvements came and went and out of all of this actually very simple method of engram running exists theres not many laws of engram running im not going to give this lecture on the subject of how simple it is to run an engram because the summation of it is very precise activity im going down the line and giving the various terms and laws and so forth and one of the things i discovered on the thing that i think youll find very interesting is we have never changed basic tenet of auditing that is youve never successfully audited anything but the time track there is nothing to audit but the time track and there is grand key to the release of things but the time track and it is time track probably people think of engrams as something stowed in the pcs wits like cordwood you know theyre just stowed there and then theres over in this department you see in this file cabinet theres big bunch of stuff over there theres some round cylinders of some kind or another and those are valences then down in the basement someplace else why we have something else stowed theremachinery and then locks locks that belongs to an entirely separate division has nothing to do with anything and secondaries well theyre sort of stowed out in the woodshed you know and that theyre pieces and bits of things and that theyre not related and so forth actually theyre simply different phenomena of the time track and in trying to summate the thing i made that little discovery and it seems to be terribly elementary but it might serve to orient you pretty well on what you are doing it is time track it is the continuous record of time of the individual since the first moment he began to experience straight on through till now an uninterrupted 3d fiftytwo perception movie and things happen to that movie and it gets grouped and becomes unavailable to the pc becomes unavailable to the pc for various reasons his inability to confront and the fact that the track itself can get grouped like you took can of motionpicture film and its all stretched out there and so you just start taking it and crumpling it up in your hand in big wads and so forth and various things can happen to this consecutive record of experience various things happen to it and all that auditing ever does is straighten it out and make it available and asis it now i think that gives you simplification of outlook i was quite surprised i was sitting there and suddenly it dawned on i could make very simple statement of exactly what we were auditing what all these things were as you go along on this track you get moment of pain and unconsciousness all right thats just another record its consecutive with the next moment which is perhaps not of pain and unconsciousness chains they dont exist in separate slots and compartments theyre just sections of the film which happen to be interrelated guy is hit over the head with hammer therefore every incident of hitting people over the head with hammer and being hit over the head with hammer and being hit overwhatwell just being hit over the head with hammer makes chain that is related series of experiences and they interrelate in the association of the individual and actually tend to pull this time track down on top of one another so youve got whole groupa grouper there so the track actually gets looped at this point and then youve got the basic time the individual was hit over the head with hammer youve got the basic time the individual washit somebody over the head with hammer and then youve got all the times that he saw hammer see or thought somebody was going to get hit with hammer or something like that those constitute the locks and they pack down on top of this thing see you eventually get solid wad there that looks like piece of black godelpus and there it is and the pc of course does not have that experience available so when the experience becomes unavailable to him it has command value over him he does not know what it is and when he comes near it it has tendency to operate as command level hammer is telling him what to do in other words and theres only two classes of things involved in this time trackonly two classes of thingsand one isyou might call the mechanical things which is matter energy space and time see and their interrelationships and so forth see theres the matter energy space and time which is this track you see and then theres the significance so the time track is basically composed of matter energy space time and thought and thats all the time track is composed of now people who cant confront any part of their trackand one of the reason the psychologist cant even deal with this thing at allim not berating the psychologist wed train him if we could well have to one of these days he has bad record with us we dont just have bad record with him he has very bad record with us he cant learn and he goes off into wild departures and so forth weve had quite sincere psychologists studying at the academies i mean its not just brushoff and one of those blokes that i know of over in the states i dont know i think he was there for about six months and he hadnt finished the comm course thats right first week he was terribly interested terribly interested he went away and im sure it did him some good we couldnt make scientologist out of him and we just sort of dusted it off and forgot about ittoo hard to do too many good people around that you could make scientologists out of you know you could train how to audit there was real point in breaking our necks with this well this actually doesnt establish any rancor on my part at all if bunch of psychologists and so forth wanted to be set up for the training course i would put them through training course but i would just make sure that it was commensurate with our experience with psychologists which is to say tenyear course something like this i wouldnt miss i wouldnt miss theyd be happy wed be happy and everything would be happy id just as soon process psychiatrist process psychologist its all the same but remember that this bird did not make discoveries of the time track or this particular area the very woof and warp of which the mind is made simply because he conceives it all to consist of only thought see his confront is down to point where he thinks the brain contains thought now this is kind of silly its like walking down the street and saying theres nothing on this street but opinions street is all full of opinions and if you just get all these opinions on this street youre all set whereas it is opinion that is pushing the pcs face in its somebodys fist well maybe the fist might have been pushed you see on the time track because of somebodys opinion but the fact of the matter is its not an opinion thats pushing his face in its fist the time track thereforeim just making this point here very strongly because youll come up against itis not imaginary it should not be treated as an imaginary thing is deck of cards imaginary what is real well what is real has mass and weight and so forth and so does time track youre into vague philosophic mutterings when you start saying what is reality what is reality oh my boy you could put on your long white robe and walk all over greece from one end to the other making good living almost in any century by just continuing to ask this question in somewhat deliberative frame of mind you know what is reality you know if you put enough if you put enough schmaltz in it you knowwould have had it well we have pretty good idea of what reality is but it does not really form too much of our technologydescriptions of reality and we take the shortcut to it and we say reality is what isyou know what is then we shortcut the idea of well is it because were thinking it is or is it because were not thinking it is you know just bypass all that garbage pail full of reasons not to look at reality just recognize that its not confront however it got here it is see it just is and its sort of ado more philosophers out of living this sort of aof direct approach i mean you cant make living saying you know reality is well you say yes yes but who made it well thats not germane see the point were interested in immediately is where we are and what we are looking at you see thats the main point now the secondary point is where did it come from and tertiary point is whats going to happen to it but these are all not main points the main point is were here and were looking at it see and what we are here before and looking at scientologicallyjust to cut the gordian knotis see it just is there isnt any discussion then of whether the pc is imagining that he is looking at brick wall or is he looking at brick wall well it is you see now what is it the product of well in the physical universe brick wall is the product of bricklayer brick maker the economics of the societylets take it back step by stepa clay bank which is part of the planet which was made and put here and then we get to divergence of opinion was it put here religiously or by the galactic construction company you see but thats actually all the importance it has it is here well what put it here well we have another peculiarity as we go along wethere are some peculiar things which make scientologist scientologist and you all fall into this category you probably dont think of these things very much but you know that what is is andas far as youre concernedand where it came from is slightly different question and that you dont necessarily have to go into these fantastic ramifications you see and we also sort of amongst ourselves have agreed that nothing is holy by which i mean nothing is proof against being inquired into thats very healthy state of mind man because that does not qanda with the unavailability of sections of the time track dont you see and when people have said well there are certain things you mustnt inquire into theyre just doing q and on the unavailability of existence or isness see theyve just done q and with it now recognizing all those things we see then that the time track has remained undiscovered undescribed forms absolutely part whatsoever of modern mental studies forms part of the materials of psychiatry and so forth now we must ask why and its because the thing has tricks of unavailability and the beings who are working in this field do not have confront sufficient to look past that unavailability so you have to be just little bit tougher to be scientologist and thats the way it is these guys werent quite tough enough they took somethingthe time trackconsisting of matter energy space and time and thought and said it was all thought and this of course leaves everything inexplicable see people think they are living in house well the bird who is saying this these people think they live in house therefore they are utterly mad because there is house and then people have gone around and made him feel the walls you know and said look there is house here you know oh theres house do you recognize thats the lockout as far as this research line has gone now whats the reason for that well the time track has great many tricks by which it becomes unavailable and the first of these tricks is that there is nothing in mind but thought and recognize that as that is trick of debarment if theres nothing in the mind but thought anybody who says hes looking at brick building in the mind of course isnt looking at brick building it must therefore be imaginary so therefore he is living in the field of illusion or delusion so therefore he must be slightly mad now this line of thought is very productive for appropriations because i think sixteen billion dollars has just been appropriated in the united states with which to erect some experimental stationsby which they mean by the way research and development sections that means theyre going to train some attendants there thats what they mean by this thats all ive read the bills actually thats not just crack thats what they mean by it its all on this basis well insane people must be mad because they say they are seeing things well of course this compounds the insanity because then the person who is supposed to be treating the insanity says you are not seeing these things so he makes the track less available so the direction of sanity lies in the capabilitythe capabilityof confronting the time track and the present time environment and for any individual for any one individual existence consists of the physical universe present timethe physical universe present time and everything that is in it at this exact precise present time instantand the time track which consists of everything that has been and that is the total isness as far as this thing called reality is concerned see now you can speculate on what the time track has been by reason of the state its in now but that actually is not an isness you see what condition is it in furthermore you go around england youll see mounds of dirtfurrows on hillside youll see mounds of mossy overgrown whatnot you look little bit closer and youll see that its some old fortification be roman camp or medieval castle that has long since gone to dust and the socialists you see and there it is well its lot of fun you see its lot of fun to add some significance to this thing you know and say what has it been see but that is not its isness now its perfectly all right to standas loas matter of fact its wonderful game to stand and look at this pile of stone and say what has it been i know ive done some of the most learned marvelousabsolutely astonished myself by the brilliance with which i could reconstruct out of single mound of stone the tremendous civilization which went before you see and the power of the fellows who erected it and so forth i remember one particular time i was so overwhelmed by my own brilliance and learnedness in this particular direction that i hardly heard the farmer at all when he said well yes thats the silo we built last year it fell down now that is suppositional reality see tremendously subject to error but not outlawed for that reason but recognize its isness which is just suppositional isness its the isness of suppositional isness now every once in while on the track youve met some fellow in conical hat who was saying abracadabra hocuspocus if you just gaze into the pot here i will tell you the future oh thats great thats great quite game in itself its probably lot of complexities but its suppositional all futures are suppositional the odd part of it is that if theyif theyre suppositional enough they come true i remember with some shame telling fortune at party to some peoplei used to tell lots of fortunes its very funny you know you look at somebodys facsimiles this is very funny you know and you pull wise face you know and you can take look at the facsimiles and saying i see you living in house which is very close to railroad track you see and there are some tall trees theresome very tall slender treesand its right there at the corner of the roads and let see now let see now don dondontdont interrupt its acacia manor yes i see you living at this house well thats fantastic we just went out to look at such house today in fact were going to buy it of course the character wasnt going to buy it till you said he was going to live in it you know and as party trick one time i told couple i saw them both being unfaithful and separatingyou know just dealing the cards outand they both obediently did and i felt very ashamed of myself the future is always enforceable from altitude and authority and so forth you get somebody like toynbee he can predict the future he says you know hes got some formula that nobody knows but toynbee and he can predict some sort of future out into the future and he can tell by that that this that and the other thing is going to happen of course hes actually found trick method of making postulate stick you see hes making postulate stick by saying that is the way it is going to be because i can read the future see thats just trick method of making postulate stick but it doesnt escape the fact that its suppositional reality so if you break existence down into isness and potential isness you can probably break down this potential into several categories and you could probably make quite an interesting german graph out of this thing you know you could extrapolate it out cover the whole wall before you got through and you could break this down into numbers types categories subclasses and then subclasses of subclasses and then subclasses of subclasses of subclasses of subclasses pretty soon nobody would know what youre talking about so i prefer to leave it at that you see theres isness and theres suppositional isness now the time track often gives people the feeling that the was can return and they think if they run back just few hours years millennia down the track they will once more find themselves standing up at the battle of bennington and getting their head shot off or something of the sort you see and this makes them very nervous about going back well i one time saw line of redcoats and line of militia standing up exchanging shells and for about oh i dont know it must have been the space of minute or so they were total 3d in much greater reality than the physical universe had had to recently you see i mean man that was solid that was solid you know and i expected these guys and for moment i thought i had returned back down the time track on the physical universe time track and found it all there yesterday dont you see i didnt realize i was going down my own time track and good heavens man you could smell the mildew in the wigs you know and it wasit was all marvelous and you know i was all ready to duck from the next volley probably its there so solidly because i didnt duck from the next volley but next thing you know just looking at it the isness of it turned out to be what it was which was simply the isness of my own time track and at that moment it fitted itself into perspective it was an exaggeratedly solid piece of my own time track more solid and more real because of the awareness jammed into the moment of time dont you see than otherwise now you could mock yourself up futures and so forth you can do all sorts of things but again what youre mocking up is suppositional now theres one more class that you have to take something of look at its what is created and its this whole business of creating that really tends to rock people because you see its half real and half suppositional and its the borderline between the two now it almost depends on the person who says he is going to create something well somebody says hes going to build building you know this fellow does build buildings and so forth well then youits very close to reality his statement that he is going to build building see its quite close to reality because you know he wisbuild the building in fact you can already see the cornerstone you know that sort of thing thats good reality and some guy down in the loony bin why he says hes going to plant ten thousand acres of forest you see well thats hardly even suppositional reality you know darn well hes never even going to look at tree much less plant forest so you know that thing is never going to exist and it wont ever exist and so this matter of suppositional reality and creation come together but remember that creation is just suppositional reality until the moment it is created at the moment it is created for whatever period it may endure it is see so it is an isness anything created is an isness for whatever period it endures now all of this is quite pristine pure from whether it is good for people bad for people nice to do not nice to do or anything else these again are adjudications of what is and thats the opinion of what is but thats part of the thought of reality now thought is not separate from reality thought is woven solidly into reality and thought is part of the isness of reality for instance bbcitv down herefinally beginning dimly to learn their lessons on programing and theyve conducted i think it was ten million dollarpound test they went to vast expense to find out who viewed television and what programs they liked they went into great expense they built small studio they bought television set i imagine even paid for it and hired some children and bought some candy and comic books and got some furniture and put it in there and then drilled some spyholes in the wall and turned on canned programs you see so the children could watch the programs or talk to each other or eat the candy or read the comic books and they very carefully notedi think theresoh probably two or three thousand pounds of the appropriation must have been just paper to carry the notes of the reactions of the children at various points of the programs and so forth and they finally learnedthe final lesson was and this is why theyre going to continue it theyve learned somethingthey learned that little children do not like to look at older childrens programs and that older children do not like to look at little childrens programs and so it was pretty brilliant and thats why they take your favorite program off every saturday night you see and throw it away see theyve got long way to go theyve got long way to go police pull this trick all the time every once in whilearound washington one time we were doing union stationthis walkabout processand were going down to the airport and so forth and run it on airplanes and all that sort of thing we were doing this for quite while we found out at the end of about week that the federal boys institute and the narcotics division and interstate commerce and so forth detectives had been hanging back in the wings and behind sofas and chairs and back of pillarssquadrons of these fellows you know had just been haunting every scientologist and his preclear and so forth and at the end of the week why they finally grabbed one and they had already determined that they were not new airline that was smuggling dope i dont know how they determined that i guess they saw they didnt have any airplanes in their pockets or something it never occurred to them to ask anybody this is the point im making you see it never occurred to them to establish an isness on situation or to ask anybody because they couldnt for some reason or other view the thought in the isness see so theyre way up around the bend they cant even view the thought in the isness so dont think that it just goes to point where people can only view the thought in the isness you can get further than that where people cant even view the thought in the isness you see and cant even ask for what thought there is in the isness now there are certain opinions abroad in the world today with which we may or may not agree but they happen to be part of the isness of this world now whether they could be changed that again is not part of the isness they are these thoughts are now the ironmonger who weaves this sign with the curlicues and so forth has had thought when he wove that set of curlicues on this sign you see he had thought when he did it and you get back and you take look at this and youre actually looking at iron set in space youre see itperceiving it by energy reflected dont you see and there is time that youre looking at it in you see and you look at it for certain period of timeand all of this isness goes together but most people overlook the fact the curlicues arethe curlicues are in actual fact an expression of thought which is part of the physical universe so theres great deal of thought woven into the physical universe that is part of its isness doesnt have to be written up go here go there this is bear but certainly either the bear making himself bear or somebody else making bear is expressing the thought of bear see hes using matter energy space and time to express the thought of so that thought is expressed by the formation of matter energy space and time and if we look this over well see that the thought is an integral part of nearly all physical universe puttogether to some degreeto some degreethought is part of the physical universe and is part of its isness so we say the physical universe then consists of matter energy space time and thought and the time track consists of matter energy space time and thought and just as your broadest classifications you have now made the simplest statement that can be made concerning time track or the physical universe that is the simplest statement that can be made now we can complicate it we can complicate it tremendously we can get the suppositional isnesses we can get the befores and afters you see we can get the purposes you see the additive utilities and of all things the aesthetics now we really go mad when we get into aesthetics you see but the devil whispered is it art you see and that devil is always standing alongside the shoulder of every artist or anybody engaged in an artistic pursuit you see the little girl doing her sampler see and so on saying i think that looks nice that really looks nice and im going to make it soandso and its going to look nice and she gets to look at it yeah but is it artistic you know is it art you see the concert pianist beating his fingertips off at the concert and you very often are utterly astonished afterwards to find out that he does not consider that this is art he could do much better or he has done much better or he will do much better but is he doing better right now well you seldom find that he is ever doing better right now hes always on some suppositional kick well the degree that an individual is on suppositional kick measures directly his confrontingnesshis ability to confront the amount of suppositional isness that is added to actual isness measures directly the individuals ability to confront now thats very involved and complicated statement because its almost too broad to embrace this fellow goes down and he takes look at this watercolordown at the art galleryhe takes look at this watercolor and he says he should have well that should have has measured the amount of notconfront he is doing at theof the watercolor see its quite interesting therefore you get into this in the area of critical and you speak of people as being highcriticals this fellow has high critical you say you know very critical pc common term amongst auditors critical pc well its the degree that he is into suppositional and not into isness that is critical hes not confronting to the degree that he is critical now from being very esoteric statement that becomes very very interesting auditing tool if you look at it just in its bareboned fashion pc goes yowyowyowyowyowyowyowyowyowyowyowyowyow wow its obvious whether hes doing it misemotionallynow i suppose he will say you see but if it oh ihoho hmmm you say whats happening well it sort of looks here that it might have been thats quite acceptableall these things are quite acceptable and quite ordinary in auditing but it sort of looks hereitheresi dont know theres some kind of wreck out here i think there has been wreck its quite ordinary to have him then find out that its not even an airplane in front of him but building see he has saidhes given you the suppositional see he hasnt given you the isness of it well now the time track straightens out and erases in direct ratio to the amount of isness confronted by the pc and thats how sane and capable somebody gets its measured directly by that the amount of isness the individual is capable of confronting and hes having as hard time as he is moving from isness to suppositional now in view of the fact that his track is in terrible condition you have two things at workyou have the pcs own feelings of incompetence and you get the unrecognizableness of the track and these two things come into combination to make cats breakfast see the pc is sure that if he confronts it something horrible is going to happen hes sure of this you know so he houleaahh you know he auheaeahww i dont know whether i want to be processed or not you see it in the extremity of the pc doesnt want to report for his session see thats merely an expression of hes moved over into suppositional to that great degree see he supposes that its not confrontable he supposes that the auditor is not going to be able to do anything for it he supposes the auditor wont be able to handle it he supposes this he supposes that you see well all the time hes supposing hes not confronting now the pcs come downscale and sort of given up on the idea of being able to confront very much anyhow over long long period of time you can more or less measure this and call it state of morale because its quite volatile it will shift with great rapidity thetans state you see is actually not pinned mechanically by anything its just where he is and what he is doing dont you see its not really pinned mechanically by anything you see hes not made less of thetan or more of thetan but when you surround him as intimately as the time track with tremendous amount of threat suppositional unconfrontabilities he is continuously enforced into state of low morale he doesnt think he can do anything as matter of fact he cant its part of the isness of the situation see he knows whatll happen hes surrounded by jackintheboxes to point where hes touched this one time and its knocked him flat and hes touched that and its ruined something and hes touched something else and its blown him down and his attention is still terribly fixed on something else and he knows he mustnt take his attention off of that and then he knows also that if he doesnt take his attention off of it hes going to go to pieces you see and then hes forgotten that he has his attention on it hes in frightful state but you get his feeling of degradationbecause of his capability you see what he feels it isbut then youve got the actual state of the bank which is horrible it looks like bunch of mad theater managers have rushed in and grabbed all of the motion pictures that have ever been shown you see and mixed them up with stick and set fire to them see and thetan standing in the middle of this debrisyou see it hasnt even got bright flame left in it you know and there he is in the middle of this debris and he knows that if he moves or sparks or does anything something horrible will occur and every bit of this has retained in full its command value over him just the fact hes standing in the middle of it is enough to depress him but at the same time its all the old tin cans hes got it has value its all his knowingness its his record files hes like somebody who has become totally dependent on the record department and then the record department has been bombed he cant even find out his own name rank and serial number dont you see without the record department well that dependency and the reason that came about is also included in the record department so he cant even find that you see its all there and hes gone into terrible state with regard to all this its boobytrapped it jumps apart if he puts beam on it he sticks and he sort of feels funny because theres hand that vaguely shows out from underneath black plate and he doesnt know whose hand it was he doesnt know where its from he doesnt know when it happened but he knows hed better keep an eye on it and weve used other methods to approach this problem of the time track amongst those other methods were exteriorization try not to be three feet back of your head i dont know how many taxi drivers went out of their heads and their cabs climbed the curb in new york when they pulled that gag over the air you know that was pulled over the air and was done quite successfully try not to be three feet back of your headover the radio and its all very well and the odd part of it is the thetan is free youll have some fantastic experiences but you can get synthetic statea temporary momentary state of thetan which approximates his actual state if he didnt have bankby exteriorization ive exteriorized peopletheyve lost their stammer their lumbosis everything else the only person i had trouble with when i exteriorized him it didnt cure his cough and then we found out he was coughing didnt have any chest to cough with but there he was out there fifty sixty feet from the body coughing but that state doesnt lastdoesnt last because the individual is in state of low morale at the time you do it and even though you get him away from the bank youve just taken somebody away from the central control office and made him leave all of his files behind and he sort of thinks that those files can be straightened out and he definitely knows that he must have them in order to know anything and he goes along just so far and then hell jump or get scared or something will happen hell snap back into his head you can do this to an individual two or three times and then he wont come out anymore hes very suspicious about it everybody however can be made to exteriorize but youve exteriorized them out of the bank to marked degree but of course the bank follows them you can exteriorize somebody out of body and then exteriorize him out of his bank see just tell him to be three feet back of the mass that hes associated with be three feet back of your head all right youve got black mass there oh all right thats fine be three feet back of the black mass the individual gets foretaste of what it is like not to be pushed in on all sides by these black masses and things see but its momentary foretaste because hell take his attention off what he thinks he should hold his attention on hell collapse back into the bank the bank collapses back into the body and now he says he doesnt want that experience again actually what it does is restimulate dying this is more or less what he does at death but he takes the bank with him at death now the only possessions thetan has consist of this bank he really doesnt own anything else at moment of death on this planet due to the laws of inheritance and other mechanisms various times on the track thetan has tried very hard to straighten this upwhen you died you didnt lose everything see and it has been more often true on the track that you didnt lose everything than it has been that you did butso thetan is actually conditioned into this and he considers it considerable deprivation so he verymakes very sure he keeps that bank very close to him because its the only possession he knows he can hold onto yet its in terrible state and he doesnt want it in that kind of state its really use to him but he hopes it will be of use to him and he couldnt get away from it anyhow well the approach of exteriorization is frankly failure you can do remarkable things exteriorizing people but it is failure you better know something about exteriorization itll always help out an old buddy whos just been knocked down by freight train or something of the sort and there he lays gasping his last well tell him to be three feet back of his head you know and go on his way various exteriorizations some guy is in perfectly good shape and hes just accidently fallen off the bridge and drowned and theyre working on him with pulmotors and he doesnt start breathing again if you happen to be around and he hasnt been dead very longhe doesnt smell yetjust say to him hey theres nothing wrong with the body pick it up all of sudden the chest its quite remarkable its part of the mechanics of existence but as far as solid processing mechanism it doesnt exist as practical processing its more of this is piece of the isness of existence thetans do this kind of thing you can do this kind of things with thetans and once upon time every time you lost body on erxes you went and picked up new one onat home base you know youre always going back and picking up your bodypicking up new body you didnt necessarily lose your identity youd be surprised the researchthe searching security regulations which sometimes would be stressed home on somebody picking up new body you didnt want enemy troops in there picking up one of your own uniform bodies and the security whats your name oh you know joe whats the name of the bar at yakbung crossroads whats the name of the bar whats the name of the bartender you say you come from there whats the name of the bartender whats his favorite joke ah have this man shot in fact its quite unusualand one of the reasons why you rebel against it and people are very anxious and willing to be processedit is very very unusual for person to totally forget his identity just by reason of death and you havent been doing it very long you dont lose your whole identity and everything youve ever been just because you kick the bucket so the way its going now thought is passing out of everything and the identity passes out and the thetan not only loses his physical universe possessions by reason of death but he also loses his identity by reason of death and he doesnt like this he thinks this is canthavenohave proposition he is not in favor of this at all and therefore he tends to pull even more tightly on the time track you see youve denied him new record so hes grabbed this record see well every time somebody wanted to get even with him on the whole track somebody boobytrapped the record somebody threw bomb into the file room that was the way it was done you go down here to the loony bin and you can find people around there and theyre screaming about being jumped by demons and theres great bird that comes every night and perches on the bottom of the bed and pecks at him psychiatrist strokes his beard this mans insane why is he insane he sees bird thats the end of it if he sees hes insane now what kind of recordapproach is this this is just further denial of record isnt it thats the way you really make them spin oh you got bird that comes and sees you every night ahha good scientologist would have an entirely different approach hed probably tell his buddy christ what dubin you know so he says to the guy yeah yeah what kind of bird is it and he finds out more about this bird hes liable to find honey of series of incidents of some kind or another but the trouble is if you approach them from that bird youre liable to go straight into one of the doggonedest awfullest messes of raarr that anybody had anything to do with youve pulled him right into the middle of it hell eventually collide with this bird in processing its not necessarily the start of his processing however and you certainly dont invalidate the bird thats the last thing you better do because whatever it is it is he saw it so it is now we dont care whether other people agree that it is or they dont agree that it is thats all whether or not we agree to reality which is another method of making quick buck walking up and down the land with conical hat thats philosophic balderdash i mean the morethe more you can keep off of these wild byroads you see well is reality really something that everybody agrees to it isnt because there are people around who dont necessarily agree to the reality so therefore it couldnt be that it really isnt real well thats just method of making it unreal for somebody else isnt it reality is miracle that it is mutual in the physical universe thats the miracle its fantastic that it is mutual reality and that is the biggest proof of its isness its mutual reality now the funny part of it is banks have mutuality they are not necessarily all different because the tricks that have been used to wreck the file room have not been very many and those that were really capable of messing up the film and bending all the reels up and bashing the cans in had to be pretty heroic it really took some doing it really took some doing and the technology which you have i dont care whether youre listing for items running valences doing an assisti dont care what youre doingyoure handling the time track or piece or portion of the time track and you have never escaped this fact because it is the only tried and true approach to sanity and to recovered ability is straighten out the guys time track we have approached it in many ways we have tried to find out who is mocking up this time track well obviously the thetan is mocking it up but thats again suppositional reality we can use mockup processing we can take over the automaticity of the creation of this track the thing wrong with it is is he cant find out about it and it really gives him opportunity to confront it the confront factor is dropped to marked degree by this create approach you say well lets take over the automaticity of his creation of the bank all of sudden he hasnt got bank therefore hes clear well thats very good theory theres nothing wrong with it at all all i can say is that after many years of hard tries why we have never been able to make it satisfactorily and uniformly work as far as im concerned its locked roadbarriered the trick that barriers it is that when you get the individual to create he very often strikes the buttonand oddly enough there is goal to create in this gpm were handlingand hell hit buttons like that and all of sudden he goes intothe bank goes into obsessive create and it practically crushes the individual everything beefs up gets hard uhrrraurghh and it happens so often and so frequently that creative processing had limited usages it was useful but its usages are limited and it does not result in clears who will stay clear and were interested in that so it all comes back to the fact that those processes which effectively handle straighten out the time track put something there to confrontthat is to say untangle it enough so that it can be confrontedraise the morale remember this isthis is an adjunct to this it isnt enough just to straighten up the track youve got pc there too you know and if you lower his morale too much while straightening up his track why track doesnt straighten up you understand because youre actually not raising the thetans confront at the same time thats forour processing has got to be rather delicate and the only thing we get into is just this his suppositional isness is so great because his confront is so low in this particular zone or area after all look how low it must be all the great savants of the field of the mind never even suspected this track except freud and he said that the body contained some sort of record or blueprint of its immediate past freud did say this the body contained some such thing i consider it very interesting he never went ahead and explored it and he went into the suppositional reality that it made everybody barbarians and very vicious people to have this what his conclusions are im not entitled to say because i have not studied his conclusions because they again are suppositional reality i can only tell you that he did however remark that there was such thing and back about 1914 15 there was some chap back there who remarked on the fact that there was such thing as an engramthat moment of unconsciousness was recorded all the way through its very small portion of book printed back then i heard about it about 51 something like that guys trace on this and they get the hell out of there they dont want anything more to do with this see they trip over some corner of this thing and then they say well dadada its the twodimensional worm trying to describe threedimension and the third dimension its umwah mm everythings flat we know that and yet heres this pole occasionally theyll say well weyou run into something if you go across that particular side of the twodimensional plate you bump your head and most of them say well its impossible to bump your head because there are only two dimensions and then they say well then theres nothing there it doesnt occur to most of them to say there might be three dimensions in such way why that isness gets blocked out and barred out we should examine how it does because its very simple answer how does the existence of the time track get completely wiped away why do the great savants never remark on this particular piece of property which can be found in every and any human being and the handling of which is the only road that we can discover or that ever has been discovered which straightens the person out what is this why is it its the same reason that you sometimes have trouble in an auditing session these things are in two divisions there are two things here one is the suppositional reality of the pc sometimes presses him forwardof course wereim now not talking about the reasons he cant see the track thats pretty obvious the unavailabilities and the tricks of it and so on im talking about the pc who is sitting in front of youhis suppositional reality is very low but very great you see it supposes his i guesses about the track are terribly thin and if you dont develop those things along very smooth line and very smoothlyyou know he supposes he has black mass in front of his face you see he doesnt see the black mass actually all youve got to donot make the track more solid for him but just keep going around in the area and take what the pc says you see and keep working with it and this thing will start to unravel and the pc will come up and youll find less and less supposition he says after while there is black mass in front of my face dont you see well the principal barrier that you get if youre inexperienced in this line is that you suppose if the pc is so vague that you cant get anything you take it that the pc doesnt know whats there then you wont be able to find out whats there you dont recognize that he is just so far down on suppositional isness that he is not approaching isness whatever the tricks of auditing are and how you audit engrams it is the process of familiarizationgradient scale youve got to raise the morale of the pc with regard to it and raise the available thing to confront and familiarization with it and running it and so forth tends to unravel the track and stretch it out and make it available to him and his morale comes up at the same time and you get to an isness and you dont recognize that its all gradientall gradient from cant to can see its just gradient pc says oh i dont know anything about this i never heard of such balderdash ron says theres an incident here of some kind or another and i never heard of such thing its horrible for him to say such thing very shortly afterwards he starts to look after all hes been given little piece of data something to look at and he looksby golly its there you know and he says hey you know haha you know it makes him feel better he can see it and it is there to be seen he looks at it little bit more theres more there to be seen now you see and then he feels better about seeing and theres now more to be seen because youve gone over and developed the track you see its at once problem of getting viewer and stack of pictures together you see youve got to get the viewer so he can see the pictures you see thats your auditors code and morale of pc and all that sort of thing and coaxing him along and giving him the right orders you seethats for the pc and then you go over the technology of arranging the pictures and the way you arrange them is just stroke them thats all just stroke them enough times and stroke the right picture and you say there thats nice picture yeah thats nice picture yeah get that one all fixed all of sudden the pc says my god theres my bird you say yeah what do you know yeah he says yeah thats familiar that bird there he is tsk tsk thats pretty good lets find out some more about this see well if youve done it smoothly then the pcs morale is up so he can look and if youve handled the bank right why thats been rubbed up so that it can be looked at its this gradient approachits barred out by the fact that its terribly simple there really isnt anything very involved about it and thats one of the things that makes impatient in teaching people how to run engram is they always want to know the command with which you run an engram i dont know give command for petting cat i mean all the rules of auditing have to be obeyed and so forth and it gets to look pretty complicated after while but it isnt complicated youre running touch assist on picture of course your pc cant touch the picture and feels that you wont let him touch the picturehes going to have an awful hard time touching it and then if you dont give him the right picture to touch of course he cant touch that and one of the big boons you have in technology is ive been finding out what pictures can be touched which then produce tremendous resurge and start untangling this track by finding out what are the principal thingstwo things found out what are the principal things that have the track snarled and which of them can be touched see theres two problems there you see what is snarled and what do you touch to unsnarl it see those are two distinctly different problems the auditor tends to qanda to some slight degree with the fact that an engram contains pain and he doesnt want to inflict pain on the pc of course and contains unconsciousness and of course you cant see anything when youre unconscious so all the great savants of all history have simply qedandaed with the pain of the engram and on the time track and unconsciousness and theyve simply remained unconscious of itunwilling to approach its pain and of qingandaing with its unconsciousness and thats why they have never said since time immemorial every being has time track its just asjust as elementary piece of nonsense as that they say well you cant see it and you cant do anything with it and theres really only thought in the head anyway and theres lots of ways they approach this thing but theyre actually just doing q and the thing is unavailable to the being so the savant supposes it is unavailable to him dont you see he doesnt want to have anything to do with that pain so he leaves it alone and because theres unconsciousness in it he remains unconscious of it and im afraid the problem is more complicated than that but the auditor mustnt fall for this see in the first place i dont think thetan can go unconscious i dont think there is level at which you could say absolute unconsciousness takes place its quite interesting you run somebody through an engram where he knew he was unconscious all the way through the engram and he doesnt remember what happened in the incident well that doesnt mean he was unconscious in the incident just means he cant remember what happened in the incident he might have been conscious all the way through and you start running this thing through as an engram and all of sudden he finds out during those moments of unconsciousness he was conscious of things going on the only real tragedy of life i suppose is that absolute unconsciousness and absolute unknowingness are unobtainable well the auditor must realize that there is slightest portion of that time track that isnt available and he should go into idont knowanythingaboutit simply because the thetan hes auditing of course doesnt know anything about it this is the expected state hed be clear if he knew all about it well youthen youre saying well i cant audit him because he doesnt know anything about it youre saying well when he gets to be clear ill give him session its all by gradients theres great deal of technical information about this theres reasons he cant view the track and the reasons the track is unavailable to him are very mechanical i dont think you would be very excited about viewing door that every time you walked up to the door it crashed open and broke your nose i think after while you would get out of the habit of walking up to this door and after while you would say that door doesnt even exist im not even going to go in that part of the room because the violence that is contained on the time track cannot be again underestimated boy its there its there its violent you can hit portions of the time track thatll kick pc right out of his head if you forced him into them bow its sledgehammer proposition lets take secondseriesgoal gpm and lets force the pc into the top oppterm and then keep hammering and pounding the pc from the top oppterm down with the wrong pattern give you the shudders yet what makes it gruesome it isnt that the auditor is pushing the pc hes not doing anything to the pc thats very bad whats doing the pushing is the bank its solid and tough at that point well the magic of it is is if you get the earliest moment of the earliest gpm it runs like hot butter it runs like nothing powpowpowpowpowpowpowpowpow do you realize theres just as much charge on it as there was the later one see as bank theres just as much charge on that bank as there was on the later bank i consider this quite interesting you cant run the later one you can run the earlier one why when youre running the later one youre trying to run that and all the banks that come before it the pc can confront one bank youre asking him to confront twenty youre asking him to stomp right into the charge of twenty banks he cant do it so he gets big lose so if he says look he says i cant confront the bank look the bank is too tough for therefore its important not to give him loses early on theres various approaches of this kind this is all technical know how this knowhow is very simple knowhow its not very difficult know how you go into too much suppositional and you have trouble but ill tell you that an auditor has success in auditing if he has good idea of the mechanics of engrams and the time track if he kind of knows what this is all about the next thing you know why hes in there sailing somebody else keeps asking for rote command they say give rote command do you say the somatic strip will return snap or do you say snap the somatic strip will return or do you say snapsnap just exactly how do you say this ill show you person that doesnt know the mechanics of what hes handling somebody gives double command this is the most serious thing in engram running it confuses the living daylights out of the pc its almost impossible not to give false command at one time or another because youre right on there and to give wrong command you find out about it before the pc has chance to get snarled up with it thats the only is not to catch it for instance the demonstration which you had i told the pc to go to the point where the pc was just one time it confused him well thats not very serious i immediately remedied the thing and he got it all straightened out and there we went and see we were on our way what if id said to him go to the beginning of the incident when you go to the end of the incident because the beginning of the incident is the place where we dont start and then gotten provoked with him because he didnt execute the auditing command well i certainly wouldnt have known very much about the bank to do something like that but you wouldnt make mistake like thisthis is gross error you say to the pc go to the beginning of the incident where the birds are he doesnt know the mechanics and behavior of an engram see well whats wrong with the command it seems like perfectly innocent command you see this is mistake almost anybody would make yeah but the beginning of the incident was where the birds are that was the beginning of the incident half an hour ago so the auditor thinks that while he handles an engram nothing happens see he thinks nothing ever changes well why is he auditing the pc if hes never going to get any change see well he thinks nothing is ever going to change so he thinks the birds are going to be the beginning of this incident from here on out well the birds are never the beginning of the incident even the second time so you say go to the beginning of the incident and you suddenly make this command go to the beginning of the incident where the birds are go to the birds go to the beginning of the incident and you ask the pc whats the matter whats the matter with you whatwhat do you want to do do you want to go to the beginning of the incident or go to where the birds are and the pc is all fogged up and he cant give you the data very good and he just neglected to tell you that there is an incident the day before the birds arrived when there was an edict that you mustnt shoot any birds issued and hes just discovered this and may even have mentioned it but you didnt get its time and you didnt realize that was the day before that is now the beginning of the incident so youve told him to go twentyfour hours deep in the incident while going to the beginning of the incident dont you see and he gets very very confused you got things like through and to you wouldnt think that through and to would make this much difference you say move to the moment of the birds all right now move to the period three days later and you say all right now what happened as you went through the engram the pc says what engram moved whatwhat are you talking about what happened as you went through the engram i didnt go through the engram well now all right you didnt follow the auditing command haha guess ill clobber him see the bank follows the hopskipjump youthinkyourethereand yourethere system of the thetan see you moved to the end well all right youre at the end see youre at the beginning youre at the end theres nothing in between so when youre scouting you always use to and when youre running an engram you always use through its little simple points like this actually to some degree it is my fault for not having made these things as brilliantly and shiningly clear as i might have some time or another but as i say the subject was never summated i frankly didnt ever think wed need it againjust per running an engram now i found out that it makes it tremendously easier to run the bank and that on very few pcs you will be unable to run the bank unless you get an early engramic incident out of the road and i also found out that if you can run the overt engram that relates to these gpms just as an engram that fantastic amount of charge will come off the implants themselves naturally and therefore they run likevery much like hot butter i had little bulletin for you found datum here you might be interested in that particular outfit was down toward the center of this particular galaxy and was founded at 52 trillion 863 billion 10 million 654 thousand 79 years and i cant give you much closer than that because when place get founded ismore or less becomes part of their lies but it was founded that time and it was destroyed on the date 38 million38 trillion 932 billion 690 million 862933 years ago by the 79th wing of the 43rd battle squadron of the galactic fleet it was not thepart of the galaxy it was wildcat activity sitting there they used to drag magellanic clouds out of the center hub of the galaxy let them follow the lines of force and just let them come over system then when they got around to it theyd send planes in with speakers and so forth and give the place the business but the place very often was totally caved in for thousands of years by these magellanic radioactive clouds which would just engulf the particular system you got the idea i just give you that in brief just as matter of interest because i dont thinkive now got good data on the datesthese dates were getting are accurate i have now compared them up the track and squared them around these are the dates now youre not likely to find any implant earlier than or even near 52 trillion and youre certainly not going to find an implant closer to present time than 389 trillion and if you find any other kind of an implant youre probably looking at different kind of implant or somebody dramatizing it someplace else so itll be subgrade proposition so that is the span and period of these particular things i gave you this second date 38 trillion because actually that was quite battle group that went in to clean up this particular activity you might have been part of it makes very lovely overt engram that keyed you in like crazy but that was not part of the galactic government they were bunch of guys that had the dream of everybody in the universe being good and they are the people who used the ice cube and youve all run into the ice cube we often wondered who was the author of this sort of thing well the ice cube was used by these people i dont say that they authored it and therefore you get all this beach scenery and so forth for people on this planet that came up through the ice cube see as well as other methods but i just thought id give you those dates because they are of some small interest and that isnt going on now there is something going on now or you wouldnt be here and you wouldnt have governments on this planet the way you have them as lousy as this but thats horse of another hue and has nothing very much aberrative connected with it in comparison to the magnitude and so forth this is the one that really keyed in the peoples time track but theres one thing that id like to point out to you in finding the original incident on the thing basic on chain is the basic on chain see its not what i say it is or what you say it is or we hope it is see the basic on the chain then that youre looking for very often may sail back into godelpus and i found basic on this chain last night which was of great interest to it was simply an assassination attempt of radioactive bomb thrown in carriage thats the basic implant chain see you move the pcthe ruleyou move the pc back before back before back before to where he doesnt have any somatics hehheh hehheh to what didnt have any part of these people at all but that one got keyed in that became basic on the chain got the idea if youre lucky itll simply be the first time they saw these magellanic clouds come in over the planet and somebody made an unsuccessful attempt to pick them up or something like this something of that sort and you run that you get the pc ahead of this and hes got somatics all right you run him into it and you find your first incident dont be surprised if your first incident expands earlier dont you see but if you run into it you get your first incident out of the road the rest of it runs relatively easily but dont be too amazed if the first incident is actually not on the same chain but has become terribly interlocked with the chain and you cant do anything else until you do it i believe somebody was running that last night and he finally got to some kind of an incident that didnt apparently have any relationship to this at all apparently had nonothing to do with it see but it was some sort of beam or blast in the face that left the fellow with hanging somatic of some kind or another that then connected up into the implant chain and away we go see well the good news i have for you is just that these guys arent around but the point im really making is that your individual address to the problem of engram running if its giving you any trouble at allthe blame is partially that i never made summation of engram running and the only difficulties youre having is just lack of appreciation of exactly what it is youre handling it is not matter of the rote command its matter of understanding exactly what is this thing called time track exactly what are you handling in the individual and exactly what keeps you from handling it and permits you to handle it and you get that taped why all of this becomes very very easy dont blame yourself too hard along about 1958 59 or something i should have sat down and said well lets see whats everything we know about engram running well i didnt bother to do so because i didnt think wed ever be running them again its with great delight now that i find out we know far more about engram running than has ever been published just by basis of summation actually summatable in very few pages okay thank you very much
