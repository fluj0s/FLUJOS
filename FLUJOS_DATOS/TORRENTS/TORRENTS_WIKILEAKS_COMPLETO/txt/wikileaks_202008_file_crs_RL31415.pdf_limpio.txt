2002 included provisions in 311 and 312 relating to military readiness activities and the mbta and respectively section 1201 of s 2225 contained similar but slightly different provisions however s

this report provides br ief overview of how the endangered species act esa1 and the migratory bird treaty act mbta2 and their relevant regulations may apply to military training and readiness activities of the department of defense dod military activities may take protected creatures directly eg killing with ordnance during rifle gunnery or assault drills or might stroy habitat eg artillery or bombing practices even if these results are not the purpose of the activities the applicability of the mbta and to military readiness activities has been controversial recently and legislation has been enacted in both the 107th and 108th congresses on these topics although bills in the 107th congress addressed both the and the mbta pl 107314 addressed only the mbta sec tion 315 of that act directs that new mbta regulations be devel oped to exempt the armed fo rces for incidental taking of migratory birds during military readiness activities3 until such regulations are finalized 315 provides that the prohibiti ons of the mbta do not apply to the incidental taking of migratory birds by member of the armed forces during military readiness activities however during the interim period the secretary of defense in consultation with the secretary of the interior is to minimize and mitigate to the extent practicable adverse impacts of the readiness activities on affected migratory birds judicial re view is preserved but expedited in that challenges to the regulations directed by the act must be filed not later than 120 days from the date the regulations are published

esarelated language was changed in conference and hr 1588 became pl 108136 the national defense authorization act for fiscal ear 2004 the new language that was ultimately enacted as pl 108136 precludes the designation of critical habitat on department of defense lands that are subject to an integrated natural resources management plan under the sike s act if the secretary dete rmines in writing that the plan provides benefit to the species for which critical habitat is pr oposed for designation the duties of defense agenci to consult under 7 of the and to comply with the prohibitions

foregoing 50 cfr 1012in instances of irreconcilable conflict between desired agency activity and the avoidance of jeopardy the provides an exemption process whereby highlevel endangered species committee may be convened to consider possible exemption from the penalties of the act for an agency action18 the process for obtaining an exemption is somewhat rigorous and timeconsuming and the exemption process has seldom been utilized the process also seems to contemplate exemptions for particular individual proposed agency acti ons rather than for generic or recurring types of activities an exemption cannot be granted if the secr etary of state after review of the proposed agency action certifies that gr anting the exemption and carrying out an action would violate an international tr eaty obligation or other international obligation of the united states19 this provision might affect the availability of an exemption for military readiness activities that would destroy migratory birds notwithstanding any other provision of the act under 7j of the 16 usc 1536j an exemption must be gran ted for an agency action if the secretary of defense finds the exemption is nece ssary for reasons of national security however this alternative is only available as part of the committee process and apparently would only apply to particular national security activity that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species in question an exemption under this section of the act has never been s ought nor have there been any attempts to administratively develop general exemptions for ongoing or recurring activities the migratory bird treaty act application to federal activities the mbta is less clear than the in several respects including its applicability to federal activities the mbta is criminal environmental stat ute enacted in 1918 to implement the international convention for the protection of migratory birds signed by the united states and great britain acting for canada only few years earlier20 section 2 16 usc 703 sets out the types of prohibited c onduct and states unless and except as permitted by regulations it shall be unlawful at any time by any means or in any manner to pursue hunt take capture kill attempt to do these acts or possess any migratory bird or any part nest or ggs of any such bird none of these terms is defined in

federal agencies the supreme court assumed without discussi on that 2 applied to forest service and bureau of land management logging planning decisions for lands inhabited by bird protected by the mbta22 in 1997 two circuitcourt decisions both involving forest service timber sales held that the mbta does not apply to federal agencies each circuit the eighth circuit in newton county wildlife assn v us forest service 23 and the eleventh circuit in sierra club v martin24 drew support for this conclusion from the 6 criminal penalties language that mentions any person association partnership or corporation terms that th courts concluded did not include the united states considerin g the mbta as whole they found violation of the mbta by the federal agencies which apparently means they concluded that 2 articulatin g what is unlawful behavio r also did not apply as matter of law however in humane society of the united states v glickman 25 involving department of agriculture g oose management plan the dist rict of columbia circuit ruled in favor of federalagency cove rage noting that 2 neither premises its prohibitions on the acts of any person nor makes an exception for federal agencies even assuming that person under the parate penalty provi sions of 6 does not reach federal agencies the court continued this is not dispositive in that the mbta can be enforced by means other than criminal penalties in particular by injunction the department of the interi or decided not to appeal humane society most recently the united states district court for the district of columbia in center for biological diversity v pirie 26 held that the united states had violated the mbta by its live fire military training activities that killed migratory birds on an island in the marianas without permit the court again noted that 2 addressing unlawful acts is worded generally and that relief other than criminal penalties was available in the form of injunctive relief the court initially ruled only on the liability issue asked for additional briefing on many questions including the availability and structuring of possible injunctive relief the court subsequently enjoined the navy from continuing its activities and required it to apply for permit from fws on june 5 2002 the court stayed the injuncti on thereby allowing training activities to continue and expedited the briefing schedule the mbta is unclear in other ways as well because the definition of take does not include harm or harass as does the the application of the act tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31415crs6

been some confusion between unintentional takes relevant to possible convictions under 6 of the act and incid ental takes where deliberate action taken for particular purpose also results in taking or killing these distinctions are important to military readiness activities where deadly force may be used that kills protected birds and destroys habitat but where such killing or destruction is not the purpose of the activities intent courts applying criminal statute may need to probe the scienter of defendant the defendants intent or knowledge of fact s that are elements of the crime intent in this sense may focus of whether defendant intended to do the acts that resulted in the harm regardless of whether the exact results that ensue were intended at times lay people confuse unintended used in the context of criminal provisions with incidental as that term is used in the meaning the actions were taken intentionally but were for different purpose courts have often concluded that intent is immaterial to misdemeanor vi olations under 6a of the mbta that if person commits acts that kill protected bird that is violation27 in contrast with the misdemeanor provision felony under 6b results only when the defendant knowingly eith er takes migratory bird w ith intent to sell or sells or attempts to sell such birds28 the word knowingly was added by 1986 amendment29 the navy in the pirie case may have confused unintentional acts with incidental acts when it essentially argued that it had not violated the mbta because it did not intend to kill birds in the sense that killing the birds was not the purpose of its actions the pirie court noted p 35 that the navy knew it was killing birds even though that was not the navys purpose that the mbta applies to both intentional and unintentional takings p 36 and that th prosecutorial discretion of the fws did not make the navys actions unreviewable p 44 direct vs indirect take other cases involve di scussions of possible mbta liability for direct vs indirect and incidental takes in seattle audubon society v evans 30 the ninth circuit addressed claims that the mbta prohibits the forest service and bureau of land management from logging timber from lands that may provide habitat for protected bird in rejecting this claim the court held that previous cases only addressed direct though unintended bird deaths they do

poachers however because this case involved criminal information alle ging electrocution of pr otected birds when they landed on defendants transmission lines the court had occasion to comment on whether its somethingmorethanhuntersandpoachers vi ew reached as far as habitat modification 35 sierra club v martin 110 f3d 1551 1555 11th cir 1997 in humane society of the united states v glickman 217 f3d 882 888 d c cir 2000 the court observed that the martin courts assumption that timber harvesting could violate the mbta is not shared by others 36 50 cfr 2141 37 50 cfr 2127suggest the ninth circuit said th at habitat destruction leading indirectly to bird deaths is taking under the mbta the court bolstered this conclusion by juxtaposing the mbta which does not incl ude harm with the which does in revealing contrast noted the court ne ither the mbta nor its regulations makes any mention of habitat modi fication rather mbta re gulations describe in the words of the court physical conduct of the sort engaged in by hunters and poachers conduct which was undoubtedly concern at the time of the statutes enactment in 191831 there evidently is even some confusion as to what constitutes direct harm since seattle audubon other cases have found taking s even for example for the harvesting of trees during nesting season which arguably killed birds directly32 the courts in both mahler and newton county33 quoted the conduct of the sort engaged in by hunters and poachers language from seattle audubon in seeming to rule out mbta coverage of timbering under any circumstances34 another post seattle audubon decision to the contrary merely assumed that timber cutting could violate the mbta and thus is weak precedent35 permits under 2 of the mbta those ta kes that are not permitted under the regulations are unlawful the pirie case faulted the navy for conducting its live fire training operations without permit alt hough the regulations set out many types of permits none currently spec ifically address dod traini ng or readiness activities evidently various dod activities have been permitted in the pa st under the permit to kill depredating birds36 but the fws denied permit for the training exercises in question in pirie special purpose permits37 may be issued for activities related to migratory birds which are otherwise outside the scope of the standard form permits if an applicant presents compelling jus tification however there are current standards for permitting or regulating military readiness and training activities and this permit has not been used to date the pirie court noted that the fws had refused to issue the navy permit because fws asserted that it lacked the authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31415crs8 38 section 3 of the mbta authorizes the secret ary to issue regulations but subject to the provisions of the act and in order to carry out the purposes of the conventions therefore the issue of the current authority of

march 20 2003 40 see note 4 suprato issue permits authorizing unintended conduct p 13 by which they appear to have meant incidental conduct if this remains the position of the fws special purpose permits may continue to be unavailable to the navy the court asked for additional briefing on the permit au thority of fws under the mbta and subsequently enjoined the navy from additional activities while also ordering the navy to apply for permit the court noted that fws had denied the permits in the past and therefore temporar injunction was appr opriate the court also stated that it would take prompt action if there were either administrative or congressional action may 1 2002 order at 1938 the navy has applied to fws for special purpose permit and action is cu rrently pending on june 5 2002 the court stayed its injunction thereby allowing tr aining activities to continue executive order an executive order signed by president clinton imposes additional obligations on federal agencies to protect migratory birds39 section 2 of the executive order defines take as defined in 50 cfr 101240 and as including both intentional and uninten tional take it defines i ntentional take as take that is the purpose of the activity in question nd unintentional take as take that results from but is not the purpose of the activity in question again confusing unintentional and incidental takes the order then commands each federal agency whose actions are likely to have measurable negative effect on migratory birds to enter into memorandum of understanding with the fish and wildlife service to the extent permitted by law to minimize the intentional take of species of concern and lessen the amount of unintentional take the executive orders definition of take is not dispositive for purposes of divining the meaning of tak as used in the mbta of course though court might accord it some persuasive valuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31415crs9 41 hrept 107436 at 294 2002 42 hrept 107436 at 295 2002107th congress house bills section 311 of hr 4546 as passed by house changes to the mbta sections 311 and 312 of hr 4546 as passed by the house would have amended the mbta and respectivel it will be recalled that the pirie case found that the military training activities of the navy conducted on an island in the marianas violated 2 of the mbta evidently according to that case the navy in that instance was conducting operations without permit based on the initial position of the fws that the fws lacked the authority to issue permit for incidental taking of protected birds the training activities in question are seen as crucial to the navy and are frequent and recurring type of activity not easily accommodated under the current system the fws later c oncluded that it did have the authority to issue permits section 311 would have amended 3 of the mbta which authorizes the secretary of the interior to promulgate regulations to implement the act by adding new subsection that defines military readiness activity and provides that section 2 shall not apply to the incidental taking of migratory bird by member of the armed forces during military readiness ac tivity authorized by the secretary of defense or the secretary of the military department concerned emphasis added because 2 of the mbta as discusse d above sets out what behavior is unlawful under that act 311 would appear to have made all incidental take of migratory birds during military readiness activities lawful the provision did not require the military to prioritize readiness activities or to avoid or minimize harm nor was any permitting process established or required despite committee report language to that effect41 if 2 did not apply to readiness activities arguably there was nothing that needed permit these provisions were changed significantly in the final enactment see the disc ussion of p l 107314 below section 312 of hr 4546 changes to the section 312 of hr 4546 as passed by the house would have elimin ated the designation of critical habitat on military lands that were subject to an integrated natural resources management plan inrmp under the sikes act42 and if the secretary determined that such plan addressed special manageme nt considerations or prot ection as those terms are used in section 35ai two requirement s that were somewhat vague as to what might be required this provision was not enacted but similar provisions are contained in the administrations proposal in the 108th congress and are discussed more fully under that part of this repor t in addition although the currently allows the secretary to consider all relevant impacts during the designation process 312 would have added the impact on national security after thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31415crs10 43 section 3 of s 911 would also add language to require consideration of the impacts to military training and operations as part of the designation of critical habitat processeconomic impact thereby expressly requiri ng consideration of national security issues during any designation process43 senate bills s 2514 reported by the nate armed services co mmittee did not contain and mbta provisions however s 2225 did contain such provisions which are discussed here section 1201 of s 2225 would have added new chapter to title 10 of the united states code to address the relationship of military readiness activities to the and mbta and certain other topi cs beyond the scope of this report new 2016 would have adde d definitions of military readiness activities and combat or combat use that were similar to those in the house bill provisions new 2017 would have addr essed the and the mbta and marine mammal prot ection as well as to the 2017a would have stated that completion of an inrmp under the sikes act that addresses endangered or threatened species and their habitat per would provide the special management considerations or protections that are part of the definition of what might constitute critical habitat in the the in rmp plan s 2225 continues precludes designation of critical habitat for the lands or areas covered by the sikes act plan this provision differs from the house ve rsion in that it expressly requires completed sikes act plan but is similar to the house language in that it would eliminate critical habitat designation on those lands if there is an inrmp that addresses species therefore the comme nts made above with respect to the this language apply to the senate provision as well mbta provisions new 2017b would have provided that dod military readiness activities would be authorized w ithout further action by the secretary of the interior provided that dod must minimize taking of migratory birds to the extent practical and necessary to further the purposes of the act by which it is not clear whether the mbta or the new stat ute is intended without diminishment of military training or other capabilities as determined by the department this language might have eliminated the issuance of permit by the secretary of the interior for dod military readine ss activities it also required dod to minimize taking of migratory birds to th extent practical and necessary without diminishment of military training or other capabilities it is not clear to what extent the without diminishment wording might affect the number of takings the remainder of the sentence refers to takings resulting from military training or other capabilities and it is not clear what activities were encompassed within this phrasing since only military readiness activities was defined in the bill therefore the scope of the waiver was not clear in addition the relevant determinations were to be made by the department

authority involve such things as failure of dod to implement conservation measures or to conduct mutually agreed upon monito ring or to provide information proposal to withdraw author ization must be made in writing and provided to the secretary of defense dod may notify the s ecretary of the interior of any objections and possibly also meet with the secretary withdrawal proposals or suspensions

defense is defined as including the department of homeland security dhs with respect to military readiness activities of the united states coast guard but some of the substantive provisions of the

is silent as to i ssues but the explanatory material in the conference report states that while compliance with environmental laws is expected unique challenges often face the armed forces one of which is the balancing of habitat protection with necessary activities the conference report calls for the secretary of defense to pr ovide the relevant committees with recommendations for legislative proposals the secretary considers necessary to accomplish avoidance of designation of cr itical habitat on base s that could affect military training through protections provided by integrated natural resources management plans and r ecommendations on pursuing cooperative approach in managing natural and cultura l resources throughout the ar med forces the relevant text of the conference report reads as follows the conferees believe that all federal agencies including the armed forces should be required to comply with all federal environmental laws however due to their unique military training and operational responsibilities the armed forces often face unique challenges in balancing the obligations to comply with environmental laws and sustain military re adiness examples of these challenges include increasing limitations and restrictions on lands and waters which are currently set aside for military traini ng exercises as well as significanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31415crs13 48 hrept 107772 at h8452restrictions on the times and conditions under which military training exercises can be conducted the conferees are concerned that future designations of critical habitat on military training ranges could have an adverse impact on the militarys readiness capabilities the conferees strongly endorse the consultative process through which the military services work with the fish and wildlife service to ensure the protection of threatened and endangered species by adopting effective integrated natural resources management plans at military installations the conferees are concerned that questions have been raised regarding whether the protections provided by these integrated natural resources management plans such as the one at marine corps base camp pendlet on california are sufficient to avoid the need for future designations of cr itical habitat that could adversely affect military training nevertheless the conf erees encourage the department of the interior and the department of defense to pursue cooperative approach in managing natural and cultural resources throughout the armed forces the conferees direct the secretary of defense to provide the committees on armed services of the senate and the house of representatives recommendations for any legislative proposals that he considers necessary to accomplish these stated goals48 108th congress the administration submitted legislative proposal to the 108th congress that again addressed the designation of critical habitat on department of defense lands the proposal stated that an integrated natural resources management plan inrmp completed under the sikes ac t improvement act for lands or other geographical areas owned or controlled by dod or signated for its use that addresses endangered or threatened species and thei r habitat provides the special management considerations or protec tion required under the and precludes designation of critical habitat for the lands but does not eliminate the 7 requirement to consult on actions likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species the full text of the administrations proposal reads 2017 military readiness and the conservation of protected species the completion of an integrated natural resources management plan pursuant to the sikes act improvement act 16 usc 670a for lands or other

critical habitat be designated for all listed species to the maximum extent prudent and determinable the prudent and determinable language functions as an exception to the absolute requirement for designation that otherwise applies critical habitat might not be designated if it is not determinable as for example if so little is known about species or is not prudent for example if there are only 12 individuals left of one species on very limited habitat and collectors might destroy them if their locati on were known hr 1588 as reported would have stricken the prudent and determinable language and substituted necessary this change would have eliminated the general requi rement that critical habitat be designated in every case subject to the two exceptions discussed above and substituted determination by the secretary concerned that designati on is necessary for that species even if designation were necessary there would have been exception if the secretary determined that designation would not be prudent these would have been significant changes and would have applied to all designations not just those on dod lands the language was deleted before passage 52 pl 86797 74 stat 1052

important differences that will be discussed and also added an additional express requirement that impacts on national security be considered when critical habitat is designated current law recognizes that habitat destruction is very important factor in the endangerment of species49 and the appropriate secretary is to designate critical habitat which is defined in part as areas in which are found physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the species and which may require special management considera tions or protection50 the appropriate secretary is to designate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific data available and after taking into consideration the economic impact and any other relevant impact of specifying any particular area as critical habitat the secretary also may exclude any area from designation if he dete rmines that the benefits of ex clusion outweigh the benefits of specifying an area unless he determines ba sed on the best scientific and commercial data available that failure to designate an area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species concerned51 the sikes act52 requires planning process for military installations which are defined as any lands or inte rest in lands owned by the united states and administered by the secretary of defense or military department except those for civil works and includes all public lands withdrawn or reserved for use by the secretary of defense or military department53 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31415crs15 54 16 usc 670aa1a 55 16 usc 670aa1b 56 16 usc 670aa2 57 16 usc 670abthe sikes act planning process is not the same as the designation of critical habitat process under the under the sikes act the secretary of defense is directed to carry out program to provide for the conservation and rehabilitation of natural resources on military installations54 and the secretary of each military department is to prepare and implement an integrated natural resources management plan for each military installation unless an installation lacks significant natural resources55 these plans are to be developed in coopera tion with the secretary of the interior acting through the director of the fws and the head of each appropriate state fish and wildlife agency56 consistent with other federal law and consistent with the use of military

installation lands to support the military mission of the installation57 there are express standards or requirements w ith respect to endangered or threatened species and the presumably currently functions as an overlay of requirements when listed species are present in contrast critical habita t designation is developed based on the best available scientific information with the conservation of endangered species as the goal designation may include milita ry lands but without military preparedness as focus some have argued that clarification of the way in which the two purposes that of protecting endangered species and that of maintaining military training and readiness are to be reconciled would be advisable and that some means of prioritizing the military needs and better fac ilitating their accomplishment within parameters might also be desirable others assert that the need for special provisions has not been adequately demonstrated hr 1588 as passed by the house would have precluded desi gnation of critical habitat if the relevant secretary determines that an inrmp addresses special management considerations or protection as those rms are used in the addresses is general rm and the provision does not contain any standards with which compliance is required or which woul d establish equivalence with the special management considerations or protection referenced in the therefore there would appear to be broad administrative discretion in determining how much detail plan must contain to address listed species and provide protections and the adequacy of inrmps appears difficult for court to review several administrative interpretations bear on this legislative language the fws and others have asserted that designation of critical habitat provides

extent this assertion appears to be true it arises from fws regulation that has now been held to be unlawful it will be recalled that under the federal ag encies must consult on actions that either might jeopardize species or cause the destruction or dverse modification of critical habitat however the fws has conflated these two dutie s by defining destruction or adverse modification as meaning direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of listed species 59 and then interpreting this last phrase as essentially meaning survival and therefore as being synonymous with jeopardy in most instances60 because it conflated two statutory require ments the agency then concludes that designation of critical habitat generally adds nothing that is not already covered by the jeopardy concept as result the fws has gi ven designation very low priority61 substituting instead general agency assertions that agency consideration of habitat needs and effects has been adequate howe ver the courts have found that the agency does have duty to designate critical habitat62 and the regulation in question has been held to be unlawful the united states court of appeal s for the fifth circuit has held63 that 50 cfr 40202 is facially invalid in that it requires consultation with respect to an agencys destruction of critical habitat if both survival as well as recovery of species is affected which standard devol ves to jeopardy standard in practice in almost all cases the court noted that the defines critical habitat as that which is essential for the conserva tion ie recovery of species much more generous standard that could encompass more hab itat by equating struction of critical habitat with

arguably may raise important issues also the defines critical habitat as areas on which are found those physical or biological feat ures i essential to the conservation of the species and ii which may require special management considerations or protection and emphasis added the fws s interpreted this language65 as meaning that if management plan exists that provides sp ecial management nd protection measures for an area that area long er meets the definition of critical habitat and cannot be designated special management and protection for th species are not required if adequate management and protection are already in place adequate management or protection is provided by legally operative planagreement that addresses the maintenance and improvement of the primary constituent elements important to the species and that manages for the l ongterm conservation of the species we consider several factors to determine if plan provides adequate management or protection these factors ar 1 whether there is current plan specifying the management actions and wh ether such actions provide sufficient conservation benefit to the species 2 wh ether the plan provides assurances that the conservation management strategies will be implemented and 3 whether the plan provides assurances that the conservation management strategies will be effective ie provide for periodic monitoring adaptive management and revisions as necessary if all of these criteria are met then the lands covered under the plan would likely longer meet the definition of critical habitat and designation would l onger be appropriate66 recent district court case has said of the analogous situation of management plans on forest service and tribal lands that this fws interpretation of the definition of critical habitat is nonsensical67 and tortured construction httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31415crs18 68 id at 1100 69 id at 1103 70 16 usc 15323impermissible and contrary to law68 the court felt the statutory language meant that habitat that may need special mana gement and protections was eligible for critical habitat designation regardless of whether other speci management and protection might be provided the court further noted that the fws interpretation would eliminate crucial part of the 7 consultation requirement that federal agencies consult on adverse modification of critical habitat and that other recent court cases on related matters should have put fws on notice that its approach was untenable and in cont ravention of the esa69 as passed by the house hr 1588 woul d have amended the to essentially incorporate the fws interpretation of the finition of critical habitat that the courts have questioned the bill states that the secretary of interior or commerce shall not designate dod lands as critical hab itat that are subject to an inrmp if the secretary determines that such plan addresses special management considerations or protection as those terms are used in the emphasis added as discussed in the preceding section of this report however at least one court has now determined that the fws reading of those terms is not how they actually are used in the act hr 1588 expressly required considera tion of the impact on national security whenever the secretary considers designating critical habitat the housepassed bill also would have preserved the duty to c onsult under 7 of the and to comply with the prohibitions of 9 of that act s 1050 as passed on may 22 2003 would have precluded designation of critical habitat on dod lands if the secr etary determined in writing that the management activities identified in an inrmp would effectively conserve listed species in the area covered by the plan and that the plan provides assurances that adequate funding will be pr ovided for such management activities the effectively conserve language arguably would have im posed more strict requirement than the current interpretation of fws under the all federal agencies have general duty to conserve species which means to bring them to the point wh ere they longer need the protections of the act ie to recover them70 critical habitat is that which is essential to the conservation of the species the sena language by requiring that the management activities identified in an inrmp effectively conserve listed species arguably is broad and addre sses the general duty to cons erve rather than speaking only to some requirement equivalent to designating critical habitat the senate provision would have been an addition to title 10 of the united states code rather than an amendment to the and only addressed the secretary of interior and not esarelated actions that might be taken by the secretary of commerce the senate language also would not affect the require ment to consult under 7 of the but did not add an express requirement to c onsider impacts on national security to the elements that must be weighed in designating critical habitathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31415crs19 71 hrept 108354 at 668 2003pl 108136 the enacted language on critical habita t differs from both the house and senate bills section 318a of pl 108136 preclude s the designation of critical habitat on lands owned or controlled by the department of defense or designated for its use that are subject to an inrmp under the si kes act if the secretary determines in writing that such plan provides benefit to the species for which critical habitat is proposed for designation this langua ge is somewhat ambiguous in that most dod lands are subject to having an in rmp under the sikes act assuming that the intended meaning is that the dod lands have in place completed inrmp that plan must be determined to provide be nefit to listed species arguably low threshold for the secretary to demonstrate the conference report states this approach would allow for balance between military training requirements and protection of endangered or threatened species as pertains to pending or future critical habitat designations the conferees would expect the secretary of the interior to assess an inrmps potential contribution to species conservation giving due regard to those habitat protection maintenance and improvement projects and other related activities specified in the plan that address the particular conservation and protection needs of the species for wh ich critical habitat would otherwise be proposed consistent with current practi ce the secretary would establish criteria that would be used to determine if an inrmp benefits the listed species for which critical habitat would be proposed71 the report language refers to species fo r which critical habitat would otherwise be proposed but the statutor language refers to species for which critical habitat is proposed the wording contained in th report is probably what was intended but the enacted language arguably requires form proposal of critical habitat before the findings as to inrmp c overage can be made section 318a also adds language to sec tion 4a3 of the that states that nothing in that paragraph relating to non designation of criti cal habitat on dod lands affects the requirement to consult under secti on 7a2 of the though it appears the new language would affect consultation in that there could be consultation regarding adverse modification of critical habitat if critical habitat is designated on dod lands where some ag ency action is proposed consultation would still occur on actions likely to jeopardize listed species and the prohibitions of 9 on takings also remain and as di scussed takings coul d include harming species through destruction of its habitat th at kills or injures directly or through certain behavioral changes although the change would eliminate one subject of consultation adverse effects on critical habitat the consultation process may still result in the modification of proposed agen cy actions or in jeopardy opinion being rendered on other grounds such that military agency might still need to consider going through the exemption processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31415crs20 72 in contrast the
