access may have on the economic development of rural america concern has been raised over digital divide between rural and urban or suburban areas with respect to broadband deployment while there are many examples of rural communities with state of the art telecommunications facilities recent surveys and studies have indicated that in general rural areas tend to lag behind urban and suburban areas in broadband deployment citing the lagging deployment of broadband in many rural areas congress and the administration acted in 2001 and 2002 to initiate pilot broadband loan and grant programs within the rural utilities service rus at the us department of agriculture usda subsequently section 6103 of the farm security and rural in vestment act of 2002 pl 107171 amended the rural electrification act of 1936 to authorize loan and loan guarantee program to provide funds for the costs of the construction improvement and acquisition of facilities and equipment for broadband service in eligible rural commun ities currently rususda houses the only two federal assistance programs exclusively dedicated to financing broadband deployment the rural broadband access loan and loan guarantee program and the community connect grant program the 110 th congress considered reauthorization and modification of the program as part of the farm bill the food conservation and energy act of 2008 became law on june 18 2008 pl 110246 title vi rural development contains authorizing language for the broadband loan program meanwhile on may 11 2007 rus released proposed rule seeking to revise the broadband loan program rules and regulations some key issues pertinent to consideration of the rus broadband programs include restrictions on applicant eligibility how rural is defined with respect to eligible rural communities how to address assistance to areas with preexisting broadband service technological neutrality funding levels and mechanisms and the appropriateness of federal assistance the final rule will reflect language in the enacted farm bill statute pl 110246 ultimately modification of rules regulations or criteria associated with the rus broadband program will likely result in winners and losers in terms of which companies communities regions of the country and technologies are eligible or more likely to receive broadband loans and grants on january 21 2009 the house appropriations committee approved legislative language for the spending portion of the economic stimulus pack age american recovery and reinvestment bill of 2009 the legislation would provide 6 bi llion to support deployment of broadband and wireless services in rural unserved and underserved areas of the nation of the total 2825 billion would be provided to rus as additional funding for its existing loan loan

are intended to accelerate the deployment of broadband services in rural america broadband refers to highspeed internet access for private homes commercial establishments schools and public institutions currently in the united states broadband is primarily provided via cable modem from the local provider of cable television service or over the telephone line digital subscriber line or dsl other broadband technologies include fiber optic cable fixed wireless satellite and broadband over power lines bpl broadband access enables number of beneficial applications to individual users and to communities these include ecommerce telecommu ting voice service voice over the internet protocol or voip distance learning telemedici ne public safety and others it is becoming generally accepted that broadband access in community can play an important role in economic development february 2006 study by the massachusetts institute of technology for the department of commerces economic development administration marked the first attempt to measure the impact of broadband on economic growth the study found that between 1998 and 2002 communities in which massmarket broadband was available by december 1999 experienced more rapid growth in employment the number of businesses overall and businesses in itintensive sectors relative to comparable communities without broadband at that time 1 subsequently june 2007 report from the brookings institution found that for every one percentage point increase in broadband penetration in state employment is projected to increase by 02 to 03 per year for the entire us private nonfarm economy the study projected an increase of about 300000 jobs assuming the economy is not already at full employment2 access to affordable broadband is viewed as pa rticularly important for the economic development of rural areas because it enables individuals and businesses to participate fully in the online economy regardless of geographical location for example aside from enabling existing businesses to remain in their rural locations broadband access could attract new business enterprises drawn by lower costs and more desirable lifestyle essentially broadband potentially allows businesses and individuals in rural america to live locally while competing globally in an online environment given the large potential impact broadband may have on the economic development of rural america concern has been raised over digital divide between rural and urban or suburban areas with respect to broadband deployment while there are many examples of rural 1 gillett sharon massachusetts institute of technology measuring broadbands economic impact report prepared for the economic development administration us department of

recent surveys and studies have indicated that in general rural areas tend to lag behind urban and suburban areas in broadband deployment for example september 2004 department of commerce report nation online entering the broadband age found that lower percentage of internet households have broadband in rural areas 247 than in urban areas 404 and that while broadband usage has grown significantly in all areas since the previous survey the ruralurban differential continues 4 the report also found that broadband penetration rates are higher in the west and northeast than in the south and midwest5 may 2006 report released by the gove rnment accountability office gao found that 17 of rural households subscribe to broadband as opposed to 28 of suburban and 29 of urban households6 gao also found that lower broadband subscription rates in rural areas are related to availability not to lesser tendency of rural households to purchase broadband service7 2008 data from the pew internet american life project indicate that while broadband adoption is growing in urban suburban and rural areas broadband users make up larger percentages of urban and suburban users than rural users pew found that the percentage of all us adults with broadband at home is 60 for suburban areas 57 for urban areas and 38 for rural areas 8 according to the latest fcc data on the deployment of highspeed internet connections released january 2009 as of december 31 2007 highspeed subscribers were reported in 99 of the most densely populated zip codes as opposed to 90 of zip codes with the lowest population densities9 the comparatively lower population density of rural areas is likely the major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly populated suburban and urban areas particularly for wireline broadband technologiessuch as cable modem and dslthe greater the geographical distances among customers the larger the cost to serve those customers for example in providing telecommunications services investment per subscriber in rural systems averages 2921 compared to 1920 for urban 10 thus there is often less incentive for companies 3 see for

area where there is more demand more customers with perhaps higher incomes and less cost to wire the market area the terrain of rural areas can also be hindrance in that it is more expensive to deploy broadband technologies in mountainous or heavily forested area an additional added cost factor for remote areas can be the expense of backhaul eg the middle mile which refers to the installation of dedicated line which transmits signal to and from an internet backbone which is typically located in or near an urban area cable modem and dsl currently comprise about 84 of residential broadband deployment nationwide 11 however because of the challenges of deploying these technologies in low population density areas other broadband technologies have been identified as perhaps offering potential in rural areas these include mobile wireless cellular fixed wireless wimax wifi satellite and broadband over powerlines bpl

are currently the only federal programs exclusively dedicated to deploying broadband infrastructure however there exist other federal programs that provide financial assistance for various aspects of telecommunications development 24 though not explicitly or exclusively devoted to broadband many of those programs are used to help deploy broadband technologies in rural areas for example since 1995 the rus rural telephone loan and loan guarantee programwhich has traditionally financed telephone voice service in rural areas under 5000 inhabitantshas required that all telephone facilities receiving financing must be capable of providing dsl broadband service at rate of at least 1 megabyte per second25 an october 2006 survey of rus traditional telephone loan program borrowers found that 92 of those borrowers were providing broadband to all of the telephone exchanges in their service territories 26 the rus distance learning and telemedici ne grants program is used to support

rural areas is the universal service fund usf27 subsidies provided by usfs schools and libraries program and rural health care program are used for variety of telecommunications services including broadband access while the usfs high cost program does not explicitly fund broadband infrastructure subsidies are used in many cases to upgrade existing telephone networks regarding the usf high cost program the congressional budget office has found that current policy implicitly provides funds for broadband in rural areas adding that whether such upgrades are motivated by the intention to provide broadband or better conventional telephone service is not immediately clear however the fact that wireline carriers as whole have been losing subscribers and longdistance revenue over the past half decade suggests that at least part of the new investment in local loops has been made with the expectation of generating revenue from broadband subscriptions 28 in the 110th congress legislation to

program is that not enough loans are approved thereby making it difficult for rural communities to take full advantage of the program as of may 1 2007 the broadband loan program had received 198 applications requesting total of 43 billion in loans of these 69 applications were approved totaling 121 billion 21 were in review totaling 950 million and 108 had been returned totaling 214 billion 33 according to rus officials 28 of available loan money was awarded in 2004 and only 5 of available loan money was awarded in 200534 the loan application process has been criticized as being overly complex and burdensome requiring applicants to spend months preparing costly market research and engineering assessments many applications are rejected because the applicants business plan is deemed insufficient to support commercially viable business the biggest reason for applications being returned is insufficient credit support whereby applicants do not have sufficient cashonhand one years worth is required in most cases the requirement for cashonhand is viewed as particularly onerous for small start up companies many of whom lack sufficient capital to qualify for the loan such companies critics assert may be those entities most in need of financial assistance in report language to the fy2006 department of agriculture appropriations act pl 10997 the senate appropriations committee srept 10992 directed the rus to reduce the burdensome application process and make the program requirements more reasonable particularly in regard to cashonhand requirements the committee also directed usda to hire more fulltime employees to remedy delays in application processing times at may 17 2006 hearing held by the senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry the administrator of the rus stated that rus is working to make the program more user friendly while at the same time protecting taxpayer investment as good stewards of the taxpayers money we must make

the loan application process that we have developed sures that the applicant addresses these areas and that appropriate resources are available for maintaining viable operation 35 according to rus the loan program was initia lly overwhelmed by applications particularly during two week period in august 2003 and as the program matures application review times have dropped36 on may 11 2007 rus

criteria for applicant eligibility has been criticized both for being too broad and for being too narrow an audit report released by usdas office of inspector general ig found that the programs focus has shifted away from those rural communities that would not without government assistance have access to broadband technologies 38 specifically the ig report found that the rus definition of rural area has been too broad to distinguish usefully between suburban and rural communities39 with the result that as of march 10 2005 1034 million in loans and grants nearly 12 of total funding awarded had been awarded to 64 communities located near large cities the report cited examples of affluent suburban subdivisions qualifying as rural areas under the program guidelines and receiving broadband loans40 on the other hand eligibility requirements have also been criticized as too narrow for example the limitation of assistance only to communities of 20000 or less in population excludes small rural towns that may exceed this limit and also excludes many municipalities seeking to deploy their own networks41 similarly per capita income requirements can preclude higher income communities with higher costs of living eg rural alaska and the limitation of grant programs only to underserved areas excludes rural communities with existing but very limited broadband access 42 35 testimony of jim

broadband access statute 7 usc 950bb specifies that the program shall give priority to eligible rural communities in which broadband service is not available to residential customers the ig report found that rus too often has given loans to communities with existing broadband service the ig report found that rus has not ensured that communities without broadband service receive first priority for loans and that although rus has system in place to prioritize loans to unserv ed communities the system lacks cutoff date and functions as rolling selection processpriorities are decided based on the applicants who happen to be in the pool at any given moment 43 the result is that significant number of communities with some level of preexisting broadba nd service have received loans according to the ig report of 11 loans awarded in 2004 66 of the associated communities served by those loans had existing service according to rus 31 of communities served by all loans during the period 2003 through early 2005 had preexisting competitive service not including loans used to upgrade or expand existing service 44 in some cases according to the ig report loans were issued to companies in highly competitive business environments where multiple providers competed for relatively few customers45 at the may 1 2007 hearing before the house subcommittee on specialty crops rural deve lopment and foreign agriculture rus administrator james andrews testified that of the 69 broadband loans awarded since the programs inception 40 of the communities approved for funding were unserved at the time of loan approval and an additional 15 had only one broadband provider 46 awarding loans to entities in communities with preexisting competitive service has raised criticism from competitors who already offer broadband to those communities according to the national cable and telecommunications associat ion ncta rus loans are being used to unfairly subsidize second and third broadband providers in communities where private risk capital already has been invested to provide broadband service47 critics argue that providing loans in areas with preexisting competitive broadband service creates an uneven playing field and discourages further private investment in rural broadband48 in response rus stated in the ig report that its policies are in accordance with the statute and that they address the need for competition to increase the quality of services and reduce the cost of those services to the consumer 49 rus argues that the presence of competitor does not necessarily mean that an area is adequately served and additionally that in order for some borrowers to maintain viable business in an unserved area it may be necessary for that company to also be serving more densely populated rural areas where some level of competition already exists50 43 ibid p 13 44 ibid p 14 45 ibid p 15 46 testimony of james andrew administrator rural utilitie s service us department of

program expired on september 30 2007 the 110th congress considered reauthorization of the program as part of the farm bill any modification of rules regulations or criteria associated with the rus broadband program will likely result in winners and losers in terms of which companies communities regions of the country and technologies are eligible or more likely to receive broadband loans and grants on may 11 2007 rus released proposed rule which seeks to revise regulations for the broadband loan program and address many of the criticisms of the program specifically the proposed rule addresses 1 funding in competitive markets and new eligibility requirements 2 new equity and market survey requirements and 3 new legal notice requirements to increase transparency 51 congress considered approaches in the proposed rule as part of formulating the rus broadband program reauthorization the final rule will reflect language in the farm bill statute pl 110 246 the following are some key issues pertinent to the reauthorization of the rus broadband programs

applicants due to stringent financial requirements eg the requirement that an applicant have years worth of cashonhand and an application processrequiring detailed business plans and market surveysthat some view as overly expensive and burdensome to complete during the reauthorization process congress considered whether the criteria for loan eligibility should be modified and whether more appropriate balance can be found between the need to make the program more accessible to unserved and often lowerincome rural areas and the need to protect taxpayers against bad loans the proposed rule issued by rus on may 11 2007 would substantially modify applicant eligibility restrictions first the proposed rule would eliminate the requirement for market survey for applicants proposing to serve 15 or less of community 52 second the existing credit support requirement would be replaced by an equity requirement under the proposed rule the equity requirement would be reduced from 20 to 10 for applicants proposing to serve areas where at least 40 of households have broadband access or service from only one provider additionally the current requirement for years worth of cashonhand would be eliminated instead once rus has completed its review of the loan application the applicant would be notified if additional cash requirements are needed to support the feasibility of the loan this would be the case if rus financial analysis indicates that cash from operations and previous cash infusions cannot sustain positive cash position throughout the forecast period finally the proposed rule seeks to give rus the authority to modify or waive the provisions of the equity requirement as long as those modifications do not result in projected negative cash position

definition of which communities qualify as rural has been changed twice by statute since the broadband loan program was initiated under the pilot program funds were authorized under the distance learning and telemedicine program which defines exceptionally rural areas under 5000 inhabitants rural areas between 5000 and 10000 and midrural areas between 10000 and 20000 rus determined that communities of 20000 or less would be eligible for broadband loans in cases where broadband services did not already exist in 2002 this definition was made narrower by the farm security and rural investment act pl 107171 which designated eligible communities as any incorporated or unincorporated place with fewer than 20000 inhabitants and which was outside any standard metropolitan statistical area msa the requirement that communities not be located within msas effectively prohibited suburban communities from receiving broadband loans however in 2004 the definition was again changed by the fy2004 consolidated appropriations act pl 108199 the act broadened the definition keeping the population limit at 20000 but eliminating the msa prohibition thereby permitting rural communities near large cities to receive loans thus the current definition used for rural communities is the same as what was used for the broadband pilot program except that loans can now be i ssued to communities with preexisting service the definition of what constitutes rural community is always difficult issue for congressional policymakers in determining how to target rural communities for broadband assistance on the one hand the narrower the defi nition the greater the possibility that deserving communities may be excluded on the other hand the broader the definition used the greater the possibility that communities not traditionally considered rural or underserved may be eligible for financial assistance the proposed rule released by rus on may 11 2007 would narrow the definition of an eligible rural community in addition to excluding cities or towns with populations over 20000 the proposed rule would exclude communities located within an urban area as defined by the bureau of the census as all territory population and housing units located within an urbanized area or an urban cluster also excluded is any area that has four or more existing broadband service providers excluding the applicant 54 related issue is the scope of coverage proposed by individual applications while many of the loan applications propose broadband projects offering service to multiple rural communities rus sees coming trend towards larger regional and national proposals covering hundreds or even more than thousand communities 55 the larger the scope of coverage the greater the complexity of the loan application and the larger the possible benefits and risks to taxpayers 53 ibid p 26754 54 ibid p 26751 55 rural utilities service private communication january 18 2007

awarded to entities serving areas without preexisting broadband service and while rus is directed by statute to give priority to eligible rural communities in which broadband service is not available to residential customers significant number of treasuryrate loans have been awarded in areas with preexisting service loans to areas with competitive preexisting servicethat is areas where existing companies already provide some level of broadbandhave sparked controversy because loan recipients are likely to compete with other companies already providing broadband service during reauthorization congress was asked to more sharply define whether andor how loans should be given to companies serving rural areas with preexisting competitive service 56 on the one hand one could argue that the federal government should not be subsidizing competitors for broadband service particularly in sparsely populated rural markets which may be able only to support one provider furthermore keeping communities with preexisting broadband service eligible may divert assistance from unserved areas that are most in need on other hand many suburban and urban areas currently receive the benefits of competition between broadband providerscompetition which can potentially drive down prices while improving service and performance it is therefore appropriate it is argued that rural areas also receive the benefits of competition which in some areas may not be possible without federal financial assistance it is also argued that it may not be economically feasible for borrowers to serve sparsely populated unserved communities unless they are permitted to also serve more lucrative areas which may already have existing providers the proposed rule released by rus on may 11 2007 would prohibit funding for any community where there are four or more existing broadband service providers to be recognized as an existing broadband service provider an incumbent service provider must provide evidence and certify to rus that 10 of the households passed by their facilities are purchasing their broadband service 57 applicants would be required to prepare legal notice stating the intent to offer broadband service in particular community the legal notice would be published on the rus web page incumbent providers would then have 30 days to submit information to rus which would be used to determine if the incumbent is classified as an existing broadband service provider58 new market entrants and startups as well as incumbent applicants seeking to expand their service area are required to enter areas where at least 40 of households either have broadband service or access to only one broadband service provider according to rus this requirement addresses the need to reach unserved or underserved areas while also permitting service to more lucrative areas which may be served by up to three existing service providers in order to attract feasible loan proposals which are supportable from project revenues permitting service in areas with up to three existing service providers addresses the need for applicants to leverage revenues from lowercost users typically those in more densely populated areas within city or town in order to provide service to rural 56 the statute 7 usc 950bb allows states and local governments to be eligible for loans only if other eligible

recommend modifications of rateofdata transmission criteria for purposes of the identification of broadband service technologies some have argued that the minimum speed thresholds should be raised to ensure that rural areas receive nextgeneration broadband technologies with faster data rates capable of more varied and sophisticated applications on the other hand significantly raising minimum data rates could exclude certain technologiesfor example typical data transmission rates for fiber and some wireless technologies exceed what is offered by current generation technologies such as dsl and cable proponents of keeping the minimum threshold at low level could argue that underserved rural areas are best served by any broadband technology that is economically feasible to deploy regardless

mandatory ccc funding mechanism provided in the 2002 farm bill should be retained eliminated or modified also at issue was whether the current funding levels for the rus broadband programs are optimal given the relatively low utilization of the broadband loan program should funding remain at current levels or below or alternatively if modifications are made to ensure fuller utilization and given the need to bridge the digital divide should funding be increased related issue was whether more money should be shifted from the broadband loan program to the community connect broadband grant

requires extensive amounts of capital loan program is more suited to supporting this kind of activity on july 21 2008 the senate appropriations committee reported the fy2009 agriculture appropriations
