6308c14 shspec294 auditing tips 1 audit to gain for result 2 the pc is always right 3 the significance is less important than the ta action 4 ta action on the right significance brings about faster clearing 5 the right significance and ta action equals case gain 6 keep the itsa line in 7 get ta action 8 when training an auditor get him to figure out how many ways you can cut an itsa line the smoothest auditing is the auditing which least cuts the itsa line auditor means listener 9 it takes lie to hold aberration in place 10 serious aberration surrenders easily its the mediocretype aberration that takes the long haul 11 the primary difference between scientology and psychiatry is that psychiatry is authoritarian and tells the person what is wrong with him often introducing new lie scientology finds out what is wrong with the person from the person and then knows more about it than the person but listens anyway 12 listening is the badge of superior knowledge he who has privileged to listen only he who has superior knowledge talks all the time with this data you could evolve all of scientology dont discount the knowledge of scientology even though you dont use it to evaluate for the pc if pc feels unreal about having lived for say 30 trillion years let him go through the unreality and run it out he will natter about how unreal it is he has never talked about an unreality before but in the process of talking about it he is raising his arc with whatever it is albeit slowly pc has two kinds of talk theta talk and entheta talk auditing consists of two actions corresponding to these two kinds of talk 1 listening with ta action this is getting theta talk out of the pc keeping the itsa line in it is theta the pc is generating that is blowing his bank apart 2 locating eg by assessment trapped charge entheta talk is handled by locating the impeded charge of theta which is barriered in the bank bpc this is the first step of putting in the itsa line find what trapped charge is trying to get loose the pc is talking up out of the bank he has been protesting cut communication lines unrealities and lack of affinity charge has been ticked and missed and the pc will go on nattering unless the auditor locates and indicates the charge what about talking havingness down this only occurs when it is entheta talk the whole phenomenon of havingness is raising arc with the environment if the pc is cutting his arc with the environment his havingness will drop how many ways can you cut an itsa line it would be beneficial to an auditor in training to give you all the ways he can think of it with an example of each and how to prevent or remedy it there are three parts to successful session 1 get the pc in session ie interested in his own case and talking about it 2 keep the itsa line in so that you get maximal ta action 3 knock out the significances necessary to resolve the case fastest the above would define the superskilled auditor you would get lower classes of auditors as you cut out parts of this until you end up at the bottom with book auditor whose skill is just to listen to the pc talk about his case with idea of ta or right significance when training auditors pound one significance home at time dont get complicated and you will win for instance on coaudit just keep the pc talking about himself dont worry about repeating the command or acknowledging etc all you want is the pc telling the auditor about his troubles you can see improvements if the pc looks brighter and talks better ie if he shows increased arc as you move the auditors skill up to using meter you want to get ta motion keeping the ta moving is the deepest problem in auditing at present this can get complex the reason ta stops is time the type of incident that is the most tastopping is the gpm especially after it has been redated crossdated or grouped in one of the betweenlives screens and after it has been mislocated if there were gpm probably nobody could group bank the gpm gets pinned down in the betweenlives screens and ta stops it is timestopper because it floats in time and appears instantaneous the auditing action that stops ta motion is wrong date it tends to group incidents if the incident is 3d visio and stays in the same place as you run it the date is ok if person is running different incidents at once he has wrong date if you wrongdate gym it is grim ta stops as if hit by truck it is possible to date gpm but the reads on dates are tiny because it is gpm and it is very rough to date it after you have dated gpm the date is as valid as you get ta if ta packs up the gpm is very likely to have been misdated you could find that you have to redate gpm when the pc gets off enough charge to spot that the first date was screen date your new date could still be only temporarily right you could go for seven sessions getting it dated which could be very fine if you kept the itsa line in and let the pc help you most of the track you see is real track but it is often invalidated false track is nothing because there really is false track there are false pictures but false track is just the dubin someone has put over his actual pictures if you invalidate someones track hard enough and hit him hard enough he puts dubin over the top of the picture which looks like the original except that it has little film over it as you audit it the film comes off and he sees the original picture the dubin is not very different from his own track actually the unreality the pc gets about the picture is the force and invalidation that has been laid in if you hit someone hard enough things get unreal down to unconsciousness unconsciousness is just total unreality so there are also arc break phenomena which prevent the meter from reading well that is one reason why the meter reads so little on gpms they are full of arc brokenness but if you just keep trying to date the gpm and dont cut the itsa line you will get ta having the itsa line in and blowing charge will increase the pcs reality on the incident to the point where the date is more and more real bundles of facsimiles will start to come apart if you just keep chewing at gpm in this way chewing at its date its pattern etc it will suddenly be there so clearly that you will wonder how you ever missed it you are getting enough charge off so that he can see it keeping the itsa line in while dating is very helpful but hard to do at times let the pc give you anything he can tell you about the date get all the ta out of it first and only go to the meter when the pc throws in the sponge then work it over and when it is all hopeless with the meter talk from the pc takes over keep at it persevere and relax it might take up to seven sessions to get the date the stable datum is that if you keep chewing away and trying to find it suddenly enough charge will disappear so it all folds up and you get it just keep him talking and he will come up with it but the more you ask the meter for the data the less you will win you can kill ta by evaluating because the itsa line is being put in for him dont put in the itsa line for the pc the meter gives you preview of coming attractions meter reads at deeper level of awareness than the pc when some charge is blown the pc will now see what the meter saw awhile earlier you say whatsit and the pc says itsa this is auditing but if the pc says whatsit and you use the meter to say itsa the ta folds up this will occur if you create meterdependency it is better if you must tell the pc what the meter says to present it as question if you put in the whatsit and get itsa from the meter you will get ta action if you have pc demanding information you can help him out it is more desirable to use the meter than to have the pc quit sometimes you have to snap in the itsa line try to get the pc certain before using the meter then you may use the meter but get the pcs agreement first as an itsa eg concerning the date you can work back and forth with the pc and the meter using the meter to jog the whatsit eg to get the order of magnitude then ask the pc if he gets anything let him find it if he asks does that read see if you can get him to say itsa eg by asking does it seem right to you then when he has said itsa you can confirm it with that reads one way to cut an itsa line is by continually asking for more than the pc can give for instance the pc says proudly ive got picture of some mountains the auditor says what kind of mountains are there any people or when the pc says i just cant find the date i dont have clue the auditor says well come on what is it this stretches an itsa line beyond its ability to stretch the situation is that you have bled off all the restimulation that was available so stir up little more by using the meter on one step or so of dating the pc easily invalidates his own reality and ability to know date dont above all use the meter to invalidate him it is better to leave the charge on something than to arc break the pc about it if he gives you date and asks for meter confirmation and there is read make it as ok as possible for instance you could say well i didnt see one there it doesnt say anything right now on that use your meter to give him the whatsit line and coax the itsa line at last resort all you have is your meter like when there is howling arc break and the pc isnt talking or thinking that applies to sessions where the pc is out of comm you can cut an itsa line to ribbons with arc break assessments as the drop of hat the value of the assessment is when all else has failed because the most operating thing you have around you is the pc the problem of how you discharge gpm without cutting the itsa line is tricky one what if he is going over one pair of items and the next pair comes up and he wants to go on if you leave bypassed charge on the items you are doing he will arc break one solution is to write down the new pair acknowledge them and then clean up the old pair the whatsit line raises ta the itsa lowers it the solution of mystery is the resolution of the case and the restoration of ta motion the pc is stuck on whatsit for which he has itsa when the ta quits the pc sometimes has his own whatsits he forgets the whatsit you gave him and never gives the itsa so you get high ta pcs do this all the time especially during break hence you could ask is there anything your attention is on or did you speculate about anything during the break the funny thing is that asising whatsits doesnt give you auditing you cant asis whatsits you could ask get the idea of questioning things repetitively this would give you high ta the bank is composed of cure to the problem or puzzle the reason that the puzzle is hung up is that there is something in it that was cure cures brought about problems to asis problems you have to pick up the cure which is the itsa the problem was the whatsit the cure is the itsa so you announce the confusion the pc gives you the stable datum and you get restoration of balance it blows off twoway comm blows all the locks off of engrams for instance if the pc says that he has big ptp you could ask when he became aware of it what solutions he has had for it etc so you need to find the whatsit and the itsa problem is in microcosm gpm you could ask what have you been puzzled about what answers might there have been to it auditing questions must balance between announcing the puzzle and asking for the cure
