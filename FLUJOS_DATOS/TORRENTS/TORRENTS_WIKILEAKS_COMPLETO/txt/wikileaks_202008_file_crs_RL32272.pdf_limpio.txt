jockeying for greater selfrule and autonomy some observers suggest th at the apparent strengthening of russian nationalism as result of the state duma election and the strengthening of the security

ambassador to ru ssia alexander vershbow in january 2004 russias operations in chechnya lead to needless suffering of the civilian population they are not holding enough of their own troops accountable when they commit excesses44 on other issues several analysts have discerned shifts in administration policy in recent years perhaps spurred to some degree by the moscow theater siege in late 2002 and steppedup terrorist bombings throughout russia in 2003 and 2004 us concerns before the iraq conflict with ga ining russias support concerns afterward with terrorist attacks within iraq on coalition forces and concerns about the replacement of the moderate maskhadov with sadulayev who is an islamic fundamentalist with close and clear links to basayev so may have contributed to the shifts there appeared to be fewer administration suggestions to russia that it should open peace talks with separatists mo re tolerance for russias argument that it was battling terrorism in chechnya
