million or 27 above the fy 2004 enacted level the president signed the omnibus bill on december 8 2004 as pl108447 figures in this report do not include an acrosstheboard cut of 080 that will reduce hud appropriations by approximately 256 million with th is reduction the increase from fy2004 to fy2005 would be about 582 million or 19 huds largest program the housing certificate fund contains the section 8 rental voucher program central to the administrations proposed fy2005 budget was controversial initiative the flexible voucher program fvp that would have significantly revised the s ection 8 voucher program public housing authorities phas would longer be reimbursed ba sed on their number and cost of inuse vouchers but would be given lump sum of money block grant to assist any households with incomes up to 80 of th local area median lowincome housing advocates contended that this change and the level of proposed funding could require phas either to reduce the number of families assisted increase the average rent that voucher holders pay or shift assistan ce away from the poores t of the poor hud countered that the fvp proposal would provi an incentive for phas to control the rapidly rising costs of housing vouchers nd phas that are good managers would be rewarded with performancebased incentives the administration requested almost 1 billion less for the fvp than provided in the previous year for vouchers congress did not adopt the fvp but c ontinued with dollarbased funding practice first adopted in fy2004 that pr ovides some constraint on spending however the final funding law provided 16 billion more for section 8 than the requested level to pay for this signif icant increase all other hud programs were reduced below their fy2004 appropriati on levels for

national defense1 section 8 vouchers huds fy2005 budget proposed to liminate the section 8 voucher program and replace it with new grant program called the flexible voucher program fvp the f unding requested for this new program was about 1 billion less than the voucher pr ogram received last year and it was estimated to be more than 1 billion less than what would be needed to maintain the voucher program at its current level if the fvp proposal was not adopted2 according to hud the fvp proposal would provide an incentive for public housing authorities phas to control the rapidly rising costs of housing vouchers under fvp phas would receive fixed budget nd would be subject to fewer regulations compared to the current program under wh ich phas are reimbursed based on their estimated costs and are subject to number of federal rules and regulations low income housing advocates contend that this change could require phas to either reduce the number of families assisted incr ease the average rent that voucher holders pay or shift assistance away from the poorest of the poor similar initiative was rejected by congress in fy2004 neither hr 5041 s 2825 nor the final consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 adopts the fvp proposal and all three increase funding for the sec tion 8 program above the fy2004 level hope vi funding was proposed for hope vi public housing

the program including many members ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32443crs4 congress contend that the program has b een successful in replacing some of the most dilapidated housing projects with ne w mixedincome housing and that it needs to be continued the house reco mmended 143 million the nate recommended 150 million and the final consolidated ppropriations act p l 108447 provides 144 million

committee passed an amended hr 3755 the administration says that homeo wnership for lowerincome and minority families helps create stable living environment for children and allows these families to

program faced the largest cut over 1 billi on from last years level the projectbased section 8 program would have received modest increase in funding the voucher program has experienced rapid cost increas over the past several years due to among other factors increasing housing cost s increasing utilization rates congresss authorization of additiona l vouchers and prog rammatic and policy changes designed to increase utilization and deconcentrat poverty the fy2005 proposed budget cut coincides with the presidents initiative to reform the voucher pr ogram by converting it into new grant program called the flexible voucher program described below the house appropriations committee would have funded the combined section 8 program at almost 700 milli on above last years leve l and 16 billion above the presidents requested level the report language specifi ed that the amount provided in the bill for the voucher program would be the total funding available and that the secretary would be prohibited from augmen ting the program budget with funds from other sources the senate bill would have provided almost 2 billion more than the presidents requested level and given the secretary the discretion to use recaptured funds to augment the program if necessa ry the enacted funding bill pl 108447 provides over 20 billion to the program lmost 18 billion more than the

fy2004 agencies r eceived budget based on fixed number of vouchers and fixed cost for those vouchers as spe lled out in the appropriations law dollarbased or budgetbased funding voucher costs were fixed for fy2004 at the august 1 2003 level plus an adjustment for inflation for some agencies whose costs had increased significantly over the pr evious year this budget change provided them with less funding than they actually n eeded to maintain their programs at their previous levels as result many agencies had to make costsaving adjustments in their programs such as not reissuing vouchers when families leave the program andor cutting the rent paid to landlords the house bill directed the secretary to continue the practice of dollarbased funding for phas in fy2005 but unlike fy 2004 the bill did not spell out formula for distributing the funds the house appropriations committee bill also proposed to split the housing certificate f und into two accounts tenantbased rental assistance and projectbased rental assistance s 2825 also proposed to continue the pr actice of budgetbased funding in the voucher program the bill directed the secr etary to fund phas based on fixed cost which would be established using phas costs as reported on their most recent end of the year financial statements adjusted for any additional information submitted by the phas as of october 1 2004 plus an inflation factor the senate billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32443crs9 proposed inflation factor wa s more broadly defined than the one adopted in fy2004 the senate bill did not propose to split the hcf

of their budget levels within 45 days of passage like the house bill pl 108447 splits the hcf into two accounts the conference report states that the reason for the split is to provide better transparency and oversight of expenditures within the accounts housing certificate fund rescission each year portion of the cost of the housing certificate fund is offset by recapture of unobligated balances from previous years for fy2004 the presidents budget indicated that just under 14 billion would be available in such bala nces for rescission however congress rescinded double that amount in fy2004 over 28 billion the additional funds were estimated to be available as the result of savings fro m onetime accounting change enacted in the program in fy2005 the presidents budget indicated that over 15 billion would be available for rescission from prior year s unobligated balances the house appropriations committee bill would have rescinded th at amount s 2825 proposed to rescind over

the senate appropriations committee bill also did not adopt the fvp proposal the committee report expressed skepticism about the administrations proposal finally the committee does not agree with the administrations belief that the section 8 program is so flawed that it cannot be corrected without conversion of the program into block grant to the states or to public housing agencies without commitment of adequate funding the block grant approach will result in shrinking commitment to housing res ources for those with the greatest needs the final consolidated appropriations act pl 108447

mortgages for multifamily rental housing and for an assortment of special purpose loans such as hospitals and nursing homes as shown in table 16 below fha has negative appropriations which means that the income to the program from insurance premiums exceeds the program expenses this suggests that in fy 2004 the fha program contributed about 2479 billion to the total hud budget another way to look at it is that because of the surplus generated by fha hud need ed 2479 billion less in appropriations in fy2004 as requested the house and senate appropriations committees recommend an overall mortgage insuran ce commitment limitation of 220 b illion in loan commitments the total includes 185 billion under the mmicmhi fund and 35 billion under the gisri fund di rect loan limitatio n of 50

new fha payment incentives mortgage program or subprime loan product wh ich would permit prospectiv homebuyers to qualify for fha insurance even though the borrowers would not meet existing underwritinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32443crs27 standards due to poor credit ratings the borrowers would still be required to meet the fha standards regarding debt income and repayment ability the increased risk of default associated with these borrowe rs would be offset by requiring larger downpayments higher upfront insurance premiums and higher annual insurance premiums after 60 months the annual premiums would be reduced to 05 of the loan balance as would ordinarily be charged for fhainsured home loans the budget also proposed new zero downpayment initiative hr 3755 under which firsttime homebuyers would be able to purchase home with zero downpayment loans and finance the settlement costs such borrowers would also be charged higher insurance premiums to cover the increased risk involved in such loans the administration further would am end section 203c of the national housing act to restrict the payments of refunds of unearned upfront insurance premiums to borrowers who refinance with new fha loan current law provides that borrowers who prepay their loans may be due refund of the prepaid insurance which was not earned by f under the proposal borro wers who refinance their fha loans with new fha loans would be ligible for refunds of unearned premiums but borrowers who obtain nonfha loans to refinance their fha loans would not be eligible for refunds of unearned premiums under present rules fha considers th upfront insurance premium as earned by fha when the loan has been outstanding for five years after that period none of the prepaid insurance is refundable the administration plans to shorten the period and provide that the insurance is c onsidered as earned by fha when the loan has been outstanding for three years this would be an administrative change congressional response neither the house or senate committee included funding for the proposed zero downpayment initiative the senate committee believes the proposal would pose s ubstantial financia l risk by making homeowners of highrisk borrowers with stake in their houses and financial cushion to pay for unexpected repairs pl 108447 amends section 203c of the national housing act to provi that refunds of unearne d insurance premiums would only be due to those borrowers who refi nance their fhainsured home loans with new fhainsured loans office of federal housing terprise oversight ofheo
