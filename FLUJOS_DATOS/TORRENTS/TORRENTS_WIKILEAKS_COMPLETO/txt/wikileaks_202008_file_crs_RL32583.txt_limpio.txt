science and industry division gasoline supply the role of imports summary gasoline demand in the united states has grown consistently during the past decade increasing by total of 20 between 1999 and 2003 gasoline consumption grew by 500000 barrels per day accounting for all of the increase in petroleum consumption during that period while 2004 may see growth slow down because of high prices during the first seven months of the year gasoline demand was up by another 19 the fact that gasoline supply has not kept up with demand has been reflected in pump prices that have risen from 150 at the start of 2004 to as high as 206 per gallon in late may when supply and demand become out of sync with their previous relationship prices change to establish new balance the outcome has been period of volatile gasoline prices which have set record highs that have become focal point for consumers and policy makers and raised concerns about their impact on the economy gasoline is supplied both by us and foreign refiners domestic producers capacity is limited as result nearly 1 million barrels per day of gasoline and its components are imported imported blending components especially those used in ethanolblended fuel are increasingly important to total us supply without this supplemental supply gasoline would be less available and prices likely higher imports most recently have come from canada and the us virgin islands which supply onethird of the offshore supply argentina the netherlands russia the united kingdom and venezuela provide another third imports peaked in march 2004 took dip and reached new highs in july increased imports may have contributed to pump prices backing off their may highs in late summer new gasoline blending components from venezuela and the rehabilitation of refinery in aruba may also contribute to enhanced gasoline component supply later this year gasoline component availability which has increased during 2004 gives domestic refiners an added measure of flexibility in using their capacity and contributes to enhanced supplies of fuels needed to meet demand for ethanolbased gasoline and other specialized regional blends potential policy concerns raised by growing reliance on gasoline imports include the availability of foreign supplies that meet us specifications whether incremental foreign supplies can be provided quickly enough to meet shifting demand and the delivered price of imported gasoline two legislative efforts were debated in the house regarding gasoline supply issues during 2004 one hr 4517 has passed the house but not been taken up in the senate it would provide for easier permitting for refinery capacity expansion and hr 4545 which did not pass the house would have limited the growth of special

subsequently declined to 187 in august as inventories increased among the factors causing 2004s gasoline price volatility has been shortage of domestic refining capacity which has affected gasoline supply availability creating need for substantial imports us gasoline imports in the form of conventional gasoline reformulated gasoline and gasoline components currently make up slightly more than 10 of the nations supply potential policy concerns raised by growing reliance on gasoline imports include the availability of foreign supplies that meet us specifications the speed at which incremental foreign supplies can be provided to meet shifting domestic demand and the delivered price of imported supplies the nations stressed gasoline supply capacity has attracted recent legislative interest in the house the gasoline price reduction act hr 4545 was brought to the floor under suspension of the rules passage requires twothirds vote on june 15 but failed by 236194 the bill was intended to increase gasoline availability by limiting the number of fuel blends required to meet clean air standards and by allowing waivers of fuel blend requirements during supply disruptions this would have made it easier to ship gasoline between markets when needed to balance supply on june 16 the house passed the united states refinery revitalization act hr 4517 by vote of 239192 this bill would provide incentives to increase refinery capacity focusing on areas with closed refineries or those experiencing layoffs or high unemployment it would also charge the department of energy doe with centralizing the process of obtaining environmental permits for new refinery projects including additions and upgrades gasoline demand gasoline demand in the united states continues to grow although gasoline comprises about 45 of total us petroleum consumption its incremental growth during the recent past accounts for virtually all of the increase in total oil demand crs2 figure 1 shows the trend in us gasoline consumption during the past decade during which demand rose 20 growth has persisted in more recent years although 2004 may see some lateyear slowdown because of higher prices between 1999 and 2003 petroleum consumption increased by half million barrels per day mbd rising from 195 mbd in 1999 to 200 mbd in 2003 during the same time span gasoline consumption rose by the same amount as demand grew from 84 mbd to 89 mbd figure 1 us gasoline demand 1993 2003 925 9 875 85 825 8 775 75 725 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 gasoline supplied source energy information administration monthly energy review june 2004 table 34 gasoline use has continued to grow during the first half of 2004 as almost 90 mbd of gasoline was supplied to consumers an increase of about 19 over the previous years first half while there is some preliminary evidence that high pump prices may have begun to retard growth in gasoline demand it is still too soon to evaluate whether this trend has shifted and how overall petroleum demand might track for all of 2004 gasoline supply gasoline is manufactured in us refineries and imported from foreign refiners as well figure 2 shows data for total us demand and domestic production1 the gap between the two sets of figures is filled by imported product made by foreign 1 us production is represented by gasoline production data which includes foreign blending components from table 2 of the weekly petroleum status report adjusted to reflect the inclusion of imported blending components as shown in table 9 crs3 refiners imported supply consists of finished gasoline which meets us specifications and is marketready as well as blending components the latter have become an increasingly important part of gasoline supply since an increasing amount of ethanolblended gasoline is being consumed in this country the trend toward ethanol blends may continue because it is the oxygenate used to replace the additive methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe which has been banned in new york california and connecticut and is being phased out in other places figure 2 us gasoline production demand jan 2003 july 2004 10 975 95 925 9

10 in one form or another the nation imports slightly more than 10 of the gasoline it consumes the unavoidable outcome of growing motor fuel demand and refining capacity which has not kept pace this supply is necessary to fill the gap between gasoline production and demand shown in figure 2 figure 3 shows the imports of gasoline in detail the total of which is rising in the timeframe in this figure total imports peaked this summer at about 11 mbd for the first seven months of 2004 they averaged 900000 barrels per day imports fit into three general categories conventional gasoline which comprises about half of the gasoline sold in the nation and conforms to the least stringent environmental standards currently in effect the us environmental standards for crs4 this fuel include prohibition on the use of lead limits on summertime volatility and limits on manganese and sulfur content reformulated gasoline rfg is used in major metropolitan areas in 17 states and the district of columbia which have significant ozone problems in april 2004 epa designated areas in total of 32 states and the district as nonattainment areas for new ozone standard to be phasedin between 2007 and 2021 2 rfg has several requirements including the mandate that it contain sufficient oxygenates to meet minimum oxygen requirement of 2 by weight the oxygenate often added is either the chemical mtbe now banned in several states or ethanol rfgs peak usage is during summer months when it comprises about 29 of national demand gasoline components are imported with increasing frequency amounting to 50 of imports during 2004 gasoline is cocktail of hydrocarbons blended at refineries and fuel terminals increasingly cocktail ingredients are available from foreign refiners and they are being imported to expand us refinery output since finished gasoline is blended product refiners can supplement short capacity by buying foreign components and blending them here in such way that us specifications are met as result of the clean air act requirements and state mandates many different types of gasoline are sold in the united states in addition to conventional and rfg there is oxygenated fuel higher oxygen content than rfg low volatility conventional gasoline and variety of state and local blends these boutique fuels include ethanol blends california cleanerburning gasoline also used in nevada and arizona and number of other local formulations as noted above the trend toward ethanol blends may continue because it is the oxygenate used to replace the additive mtbe ethanol blends cannot be stored or transported by pipeline because ethanol and gasoline do not mix well and can separate the blend must be mixed near the point of final consumption imported components of the gasoline cocktail fit into the increasingly common practice of local blending for local markets in that cocktail components often come from multiple sources and are assembled at terminals and other gasoline distribution points for refiners blending gasoline from component parts represents small incremental supply bonus since they can purchase opportunistically those components that might be available on world markets and manufacture the remainder in their own facilities in total us refiners do not have the capacity to make all the gasoline sold in this country but they often do have substantial flexibility within overall capacity constraints to make hardtoimport 2 for full discussion of the new ozone standards see crs report rl32345 implementation of epas 8hour ozone standard by james mccarthy crs5 components tailored to us specifications which foreign refiners cannot easily provide the trend shown in figure 2 suggests that us refiners are able to produce during an average month bit more than 80 mbd while demand is trending just under 90 mbd this year the actual numbers fluctuate from month to month figure 3 shows total gasoline imports averaging about 900000 barrels per day3 imports of finished gasoline and components which have averaged respectively about 500000 barrels per day and 400000 barrels per day during the past 12 months bridge the gap between us

apr jul oct jan 04 apr jul source eia weekly petroleum status report august 2 2004 table 9 the increasing use of blending components in building up the gasoline pool is seen in the rise of components as proportion of nationwide gasoline inventories figure 4 shows that total gasoline stocks started 2003 at essentially the same level 212 million barrels that they were at the end of august 2004 206 million barrels but blending components held in inventory rose from 54 million barrels or 26 of inventory to 72 million barrels or 35 of total inventory this is substantial increase and shows refiners demand for stocks of components to meet the need for locallymixed ethanol blends as well as diverse boutique fuels 3 energy information administration weekly petroleum status report table 9 crs6 boutique fuel supply issues fifteen states have chosen to address clean air issues by calling for localized gasoline formulations for all or part of their states4 many of these requirements are in effect during summer months when concerns about ozone are greatest the diversity of fuel formulations has raised concerns among stakeholders regarding refiners ability to provide the diversity of products required in sufficient quantities as well as the product transport sectors ability to distribute the diverse product slate in its staff white paper on boutique fuels5 the environmental protection agency epa contends that the refining and distribution system works well under normal operating conditions but the agency notes that when the entire fuel market is stressed the places where supply shortfalls and volatile prices tend to show up first and be most acute involve geographically isolated fuel programs many state boutique programs are of this nature and have fewer suppliers and fewer transport options in situations where there is transportation failure supply shortfall of gasoline components or some combination of these and possibly other factors prices can become very volatile as small supply glitches impact an isolated local market disproportionately there appear to have been few such instances but some have taken place the experience in the chicago metro area during the spring of 2000 is one example of how confluence of circumstances can play out as the chicago metropolitan area transitioned to ethanolblended gasoline in the late spring of 2000 key pipeline supplying gasoline from the gulf coast refining area failed the supply shortfall from traditional refiners coupled with the initial difficulty in making reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending in local refineries combined to create tight regional supply situation which saw pump prices nearly double in may and june6 but by july supply from other sources and restoration of pipeline flow began to return prices to accustomed levels the price spike while only few months in duration was substantial and is often pointed to as worst case situation of how convergence of mishaps can lead to substantial disruption in market delineated by boutique fuel requirements epa notes that problems of this type to date have been limited in terms of geographical scope and duration it appears that the fuel supply system can support the current structure of fuel standards absent some set of untoward circumstances 4 full discussion of boutique fuels see crs report rl31361 boutique

suppliers shares of the imported gasoline market it also shows how the amounts supplied by each important supplier can vary from month to month as well as changes in the overall supply of imports canada source of much of the nations hydrocarbon imports is the single leading supplier of gasoline on regular basis canadas exports have increased steadily during recent years and the us virgin

venezuelan gasoline exports to the united states have dropped to about 40 of levels seen prior to 2002s political disruption recent efforts to regain us market position by pdvsa discussed below could produce supply benefit although refinery operations are still recovering from the strike figure 5 average daily gasoline imports by country of origin jan 2000 apr 2004 1200 1000 uk netherlands us

much lower than in the united states many other nations with spare refinery capacity are suppliers as well recent enhancement to the supply of imported gasoline has been made by pdvsa which has started shipping the complete cocktail for ethanol blended gasoline without the ethanol which is blended near the point of sale pdvsa has planned to export 1 million barrels per month of this highpriced component called rbob8 starting with test cargoes in june platts oilgram price report9 noted that 720000 barrels were exported in july and the extra barrels in the us market have 8 this is an acronym for reformulated before oxygenate blending 9 european gasoline sellers lose us market share to cheaper venezuelan exports platts oilgram price report july 26 2004 p 1 crs9 provided extra competition for comparable cargoes from europe where distances and shipping costs are greater this illustrates the significance of the supply of foreign gasoline components and how they can impact us gasoline prices it is likely that high us prices for gasoline and its significant components will continue to attract foreign refiners attention perhaps leading them to seek permanent market share pdvsa which also owns us refiner citgo affording direct retail market access announced that for september it planned to export 12 rbob cargoes to the united states including four or five for the new yorkconnecticut ethanolonly blended markets10 another example of what may be taking place in offshore refined product supply is the revitalization of large refinery in aruba that was recently acquired by valero energy an independent refining company with most of its facilities in the united states while geographically wellpositioned to serve us markets this facility had an unsuccessful operating history valero began improving operations quickly and is adding upgrading units so that gasoline components can be made in increasing quantities from lowquality crudes the capacity of this refinery is 275000 barrels per day figure which suggests that it could when it reaches capacity contribute significantly to gulf and east coast gasoline supplies imports from aruba are so recent that they are not reflected in doe data which lag by few months on product imports by country imported gasoline is the nation overly dependent dependence on imports to meet over 10 of national gasoline needs has begun to cause concern that these imports might contribute to 2004s high prices while supplies from canada may have similar physical characteristics and prices to the output from us refiners and offer speedy delivery products from refineries farther afield may not factors such as the cost and timeliness of incremental supply physical reliability and meeting us product specifications can affect price and supply at the gas pump shipping cost may be an additional issue gasoline and many other refined products need to be protected from contamination from other oils as result they must be shipped in clean vessels these product carriers are usually much smaller than crude carriers and not benefitting from economies of large scale have higher unit costs in addition the clean tanker market is influenced by spot charter rates for vessels making product shipping costs often higher and more volatile than 10 email from fadi kabboul minister counselor for energy affairs embassy of venezuela aug 20 2004 crs10 crude oil it is cheaper to ship crude to local refinery than to transport products an equivalent distance11 imported products cost more than those refined domestically simply by virtue of transport costs the higher import costs impact the last units of gasoline supply providing price umbrella for domestic refiners whose pricing like all industrial pricing is linked to the cost of the last increments of the good involved as long as gasoline is imported to meet sizeable imbalance between domestic supply and demand this situation offers likelihood of prices which are above the cost of domestic manufacture this assumes that new domestic refining capacity to replace imports could produce usspec gasoline at costs below those of foreign refiners plus product transport tariffs to the united states in addition to pricerelated considerations the speed of supply response to price signals from us gasoline markets seems less than it might be from refiner located here it may well be that distance mutes price signals related to an increase in demand for example and refiners abroad may be slow to receive the message that us consumers desire more gasoline and are currently paying prices which would justify foreign refiners manufacturing of us specification fuel even if the foreign refiners response to us prices were instantaneous it could take as long as month in some cases more for the physical supply to arrive here manufacturing fuel for the us market may be another source of delayed response to us market signals some of the substances called for in satisfying us fuel needs may not be produced in the ordinary course of refinery runs abroad and some like rbob are difficult for many refiners to make calling for longer setup time lags in getting foreign supply may have contributed to 2004s price increases figure 3 shows low imports during late 2003 and early 2004 which corresponded to decline in gasoline inventories and consistent price increases seen throughout the first half of 2004 11 the energy information administration eia described the economics of attracting imported gasoline to the united states in its summer 2001 motor gasoline outlook showing how the incremental cost of transport must be surmounted it notes that western europe is an important source of incremental or swing gasoline supply in the united states transatlantic gasoline price differentials provide some indication of the attractiveness of the us market to european refiners when us prices exceed european prices adequately to cover transportation costs the united states will attract supply from refineries located there eia notes that europe us gasoline transport costs vary greatly while averaging 4 cents per gallon as imputed by wholesale price differentials but the data shown on the graph accompanying the discussion indicate differentials as high as 14 cents per gallon and yearlong periods averaging 8 to10 cents per gallon these figures embody the costs of shipping presumably imported crude to refinery in europe so they embody crude transport costs according to eia figures crude transport to the us from the persian gulf averaged 237 per barrel 56 cents per gallon during 2003 crs11 is dependence on gasoline imports for more than 10 of the nations gasoline supply undesirable in theory importing gasoline may have few drawbacks it might make little difference if this fuel were to be supplied from across the border in canada the products supplied might be usspecification conventional gasoline or rfg what about imports from refinery operated by major international oil company in europe or nearby in the caribbean at what point does foreign refined product dependence become policy concern there is clear answer but major considerations in evaluating this question include availability of supplies meeting us specifications so that demand can be met without the need for waivers that could compromise environmental protections the speed with which incremental supply might be available given justintime gasoline inventories in order to avoid excessive price volatility the delivered price of foreign supplies and whether they are above the incremental price of domestic output such that they ultimately contribute to higher prices policy and legislation the nation has apparent defined policy on refined oil product imports nor is there policy regarding gasoline prices there is general perception among policymakers that price volatility is undesirable but there is consensus on what the price level ought to be nor is there consensus about how the government might deal with market volatility similarly there appears to be general agreement that spot shortages runouts and lines at gas stations are to be avoided but there are guides for policy actions to remedy such situations should they take place and it could be that letting market forces make corrections without government involvement would be the better course of action some policy initiatives in the 108th congress are embodied in two house bills focusing on the proliferation of regional gasoline blends and expanding refinery capacity hr 4545 the gasoline price reduction act centered on the proliferation of special local boutique gasoline blends the bill failed to get the required two thirds house vote for passage under suspension of the rules it would have authorized epa during significant supply disruptions to issue waivers of state provisions requiring boutique fuels the boutique fuel requirement is seen as potentially limiting supply by impeding the movement of fuel between areas shortage in one spot might not be met with extra fuel from nearby area because of differing requirements the bill also proposed capping the number of boutique fuels at the current level hr 4545 proposed dealing with supply fungibility but it did not offer remedies that could have increased the supply of domestically produced gasoline hr 4517 the refinery revitalization act which passed the house but has not crs12 seen senate action is aimed at facilitating increases in capacity by fasttracking the environmental review and permitting of facilities in designated refinery revitalization zone the secretary of energy would designate the zones coordinate environmental reviews and make final decisions on federal authorizations for new refineries within the zones to the extent that those wishing to construct new refinery or expand an existing facility have been hindered by environmental regulation this measure is intended to offer some assistance these bills articulate at least some components of gasoline supply policy dealing with domestic supply and indirectly with imports and with fuel specifications that impact the distribution of supply both measures have drawn substantial criticism however particularly on environmental grounds for example with regard to the refining bill opponents express concern that such measure would override state clean air programs among its cons hr 4545 raises concerns about the overall cost of gasoline given that many state programs which avoid fullfledged rfg have been implemented to keep down gasoline costs the refining proposals attempt to address the 1 mbd gasoline production shortfall which is made up by imports in one form or another encouraging growth in domestic refinery capacity implies judgment that it is advantageous to have that capacity in the united states in contrast to offshore even if offshore is relatively nearby as noted above domestic production could reduce transportation costs and provide quicker supply response to unanticipated changes in demand this could shorten the duration of potentially disruptive price spike resulting from gasoline supply shortfall refinery proposals under current debate do not address other issues impacting refinery projects such as an historic lack of profitability in this industry segment12 it may well be that the current refining situation with imports holding price umbrella over domestic gasoline production may be profitable situation for many refiners many of whom are realizing record earnings in the first and second quarters of 2004 while this years earnings may be high one years experience does not outweigh years of low profits while basic change in refiner profitability might be suggested it is too soon for many firms to consider making significant investments in longlived capital equipment whose cost is recouped over many years were the prospects for longterm profitability in the refining industry to improve by virtue of sustainable recovery in refining margins it is likely that additional investment in added capacity would be seen but it might take several years of high margins before firm managers and their bankers would become confident enough to make substantial capital commitments 12 for more extensive discussion of refinery profitability see crs report rl32248 petroleum refining economic performance and challenges for the future march 1 2004 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32583
