referred to as the budget year and beyond in addition some made adjustments to the budget for fy2005 referred to as the current year this report describes house and crs2 senate action on major budgetary legislation within the framework of the congressional budget process and other procedural requirements1 within this procedural framework congress considered various budgetrelated legislation in the context of what was arguably an unfavorable budget outlook according to the office of management and budget omb and the congressional budget office cbo current budget projections under existing law without any legislative changes showed annual deficits in the unified budget ie including federal funds and trust funds in each of the next several fiscal years for example at the beginning of the year omb projected that the fy2005 unified budget deficit would be 390 billion 427 billion if the supplemental request is included with deficits continuing but declining through fy2010 similarly cbo projected that the fy2005 unified budget deficit would be 368 billion with surplus not returning until fy20122 overview of the congressional budget process the congressional budget process consists of the consideration and adoption of spending revenue and debtlimit legislation within the framework of an annual concurrent resolution on the budget the presidents budget congress begins its budget process once the president submits his budget the president is required by law to submit comprehensive federal budget later than the first monday in february 31 usc 1105 the presidents budget includes estimates of direct spending and revenues under existing laws with certain adjustments as well as estimates of any proposed legislative changes affecting direct spending and revenues in addition the presidents budget contains requests in specific dollar amounts for discretionary spending ie funds controlled through the appropriations process for the upcoming fiscal year although congress is not bound by the presidents budget congressional action on spending and revenue legislation often is influenced by his recommendations as well as subsequent budgetary activities by the president during the year omb assists the president in formulating and coordinating his budget policies and activities on february 7 2005 president bush submitted his fy2006 budget to congress as is the usual practice the presidents budget was submitted as multivolume set consisting of main document that includes the presidents budget message and information on his 2006 proposals budget and supplementary documents

congressional actions the budget resolution implementation and enforcement the congressional budget act of 1974 titles iix of pl 93344 88 stat 297332 established the congressional budget process including timetable for congressional action on budgetary legislation see table 1 the congressional budget process provides for an annual concurrent resolution on the budget to serve as framework for the consideration of budgetary legislation the budget resolution sets forth aggregate spending and revenue levels and spending levels by major functional area for at least five fiscal years as concurrent resolution the budget resolution is not presented to the president for his signature and thus does not become law instead it is an agreement between the house and senate on congressional budget plan providing framework for subsequent legislative action on the budget during each congressional session 3 all of the presidents fy2006 budget documents are available at

section 300 of the congressional budget act of 1974 as amended pl 93344 2 usc 631 budget resolution policies are implemented through the enactment of revenue and debtlimit legislation appropriations and other spending measures and if required by the budget resolution one or more reconciliation bills see table 2 congress enforces budget resolution policies through points of order on the floor of each chamber and the reconciliation process for example any legislation that would cause the aggregate levels to be violated is prohibited from being considered further the total budget authority and outlays set forth in the budget resolution are allocated among the house and senate committees having jurisdiction over specific spending legislation any legislation or amendment that would cause these committee allocations to be exceeded is prohibited finally the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide their allocations among their respective subcommittees point of order may be raised against any appropriations act or crs5 amendment that would cause one of these subdivisions to be exceeded6 the budget resolution also contains spending levels by functional categories eg national defense but these are not enforceable congress also may use reconciliation legislation discussed further below to enforce the direct spending revenue and debtlimit provisions of budget resolution in addition the senate is constrained by limits on discretionary spending and payasyougo paygo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation which are enforced through points of order while legislation is being considered on the senate floor both explained further below the house does not provide for similar points of order expired budget enforcement procedures for fy1991 through fy2002 congress and the president also were constrained by statutory limits on discretionary spending and statutory paygo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation7 unlike the enforcement procedures associated with the budget resolution which are employed while legislation is considered on the floor of each chamber the discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement were enforced by sequestration process generally after legislative action for session of congress ended if either of these budget constraints were violated then the president was required to order sequestration which involved largely acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs by the amount of any violation these budget enforcement mechanisms however expired at the end of fy2002 ie september 30 2002 president bush among others has proposed setting new discretionary spending limits and restoring modified version of the paygo requirement in addition to several other budget process reforms8 if congress and president bush enact budget enforcement procedures such as these applicable to budget legislation in 2005 this report will incorporate them accordingly 6 for more detailed information on these points of order and their application see crs report 97865 points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturno 7 these constraints were first established by the budget enforcement act of 1990 title xiii of pl 101508 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 104 stat 13885731388 630 which amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 99 stat 10381101 8 in his fy2006 budget president bush proposed to set discretionary spending limits for fy2006 through fy2010 and to restore the paygo requirement for direct spending legislation only among other budget reform initiatives see office of management and budget analytical perspectives budget of the us government fiscal year 2006 pp 235 242 for contextual

presidents budget early in the year congress begins formulating the budget resolution the house and senate budget committees are responsible for developing and reporting the budget resolution in formulating it the budget committees hold hearings and receive testimony from members of congress and representatives of federal departments and agencies the general public and national organizations

fy2015 during testimony to the senate budget committee10 on february 8 and 9 omb director joshua b bolten provided an overview of president bushs budget request before the house and senate budget committees respectively11 the congressional budget resolution like the presidents budget is based on budget baselines see table 312 the budget baseline is projection of federal revenue spending and deficit or surplus levels based upon current policies assuming certain economic conditions baseline projections provide benchmark for measuring the budgetary effects of proposed policy changes the presidents budget baseline referred to as current services estimates is included in the budget documents submitted to congress13 the presidents baseline usually differs from cbos baseline referred to as baseline budget projections because of different economic and technical assumptions in preparation for action on the fy2006 budget resolution on january 25 2005 cbo released its annual report on

background information and the estimated 10 year budgetary effects of 185 spending options and 53 revenue options another source of input comes from the views and estimates of congressional committees with jurisdiction over spending and revenues within six weeks after the presidents budget submission each house and senate committee is required to submit views and estimates of budget matters under its jurisdiction to its respective budget committee these views and estimates frequently submitted in the form of letter to the chair and ranking minority member of the budget committee typically include comments on the presidents budget proposals and estimates of the budgetary impact of any legislation likely to be considered during the current session of 14 cbo documents are available at httpwwwcbogov crs9 congress the budget committees are not bound by these recommendations the views and estimates often are printed in the committee report accompanying the budget resolution in the senate and compiled as separate committee print in the house the budget resolution was designed to provide framework for making budget decisions leaving specific program determinations to house and senate appropriations committees and other committees with spending and revenue jurisdiction in many instances however particular program changes are considered when the budget resolution is formulated program assumptions sometimes are referred to in the reports of the house and senate budget committees and usually are discussed during floor action although these program changes are not binding committees may be strongly influenced by the recommendations when formulating appropriations bills reconciliation measures or other budgetary legislation on march 9 2005 the house budget

allocations to the appropriations committees only or combination of these in some cases an entire budget resolution earlier adopted by one chamber may be deemed to have been passed under deeming

section 310 of the budget act22 the reconciliation process has two stages first congress includes reconciliation directives in budget resolution directing one or more committees in each chamber to recommend changes in statute to achieve the levels of direct spending revenues debt limit or combination thereof agreed to in the budget resolution second each instructed committee develops legislative recommendations to meet its reconciliation directives and reports its legislative recommendations to its respective chamber directly or transmits such recommendations to its respective budget committee section 310b of the congressional budget act of 1974 titles iix of pl 93344 88 stat 297332 specifies two options for the submission of legislative recommendations to comply with reconciliation directives 1 if one committee is instructed the committee reports its legislative recommendations to its parent chamber directly or 2 if two or more committees are instructed the committees submit their legislative recommendations to their respective budget committee in the latter case the legislative language recommended by committees is packaged without any substantive revision into one or more budget reconciliation bills as set forth in the budget resolution by the house and senate budget committees as indicated in table 4 the conference report to the fy2006 budget resolution hconres 95 hrept 10962 provides for three reconciliation measures 1 to cut direct or mandatory spending by about 35 billion 2 to cut taxes by 70 billion and 3 to increase the statutory debt

however the president proposes and congress considers changes in revenue laws to effect adjustments in the rates of taxation or the distribution of the tax burden or for other purposes an initial step in the congressional budget process is the publication of revenue estimates of the presidents budget by cbo these revenue estimates usually differ from the presidents since they are based on different economic and technical assumptions eg growth of the economy and change in the inflation rate cost estimates of any congressional revenue proposals are prepared by cbo based on revenue estimates made by the joint committee on taxation jct they are published in committee reports or in the congressional record and are available on jcts website40 the budget resolution recommends yearly revenue levels

considers and adopts legislation to change this limit43 federal debt consists of debt held by the public plus debt held by government accounts the debt held by the public represents the total net amount borrowed from the public to cover all or most of the federal governments budget deficits by contrast the debt held by government accounts represents the total net amount of federal debt issued to specialized federal accounts primarily trust funds eg social security trust fund surpluses by law must be invested in special nonnegotiable federal government securities and thus are held in the form of federal debt the combination of both types of debt is subject to the statutory public debt limit therefore budget deficits or trust fund surpluses may contribute to the federal government reaching the existing debt limit the annual congressional budget resolution specifies the appropriate level of the public debt for each fiscal year covered by the resolution although the budget resolution does not become law itself the specified debt limits serve as guide for any necessary debtlimit legislation congress may develop debtlimit legislation in any of three ways 1 under regular legislative procedures 2 under house rule xxvii or 3 as part of reconciliation legislation as described above regardless of the process by which debtlimit legislation is developed the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee maintain exclusive jurisdiction over debtlimit legislation under house rule xxvii commonly referred to as the gephardt rule after its author former representative richard gephardt joint resolution specifying the amount of the debt limit contained in the budget resolution automatically is engrossed and deemed to have passed the house by the same vote as the conference report on the budget resolution thereby avoiding separate vote on the debtlimit legislation44 the senate has comparable automatic engrossment procedure if it chooses to consider housepassed joint resolution it does so under the regular legislative process the most recent increase in the publicdebt limit was enacted as an independent measure pl 108415 118 stat 2337 in november 2004 the debtlimit measure increased the statutory limit by 800 billion from 7384 trillion to 8184 trillion president bushs fy2006 budget projects that the debt subject to the statutory limit will increase to 8673 trillion almost 500 billion over the current limit by the end 43 for further information on debtlimit legislation see crs report rs21519 legislative procedures for adjusting the

the public debt limit by 781 billion to 8965 trillion hjres 47 was deemed to have been adopted by the house on april 28 by vote of 214211 ie the vote upon which the house agreed to the conference

are allocated among the house and senate committees with jurisdiction over specific spending legislation these allocations commonly referred to as 302a allocations after the applicable section of the congressional budget act are specified in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report to the budget resolution48 point of order may be raised against any legislation that would cause committees spending allocation to be exceeded like most points of order under the congressional budget act this point of order may be set aside by unanimous consent or waived by special rule in the house or by threefifths vote in the senate ie 60 senators if there are vacancies the budget resolution typically provides for periodic revisions of these allocations if certain conditions specified in reserve fund provisions for instance are met discretionary spending discretionary spending is under the jurisdiction of the house and senate appropriations committees soon after the budget resolution is adopted by congress the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide their spending allocations among their subcommittees and formally report these suballocations to their respective chambers these suballocations referred to 48 see us congress committee on conference concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 conference report to accompany hconres 95 109th

302b allocations to be exceeded this point of order like others under the congressional budget act may be set aside by unanimous consent or waived by special rule in the house or by threefifths vote in the senate ie 60 senators if there are vacancies during the appropriations process these suballocations usually are revised several times congress passes three main types of appropriations measures regular appropriations acts provide budget authority for the next fiscal year beginning on october 149 from time to time congress merges two or more of these regular appropriations acts into an omnibus appropriations act at the end of the year supplemental appropriations acts provide additional funding for unexpected needs while the fiscal year is in progress continuing appropriations acts commonly referred to as continuing resolutions provide stopgap funding for agencies that have not received regular appropriations by the start of the fiscal year the presidents budget includes recommendations for the agencies programs and activities funded in the annual appropriations measures account and program level detail about these recommendations is included in the appendix volume of the presidents budget documents in addition agencies submit justification materials to the house and senate appropriations committees the budget justifications provide more detailed information about an agencys program activities than is contained in the presidents budget documents and are used in support of agency testimony during appropriations subcommittee hearings on the presidents budget request the house and senate appropriations subcommittees begin holding extensive hearings on appropriations requests shortly after the presidents budget is submitted by custom appropriations measures originate in the house in recent years the senate appropriations committee has adopted and reported original senate appropriations measures allowing the senate to consider appropriations measures without having to wait for the house to adopt its version under this practice the senate version is considered and amended on the floor and then inserted into the houseadopted version when available as substitute amendment thereby retaining the housenumbered bill for final action 49 each subcommittee of the house and senate appropriations committees typically is responsible for one of the regular appropriations acts on feb 15 the house appropriations committee voted to reduce the number of its subcommittees from 13 to 10 and adjust their jurisdiction each subcommittee continues to be responsible for one regular appropriations act and the full committee is responsible for the accounts and programs of the legislative branch on mar 2 senator thad cochran chairman of the senate appropriations committee announced new subcommittee organization including the elimination of one subcommittee leaving 12 subcommittees for additional information on changes to the appropriations subcommittee structure see crs report rl31572 appropriations subcommittee structure history of changes from 19202005 by james v saturno crs25 congress also often adopts one or more continuing resolutions each year because of recurring delays in the appropriations process for example congress passed three continuing resolutions before completing action on the fy2005 regular appropriations acts50 appropriations for fy2006 the conference report to the fy2006 budget resolution hconres 95 hrept 10962 provided for about 843 billion in discretionary spending accordingly the house appropriations committee received spending allocation its socalled 302a allocation of 843020 million in budget authority and 916836 million in outlays and the senate appropriations committee received spending allocation its socalled 302a allocation of 842265 million in budget authority and 916081 million in outlays for the fy2006 regular appropriations measures51 subsequently these spending
