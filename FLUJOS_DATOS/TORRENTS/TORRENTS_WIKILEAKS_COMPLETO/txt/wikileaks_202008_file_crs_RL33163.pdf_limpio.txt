effectiveness its relationship to eradication and the longter m sustainability of programs once they are started drug crops are eradicated either manually or by aerial spraying of herbicide mixture the main ingredient being gly phosate used commercially in the united states under the brand name of roundup eradication can be conducted with the voluntary agreement of growers or invol untarily peru and bolivia do not allow aerial eradication which has pr oven to be controversial critics believe it poses risks to the environment and the health of inhabitants living in sprayed regions proponents believe it is the mo st effective and safe means to defoliate large areas being used for drug crop cultivation thereb removing lucrative source of income from the illegally armed colombian groups providing alternatives to drug crops is be lieved to be crucial to achieve effective eradication this often includes technical support for farmers marketing assistance and strengthening the

in coca growing regions whereby the communities themselves eradicate their drug crops in exchange for development assistance more recently the government of colombia has used demobilized rightwing paramilitary fighters flying them to coca regions to manually eradicate crops peru perus support for eradication progra ms has varied hist orically based on the political conditions in the country nd the resolve of national governments while once the largest producer of cocai ne in the andes it is now second to colombia the traditional areas of coca cultivation are the upper huallagamonzon and the apurimacene valleys although th state department has reported that dense cultivation is increasing in other areas it also reports that there is an upward trend in opium poppy cultivation in north ern peru coca cultivation has decreased in peru from its peak in 1995 and is considered an andean success story some observers believe the reduction was due to several factors other than the eradication operations including the following the appearance of soil fungus fusarium oxysporum in the huallaga valley the decline of colombias dependence on bolivian and peruvian coca and the successful dismantling of colombias drug cartels that were the principal buyers of peruvian coca this led to collapse in coca prices in the early 1990s10 the government of pe ru allows only the manual eradication of drug crops by the end of the 1980s peru was the worlds leading producer of coca leaf supplying 60 of world supply early in president fujimoris government 1990 2000 he adopted an approach that empha sized alternative velopment and land titling incorporating coca farmers into th formal economy while deemphasizing forced eradication as his administrati on proceeded fujimori adopted policies that gave more authority to the military in dr ug matters and combined counterinsurgency and drug control missions forced eradica tion was restarted in 1996 and increased in tempo toward the end of the 1990s eradication operations provoked the mobilization of coca growers especially in light of unsubstantiated claims that spraying of crops was occurring this led fujimori to sign decree prohibiting the use of chemical or biological defolia nts in 2000 under the toledo government 2001 to present alternative developm ent programs using voluntary agreements have become again widely u tilized although forced eradication continues assistance for growers is provided as long as they sign agreements to fully eradicate their crops if an agreement is not signed forced

successes in reducing cultivati on but some observers would argue at the expense of social unrest the two main coca growing regions are chapare and yungas since the beginning of plan dignidad in 1998 the counternarcotics policy of former president banzer 19972001 that focu sed on increasing forced eradication cultivation in the chapare has decreased it has however dramatically increased in the yungas the state department reports that the increase is far above the legal limit as in peru indigenous bolivians belie ve coca is cultural right and use it for cultural spiritual and medical purposes total coca cultivation in bolivia decreased from its peak in the mid1990s of 118000 acres to around 36000 acres in 2000 but in 2001 coca cultivation began to increase again and to expand to new areas in 2004 the state department estimates that there were nearly 61000 acres of coca crops12 bolivian law states that only manual and mechanical methods can be used to eradicate and prohibits the use of chemical means herbicides biol ogical agents and defoliants13 while interim presidents have reaffirmed their suppor t for counternarcotic s policy continuing political instability and the mobilization of coca growers organizations especially in the context of an upcoming presidenti election have led some observers to question the resolve of the national governme nt both the state

motivate coca growers who lose their crops to start over in other more remote parts of the forest causing still more ecosystem destruction if eradication is nevertheless the best option then

byproducts to reduce the target plant pest to tolerable level the living things may be native to an area and natural enemies of the target plant or they might be imported in either case to be effective in controlling pests they first must be identified and then established in sufficient numbers in proximity to the targeted plants at the same time it is important to ensure that such
