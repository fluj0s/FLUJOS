president declared central america aid farm loan funds and kosov operations as emergencies thereby avoiding the need to offset the costs of th supplemental he proposed to cover the expenses of additional middle east aid by using mostly defense department funds last year congress approved about 21 billion in emergency funds that were not offset with cuts in existing appropriations decision

resources 372 million for the federa l emergency management agency fema to aid victims of the recen t tornados in the midwest the house passed separate kosovo spending measure hr 1664 but lawmakers added the ko sovo and fema funds to the supplemental package for central america jordan and american farmers when th latter was taken up in midmay by housesenate conference committee paying for the fy1999 supplementals continuing controversy during the recent consideration of supplementa l appropriatio ns and one that has emerged as the most contentious issue in th current debate is whether to cover the costs of the additional spending throug h offsets or to declare the requirement as an emergency the emergency designation7 allows congress to approve the supplemental funds without offsetting the amounts with resciss ions in previously enacted discretionary appropriations or finding cuts in mandatory spending programs but if congress agrees with the president to define all or part of the supplemental as an emergency and not offset the amounts discretionary spending rises beyond the agreedupon caps and the size of the budget surplus for fy1999 declines between 1994 and 1997 congress usually enacte d budget authority offsets for supplementals reversing that practice last yea r congress declared nearly l of the 21 billion supplemental appropriation enacted in pl 105277 as an emergency some lawmakers strongly objected to this action and are vigorously opposing efforts to approve any supplemental funding for fy199 9 without correspond ing cuts in existing budget authority some congressional critics argue that since the current surplus is due to social security approving supplemental funds without offsets will reduce social security resources in the future the administration designated the central americacaribbean relief package usda farm loans and kosovo operations as emergen cies not requiring reductions in existing budget authority for the wye memorandum however the white house proposed to offset most of the 900 million fy1999 portion with defens department funds has met with some opposition in congress in addition t rescinding 18 million in previously enacted military assistance funds the presidenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30083crs6 proposed to use 652 mill ion of dod intelligence and 230 million of dod ballistic missile defense funds enacted last year as contingent emergency supplementa l appropriations in pl 105277 additional spending for intelligence and missil defense resulted directly from initiatives developed by congressional leaders because the funds were contingent on the president designat ing them as an emergency they are not available until the white house makes such determination and the president may choose not to do so the president said the monies for intelligence and missile defense are not needed this year and his budget request includes proposals fo r advance fy2001 appropriations for both of these accounts as offsets this proposal is especially controversial as it comes at time when many i n congress believe that defense spending is too low and are seeking ways to increase appropriations for next year and beyond congress is considering number f alternati ve offsets and as noted below some of these options have drawn shar p criticism from the administration few have brought veto threats from the white house congressional actions agreeing with the presidents recommendation for immediate consideration of the central americacaribbean and jordan supplemental requests the senat approp riations committee met on march 4 and reported out legislation providin g 19 billion in supplemental funding s 544 including 100 million for jordan slightly higher than requested amounts for central americacaribbean rehabilitation efforts and about t wice as much as proposed for farm relief aid 308 million the senate panel also added about 340 million to other administration proposals primarily for the transfer of resources for domestic disaster relief programs from hud to the federal emergency management agency fema and for 1 billion loa n guarantee program for the american steel industry following three days of debat and consideration of more than 50 amendments the senate passed s 544 on march 23 during senate consideration severa l amendments adding and rescind ing funds were adopted bringing the total amount of new spending to 25 billion the largest new funding amendmen ts were those offered by senator bond for an additional 150 million in aid for american hog farmers proposal by sena tor bingaman of 125 million for oil and gas industry relief and an initiative by senator domenici to create 500 million oil and gas guaranteed loan program the senate further set aside by tabling three other controversia l amendments to require prior congressional approval for the united states to suppor t chinas membership in the world trade organization senator

senate provision per mitting states to maintain full control over how to spend money from the settlement of tobacco lawsuits and t he congressional proposed cuts in existing resources to pay for the supplementals emerged as the mos t controversial issues as the legislation went before conference committee in mid may s 5 44 which offset all new supplemental budget authority and outlays drew much of the program reductions from domestic spending about 13 billion i n order to ensure the bill was budget neutral in terms of outlays the senate furthe r adopted an mendment by senator gramm that would rescind 225 billion of non defense emergency supplemental funds enacted in october 1998 pl 105277 for such things as us embassy security and counterterror ism programs y2k problems and antinarcotics programs when congress passed pl 105277 last year lawmakers did not include offsets for these supplemental initiatives hr 1141 which offset in budget authority all but about 195 million in defense funds used to provide eme rgency relief for central america cut mostly from foreign policy programs 845 million unlike the senate bill however the hous measure did not provide enou gh rescissions to make the legislation budgetneutral in terms of outlays cbo estimated that the housepassed version of hr 114 1 would cost about 800 million in outlays over the next 5 years one of the larges t rescissions included in the house bill was callable capital appropriated by congress prior to 1980 to back us contributions to multilateral development banks because of this and other foreign policy cuts some administration officials said the president should veto the house measure so house members on the other hand opposed the bill because it does not offset all new supplemental spending efforts to convene conference committee to work out house and senat differences stalled for weeks as controversy continued over higher spending in th senate measure and the composition of offsets in

additional new spending for hog farmer relief state department counternarcotics programs grants to lowincome migrant an d seasonal farm workers the conservation reserve program and the rura l communities advancement program based on the most recent estimates it appears that there will be at least 14 billion and perhaps as much as 2 billion surplus in food stamps conferees also rescinded 350 million in hud public and india n10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30083crs12 housing funds food stam ps the housing deferral and the transfer of hud funds to fema make up nearly all rescissions included in the enacted legislation among those rescissions dropped by conferees but over which strong whit house opposition emerged included immigration and naturalization serv ice 65 million rescission in s

million p ending case load of naturalization applications contributions to international or ganizations and peacekeeping 46 million rescinded in s 544 funding that according to the senate appropriation s committee was in excess of approved or required levels it is possible tha t recent exchange rate gains coming from stronger dollar could have reduced the impact of this reducti on for international organization contributions but it also might have resulted in adding to existing us arrears to thes organizations foreign aid to haiti russia and bosnia 30 million re scinded in s 544 that would be drawn from existing fu nds for haiti russia and bosnia hr 1141 rescinded 45 million for aid to eastern europe and the former soviet union foreign food aid loans 30 million rescinded in hr 1141 the hous appropriations committee said that funds carried in from the previous yea r would be sufficient to maintain the program at planned levels even with thi s reduction the administration however had assumed 50 million carryin for fy2000 in its budget request in order to keep the program operating t current levels callable capital for the world bank and other regional international financial institutions 648 million rescinded in hr 1141 prior to 1980 congress appropriated both paidin capital funds the us actually transferred to th banks and callable capital full faith and credit commitment by the us government that coul d be provided in the event of bank crisis none of this callable capital has ever been dra wn upon and since 1980 only paidin capital has been appropriat ed and scored as budget item the house committee contended that its action would n ot alter its support for the mdbs nor would it have any signific ant impact on the financial strength of the banks treasury secretary rubin however told the house foreign operations subcommittee on march 17 that several experts h ad advised him that the committees action could increase the borrowing costs of the banks and undermine mdb efforts to stabilize asian and latin american economies in crisis he further warned of the precedent this rescission would set about 12 billion in pre198 0 appropriated callable capital exists that some lawmakers might be inclined to draw from in future spending bills that require offsets he would recommend veto of th bill he said if the rescission remained in the bill moreover some members pointed out that the callable capital appropriations had n ohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30083crs13 congress approved about 59 billion for emergency agriculture relief programs in pl11 105277 but because these amounts were enacted in division of the bill where regula r fy1999 app ropriations were placed they would not be affected by this provision in s 544outlays associated with them so t hat the rescission would not have resulted in any real reduction in us government expenditures russian plutonium and uranium disposal 150 million rescinded in hr 1141 the committee noted that usrussian ag reements to set up programs to dispose of the excess plutonium and uranium from nuclear weapons had yet to be settled and that not all of the 525 million appropriated for fy1999 was needed administration and other critics contended however that th agreements are nearly in place and that the house action sent signal that the united states was not committed to maintaining the security of the exces s nuclear material in addition s 544 proposed to rescind nearly 3 billion of the funds congress appropriated in last years omnibus appropriation act pl 105277 for non defense emergency activities this would have represented about 44 reduction for all emergency funding other than dodmilitary provided in division b of the omnibus spending measure the senate appropriations committee had proposed11 rescission of 343 million or about 5 of unobligated nondefense emergenc funds in pl 105277 in the reported version of s 544 during floor debate senator gramm pointed out that while s 544 offset new budget authorit recommended in the bill outlays for suppleme ntal funds would be higher than outlays rescinded in the bill the overall effect of s 544 would be to add about 441 million in expenditures for fy1999 in order to ensure that new spending in s 544 would not reduce the projected surplus senator gramm proposed and the senate agreed to rescind 225 billion in budget authority from emergency nondefense money in pl 105277 an amount that would result in 441 million in fewer outlays for fy1999 after adopting the gramm amendment the senate also approved additiona l supplementals for livestock indu stry relief and oil and gas industry aid both of which were offset by additional cuts from last years emergency supplemental as passed s 544 rescinded 2 968 billion in budget authority from the nondefense emergency money in pl 105277 cuts would be have been made on proportional basis across all nondefens accounts which congr ess approved on an emergency basis without offsets among the major emergency initiatives funded in pl 105277 that would have potentially been affected by proportional reduction included money for us embassy security and other counterterrorism enhancements y2k conversion counternarcotic s programs and domestic natural disaster assistance the reduct ion in embassy security funding was especially contentious the administration has proposed followon 3 billion 5year initiative that would begin in fy2001 but an expert pane l recommended in late 19 98 that the state department needs to spend 14 billion per year for 10 years i n order to provide adequate security to counter terrorist threats athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30083crs14 for example on april 29 the house international relations committee reported hr 12 1211 authorizing 158 billion for security and maintenance of us missions 11 billion more than the state department proposes for fy2000us facilities overseas some critics in co
