makinen government and finance division updated may 20 2008 abstract the nations trade deﬁcit is equal to the imbalance between national investment and national saving national saving is the sum of household saving business saving and public sector saving budget deﬁcit equals public sector borrowing in the 2000s the gap between national saving and investment widened largely because of fall in private and public saving causing the trade deﬁcit to widen it fell somewhat in 2007 relative to gdp to ﬁnance the trade deﬁcit foreign capital must ﬂow into the united states net private capital inﬂows have not grown over this period however to match the widening gap between saving and investment to ﬁnance the growing trade deﬁcit from 2002 through 2007 oﬃcial capital inﬂows became increasingly important as central banks in few asian and oilproducing countries purchased us assets to moderate or prevent their currencies from appreciating against the dollar net oﬃcial capital inﬂows were close to 400 billion in 2006 and 2007 if total net capital inﬂows should decline the dollar and trade deﬁcit would decline us interest rates would rise and us spending on capital goods and consumer durables would fall all else equalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs219511 for more information see crs report rl31032 the trade deficit causes consequences and cures by craig elwell order code

2000s the gap between national saving and inves tment widened largely because of fall in private and public saving causing the trade deficit to widen it fell somewhat in 2007 relative to gdp to finance the trade deficit foreign capital must flow into the united states net private capital inflows have not grow n over this period however to match the widening gap between saving and investment to finance the growing trade deficit from 2002 through 2007 official capital inflows became increasingly important as central banks in few asian and oil producing countries purchased u s assets to moderate or prevent their currencies from appreciating against the dollar net official capital inflows were close to 400 billion in 2006 and 2007 if total net capital inflows should decline the dollar and trade deficit would decline us interest rates would rise and us spending on capital goods and c onsumer durables would fall ll else equal this report will be updated as events warrant introduction by accounting identity the us current acc ount balance which consists primarily of the trade balance must qual the financial formerly the capital account balance or the net international flow of capita l that is because count ry receives saving from abroad when it imports more than it exports1 capital outflows represen t foreign assets purchased by americans whereas capital inflows are us assets purchased by foreigners also by identity us spending on capital goods inves tment must equal nati onal saving plus net capital flows national saving consists of private saving household and business savinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21951crs2 1050510152025 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006of gdpprivate sav ing domesticinvestment governmentsav ing trade balancefigure 1 us saving investment budget balance and trade balanceand public sector saving federal state nd local government saving when the public sector runs budget deficit it has negativ saving rate which re duces national saving these identities are useful when attempting to provide proximate explanation for why the us trade deficit has stayed at ve ry high levels from the late 1990s period of rapid economic expansion through the recession of 2001 and to the present the 1990s experience in the late 1990s the united states experi enced an investment boom and decline in the private sector saving rate as can be seen in figure 1 there was widening gap between the private saving and investment ra tes as the decade progressed the result was growing trade deficit that filled the ga p from 13 of gdp in 1997 to 4 of gdp in 2000 although the public sector budget balance improved as the decade progressed moving to surplus in 1998 this shift was not large enough to offset the growing private sector savinginvestment imbalance and th trade deficit continued to grow so paradoxically for some the budget deficit nd trade deficit did not move in the same direction as had occurred in the 1980s th reason was that all else did not remain constant spending on capital goods inve stment rose and private saving fell source crs report rs21480 saving rates in the united states calculation and comparison by brian w cashell notes private saving equals household and business saving net government saving equals the combined budget balance of the federal and state and local sect or domestic investment includes private and public investment the trade balance measure used in this ch art is measured as the current account deficit in the bea saving and investment tables bea measures government saving on calendar year basis using different definition than in budget documents why did the 1990s investment boom lead to growing trade deficit and an appreciating dollar the subs tantial acceleration in productivity growth that began in the last half of the 1990s undoubtedly increased the r eal rate of return on us capital since this rise in productivity was largely an amer ican phenomenon real rates of return in the us rose relative to those abroad and this served to increase the attractiveness of ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21951crs3 2 for more information on foreign lending to the united states see crs report rl32462 foreign investment in us securities by james jackson 3 most of the fiscal shift from 2000 to 2007 came at the federal level since state and local governments have balanced budget rules the federal budget shifted from surplus of 19 of gdp in 2000 to deficit of 34 of gdp in fy2003 in subsequent years it declined reaching 16 of gdp in 2007 4 this was the same logic behind the twin ficits argument made in the 1980s see crs report rs21409 the budget deficit and the trade deficit what is their relationship by marc labonte and gail makinenassets the response of foreig ners and americans was to s ubstitute american assets for nonamerican assets in their portfolios2 to buy american assets foreigners had first to buy dollars this drove up the price of the dollar on the foreign exchange market the dollar appreciated and as explained above this led to growing trade deficit the 2000s experience the american investment boom came to an abrupt halt with the 2001 economic recession as seen in figure 1 domestic investment spendi ng fell to 18 of gdp in 2003 from 22 in 2000 it has since recovered somewhat over that period private saving first increased modestly from 136 of gdp in 2000 to nearly 149 of gdp in 2003 it has since declined since the trad deficit reflects the imbalance of national saving and investment one might assume that the change in saving and investment would result initially in smaller trade deficit and then larger one all else equal however other things were not equal during this period the public sector initially went from being net contributor to na tional saving running net budget surplus of 24 of gdp in calendar year 2000 to net borrower runni ng budget deficit that peaked at 36 of gdp in 2003 shift of 6 of gdp3 this change in fiscal position meant that the overall shortfall of national saving relative to investment in the early 2000s grew and was larger than in the 1990s as the fiscal position improved after 2003 it was not enough to offset the growing gap between private inve stment and private saving this meant that longterm interest rates did not fall as much as they otherwise would have4 investors choose where to buy assets based on the riskadjus ted rate of return the federal reserve had an impor tant influence on interest rates from 2000 to 2003 lowering shortterm interest ra tes to 1 from 65 it might be expected that the fall in interest rates that accompanied the investment slowdown and the steep stock market decline of mid2000 to 2002 made the us economy less attractive destinati on for foreign capital as can be seen in figure 2 this was generally the case annual private capital inflows fell from about 1 trillion in 2000 to 600 billion in 2003 however at the same time that the us was experiencing an economic downtur n so was much of the rest of the world and american purchases of foreign assets p rivate outflows also fell sharply from 600 billion in 2000 to 300 billion in 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21951crs4 source bureau of economic analysis beginning in 2004 with the acceleration in world economic growth international capital flows began to rise private infl ows increased sharply topping 14 trillion in 2006 and 2007 in 2005 private outflows fell causing net private inflows to rise in 2006 and 2007 private outflows rose relative to priv ate inflows causing net private inflows to fall to 356 billion in 2006 and 268 billion in 2007 based on the decline in net private capita l flows from 2002 to 2007 the trade deficit would have been expected to have decline this did not occur except for small decline in 2007 because of an increas in official capital inflows primarily purchases of us assets by foreign central banks to increase th eir foreign exchange reserves and it is this net inflow that filled the growing gap between national saving and investment in the united states as seen in figure 3 net private inflows tracked net total inflows very closely from 1997 to 2001 but since 2002 net to tal inflows the trade deficit kept climbing while net private inflows both rose nd fell net official capital inflows became major source of financing for domestic investment over this period

flows 19962007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21951crs5 source bureau of economic analysis official capital inflows have not been sp read evenly among us trading partners they have been concentrated in asian ec onomies and more recen tly in oilproducing economies by contrast the foreign reserve accumulation of many trading other partners such as the euro area and the anglosa xon countries has been negligible the decline in net private capital flow s through 2007 placed downward pressure on the us dollar since foreigners needed to buy fewer dollars to buy us assets but the rise in net official capital inflows tempered that decline the dollar has fallen 35 in real terms against major currencies since its peak in february 2002 when one examines the depreciation of the dollar since then it is due mainly to decline against the euro 78 the canadian dollar 58 and the british pound 38 the same countries that have not been source of official capital inflows the dollar declined by 29 in nominal terms against the japanese yen and by 19 against the chinese yuan why did some countries decide to increas their foreign exchange reserves since 2002 although japan allows its currency to float it would appear that the government is committed to policy of moderating the yens appreciation relative to the dollar so as not to nip japans revival of economic growth in the bud nd add deflationary pressures to the japanese price level this means th at as relative private demand for us goods or assets in japan declined the bank of japan entered the foreign exchange market and bought dollars and with them dollardeno minated assets to moderate the yens appreciation thus the bilate ral trade deficit between the united states and japan did not decline as much as it would have if the bank of japan had not entered the exchange market to support the dollar this was par ticularly the case through 2004 the increase in japans foreign exchange reserves has been much more modest since then similar story can be told about other count ries accumulating foreign reserves the chinese role in this episode is more complicated since its government does not allow the free flow of private capital out of china nevertheless the data from china must still conform to the accounting identity mentioned above thus for china to have current account surplus domestic investment in china must be less than chinas02004006008001000 19961998 20002002 2004 2006billions of net official inflow net private inflowfigure 3 us net capital inflows by type 19962007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21951crs6 national saving however it is the chinese government rather than private individuals who are diverting chinas saving abroad the result has been large accumulation of dollar denominated assets by the bank of china thus lower us interest rates are unlikely to have had much of an effect on the bilateral flow of capital from china to the us since 2005 china has allowed the yu an to appreciate against the dollar but intervenes in currency markets to prevent th yuans value from changing by more than 03 daily at most between 2002 and 2007 th yuan has appreciated 19 in nominal terms against the dollar what do these trends mean for the us economy did the shift in net capital inflow to the united states since 2002 from primarily private to mix of private and official sources change the effect of the trade deficit on the us economy the shift meant that net inflows were based less on private lenders seeking profitable opportunities in the united states and more on efforts by foreign central banks to keep their currenc from appreciating against the dollar although the motive for the trade deficit has changed since the 1990s its effect on the us economy remains the same when priv ate foreigners buy us assets they must first obtain dollars and this pushes up the valu of the dollar this makes us exports and importcompeting goods less desirable reducing production and em ployment in those industries on the other hand the capital infl ow increases the supply of saving available to us borrowers thereby pushing down domestic interest rates this has an offsetting positive effect on the us economy because it increases interestsensitive spending on plant equipment homes consumer durables such as automobiles and appliances and the like thereby boosting employment in those industries in the medium term the trade deficit has net effect on us aggregate spending or employment although there may be transitional effects it does change the composition of spending and employment however away from the trade sector and to ward the capital and durable good sectors when the trade deficit results from official capital flows the outcome is very much the same when country reduces its rela tive demand for us goods and services us exports and employment within export industrie s fall with floating exchange rate the dollar would depreciate but if the foreig n country has fixed its exchange rate to the dollar its central bank must instead purchase dollars and us assets to prevent the dollar from depreciating this pushes down us interest rates and stimulates interest sensitive us spending just the same as if private capital inflow motivated by relative rates of return had occurred thus if the purchase of us assets by fo reign central banks official capital inflows to the united states ceased the composition of output would change all else equal the us dollar would depreciate increasing the output of us exports and importcompeting industries but at the same time less saving would be available for americans to finance their spending on capital goods and for the us government to finance its budget deficit as result interest rates would rise and depress interestsensitive spending all else equal
