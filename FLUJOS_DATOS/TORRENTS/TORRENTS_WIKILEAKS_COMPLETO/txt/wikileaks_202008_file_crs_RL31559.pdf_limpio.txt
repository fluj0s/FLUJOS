the hands of radical states and terrorists represent major threat to us national security interests multilateral regimes were established to restrict trade in nuclear chemical and biological weapons and missile technologies and to monitor their civil applications congress may consider the efficacy of these regimes in considering the potential renewal of the export administration act as well as other proliferationspecific legislation in the 110 th congress this report provides background and current status information on the regimes the nuclear nonproliferation regime encompasses several treaties extensive multilateral and bilateral diplomatic agreements multilateral organizations and domestic agencies and the domestic laws of participating countries since the dawn of the nuclear age us leadership has been crucial in developing the regime while there is almost universal international agreement opposing the further spread of nuclear weapons several challenges to the regime have arisen in recent years india and pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998 north korea withdrew from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt in 2003 nd tested nuclear explosive device in 2006 libya gave up clandestine nuclear weapons program in 2004 and iran was found to be in noncompliance with its treaty obligations in 2005 the discovery of the nuclear black market network run by aq khan has spurred new thinking about how to strengthen the regime including greater restrictions on sensitive technology however the possible extension of civil nuclear cooperation by the united states and other countries to india nonparty to the npt has raised questions about what benefits still exist for nonnuclearweapons states that remain in the treaty regime the chemical and biological weapons cbw nonproliferation regimes contain three elements the chemical weapons convention cwc the biological and toxin weapons convention bwc and the australia group the informal australia group coordinates export controls on cbwrelated materials and technology after 25 years of negotiations the cwc entered into force in april 1997 it prohibits the development production stockpiling transfer and use of chemical weapons and mandates the destruction of existing chemical weapon arsenals bwc states parties have not yet been able to agree upon verification protocol to be added to the convention since its 1972 inception bwc state parties have failed to agree on verification mechanism the missile nonproliferation regime is founded not on treaty but an informal agreement created in 1987 the missile technology control regime mtcr the mtcrs goal is to limit the spread of missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons thirtyfour countries now adhere to the guidelines which have been modified over time to include missile systems designed for the delivery of chemical and biological weapons the regime which has enforcement organization is thought to have been instrumental in blocking several missile programs but it has been unable to stop north korean missile development production and exports or to win the full cooperation of russian and chinese entities this report is updated annually

chemical and biological weapons and missiles the regimes and their member countries use cooperative and coercive measures to achieve nonproliferation and counterproliferation objectives multilateral agreements and organizations are supplemented by strong bilateral cooperation among key allies unilateral po litical and economic actions and recourse to military operations should they become necessary congress supports the nonproliferation regimes primarily by providing statutory authority and funding for us participation establishing policy and mandating punitive actions to help enforce the international standards set by the regimes the term regime often refers to the entire array of international agreements multilateral organizations national laws regulations and policies to prevent the spread of dangerous weapons and technologies the nuclear nonproliferation regime is presently the most extensive followed by those dealing with chemical and biological weapons and then by the missile regime the difficulty of producing nuclear weapons material highly enriched uranium or plutonium and the great awareness of nuclear weapons destructiveness together have been conducive to creating complex regime with widespread agreement on the priority of nuclear nonproliferation chemical weapons are easier to make and rely on readily available precursors and they are far less destructive biological weapons also rely on dualuse technology and as technology has spread efforts to build more extensive control regime have intensified finally there is international consensus on the danger of missile proliferation to support nonproliferation treaty or binding regime with enforcement mechanisms key aspect of all the regimes is their attempt to control exports of sensitive goods and technologies through supplier agreements these are the nuclear suppliers group and the zangger committee for nuclear technology the australia group for chemical and biological weapons technology and the missile technology control regime in the last decade these export control regimes have expanded their membership expanded and refined their control lists and increased coordination among member states at the same time however the nonbinding nature of some of the regimes and growing resistance to them by certain countries including some regime members limits their effectiveness major dilemma is whether to include new members such as russia and china that are not us allies and do not have reliable export controls or to limit membership to countries with excellent nonproliferation credentials regime members are afforded special access to controlled technology by the other members so this issue also affects decisions on whether to include nonallies table 1 lists the proliferation control regimes their components and statutory authority there are many arms control treaties and other activities that address aspects of wmd and conventional weapons beyond the regimes covered in this report 2 g21g157g138g157g158g156g561g138g151g141g561g22g155g142g151g141g156g561 the nonproliferation regimes have prevented many risky transfers over the years however several factors undermine their effectiveness one is the difficulty of addressing underlying 1 this report was updated with the assistance of research associate jill marie parillo 2 for coverage of these

countries to acquire weapons of mass destruction wmd regional security conditions as well as the desire to compensate for other countries superior conventional or unconventional forces have been common motivations for wmd programs some countries may want wmd to dominate their adversaries prestige is another reason why certain countries seek wmd another factor working against the regimes is the steady diffusion of technology over timemuch of the most significant wmd technology is 50 years old and growing access to dualuse equipment makes it easier for countries or groups to build their own wmd factories from commonly available civilian equipment there are at least two problems common to all of the nonproliferation regimesthe lack of universal membership and gaps in verification in the nuclear regime india pakistan north korea and israel are not members of the npt apart from diplomatic questions about how to treat their status as states with nuclear weapons not sanctioned by the npt those countries are not bound by that treatys prohibition on sharing nuclear technology they are also not members of the export control groups the international community seems to be at loss for how to bring these states into the nonproliferation regimes w ithout tacitly agreeing to their acquisition of nuclear weapons major objection to the proposed us nuclear cooperation agreement with india is the perception that it legitimizes indias nuclear weapons program without extracting any significant concessions like india pakistan is not bound by any npt obligations whether or not pakistani scientist aq khan sold nuclear t echnology on the black market with or without pakistani government acquiescence revelations of centrifuge enrichment technology sales to libya iran and north korea in 2004 galvanized the international community to examine strengthening implementation of national export controls and interdiction unfortunately the 2005 npt review conference failed to address these and other challenges facing the npt including north koreas withdrawal in 2003 and irans noncompliance in 2005 in the cbw area some states suspected of having military programs are still outside the treaty within the treaties there are some members eg iran under the cwc and russia under the bwc suspected of continuing programs in the missile area although the hague code of conduct has widespread membership mtcr is still not adhered to by many states eg china north korea that are responsible for proliferating missile technologies continued diplomatic support for the treaties may face some hurdles in the nuclear nonproliferation regime many nonweapons states link their continued cooperation with progress in implementing article vi of the treaty steps toward eventual nuclear disarmament by the five nuclear weapons states in recent years several developments have generated criticism the united states abrogation of the antiballistic missile abm treaty conclusion of the moscow treaty which many criticize as having little real impact and verification the us senates rejection of the comprehensive test ban treaty failure to proceed on fissile material production cutoff

allies and other countries are very important for us efforts to counter the spread and the use of wmd initiatives by allies such as the g8 global partnership to combat the spread of wmd demonstrate resolve to tackle specific proliferation problems in may 2003 president bush launched the proliferation security initiative see description below many of these relationships nonetheless are strongly influenced by other political military and economic issues that sometimes take precedence over proliferation concerns in practice nonproliferation competes with important policy objectives such as trade regional issues and domestic political considerations and uneven implementation of nonproliferation policy can result in particular it appears that the bush administration has elevated counterterrorism cooperation above nonproliferation cooperation in few cases more difficult challenge exists when key us allies and friends seek wmd and missiles of their own or transfer wmd technology in that circumstance breakthrough in establishing trust and cooperation might ease some of the underlying security concerns that motivate countries to acquire wmd or to transfer wmd technology perhaps the hardest challenge for nonproliferation policies is to reduce the desire of countries for weapons of mass destruction it is sometimes possible to change regional security conditions through alliances arms transfers arms control or negotiations aimed at settling conflicts however eliminating underlying motivations takes time and the next best option may be to delay wmd development for as long as possible libyas decision in december 2003 to give up its nuclear chemical weapons and missile programs is good example of state that apparently decided the costs of wmd programs exceeded their benefits unilaterally the united states uses sanctions to support its nonproliferation objectives various laws authorize or require the president to impose unilateral sanctions on countries that acquire use or help other countries to obtain wmd or missiles sanctions can affect us aid cooperation and impose restrictions on us technology exports the effectiveness of sanctions often depends on persuading other countries to pport or respect us sanctions even without multilateral support sanctions can still highlight strong us opposition to wmd proliferation however strong sanctions are rarely imposed on us friends or allies that acquire wmd

us armed forces have developed programs to help prevent the spread of wmd to deter or prevent their use and to protect against their effects defense cooperation and arms transfers to us allies can ease concerns about security that can lead them to consider acquiring wmd and also signal potential adversaries that acquisition or use of wmd may evoke strong military response us conventional and nuclear military capabilities and the threat of retaliation help deter wmd attacks against us forces territory or allies counterproliferation capabilities have been expanded in recent years to include more advanced passive and active defense measures passive counterproliferation tools include protective gear such as gas masks and detectors to warn of the presence of wmd active measures include missile defenses to protect us territory forces and allies precisionguided penetrating munitions and special operation forces to attack wmd installations and intelligence gathering and processing capabilities intelligence is crucial to us nonproliferation ef forts particularly in helping shape policy

agencies track foreign wmd programs monitor treaty compliance and attempt to detect transfers of wmd goods and technology the united states cooperates with certain allies to prepare for possible counterproliferation actions although counterproliferation has emerged as main pillar of the bush administration strategy to combat wmd political and technical hurdles hidden underground bunkers

diplomacy treaty implementation and military options legislation effecting restrictions on foreign aid sanctions and export controls help establish nonproliferation policy and congressional oversight of executive branch nonproliferation policies congress enacted strict controls on nuclear energy and cooperation in the first atomic energy act of 1946 by the 1950s however it became clear that the us nuclear weapons program needed materials from abroad and that pure denial of materials and technology had neither stopped the soviet union nor the uk from acquiring nucle ar weapons the 1954 revision of the atomic energy act reflected shift in strategy from that of prevention through denial to one of influence through cooperation however as allies planned to sell sensitive enrichment and reprocessing equipment to states outside of the npt in the 1970s eg pakistan south korea and brazil congress reacted by passing several laws to slow down nuclear commerce and implement sanctions against those states clandestinely pursuing nuclear weapons controls on exports of chemical and biological agents with military applications and missiles have been regulated under the arms export control act aeca of 1968 an d their dualuse technologies have been regulated under the export administration act eaa of 1979 and its predecessors but these controls were implemented relatively later in the 1980s table 2 lists the major us laws enacted to limit the transfer of wmd and wmd technology over time most laws have been amended to address the range of wmd threats but there are few laws that address only one kind of weapon of mass destruction some laws have focused on proliferation threat from particular country nunnlugarrelated legislation and the freedom support act address the range of wmd but focus on russia and the nis in addition legislation related to iran and syria span the range of wmd proliferation see appendix b for relevant text from nonproliferationrelated

several treaties extensive multilateral and bilateral diplomatic agreements multilateral organizations and domestic agencies and the domestic laws of participating countries since the dawn of the nuclear age us leadership has been crucial in developing the regime while there is almost universal international agreement opposing the further spread of nuclear weapons several challenges have arisen in recent years india and pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998 north korea withdrew from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt in 2003 and tested nuclear device in 2006 libya gave up clandestine nuclear weapons program in 2004 and iran was found to be in noncompliance with its treaty obligations in 2005 the discovery of the nuclear black market network run by aq khan has spurred new thinking about how to strengthen the regime including enhanced export controls and greater restrictions on sensitive technology however the possible extension of civil nuclear cooperation by the united states and other countries to india nonparty to the npt has raised questions about what benefits still exist for nonnuclear weapons states that remain within the treaty regime in 2004 there were five declared nuclear weapons states united states russia great britain france china three facto nuclear weapons states india israel pakistan and one country north koreathat has probably secretly produced enough plutonium for at least half dozen nuclear bombs this is considerably less than predicted 40 years ago when president kennedy warned of the possibility that by the 1970s the united states could face world in which fifteen or twenty or twentyfive nations may have these weapons the nonproliferation regime has not stopped all proliferation but it has helped restrain nuclear ambitions and solidified an international norm of behavior strongly condemning proliferation many countries that could make nuclear weapons have not but some have at one time or another taken significant steps towards acquiring nuclear weapons capability argentina brazil south africa iran iraq north korea taiwan sweden and south korea all have had nuclear weapons development programs both japan and german had nuclear weapons programs during the second world war but did not succeed in making nuclear weapons before their programs were halted at the end of the war argentina brazil south korea sweden taiwan and south africa abandoned their nuclear weapons programs and joined the npt as nonnuclear weapons states ukraine kazakhstan and belarus as former so viet republics with inherited nuclear weapons on their soil also opted to join the npt as nonnuclear weapons states despite its membership as nonnuclear weapons state in the npt libya gave up clandestine nuclear weapons program in december 2003 4 only few countries maintain an interest in developing nuclear weapons but it is difficult to predict how many countries or terrorist groups may in the future want nuclear weapons

it took just three months after the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 for the first proposals to emerge from governments to control the destructive uses of nuclear energy it took twentyfive years however for the npt to emerge as the blueprint for nuclear nonproliferation5 in 1968 the treaty demarcated nuclearweapon states from nonnuclearweapon states by defining nuclearweapon states as those states that have manufactured and exploded nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device prior to january 1 1967 this definition implied that there would only ever be five legitimate nuclearweapon statesthe united states russia great britain france and china all other states would join as nonnuclear weaponstates agreeing not to 5 previous proposals included 1945 proposal by the united states britain and canada proposed to establish atomic energy commission to eliminate the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes 1957 package of measures from canada uk france and united

treaty officially in april 2003 india israel and pakistan have never been members of the treaty the pledge not to acquire nuclear weapons is verified through the application of nuclear safeguards measures the international atom ic energy agency iaea founded in 1957 devised system of nuclear material accountancy coupled with periodic and special inspections to ensure that nuclear material is not diverted from peaceful uses to military uses each non nuclearweaponstate party to the npt must negotiate an agreement with the iaea to submit all nuclear material in its possession to regular inspections7 after learning several lessons from iraqs and north koreas clandestine nuclear programs the iaea launched major effort to strengthen its safeguards system see below in 1992 the incentive for nonnuclearweapon states to submit to inspections is promise by advanced nuclear countries to promote the fullest possible exchange of equipment materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy 8 the nuclearweapon states also agree to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament9 in 1995 npt members voted to make the treaty permanent the members also agreed on stronger review process to oversee compliance with the treaty however many members of the npt are dissatisfied and the future of the treaty is not guaranteed see discussion of implementation

international nuclear trade laws parties to the treaty agree to report to the iaea on the disposition of nuclear materials being transported and agree to provide appropriate security during such transport for several years the united states has been trying to strengthen this treaty to address the issue of nuclear terrorism by extending controls to domestic facility security not just transportation in july 2005 states parties convened to amend the convention they extended the conventions scope to cover not only nuclear material in international transport but also nuclear material in domestic use storage and transport as well as the protection of nuclear material and facilities from sabotage the new rules will come into effect once they have been ratified by twothirds of the

the united states and other weapons states after certain criteria were satisfied this nuclearweaponfree zone is not yet in force and the united states and russia have not ratified but have signed the

states and other weapons states declined to sign the protocols to the zone because the treaty contained controversial definitions of its members sovereignty over territorial seas the united states

completion of the new reactors such compliance hinged on several issues including resolution of how much undeclared plutonium north korea might have separated prior to 1994 experts generally agree that the amount is at least sufficient for 12 bombs about 12 kg an international consortium called the korean peninsula energy development organization kedo was established in march 1995 to coordinate the reactor construction project kedo negotiated several agreements with north korea on the legal financial and territorial aspects of the project south korea was to build the reactors and pay for

states give up their right to develop nuclear weapons nuclearweapon states agree to eventually disarm in the 1990s the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt was seen as the next step toward nuclear disarmament15 by the mid1990s all nuclear weapons states were observing moratorium on testing which the treaty would have made permanent the parties completed negotiations and signed the ctbt in 1996 president clinton submitted the treaty to the senate in september 1997 and in 1999 the senate voted against the treaty16 the treaty remains on the senate foreign relations committee calendar unilateral and bilateral reductions of nuclear weapons have also been important within the context of the nuclear nonproliferation regime as demonstrations of good faith by the nuclear weapons states towards the eventual goal of disarmament in january 2002 the bush administration released the results of its nuclear posture review announcing that us nuclear planning would longer address the russian thre at but would need to meet range of threats from unspecified countries the redirection would be accompanied by large unilateral reduction in deployed nuclear weapons however the new policy also included development of controversial missile defense capability improving the nuclear weapons infrastructure to allow resumption of testing and possible development of new weapons more rapidly although the administration statement did not indicate that such activities were contemplated or necessary the suggestion that they might be in the future caused dismay in nonproliferation circles17 in may 2002 presidents bush and putin signed what has become known as the treaty of moscow which will reduce the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons to between 1700 and 2200 by 201218 this treaty has been viewed alternately by some observers as step toward nuclear disarmament and by others as step back from nuclear disarmament since its reductions are not permanent and apply only to deployed forces rather than the stockpile of weapons as whole for many countries the abm treaty was an important symbol of commitment by the united states and ussr to ratchet down the nuclear arms race and its june 2002 abrogation represents to some setback in disarmament on the other hand some observers have argued that us withdrawal from the treaty will have little impact on other states nuclear force postures including that of china19 on may 18 2006 the united states tabled draft fissile material cutoff treaty fmct at the cd in geneva the proposed us treaty would enter into force with the signatures of the five nuclear weapons states ban new production of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for use in nuclear weapons for 15 years be extended only by consensus of the parties

highenriched uranium enrichment for naval fuel contain verification mechanism the lack of verification mechanism in the us draft is controversial as it contradicts the shannon mandate of 1995 in which the conference on disarmament agreed to negotiate nondiscriminatory multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices following bush administration internal review in 2004 us policy has been that effective and international verification of fmct is not achievable20 this was break from previous policy the review reportedly found that verification regime would be too intrusive and too expensive disagreement remains about this approach and negotiations have not yet begun nevertheless some perceive ban on producing fissile material for weapons as much more relevant today than it was decade ago view supported by the bush administrations may 18 2006 proposal21 concern about terrorist access to large stockpiles of fissile material has only grown since the cooperative threat reduction programs began in the early 1990s and particularly since september 11 2001 revelations about

committee to assist in restricting nuclear trade as called for in article iii of the npt28 in 1974 the zangger committee compiled list of nuclear export items that could be potentially useful for military applications of nuclear technology the nuclear suppliers agreed that the transfer of items on the list would trigger requirement for iaea safeguards to assure that the items were not used to make nuclear explosives the zangger list included reactors reactor components and certain nuclear materials such as heavy water in recent years the list of controlled items has been expanded and updated membership is voluntary and implies formal commitments for enforcement of the guidelines as of january 2008 the zangger committee had 36 members 29 and continued to meet twice each year to

shaken by the 1974 test of nuclear explosive device by india the major nuclear suppliers in 1975 established set of unpublished nuclear export guidelines 30 in 1978 the group known as the london club added new members and announced common policy regarding nuclear exports while the npts zangger list initially included only nuclear materials and components used directly in weapons development the london club adopted more restrictive export control guidelines that included some dualuse items with civil and military applications the nsg guidelines called for suppliers to exercise restraint regarding transfers of enrichment and reprocessing technology and required the provision of physical security for transferred nuclear facilities and materials acceptance of safeguards on replicated facilities based on design transferred from london club memberstate and prohibitions against retransfer of nuclear exports to third parties although nsg guidelines were in place members took further actions until 1991 concerned about iraqs successful procurement of dualuse items and apparently inconsistent enforcement of nuclear export controls in several supplier countries the nsg convened in

january 1992 for transfers of wider range of nuclearrelated dualuse equipment material and technology and jointly dopted the longstanding us policy of requiring fullscope safeguards for all nuclear exports nations purchasing nuclear technology must open all nuclear facilities to inspection not just the facility in which an imported item is used31 the nsg has expanded to 45 members32 some developing nations have objected to the nsg because it further divides the technologically advanced nuclear haves from the have nots and creates additional obstacles to their access to nuclear technology few countries have turned to suppliers outside of the nsg to avoid the requirement for fullscope safeguards on nuclear exports the emergence of new nuclear suppliers that do not subscribe to nsg guidelines undermines the efforts of nsg members to control the spread of nuclear weapons the strengthening of nsg export policy after the gulf war responded to numerous examples of illegal covert and suspicious nuclear trade involving western firms and countries such as india iraq iran israel pakistan brazil argentin south africa and others these transfers underscored the limitations of voluntary export controls but they also motivated us officials to push for further tightening of nsg restrictions on world nuclear exports however as voluntary association the nsg has formal administrative structure legal authority to influence the nuclear trade policies of its members and formal enforcement mechanism in 2005 the united states approached the nsg to create an exception for india to the nsgs requirement for fullscope safeguards as condition of nuclear supply such an exception would be necessary for the united states to implement its proposed civil nuclear cooperation initiative with india33 key nsg members such as the united states russia and france support countryspecific exception while other members question whether such an approach might be damaging to the nonproliferation regime nsg members may take up the issue in 2008 if and when india and the iaea formulate safeguards agreement as required by the henry j hyde united statesindia peaceful atomic

in late 1991 congress passed the soviet nuclear threat reduction act which became known as the nunnlugar amendment establishing programs to assist with the safe and secure storage and dismantlement of nuclear weapons in russia and the newly independent states nis these programs initially focused on the loose nukes problem but have broadened their focus to address variety of proliferation risks associat ed with weak political control over nuclear materials equipment and expertise as well as cw bw and missiles this effort has expanded to include the ctr program in dod and nonproliferation programs in doe and the state department 42 in the fy2004 defense authorization act there was provision to allow 50 million of unobligated funds to be spent on cooperative threat reduction outside the

weapons it has been much more difficult to constrain their proliferation and use they do not require as extensive an infrastructure as do nuclear weapons and the technologies are much more widely disseminated making it difficult to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate activities 44 in addition there has been weaker consensus on the need to control these weapons in part because they

commodities through ag members and 3 the ags relationship to the chemical weapons convention the question of membership expansion has been perennial one as countries seek ag membership to avoid the export controls imposed on nonmembers the ag has remained relatively small because of its inclusion only of countries seriously dedicated to cbw non proliferation and capable of maintaining an effective export control regime some have argued that extending membership to countries such as russia could provide greater leverage in encouraging export control improvements to date however ag members have not been persuaded that the advantages of such action outweigh the potential for dilution of the regimes effectiveness and new obstacles to consensusbuilding the transhipment issue arises because ag members are exempted from the export licensing requirements for restricted goods and technology member states assume that exports to ag members will be controlled by the receiving nations export control regime once in that country and therefore are not subject to unauthorized reshipment critics of this exemption maintain that in practice monitoring unlicenced shipments is almost impossible and that countries such as iran and iraq have been able to elude export controls through multiple transhipments this controversy reflects the perpetual tension between nonproliferation controls and the desire for unfettered commerce with major trading partners one apparent weakness in the system is related to information exchange 2002 gao report stated that in particular the united states failed to report 27 export license denials to ag members between 1996 and 2002 54 in 2006 gao reported that the state department had not acted upon corrective recommendations55 52 improvements

interests the cwc contains provision permitting denial of an inspection and critics note that doing so could place the united states in noncompliance they maintain that even if never exercised this sections existence will encourage other nations to enact similar exemptions thereby weakening the cwc verification regime section 253exempts discrete organic chemicals not on the cwc control lists and incidental chemical byproducts or wastestreams from reporting and inspection requirements this is intended to ease potential burdens particularly on paper manufacturers but critics believe the exemption is too broadly worded and would rule out an effective nonintrusive sampling technique for inspectors in early 2002 the bush administration led successful effort to have jose bustani removed as the directorgeneral of the opcws technical secretariat citing disdain for the opcw executive committee and inappropriate administrative and budgetary policies among other charges the state department made concerted and sustained effort to gain support after bustani refused to voluntarily resign on april 21 2002 the conference of opcw state parties voted 48 7 with 43 abstentions to

difficulties to dg bustanis mismanagement others have pointed to the us and russias repeated delinquency in annual dues payments and inspection cost reimbursements as having contributed significantly to the opcws budget shortfalls in 2002 the united states refused to support budget increase to address backlog of inspections and was successful in having its prorated portion of the annual dues reduced from 25 to 22 with fairly small budget at the department of state for international organizations the united states regularly pays its opcw annual dues late in the fiscal year or early in the year after they are due 56 these actions have raised questions among cwc supporters concerning the us commitment to the opcw however the united states approved an overall opcw budget increase of 67 for 2004 for total budget to 865 million the total opcw 2005 budget was 758 million euros 977 million of which the united states assessment was 167 million euros 215 the budget stabilized in 2006 at

destruction deadline from april 2007 to april 292012 the latest possible date allowed under the cwc 57 however ambassador eric javits us permanent representative to the opcw added that we do not expect to be able to meet that deadline because washington had encountered delays and difficulties in destroying its stockpile 58 these delays have generally resulted from the need to meet state and federal environmental requirements and from both local and congressional concerns over the means of destruction reinforcing javits statement former secretary of defense donald rumsfeld notified congress in april 2006 that destruction of the us stockpile by the april 2012 deadline was in doubt based on the current schedules but that the department of defense would continue requesting

unlike the bwc has strong verification mechanism which currently employs over 180 inspectors verification is fundamental challenge to the success of the cwc this verification mechanism allows for the cwc to meet evolving challenges to the implementation of the cwc yet to successfully do so the opcw must intensify its oversight capacity this would call for greater financial support from key member states in order to increase the inspectorate and enable the opcw to do more inspections in shorter amount of time the fact that many toxic chemicals could be used for either military or peaceful purposes and new synthetic compounds are continually developed with toxic properties adds to challenges in cwc verification 63 under the verification system facilities developing chemicals never before used in warfare are given less scrutiny than facilities that once developed warfare agents leaving newly developed toxins with future warfare potential insufficiently monitored 64 this facility issue could also become an issu in respect to biochemicals the international community may run into definitional problem in respect to these chemicals and they could be detrimental to the purposes of the convention synthetic biology is new powerful technology which attempts to assemble new microbial genomes from set of standardized genetic parts65 these components could be natural genes applied for new purposes or natural genes redesigned to function more efficiently or artificial genes that have been designed and synthesized from scratch66 biochemicals developed in synthetic biology produced from natural genes would not be within the scope of cwc verification criteria and may instead fall under the biological weapons regime since the biological weapons regime lacks verification

after ten years of negotiation the united states declared the adaptation protocol draft unacceptable and rejected it as basis for further negotiation in rejecting the draft protocol the bush administration stated that the draft protocol will not improve our ability to verify bwc compliance it will not enhance our confidence in compliance and will do little to deter those countries seeking to develop biological weapons in our assessment the draft protocol would put national security and confidential business information at risk 68 at the same time the united states introduced number of proposals which it suggested that nations undertake on unilateral basis to enha nce biological weapons nonproliferation these were to enact strict national criminal legislation against prohibited bw activities with strong extradition requirements establish an effective united nations procedure for investigating suspicious outbreaks or allegations of biological weapons use establish procedures for addressing bwc compliance concerns commit to improving international disease control and to enhance mechanisms for sending expert response teams to cope with outbreaks establish sound national

unable to reach consensus on final conference declaration many in the arms control community criticized the us position as selfimposed isolation from the mainstream of bwc diplomacy69 in light of continued us opposition the chairman of the november 2001 review conference presented minimal program at resumed session of the review conference in 2002 the program emphasized only annual meetings to discuss strengthening national laws and ways to respond to bw attacks the united states which did not attend the resumed 2002 session endorsed this work program expertlevel meetings have focused on among other things maintaining security of pathogens enhancing capabilities to respond to outbreaks broadening mechanisms for surveillance improving the ability to combat infectious disease and creating codes of conduct for scientists the last bwc review conference was held from november 20 to december 8 2006 state parties came to consensus over final document which extended the series of annual meetings started in the previous intersessional period and provided mandate for the next bwc review conference the intersessional meetings will take place from 2007 to 2010 for two weeks each year the mandate for the next 7 th bwc review conference as stated in the 2006 final document is that the next review conference will be held in 2011 and will review the operation of the convention taking into account new scientific and technological developments relevant to the convention the progress made by states parties on the implementation of the obligations under the convention progress of the implementation of the decisions and recommendations agreed upon at the sixth review conference at the 2006 review conference bwc state parties also decided to expand the genevabased secretariats role and add arabic as an official language to the bwc some observers expressed disap pointment that little was accomplished at this last review conference alan pearson director of the

and many other nations had come to agree in principle on wide range of proactive measures to strengthen the convention however continued tension between developing and developed nations destroyed any chance of major success towards strengthening the convention for example consensus was not found on topics such as an action plan to improve national implementation of treaty obligations an effort to enhance transparency of dualuse biodefense activities and annual review of treaty implementation 70 as biotechnology increases its global spread in the future it will only become more important to

alleviated common ground to improve the bwc exists at the april 2006 preparatory committee for the sixth review conference in contrast to the us position the group of nonaligned states the european union and new grouping of latin american states all reasserted that verification mechanism remained their longterm goal72 however all state parties do share common interest in improving capabilities to respond to disease outbreak natural or intentional and to prevent nonstate actors from obtaining bioweapons 73 states with advanced technology and systems of reporting and surveying disease can share information with states less advanced in these areas keeping bioscience work transparent and keeping good system of reporting can help states distinguish between basic research and

also been discussed among bwc participants as way to strengthen implementation however the level of cooperation several member states legally approved for the who is different from what they approved for bwc for this reason in several cases direct link between the two regimes would not be feasible without change in law the 6th bwc review conference held in december 2006 could not reach consensus on comprehensive set of guidelines for nationa l implementation of the convention owing to differences between the united states and the nonaligned nations group over technology transfer control issues the assumption of the united states opposition also precluded consideration of enhanced verification or enforcement provisions for the convention the conference did establish new program of work for annual meetings which are to take place before the 7th review conference in 2011 for discussion and information exchanges on variety of issues including domestic enforcement of bwc provisions pathogen security and oversight of potentially dualuse research the united states required however that these sessions be prohibited from reaching binding decisions reserving that for the next review

allies became concerned over the rapid spread of missiles as the advanced industrial nations monopoly on missile technology gave way to diffusion of missiles and missile technology th roughout much of the world in april 1987 the united states canada france west germany it aly japan and the united kingdom created the missile technology control regime mtcr to limit the proliferation of missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons thirtyfour countries are now partners in the mtcr 77 in addition china israel romania and the slovak republic have agreed to observe mtcr guidelines but without becoming mtcr partners israel additionally has completed memorandum of understanding with the united states affirming its commitment to abide by mtcr guidelines the regime is based on the premise that foreign acquisition and development of missiles can be delayed and made more difficult and expensive if major producers agree to control exports of missiles and the equipment and technology used in missile production the mtcr is similar in this regard to the nuclear suppliers group the australia group and the wassenaar arrangement it differs from the nuclear chemical and biolog ical nonproliferation regimes in that the mtcr is not supported by treaty and has international organization to verify or enforce compliance rather the mtcr is set of common export control guidelines adopted and administered independently by each of the partner nations the specific missile equipment and technology subject to the guidelines is described in an annex to the mtcr guidelines and divided into two categories each of the member countries is to exercise particular restraint in considering transfers of items in category i which include complete rocket systems and unmanned air vehicle ua v systems capable of delivering 500 kilogram 1100pound payload to range of 300 kilometers 186 miles or more and complete subsystems of such missiles and vehicles there is strong presumption by the mtcr to deny transfers of these systems and components the guidelines further state the transfer of category i production facilities will not be authorized export restraints are to be applied to category ii items which consist of other components equipment material and technology that would be usable in the production of missiles and ua vs category ii also includes at item number 19 complete rocket systems and ua vs with 300km range but not capable of delivering 500kg 75 crs report rl32891 the national biodefense analysis and countermeasures center issues for congress by dana

range as covered by category i and in item number 20 individual rocket stages and rocket engines and production equipment usable for systems with range of 300 km with less than 500kg payload in january 1993 mtcr partners revised the guidelines to limit the risks of proliferation of missile delivery systems for all weapons of mass destruction chemical and biological weapons as well as nuclear weapons the guidelines now call for particular restraint and the presumption to deny transfers of any missiles whether or not they are included in the annex and of any items in the annex if the government judges that they are intended to be used for the delivery of weapons of mass destruction 78 this addition is commonly referred to as catchall clause the mtcr has undergone transformation from small group of western industrial countries to more inclusive group of countries argentina with its condor ii missile program was originally one of the primary targets of the regime but that country terminated development of condor ii and is now full partner in the mtcr south af rica and brazil had active missile programs but are now partners whereas the soviet union was the primary source for missiles to the third world in the 1970s and 1980s russia has become partner in the mtcr although the united states has sanctioned russian organizations for improper exports to iran china has been and still is another significant supplier of missiles and missile technology to developing countries but has committed to observing the mtcr guidelines and pledged not to transfer surfacetosurface missiles that meet the mtcr thresholds in spite of these commitments russian and chinese organizations and individuals continue to supply components and technical assistance for missile production north korea has become the primary supplier of missiles and missile technology to developing countries iran syria india and pakistan are the other countries of major concern regarding the development and acquisition of missiles missile programs in china egypt and south korea have also caused concern in washington cruise missiles have always been included with ballistic missiles and spacelaunch vehicles in the mtcr but are now receiving greater attention as advanced propulsion and guidance technology is becoming more widely available the united states long ago stated its support for expanding membership of the mtcr to include additional countries that subscribe to international nonproliferation standards enforce effective export controls and abandon offensive ballistic missile programs 79 the united states will not support space launch programs in nonmtcr countries but will consider exports of mtcr items for use in spacelaunch programs by mtcr countries on casebycase basis the united states and other mtcr countries are promoting regional efforts to reduce the demand for missiles and persuade countries to forgo the acquisition of missiles 78 according to the guidelines the government judgment on the likely use of the missile items will be made on the basis of all available persuasive information evaluated according to factors including concerns about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction b the capabilities and objectives of the missile and space programs of the recipient state c the significance of the transfer in terms of the potential development of delivery systems other than manned aircraft for weapons of mass destruction d the assessment of the enduse of the transfers including the relevant assurances of the recipient states and

general commitments and modest confidencebuilding measures the united st ates sees the icoc as an important addition to the wide range of tools available to countries to impede and roll back this

to continue in effect the system of controls that had been maintained under the act members of congress became interested in missile proliferation in the mid1980s because of evidence of third world missile development and acquisition programs and because the developing threat was an additional consideration in funding research into ballistic missile defenses libya had purchased soviet scud missiles and iran and iraq were firing missiles at each other congress had little or involvement in shaping the mtcr since it was neither treaty nor an executive agreement soon after the regime was announced in april 1987 it became apparent that companies and individuals from number of mtcr member countries such as west germany italy britain and france were transferring goods and technical assistance to missile development teams in argentina brazil iraq egypt and elsewhere in 1987 the united states also learned that china had transferred intermediate range missiles to saudi arabia many members of congress thought the mtcr needed enforcement mechanisms additional members and stricter compliance several bills were introduced in the 101 st congress with the intention of strengthening the us position on missile nonproliferation several bills that included sanctions against nations companies and individuals who violate the mtcr guidelines gained widespread bipartisan congressional

over the years congress has called for additional sanctions expressed views on nonproliferation policies related to missiles or advanced conventional weapons and expressed views on the organization of

effective enough to warrant the economic and political costs to the united states and whether additional or alternative feasible measures would increase effectiveness many analysts consider the mtcr successful vehicle of quiet diplomacy the mtcr has been credited with slowing missile development in brazil and india and blocking collaborative program of argentina egypt and iraq to build the condor missile this missile would have been significant improvement over the scudbased missiles used by iraq in the gulf war russia and china have probably stopped exporting entire missiles that fall under the parameters of the mtcr but continue to transfer components and technology most european countries and asian allies have tightened their export control laws and some have prosecuted individuals who have smuggled missile technology as well as nuclear and chemical production technology accurate longrange missiles are expensive and difficult to develop and produce because most countries cannot produce and integrate all of the sophisticated components required the mtcr and complementary export controls will probably continue to impede development of the most advanced missiles the major current challenge however is that much of the international commerce in missiles and missile technology occurs between nations that do not adhere to mtcr guidelines china and north korea are not members although china promised to observe the guidelines after the united states had twice imposed economic sanctions on chinese companies for transferring missile items to pakistan on the condition that the united states would lift those sanctions north koreas missile development production deployment and export of missiles has apparently not been hindered by the mtcr in particular north korean exports of missile production technology to iran pakistan syria and egypt seriously undercut the international standards and goals of the regime in the view of some analysts the activities of north korea demonstrate the failure of the mtcr and the necessity of the other measures some difficulties associated with the nuclear chemical and biological nonproliferation regimes may be even more acute with respect to missile technology the notion of suppliers regime dividing the world into haves and havenots is even more exacerbated in the case of missiles since there is treaty and quid pro quo for the havenots the international code of conduct is an attempt to address this carrot side of the carrotstick equation but the lack of specificity on incentives is viewed by some as too limited and by others as too potentially expansive also there is common perception that technology is shared among mtcr members although the

for the strong presumption of denial of category iclass missiles and technology to anyone the us decision in 2002 to elaborate what constitutes rare occasions wherein category i presumption of denials could be overruled lends credence to this view82 further while many of the materials associated with nuclear weapons can be identified and controlled the materials and components used in missiles are commonly used in wide range of commercial manufacturing processes ballistic missiles can be nearly indistinguishable from civilian space launch vehicles and some missile production equipment technology and materials are difficult to distinguish from civilian items this is particularly acute in the case of ua vs as developing nations become increasingly capable of producing missiles indigenously the effectiveness of supplier controls is gradually being eroded growing list of nations now produce ballistic missiles and are increasingly less dependent on imported materials some analysts see attempts to control missile technology exports as futile and argue for the fewest export restrictions possible emphasizing the im portance to the us economy of exports others say the us government should not allow the export of any goods that are likely to harm us national security despite the potential effect on some american business interests in addition to the promotion of exports other foreign policy and national security goals may also compete with missile nonproliferation for govern ment attention and action for instance us leaders hope to encourage russia and china to become stable and responsible actors in their regions and in the international community to pursue economic and political reforms and to respect internationally recognized human rights the united states seeks the cooperation of those two countries and many others in efforts to block nuclear proliferation terrorism drug trafficking and organized crime although missile nonproliferation will remain an issue of utmost importance other goals may occasionally be given greater emphasis however when political leaders suspend missile nonproliferation policies in favor of other goals the credibility of the us missile policy and that of the mtcr are damaged it can become more difficult to persuade other countries to comply with set of standard s when the united states appears to enforce the standards on selective basis the priority to be given to missile nonproliferation has occasionally been point of contention between congress and the administration congress has established economic sanctions that must be imposed on companies that trade in missile technology contrary to the mtcr guidelines the imposition lifting and waiving of these sanctions frequently cause controversy some analysts suggest these negative actions should be coupled with positive incentives to induce countries to refrain from proliferation positive incentives could include trade credits development assistance military assistance technology transfers access to space launch and satellite capabilities or security guaranties but other analysts contend the security benefits derived from adhering to the mtcr should be sufficient and that the united states should not try to buy compliance according to many foreign policy specialists the underlying political and security problems that drive proliferation must be resolved before meaningful curbs can be applied to the spread of weapons of mass destruction and missiles the united states and its partners in the mtcr have helped countries particularly neighbors in regions of ongoing conflict to adopt confidence 82 testimony given by vann van diepen deputy assistant secretary of state for proliferation controls in hearing before senate

such as those that have contributed to security and cooperation in europe they also try to help correct regional imbalances of military forces and to facilitate peace negotiations and arms control talks security alliances and military assistance can play role in restraining missile development the us security umbrella over western europe and parts of asia and the transfer of large quantities of advanced conventional weapons helped to di ssuade number of us allies from developing weapons of mass destruction and helped deter aggression some analysts contend that the security of some allies was enhanced by the deterrent power of us nucleararmed missiles previously deployed in their territory or possibly in the case of israel by indigenous weapons the us government has also decided that it is appropriate to sell missiles us army tactical missile systems with potential range of 250 km to turkey greece south korea britain france and germany though it forbids sales of missiles with range of 300 km however the superiority of us military technology may actually persuade some adversary countries to develop weapons of mass destruction and missiles as their best means of deterring us intervention some analysts see missile defense systems as proper alternative to export controls though most see them as supplementing other military political and economic measures including export controls and sanctions the united states will probably deploy theater and national missile defense systems and has provided defensive missiles to some allies in europe east asia and the middle east as the united states seeks to increase defense cooperation in the area of missile defenses issues could arise about the applicability of mtcr guidelines one particular case where questions have arisen is the proposed transfer of arrow missile defense systems from israel to india which requires us approval 83 air defense missiles and antitheater ballistic missiles probably enhance the security of us allies but none are expected to be 100 percent effective in some cases such as taiwan deployments might increase tensions the administration and congress will have to weigh carefully defense policy objectives against nonproliferation policy objectives in this area 83 in hearing on multilateral nonproliferation regimes of the senate governmental affairs committee july 29 2002 vann van diepen thendeputy assistant secretary of state for proliferation controls stated that the arrow interceptor is mtcr category1 class missile and that israel would have to go through the necessary procedures to decide it could overcome strong presumption of denial to make such sale
