fundamental principles for tactical counterinsurgency coin operations at the company battalion and brigade vel it is based on lessons learned from historic counterinsurgencies and current operations this manual continues the efforts of fm 324 counterinsurgency in combining the historic approaches to coin with the realities of todays operational environment oean environment modified by population explosion ur banization globalization technology the spread of religious fundamentalism resource demand climat change and natural disasters and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction this manual is generic in its geographic focus and should be used with other doctrinal sources chapter 1 operational environment of counterinsurgency defines insurgent and counterinsurgent while using the operational va riables and mission variables to describe the oe finally it stresses developing culture capability for soldiers and leaders chapter 2 foundations of insurgency categorizes insurgent groups by their components elements dynamics and strategies and their manifestationstactics strengths and vulnerabilities chapter 3 foundations of counterinsurgency covers the seven lines of effort tactical considerations clearholdbuild operations and counterinsurgency phases chapter 4 planning in counterinsurgency arguably the most important chapter covers planning for tactical units during counterinsu rgency operations it also covers planning horizons and targeting chapter 5 offensive operations in counterinsurgency addresses offensive techniques used by tactical units during counterinsurgency operations chapter 6 defensive operations in counterinsurgency addresses defensive techniques used by tactical units during counterinsurgency operations chapter 7 stability operations in counterinsurgency addresses stability techniques used by tactical units during counterinsurgency operations chapter 8 working with host nation security forces covers the seven steps

masculine nouns and pronouns may refer to either men or women fmi 3242 ix introduction this manual gives the us army common language concept and purpose to fight and achieve success in counterinsurgency coin is complex subset of warfa re that encompasses all military paramilitary political economic psychological and civic actions taken by government to defeat an insurgency at the company battalion and brigade levels to do this the manual merges traditional approaches to coin with the realities of the current operational environment the us army thinking and doctrine on coin tactics since the end of world war ii have focused on the conduct of counterguerrilla operations in the later stages of insu rgency the army has seen itself as defeating guerrilla forcesusually communist forcesrather than defeating an entire insurgency it saw success as something it could achieve by using the force of arms directly against guerrilla forces this doctrine of coin began to take shape shortly after world war ii in manuals such as fm 3120 operations against guerrilla forces 1951 and later in fm 3115 operations against irregular forces 1961 the army refined its counterinsurgency doctrine during vietnam in fm 3122 us counterinsurgency force fm 3116 counterguerrilla operations both published in 1963 and in fm 3123 stability and support operations 1972 after vietnam the army split coin doctrine off from conventional high intensity operations in fm 10020 military operations in low intensity conflict 1990 in which the light forces owned counterinsurgency and fm 908 counterguerrilla operations 1986 where the focus remained on defeating the guerrilla force this manual is the historical successor to fm 908 in addition parts of fm 10020 have been integrated into this fm as have the armys concept of fullspectrum operations and all elements of coin operations at its heart counterinsurgency is an armed struggle fo r the support of the population this support can be achieved or lost through information engagement strong repres entative government access to goods and services fear or violence this armed struggle also involves eliminating insurgents who threaten the safety and security of the population however military units alone cannot defeat an insurgency most of the work involves discovering and solving the populations underlying issues that is the root causes of their dissatisfaction with the current arrangement of political power dealing with diverse issues such as land reform unemployment oppressive leadership or ethical tensions places premium on tactical leaders who can not only close with the enemy but also negotiate agreements operate with nonmilitary agencies and other nations restore basic services speak the native foreign language orchestrate political deals and get the word on the street todays counterinsurgent battlefield is increasingly cluttere d with us host nation and other coalition forces each with its own strengths and limitations in addition mu ltiple insurgent groups nongovernmental organizations armed contractors and local population divided into several ethnic groups add to this clutter counterinsurgency longrange plan for tactical unit combines offensive fensive and stability operations to achieve the appropriate ratio between these and accomplish unity of effort among diverse units and actors units must build longterm plans around the seven counterinsurgency lines of effort establish civil security establish civil control support host nation forces support to governance restore essential services support economic and infrastructure development and conduct information engagement all seven lines of effort are critical to establishing unity of effort for actions conducted by us units host nation security forces and the host nation government these act ions can range from killing or capturing an insurgent cell known to emplace ieds to solving unemployment in an area to publicizing the opening of water treatment facility without unity of effort over time the tactical units longrange plan will face challenges in securing the population gathering the populations support and defeating the insurgency counterinsurgency is an iterative process tactical units can conduct wide variety of operations these can include anything from combined cordon and search operation with host nation security forces to medical operation to inoculate hamlets children against disease to road project to connect village to the highway to loudspeaker broadcast to inform village about recent council meeting regardless of the mission ccessful tactical units learn and adapt as they discover more about their own strengths and limitationsand the strengths and limitations of the host nation government the populace and the insurgents this manual furthers fm 324s theory that in coin the side that learns faster and adapts more rapi dlythe better learning organizationusually wins each counterinsurgency is unique leaders must always execute good judgment tactical patience and innovation to defeat an insurgency as the us army continues its lengthy battles against insurgency around the world tactical units must continue to focus on securing the support of the population achieving unity of effort and learning and adapting faster than the insurgents do fmi 3242 11 chapter 1 operational environment of counterinsurgency learn all you can about your ashraf and bedu get to know their families clans and tribes friends and enemies wells hills and roads t lawrence the 27 articles of lawrence fm 30 defines an operational environm ent as composite of the conditions circumstances and influences that affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander the particular operational environment heavily influences both the nature of insurgent warfa re and the methods of counterinsurgency operations this chapter helps units define the operational environment of coin by using operational variables employing mission variables understanding the effects of the operational environment and co mprehending the importance of cultural awareness section ioverview for more than two centuries the ited states military has been called upon to defeat insurgencies like the whiskey rebellion in the eastern united states the native americans on the western plains of the united states the boxer rebellion in china pancho villa in mexico augusto sandino in nicaragua and the viet cong in vietnam although the army does have historic examples of coin operations our doctrine and coin skills atrophied between vietnam and th invasion of afghanistan in addition the world is increasingly shaped by population explosion urbanization globalization technology religious fundamentalism resource demand climate change and natural disasters and prolifera tion of weapons of mass destruction the increasing complexity of the world has made it more challenging fo r governments to maintain order and satisfy the rapidly growing needs of their populations as these governments try to maintain their tenuous hold on power dissatisfied portions of their population have like dissatisfi ed groups for thousands of years turned to violence to achieve political goals using violence to achieve political goals is known as insurgency as result us forces have conducted counterinsurgency operations around the world in colombia somalia kosovo afghanistan the philippines and iraq before devel oping better understanding of the operational environment oe it is important to understand what insurgencies counterinsurgencies and the influences shaping the oe are insurgency 11 this is an organized movement aimed at the overthrow of constituted government through use of subversion and armed conflict jp 102 the ke distinction between an insurgency and other movements is the decision to use violence to achieve political goals an insurgency is typically an internal struggle within state not between states it is normally protracted po litical and military struggle designed to weaken the existing governments power control and legitimacy while increasing the insurgencys power control and legitimacy 12 the majority of insurgencies have been limited to local regions or specific countries however todays instant communications allow insurgent groups and leaders to communicate worldwide to find support for their cause and to support causes they view as compatible with their own goals external forces including nationstates may support an insurgency for their own benefit they may also oppose competing nationstate that supports the existing government as result modern insurgencies can often cross multiple countries chapter 1 12 fmi 3242 13 an insurgency is made up of components the five insurgent elements the eight dynamics and one or more of the six insurgent strategies and manifestations tactics strengths and vulnerabilities for greater understanding of insurgencies see chapter 2 counterinsurgency 14 coin involves all political economic military military psychological nd civic actions that can be taken by government to defeat an insurgency jp 102 coin operations include supporting host nations military paramilitary political economic psychological and civic actions taken to defeat an insurgency avoiding the creation of new insurgents and forcing existing insurgents to end their participation is vital to defeating an insurgency coin operations often include security assistance programs such as foreign military sales programs the foreign military financing program and international military training and education programs 15 counterguerrilla operations on th other hand focus on detec ting and defeating the armed insurgent or guerrilla without solving the societys underlying problems military efforts alone however cannot defeat an insurgency for better understanding of counterinsurgency see chapter 3 influences on current operational environments 16 eight forces are shaping current operational environments population explosion 17 population explosion is the rapi d growth of the worlds popula tion over the last six decades in 1950 the worlds population was 2 5 billion people in 2008 the popula tion is estimated at 65 billion people and in 2050 the population is expected to reach 9 billion th population explosi on provides more opportunities for the insurgent to hi within the population and places premium on winning the struggle for the populaces support as the population continues to grow governments will struggle to provide their people with food water and power giving potential insurgent groups an opportunity to exploit vulnerable population urbanization 18 urbanization is the growth of urban areas due to both population surge and migration in 1950 29 percent of the worlds population lived in urban areas in 2008 almost 50 percent of the population lives in urban areas and by 2050 it is estimated that 60 percent of the population will live in urban areas this rapid growth of urban areas indicates that there is greater potential that future insurgencies will be fought in urban areas globalization 19 globalization is combination of the technological economic social cultural and political forces that are bringing nationstates and the people of the world closer together these forces are making the world more interconnected and econom ically linked positively it s reduced poverty in nations like china and india it has increased the gap between rich and poor nations caused an increased demand for resources and may be affecting the climate technology 110 technological developments such as the computer the internet the digital camera and satellite television have transformed the world since 1950 information can be exchanged around the world in less than second this has also incr eased the reach impact and influen ce of the media to the insurgent and the counterinsurgent additiona lly these same technologies along with advanced weaponry have operational environment of counterinsurgency fmi 3242 13 dramatically changed the battlefield both insurgents and counterinsu rgents will continue to innovate and adapt these technologies to the battlefield of today and the future religious fundamentalism 111 religious fundamentalism is defined as belief in the infallibility of hol scriptures absolute religious authority and strict adherence to set of ba sic religious principles without any compromise with modern life as nationstates struggle to provide for their people some of the dissatisfied population as backlash against globalization will turn to religious fundamentalism to provide those needs that the nationstate cannot this is primary insurgent ideology and is further discussed in chapter 2 resource demand 112 demand for energy water and food for grow ing populations will increase competition and potentially conflict climate change and natural disasters 113 climate change and natural disasters will co mpound already difficult c onditions in developing countries and have the ability to cause humanitarian crises driving regiona lly destabilizing population migrations and raising potential for epidemic diseases proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and effects 114 proliferation of weapons of mass destruc tion and effects will increase the potential for catastrophic attacks especially if used by failed states or terrorist organizations section iioperational and mission variables thorough analysis of the population the insurgency and the counterinsurgent using the eight operational variables and the six mission variables is critical to developing counterinsurgency plan that can defeat the insurgency even tactical unit will use the operational variables as way to define their operational environment which often corresponds to their area of interest ai operational variables 115 army doctrine uses eight interrelated operational variables to analyze the operational environment known as pmesiipt th eight operational variables are political 116 the political variable describe s the distribution of responsib ility and power at all levels of government since an insurgency is fundament ally struggle for political power the political environment in the hn country is criti cal attention should be paid not ju st to the formal political system such as political parties and elected officials but also to informal political systems such as tribes ethnic groups and other centers of power longterm success in coin is ultimately based on political efforts all counterinsurgents must focus on the political impact of their actions th erefore tactical leaders may be expected to broker local political solutions 117 host nation hn us and coalition political considerations drive the conduct of coin operations this is especially true concerning the involvement of the us government and us public opinion major goal of most insurgencies is to influence us public opinion against us involvement as chapter 1 14 fmi 3242 counterinsurgent force successful counterinsurgents must therefore not only prevent insurgents from obtaining this goal but also actively work to influence public opinion for the coin mission 118 commanders must be prepared to operate within broad range of political structures the host nations form of government may range from despotic dictatorship to struggling democracy commanders at all levels including platoon leaders and company commanders need to recognize the importance of establishing and reinforcing the hn as the lead authority for all operations this reinforces the legitimacy of the hn government military 119 this variable includes the military capabilities of all armed forces most coin units will need to analyze the insurgencys military forces guerrillas local militias and the host nation security forces commanders should consider qualitative aspects such as conscription or recruitment systems economic basis to include appropriations system and position of forces in national and local government structure additional qualitative considerations are general orga nization training and doctr ine efficiency rapport with population and the police role in the nations internal security for example typical us brigade in iraq might have to analyze sunni guerrilla for ce shia guerrilla force an iraqi national police brigade an iraqi army brigade the iraqi local police and sons of iraq militia unit economic 120 the economic variable consists of the general economic categories of an area of operations ao such as energy raw materials government development policy distribution of labor and labor policies income distribution nati onal food distribution fr ee market or socialist interface and functions consumption patterns external inve stment taxation policy port author ities movement of goods consumer issues border controls foreign trade tariffs and graft or corruption 121 low standard of living and desire for economic reform may be cause of resentment toward the government generally the counterinsurgents pl an their operations to minimize damage to the economic structure of an area to avoid causing adverse psychological and economic impacts and to support economic development social 122 the social variable describes societies within an operational environment society is population whose members are subject to the same po litical authority occupy common territory have common culture and share sense of identity both insurgents and c ounterinsurgents need the support of the population to be successful mo st insurgencies attemp t to increase friction between different groups in society and to gain or increase support from any group that shares common elements with the insurgency these groups may be aligned along racial ethnic religious or social lines language similarities or tradition can also be reason for alignment religious influences often play major role in the sociological factors that affect the insurgent 123 to be successful against insurg ents in particular area and to avoid alienating the populace counterinsurgents must understand the local environment this includes local social issues and national issues that effect the local environment for instance afghanistan units may interact with groups of pashtuns tajiks hazaras uzbe ks and nuristani across their ao information 124 the information variable involve s the collection access use ma nipulation rapid distribution and reliance on data media and knowledge systemsboth civilian and militaryby the global and local communities insurgents seek to control and manipulate how the local regional national and international operational environment of counterinsurgency fmi 3242 15 community perceives its cause and events within their operational environment to achieve this they try to control manipulate and distribute information 125 understanding the existing comm unication system is important because it influences local regional national and international audiences media coverage in particular influences us political decisionmaking popular opini on and the sensitivities of coalition mbers while the local teahouse may control the communitys opinion and the word on the street commanders must use information engagements to fully achieve their tactical goals 126 insurgents observe the actions of both government and coin forces insurgents often use propaganda to gain creditability and legitimacy w ith the population while simultaneously undermining their opponents successful insurgen ts strive to seize the moral high ground on any counterinsurgent mistakes both real and perceived this includes political military ec onomic social religious cultural or legal errors they will use all available mean s including the media nongove rnmental organizations and religious and civic leaders to get their information out to all audiences infrastructure 127 the infrastructure variable includes the basic facilities services and installations needed for community or society to function the state of the infrastructure determines the resources required for reconstruction typical key infra structure includes sewers water electrical academic trash medical facilities safety and other consid erations also known as sweatmso the degradation or destruction of infrastructure will negatively affect both the ho st nation and its population thus the degradation or destruction of infrastructure often helps the insurg ency especially with respect to propaganda and the populations perception of the hn physical environment 128 the physical environment variable is often th most noticeable aspect of an operational environment terrain affects people equipment trafficability visibility and the employment of many weapons the terrain aspects of each area of operations must be evaluated to determine the impact on both insurgent and counterinsurgent forces for coin operations terrain is categorized as either rural or urban weather and climate influence insurgents the population and counterinsurgents who analyze the weather to determine its effect on the populations wellbeing and operations they pay particular attention to trafficability visibility and equipment despite weather extremes most insurgents have an advantage since they are usually native to the climate time 129 time affects everything and influences all decisions however the population the counterinsurgent and the insurgent often view time differently insurgents may design operations with the intent to influence the american political process or elections in contrast counterinsurgents must understand that popular support for extended operations may diminish over time figure 11 shows the difference between western counterinsurgents and an insurgents perspective of time chapter 1 16 fmi 3242 figure 11 comparison of insurgents and counterinsurgents perspectives of time mission variables 130 while analysis in terms of the operational va riables improves understanding of the operational environment it does not lend itself di rectly to mission accomplishment for operations at the tactical level the army uses the mission variables of metttc missi on enemy terrain and weather troops available time available and civil considerations to help unit understand its mission within the context of its specific oe for coin civil considerations are esp ecially important when co mmanders and staff receive specific mission or identify particular problem they can draw relevant information from their ongoing analysis of their oe using operational variables to further complement their analysis of mission variables use of the mission variables combined with the knowledge of the operational variables enables leaders to understand the threat act effectively and anticipate the consequences of their operations before and during mission execution mission 131 mission is the task together with the purpose that clearly indicates the action to be taken and the reason therefore fm 102 at the brigade battalion and company level the coin force conducts tactical operations across seven coin lines of effort these incorporate the five stability tasksestablish civil security establish civil control support hn security forces support to governance restore essential services support to economic development and conduct information engagement these tasks are described in detail in chapter 3 and chapter 4 leth efforts may include patrols raids and cordon and searches nonlethal efforts may include atte nding council meetings engaging tribal leaders or repairing damaged infrastructure enemy 132 coin operations by nature involve confusing emy situation since the enemy generally lacks traditional task organization fm 34130 moreover the enemy insurgents can have varying level of training capability commitment involvement and xperience in addition to analyzing the insurgents disposition composition strengths and weaknesses counterinsurgents must identify and understand the five elements of the insurgency leaders guerrillas auxiliary underg round and mass base furthermore it is important to understand the eight dynamics of the insurgencyits leadership ideology objectives environment and geography external support inte rnal support phasing and timing organizational and operational patterns finally it is critical to identify which of the six strategiesurban military focused protracted popular war conspiratorial identity and composite and coalitionthe insurgent is employing for more on insurgency see chapter 2 operational environment of counterinsurgency fmi 3242 17 terrain and weather 133 terrain includes natural features such as rive rs and mountains and manmade features such as cities airfields and bridges weather describes the conditions of temperature wind velocity precipitation and visibility at sp ecific place and time when evaluating the effects of terrain and weather on coin operations the commander should consider the ffects of seasons of the year to include planting and harvesting periods phases of the moon and coas tal tides in particular he concentrates on the effects of the weather which mainly includes his soldiers equipment and visibility but also includes other factors such as mobility the suitability of terrain and road nets for tactical and logistical operations 134 he focuses on the effects of the terrain on soldiers equipment visibility and mobility units and staffs study the terrain in re lation to the factors of oakoc observation and fields of fire avenues of approach key and decisive terrain obstacles cover and concealment troops and support available 135 successful counterinsurgency operations depend upon the commander using his available assets to maximize force strengths and minimize vulnerabilities to do this the commander realistically appraises the capabilities and limitations of his assets as well as joint interagency international and multinational elements to organize and employ them on suitable missions in the coin environment the tactical unit must identify account for and leverage all hn secur ity forcespolice army and paramilitaryto secure and control the population and disrupt the insurgency time available 136 for tactical operations time available for pla nning and execution varies campaigns and major operations need prolonged pe riods of time for detailed planning st ability operations that address political economic and social issues usually take considerable length of time to complete as such after the initial period of planning the time available for modified or future planning is often quite long 137 when planning shortterm actions such as offens ive operations against fleeting insurgent targets planning time is usually short and information is scarce commanders at all levels can use the time available to them more efficiently by planning c ontingency missions one method to reduce planning time is to codify routine tasks common to similar missions in sop when the need to execute contingency mission arises the basic plan can be reviewed and planning expedited by making minor adjustment

section iveffects describing the effects of the operational environment is the second step in ipb it involves taking the facts about an area of operations grouped by mission variable s of terrain weather and civil considerations and analyzing them to arrive at conclusion about their effects on enemy and friendly courses of action in addition to the normal analytical t ools examining each of the prerequis ites of an insurgency and the root causes that lead to the insurgency have proved to be useful in identifying longterm societal problems these problems lie at the heart of the competition fo r the populations support between the insurgent and counterinsurgent prerequisites 187 there are three prerequisites fo r an insurgency to be succe ssful in an areaa vulnerable population leadership available for direction and lack of government control when all three exist in an area an insurgency can operate with some freedom of movement gain the support of the people and become entrenched over time vulnerable population 188 population is vulnerable if the people have real or perceived grievances that insurgents can exploit the insurgents can expl oit the population by offering hope fo r change as well as exploiting political economic or social dissatisfaction with the current government gap between populations expectations and the capability to meet these exp ectations may cause unrest within the population including turning to insurgency the larger the gap the greater the populations perceived or relative sense of deprivation between what they have and what they perceive they should have similarly the larger the gap the more susceptible the population is to insurgent influence through promises to close the gap leadership available for direction 189 vulnerable population alone will not support an insurgency th ere must be leadership element that can direct the frustrations of the population if insu rgents can recruit coopt or coerce local leaders or the local leaders are part of the insurgency these leaders can dir ect the frustrations of the populace lack of government control 190 real or perceived lack of govern mental control can allow insurgen ts to operate with little or interference from security forces or other agencies the greater the control the government has over the situation the less likely are the chances for insurgen t success the opposite is also true if the government is not providing what the people believe their government should insurgents may provide an alternative chapter 1 118 fmi 3242 government or shadow government or they may rely nullify governance to allow freedom of action and movement depending on their end state host nation failure to see or admit that there is an issue or outright refusal to change can further strengthen this prerequisite root causes 191 there are five general categories of root causes fo r insurgencies root cause is the basis of grievance among the population some or all of these grievances may fuel an insurgency to varying degrees the importance of the root causes or even their existence can change over time additionally insurgents may be adept at manipulating or creating root causes and grievances to serve their purpose identity 192 many factors impact persons sense of identity but membership in socio cultural group may have the deepest influence strong feelings based on identity can be in conf lict with the group identity of the majority of the members of the host nation government potentially leading to insurgencies with secession or political overthrow as goals external nations with similar social identities as the insurgents may assist religion 193 while religion is often primary identity it can become important enough to be considered separate identity unto itself in this way religious fundamentalism or extremism can become root cause of an insurgency in and of itself external groups w ith similar extremist religious views as the insurgents may assist occupation or exploitation 194 popular perception of outsiders either occupyi ng the hn or excessive hn pandering to outsiders can be source of insurgency for example foreign businesses can dominate critical portions of the local economy this can occur to the point that some may feel that they or their country are being exploited an outside military presence or military treaty may offend national sentiment the mere presence or specific actions of foreigners may offend religious or cultural sensibilities as well economic failure 195 pervasive and desperate poverty can often be root cause of an insurgency starving young people without jobs or hope are ripe for insurgent recruitment large gap between the vast poor majority and small extremely rich minor ity will exacerbate these issues corruption and repression 196 corruption and repression can lead to popular dissatisfaction with the current government rampant corruption leads to the loss of hn legitimacy and possibly sire to change or replace the host nation government operational environment of counterinsurgency fmi 3242 119 section vcultural compete nce and situational awareness culture can be defined as the set of system of shared beliefs values customs behaviors and artifacts that members of society use to cope with their world and one another since all wars are fought in and amongst population the army seeks to develop an ability to understand and work with culture for its soldiers and leaders cultural cap ability is the blend of individual co mpetence in understanding the general characteristics and the characteristics of specific culture s derived from cumulative set of cultural knowledge skills and attributes to help forecast and favorably influence the behavior of the target group or society this section will define culture identif the two major components of cultu re capabilitycrosscu ltural competence and regional competence and discuss the three cultural proficiency levelscultural awareness cultural understanding and cultural exper tisewithin cu lture capability culture 197 each society is composed of both social struct ure and culture social structure refers to the relations among groups of persons within system of groups social structures persist over time that is it is regular and continuous despite disturbances nd the relation between the parts holds steady even as groups export contract in an army for example the structure consists of the arrangement into groups like divisions battalions and companies and the hierar chy of ranks in societ the social structure includes groups institutions organizati ons and networks social structur involves the arrangement of the parts that constitute society the organization of social positions and the distribution of people within tho positions some elements of the soci structure are considered here social groups what are the major groups both inside and outside their ao what are the formal relationships such as treaties or alliances and the informal relationships such as tolerance or friction between groups what are the cleavages between groups and crosscutting ties for example religious alignments that cut across ethnic differences do the insurgent leadership and their rank and file belong to separate groups does the population belong to different social group than the insurgents can seams among insurgents or between insurgents and the population be widened how do people identify themselves tribes religions ethnicity provincesregions classes occupations and

culture 198 culture is learned shared by members of society patterned ch angeable arbitrary and internalized in the sense that it is habitual taken for granted and perceived as natural by people in chapter 1 120 fmi 3242 the society culture conditions the individuals range of action and ideas including what to do and not do how to do or not do it and whom to do it with or not to do it with culture also includes under what circumstances the rules shift and change culture influences how people make judgments about what is right and wrong assess what is important and unimportant categorize things and deal with things that do not fit into existing categories cultural rules are flexible in practice taxonomy 199 one simple way to show culture is to build chart that systematically distinguishes orders and names groupsa cultural taxonomy in order to do th is leaders and staffs must define cultures influences variations and manifestations cultural influences and cultural variations explain why the culture is the way it is cultural manifestations refer to what one may encounter in culture figure 14 shows an example of cultures taxonomy figure 14 taxonomy of culture elements of culture 1100 the size of nation its diverse subcultures different educational levels and geographic backgrounds contribute to great range of cultural variances amongst individuals and groups members of the population view cultural influences differently depending on their geographic location or identifying group some elements of culture should be identified and evaluated in

variations 1101 cultural variations are the behaviors values and interests common to culture understanding these variations allows us and hn security forces to interact and thus to operate more effectively in negotiations advisory roles popul ation control and daily interac tion with the populace to gain better cultural competence behaviors 1102 cultures behavior consists of actions whic h can be sensed specifically groups language social mores customs structures and instituti ons culturally competent units understand and train to recognize these behaviors as means to identify insurgent actions anticipate the population actions and detect subtle changes within the population ac tions inconsistent with the populations behavioral norms could be indicators of guerrilla activity internal conflict or the confirmation or denial of intelligence living and operating among the popul ation is essential to understanding population behavior values 1103 values are the principles the population uses to eval uate alternatives or consequences of decisions and actions value is concept that describes the beliefs of an individual or culture and is identity based for example army values values are how people unde rstand what they are and what they will and will not tolerate values define their sense of honor and respect values are often unchangeable soldiers never attempt to change the populations values confuse its interests with its values or use its interests in an attempt to alter its values during tactical operati ons counterinsurgent forces prioritize the populations values over its interests to demonstrate the ho st nation governments gitimacy in supporting the population interests 1104 an interest is what the population wants or desires for groups benefit or advantage it is often perceived as right or legitimate claim an interest may be flexible and can change interests are linked to the situation such as what people want at present us perceptions should not dictate what the population needs and wants the insurgency likely understands these needs and wants and eagerly exploits them to gain support as well as to turn the populati on away from the hn government vulnerable population gravitates towards who it feels best understands and satisfies its needs and wants during tactical coin operations the counterinsurgent must know the local populations difference between need and want and not operate with us cultural bias cultural manifestations 1105 cultural manifestations are the concrete displays of cultures thought and behavior measured by the

an insurgency if counterinsurgent understands both the components and manifestations of the insurgency then the unit can correctly apply pressure along the seven counterinsurgen cy lines of effort chapter 3 to defeat it components 21 the components of an insurgency are comprised of the five elements the eight dynamics and six strategies the elements are the five groups of peopleleaders guerrillas underground auxiliary and mass basethat form the insurgencys organization the dynamics are the eight categories that define an insurgencyleadership ideology objectives envi ronment and geography external support internal support phasing and timing organiza tional and operational patterns finally the six insurgent strategies are the urban military focused protracted popular war identity focused conspiratorial and the composite and coalition together the componentsthe five elemen ts the eight dynamics nd the six strategiesare tools of analysis that allow the counterinsurgent to fully grasp the nature of the insurgency manifestations 22 the manifestations are the visible outputs of the insurgency made up of the insurgents tactics strengths and vulnerabilities the counterinsurgent will be able to track categorize and develop the insurgencys pattern and means to defeat it figure 21 shows the relationship between the components and manifestations of an insurgency chapter 2 22 fmi 3242 figure 21 insurgency historical insurgency 23 with an understanding of the components of an insurgency counterinsurgent unit can identify describe and categorize any insurgency figure 22 s hows the components of an historical insurgency figure 22 components of mala ysian insurgency circa 1950 section iielements insurgent organizations vary consider ably but are typically made up of fi ve elements supported by military wing and political wing the proportions of each ement depend upon insurgent strategy and the degree of active support obtained from the populace if the exis ting government presence is eliminated in any foundations of insurgency fmi 3242 23 particular area these elements can exist openly if the hn government presence is strong in particular area the elements of an insurgency will maintain clandestine existence the five elements of an insurgency are leaders guerrillas underground auxilia ries and mass base figure 23 figure 23 organizational elements of an insurgency leaders 24 leaders provide direction to the insurgency they are the idea people and the planners they usually exercise leadersh ip through force of personality th power of revolutionary ideas and personal charisma generally they convey the ideology of the insurgency into objectives and direct the military efforts of the guerrillas in some insurgencies they may hold their position through religious clan or tribal authority 25 leaders who form the political core of the insurgency are often called the political leaders they are actively engaged politically in the struggle to accomplish the goa ls of the insurgency they may also make up formal political party to signify thei r political importance these political leaders are the driving force behind propaganda insurgencies based on religious extremism usually include religious and spiritual advisors among their political cadre 26 at tactical level units may identify leaders as ied cell leaders political religious or social leaders who direct the propaganda and nonviolent efforts of the insurgency or as business leaders who provide extensive resource support to the insurgency and other roles chapter 2 24 fmi 3242 guerrillas 27 guerrilla is any insurgent who uses weapon of any sort and does the actual fighting for the insurgency they may conduct acts of terror guerr illa warfare criminal activities or conventional operations they are often mistaken for the movement or insurgency itself but th ey are merely the foot soldiers of the movement or insurg ency guerrillas vary widely in size makeup tactics and methods from one insurgency to another they ev vary widely within an insurgency especially in each of the three phases of an insurgency 28 guerrillas may continue in their normal positions in society and lead clandestine lives for the insurgent movement guerrillas tend to organize themselves based upon the activity they will be conducting those focused on using terrorism usually ope rate individually or in small cells and are often armed with explosives instead of weapons guerrilla bands historically have lived in remote areas and conducted raids on hn government infrastructure historical exam ples of guerrillas include the maquis in world war ii france the viet cong in the vietnam war and the mahdi army in iraq underground 29 the underground is cellular organization of active supporters of the insurgency which may contain an element that works in the hn government keeping the nature of their work for the insurgency secret is often paramount to them they are more ngaged than the auxiliaries are and may at times be guerrillas if they use weapons or conduct combat operati ons they operate in all areas especially in areas denied to any established guerrilla force and where operations are not suitable for guerrilla forces they conduct clandestine covert and overt operations sometimes infiltrating the hn government members of the underground often continue in thei r normal positions in society but lead second clandestine lives for the insurgent movement some insurgencies are unique in that they conduct most of their political activities inside th underground while different secti on trains recruits maintains the propaganda campaign and helps in popul ation control the underground may spread propaganda support sabotage assassination and subversion support intelligence and counterintelligence operations run safe houses provide transportation manufacture and maintain arms and explosives auxiliaries 210 an auxiliary is the support elem ent of the insurgency auxiliaries are active sympathizers who provide important logistical services but do not directly participate in combat operations if they participate in guerrilla activities they become guerrillas auxiliaries may work full time or part time for the insurgency and generally conduct safer activities th an the underground they often include women children and other individuals that tend to be less scrutinized by counterinsurgent forces examples of auxiliaries include shepherds or street merchants that may openly ope rate near counterinsurgent base and provide intelligence on that site examples of support that auxiliaries provide include store weapons and supplies perform courier operations provide passive intelligence collection give early warning of counterinsurgent movements acquire funds from lawful and unlawful sources provide forged or stolen documents promote and facilitate desertion of security forces recruit and screen new members create and spread propaganda foundations of insurgency fmi 3242 25 provide medical support manufacture and maintain equipment mass base 211 the mass base consists of the population of the state who are sympathetic to the insurgent movement this sympathy varies between the specific elements within the population such as religious and ethnic groups and within those specific elements themselves this mass base by default passively supports the insurgency as occasi ons arise they may provide activ support leaders often recruit members of the mass base who are more activel oriented to serve as auxiliaries underground or guerrillas mass base members are the true silent supporters of the insurgency and are often the most available for the hn government to positively influence example 212 although two insurgencies or insu rgent organizations are alike they still have elements that can be identified and some form of hierarchy figure 24 shows an example insurgent organization with developed structure in this insurgency the underground finances the insurgency figure 24 example insurgent organization section iiidynamics insurgencies are political movements that result from real or perceived grievances or neglect that leads to alienation from an established government eight dynamics are common to an insurgency knowing and understanding these dynamics helps to understanding the insurgency the eight dynamics are leadership objectives ideology environment and geography exte rnal support internal support phasing and timing organizational and operational patterns chapter 2 26 fmi 3242 leadership 213 insurgent leaders provide vision direction guidance coordination organization for an insurgent movement successful insurgent leaders use interpret and shape the frustrations of dissatisfied populace into the insurgent strategy they often provide solutions to grievances by advancing alternatives to existing conditions that support the insurgency effective insurgent leaders make their cause and solutions known to the people to gain popular support i ndividual leaders of an insurgency are often members of the elite of society who have been somehow alienated from the power structure their education background family connections social standing and experiences contribute to their ability to organize and inspire the people who makeup the insurgency to be successful they must break the ties between the people and the government and establish credibility for their movement structure 214 in general there are three categories of l eadership found in insurgencies they are single person 215 one person may be the overall leader of an insurg ency this leadership structure has one person who provides cohesion motivation and direction for th insurgency cubas fidel castro is an excellent example of single person leadership structure however this single lead er may centralize power or decentralize decisionmaking and execution leaving decisionmaking nd execution to subordinates at the local level most units will see organizations controlled by single person single group or party 216 the insurgency may be headed by ruling council that makes and executes policy this leadership group or party may also control other groups involved in the insurgency chinas communist party before the ascendancy of mao is an example of group leading an insurgency group of groups 217 different groups that have different concepts of how the country should be governed make up the leadership under this kind of leadership there w ill be many leaders possibly unified only by their opposition to the government they compete with each other and the government example the partisan forces in yugoslavia and greece during world war ii were united in their fight against the german occupation but ranged from monarchist to democratic to communi st sometimes they fought each other more violently than they did the germans 218 as group insurgent leaders operate in eith er decentralized or centralized manner decentralized 219 the power base of some insurgencies is co llective and does not depend on specific leaders or personalities to be effective these insurgencies are easier to penetrate but recover rapidly when they lose key personnel decentralization restricts an insu rgency in its ability to f unction as coherent body and to create viable counter state however decentralized insurgencies are very hard to destroy and can continue to sow disorder even wh degraded for example qaed in 2008 is loose decentralized organization held together by an ideal of reestablishing the caliphate centralized 220 other organizations depend on single often charismatic personality to provide cohesion motivation and direction centralized insurgencies make decisions and initiate new actions rapidly however they are vulnerable to disruptions if key personalities are removed coopted discredited or eliminated these insurgen cies are often led by traditional authority figures such as tribal sheikhs local warlords and religious leaders for example tecumseh was the major factor in the creation of shawnee confederation after he was killed in battle the confederation fell apart foundations of insurgency fmi 3242 27 identification of key leaders 221 identifying leaders can be critical in determining an insurgencys organizational structure strategy and tactics understandi ng the basic beliefs intentions cap abilities and vulnerabilities of known key leaders is extremely important to countering insurgency removing these key leaders will normally degrade an organizations capab ilities che guevara was wellknow n centralized leader that counterinsurgents effectivel targeted when he was killed his insu rgency fell apart lternately in the case of the decentralized leader abu musab alzarqawi his organization alqaeda in iraq although severely disrupted continued as functioning orga nization after his death the following information is vital to understand and target an insurgent leader role activities associates personal background personal beliefs motivations and ideology education and training temperament position within the organization public popularity objective 222 insurgencies normally seek to achieve one of three objectives to overthrow the existing government in order to reallocate power to expel whom they perceive to be outsiders or occupiers or to seek to create or maintain re gion where there is little or government control that they can exploit insurgents objectives include struggles for independence against colonial powers the rising up of political ethnic or religious groups against their rivals and resistan ce to foreign invaders the central issue in an insurgency is the reallocation of power usually an in surgency mounts political challenge to the existing state through the formation of counter state which is promoted as an alternative to the existing state 223 understanding the root causes of the insurgency is essential to analyzing the insurgents objectives effective analysis of an insurgency requi res knowing its strategic operational and tactical objectives these objectives can be psychological in nature physical in nature or combination of the two strategic 224 the insurgents overall political goa ls are their strategic objectives the set of required conditions that define achievement of the insurgents objectives are their desired end state examples of strategic objectives include overthrow an established government establish an autonomous national territory cause the withdrawal of foreign occupying power extract political concessions operational 225 insurgent operational objectives ar those that insurgents pursue to destroy government legitimacy and progressively achieve their political end state these are the means they use to link tactical goals with strategic end states they often targ et the governments inability to addre ss the root causes that lead to the insurgency the insurgents opera tional objectives define their ove rall campaign plan although most insurgents will not have formal campaign plan these objectives are based on the insurgents strategy across political military economic and social objectiv examples of operational objectives include chapter 2 28 fmi 3242 political 226 disrupt elections develop or strengthen an insurgencys po litical wing attack government legitimacy gain recognition of thei r political party by the governmen t attack the legitimacy of the government or gain ability to r candidates for elected office military 227 disrupt operational lines of communication and supply routes force us or hn units out of an area keep government forces in their bases draw us or hn forces into fight or provoke overreaction from us or hn forces which result in mediareported civilian casualties economic 228 disrupt reconstruction and attack infrastructure thereby preventing the government from addressing root causes prevent governme nt from addressing the populaces issues social 229 spark sectarian violence subvert education system cause population to question the government highlight corrupt or oppressive police or establish regular means for mass communication radio or paper tactical 230 tactical objectives are the immediate aims of insurgent acts such as disseminating propaganda such as posters compact discs and handbills killing individuals or the attack and seizure of key facilities tactical objectives can be both physical and psychological aspects counterinsurgents can often gain insight into tactical goals by analyzing the insurgent propaganda examples of tactical objectives include political 231 intimidation of local official or the dissemination of propaganda products military 232 attack us or hn government convoy or checkpoint or random indirect fire attacks on bases economic 233 attack manufacturing centers stores and market s sabotage roads bri dges electrical lines and pipelines threaten violence against storeowners employees and customers social 234 attack police station or directly interact with the population in order to communicate directly to the populace general insurgent goals for terrorism and guerrilla warfare 235 insurgents typically work toward achieving ten general objectives as they gain the support of the population insurgent activity like all other aspect of the insurgency develops and evolves over time obtaining popular support 236 insurgent operations are normally focused directly or indirectly at decreasing support to the existing government simultaneously competent insurgents try to gain support for the insurgent movement through propaganda coercion or by causing terror if they cannot gain active support they will seek passive support such as silence foundations of insurgency fmi 3242 29 undermining host nation legitimacy 237 insurgent efforts can damage or destroy both r eal and perceived economic and political targets the loss of government services ove rreaction by government forces or the belief that the government is powerless against the insurgency contributes to the populations dissatisfaction with the government lessening government control 238 by defeating small government forces remaining gove rnment forces can be forced to consolidate in larger size elements or bases this can redu ce the overall presence of the counterinsurgent forces and allow an insurgent force to operate openly where counterinsurgent forces are not if even for short amount of time this can create the perception that the insurgency is increasing its control or the government is losing control and legitimacy providing psychological victories 239 the guerrilla seeks to gain small psychological victories these victories do not need to be significant in terms of material damage to the government or its armed forces these tactical victories show that small guerrilla force can defeat the much larger government force tying up or blocking host nation government resources 240 by forcing the hn government to expend resources on military ope rations against guerrillas the insurgency seeks to tie up resources that could best be used by the government to provide services and development programs to the populace weakening host nation government resolve 241 by defeating small elements of the hns security forces and attacking government agencies the guerrilla weakens the resolve of government employees and forces small government forces and agencies become aware of their vulnerability desertion ab sence from work willingness to compromise difficulty in recruiting or limitations on services to dange rous areas all benefit the insurgencys purpose intimidating the population 242 by attacking vocal opponents and cer tain types of individuals such as teachers the insurgents seek to frighten the population acquiring supplies and equipment 243 guerrillas seek to acquire government weapons uniforms equipment s upplies or vehicles infiltrating host nation g overnment and government forces 244 insurgents will often attempt to infiltrate various government minist ries and security forces by emplacing sympathizers and by converting existing members of those agencies these inf iltrators are used to gather intelligence and to subvert operations causing coin security force overreaction 245 since coin fight is the fight for the population often the intent of insurgents using terrorism or guerrilla warfare is to cause heavyhanded respons to attacks on the part of the coin force or hn security force these responses will often drive the population to support the insurgency ideology 246 insurgents often use their ideology to show the population how they can address the root causes that the government cannot provide or is not providing insurgent ideology attempts to provide vision of how society including political and economic system should be st ructured ideology should not be chapter 2 210 fmi 3242 confused with the insurgent strategy which is the way that the insurgents intend to achieve their end state two of the most identifiable insurgent ideologies have been communism and religious extremism 247 ideology is motivating factor in insurgent activities insurgencies can gather recruits and amass popular support through ideological appeal which includes religious or other cultural factors the insurgencys ideology explains its followers difficulties and provides means to remedy those ills the most powerful ideologies tap latent emotional concerns of the populace tactical units could see ideology expressed in the propaganda and recruitment techniques of local insurgents communism 248 communism is political system where private property is eliminated and controlled by the state historically it has been advocated in countries where wealth is unevenly distributed among the classes communism was once the most typical form of insurgen t ideology and often experienced success with the fall of soviet union communism has not been ccessful motivation for insu rgents especially since there is currently little or external support for communistbased insurgency religious extremism 249 religious extremism often byproduct of religious fundamentalism can be defined by strict adherence to set of religious principles and the rejection of compromise these ideologies are often energized by inequities in social political or economic devel opment and further helped by counterinsurgent attempts to marg inalize religious issues globali zation creates opportunities for an increase in religious extremism based on both real and perceived inequities insurgencies based on religious extremism want their values incorporated into the nations gove rnmental structure this fulfills the frustration and dissatisfaction of the religious extremists adherents often receive formal instruction on the religions fundamentals and use adherence to these fundamentals as recruiti ng tool religious leaders are often leaders of the insurgency and nonextre mist leaders are often replaced characteristics of insurgencies motivated by re ligious extremism that differ from traditional insurgencies are individual duty with an indifference to popular support use of violence that maximizes shock awe and casualties disinterest with governance and lack of prac tical political objective in organizations with global reach or establishing theocracy in local cases ability to regenerate guerr illas without popular support narrative 250 the central mechanism through which ideologies are expressed and absorbed is narrative narrative is when story is used to display the benefits of certain ideology narratives are often central to representing identity particularly the collective identity of religious sects et hnic groupings and tribal elements stories about communitys history provide models of how actions and consequences are linked stories are often the basis for strategies and actions as well as for interpreting others intentions insurgent organizations use narratives and religiousbased concepts very effectively in developing spreading and mobilizing followers 251 in the qaeda narrative osama bin laden shows himself as man purified in the mountains of afghanistan who is gathering and inspiring followers and punishing infidels in the collective imagination of bin laden and his followers they are agents of islamic history who will reverse the decline of the umma muslim community reestablish the caliphate and bring about its inevitable triumph over western imperialism this image mobilizes support for qaeda among some of the most traditional muslims foundations of insurgency fmi 3242 211 environment and geography 252 environment and geography including cultural religious tribal affiliation and other demographic factors along with terrain and weather aff ect all participants in an operational environment how insurgents and counterinsurgen ts adapt to these realities creates advantages and disadvantages for each in chapter 1 this manual stressed the importance of understanding an aos civil considerations ascope considerations for environment and geography include population density and distribution especially degree of urbanization root causes of the insurgency within an urban population such as lack of basic services security markets governance municipal council representation or schools root causes that lead to the insurgency within rural population such as lack of land ownership grazing rights wate r rights isolation or inclus ion in political process access to markets or schools growing seasons rainydry seasons plantingharv est time key events these may influence level and type of insurgent activity use of structures and infrastructures by both the insurgent and population tribal religious or other affiliations which may have tremendous effect on the local populaces willingness to support an insurgency or where people and insurgents can expect sanctuary or will avoid proximity to international borders that may provide sanctuary or support rugged inaccessible terrain with often hostile populations to outsiders that may provide sanctuary or support economic enclaves such as slums market areas middle class areas and wealthy areas geographic divisions along ethnic tribal religious political or other factors external support 253 external support includes moral support political support resource support or sanctuary support external support can come from an entity outside of the host na tionnot just ne ighboring states countries from outside the region seeking political or economic infl uence can also support insurgencies insurgencies may turn to transnational criminal elem ents for funding or use the internet to create support network ethnic or religious communities in other states may also provide form of external support and sanctuary particularly for transnational insu rgencies access to external support influences the effectiveness of insurgencies 254 accepting external support can aff ect the legitimacy of both insu rgents and counterinsurgents the act of acceptance implies the in ability to sustain oneself in add ition the country or group providing support attaches its legitimacy along with the insurgent group it supports the consequences can affect programs in the supporting nation wholly unrelated to the insurgent situation moral support 255 moral support is the acknowledgement that the insurgent or their cause is just and admirable it starts as outside popular approval and can manifest with negative media attention focused towards the counterinsurgent or host nation moral support often leads to political resource and sanctuary support political support 256 political support is the active promotion of insurgents strategic goals in international forums international forums such as the united nations trade sanctions and embargoes and the creation of political discussion in the unites states can all pr ovide political support which negatively influences the counterinsurgents effort another form of political support can come when legitimate state actually recognizes an insurgent group as legitimate authority political suppor t is the most dangerous form of support as it can result in an in surgency gaining international legitimacy forcing the counterinsurgent to stop actively targeting them chapter 2 212 fmi 3242 resource support 257 resource support is typically guerrillas money w eapons equipment food advisors and training resource support is often the most important form of support such as during the french experience in algeria although insurgents were numerous weapons were not because the french closed international borders preventing arms smuggling sanctuary support 258 sanctuary support is secure site to train obtain l ogistics rest and refit historically sanctuaries provided insurgents place to rebuild and reorganize without fear of host na tion or counterinsurgent interference often these were in neighboring countries or remote areas difficult to access sanctuaries may also include areas within state including nei ghborhoods where hn security forces cannot or will not conduct operations the meaning of the term sanctuar is evolving today insurgents can draw on virtual sanctuaries in the internet global financial systems and the international media these virtual sanctuaries can be used to present insurgent actions as acceptable activities worthy of internal and external support effective coin operations work to eliminate all sanctuaries internal support 259 internal support is any support provided from inside the country it is normally broken down into the two general categories popular and logistical suppor t together these two form the mass base for the purposes of this manual one other category is addedinsurgent bases popular support 260 an insurgent movement requires popular support figure 25 to survive and popular support is even more essential for an in surgency to succeed typi cally there is also relationship between the amount of popular support and the size of the insurgency to grow an insurgency needs an adequately sized mass base that will support this growth one of the best means of feating insurgencies is to shrink this mass bass by causing the local population to become hostile or at least apathetic toward the insurgents figure 25 range of popular support types of support 261 popular support can be either active or passive and may come from only small segment of the population or from broad base of the population s upporters of an insurgency may also be overt or clandestine active support 262 active supporters provide open sympathy to the movement participate in legal insurgent activities such as strikes find new recruits and may transition to being an active element of the insurgency such as guerrillas underground or auxiliary active s upporters are usually central to the insurgencys propaganda efforts foundations of insurgency fmi 3242 213 passive support 263 passive supporters vary from those who are sympathetic yet inactive to those who are not sympathetic but who choose to remain silent about insurgent activities silence on the part of the populace concerning insurgent activities provi des passive insurgent support recruitment 264 local insurgent representa tives address local grievances and conduct recruiting elements of the population who are dissatisfied with existing conditions or those who have been marginalized through psychological alienation are prone to insurgent recruitment the cadre often gives credit to the insurgent movement for all local successes and blames governme nt forces for all failures and problems every promise and appeal made by cadre members is associ ated with tangible soluti ons and deeds competent insurgents and counterinsurgents both seek to mob ilize and sustain popular suppor t for their cause while discouraging popular support for their adversaries there are five common methods used individually or in various combinations to mobilize popular support knowing these five means provides an opportunity for the counterinsurgent to identify when they are being used and then counter them the five common methods are persuasion 265 political social religious secur ity and economic promises can of ten entice people to support one side or the other coercion 266 through threat of violence or abuse insurgents can force people to support them citizens seek to ally with groups that can guarantee their safety reaction to abuses 267 though firmness by security forces is often necessary to establish secure operational environment tyrannical government can generate resistance to its rule foreign support 268 foreign governments can provide the expertise international legitimacy and money needed to start or intensify conflict apolitical motivations 269 insurgencies attract foreign vol unteers criminals and mercenar ies who are often motivated by money or extremism measurement 270 the reality of insurgencies is that the support of the population fl uctuates between the government and the insurgency due to many factors but one side will ever possess the support of the total population trying to quantify why the populace favors the government or the insurgency is difficult but evaluating the issue is important gauging aspects such as the reacti on of local populace to the presence of troops or government leaders can help estimate popular support at the tactical level asking the population directly or using surveys can produce valuable insi ght into popular support and attitudes logistical support 271 modern warfare is inherently re source intensive the insurgent needs to sure continual access to supplies weapons ammunition and money and this requires insurgents to maintain open supply lines while logistical support may be an in surgents greatest vulnerability it can be difficult to interdict as an insurgency develops and expands logistical support increasingly relies on external sources in chapter 2 214 fmi 3242 conventional war insurgent forces often receive significant amounts of supplies from external sources usually from one of the opposing nations involved in the conflict the protracted popular war strategy emphasizes mobilization of the masses and requires consid erable resources to build and maintain counter state the urban strategy requires significantly less support supplies 272 once the insurgents onhand supplies are exhauste d supplies must come from the populace or an external source in most in surgencies initial support comes from the populace either voluntarily or coerced identifying types of supplies the insurg ency needs and then discovering how the insurgent is obtaining these supplies are significant steps in the process of identifying insurgent supporters and insurgent bases medical supplies are often the most critical supply that the insurgency requires weapons and ammunition 273 external sources are often required to sustain sp ecialized arms and equipment insurgents can obtain these weapons through legal or illegal purchases or from foreign sources another common tactic is to capture weapons from government forces money 274 money is essential to an insurgency for the pur chase of critical supplies especially hightech weapons and ammunition or bomb maki ng materials money is also esse ntial for the payment of guerrillas and the bribery of corrupt officials money can be obtained through many sources and in todays electronic world it crosses all boundaries while money is often shipped to insurgents just like other supplies it may also be moved and held by local financial institutions in some cases insurgencies develop an underground banking system sometimes known as hawala which can be used to launder money just like supply lines the money path must be discovered tracked and disrupted funding greatly influences an insurgencys character and vulnera bilities local supporters or intern ational front organizations may provide donations sometimes legitimate businesses are tablished to furnish funding in areas controlled by insurgents confiscation or taxation might be used especially in cases when insurgencies provide their own essential services to the population another comm on source of funding is criminal activity especially the illegal trade of drugs supply lines 275 in all cases either the insurgents must go to their suppliers or the suppliers must come to the insurgents discovering and tracking these supply lines can provide key information on insurgent forces and support although rarely overt all insurgent organizations will have some system of supply lines means of transportation and storag facilities skillful counterinsurgen ts attempt to cut off the flow of supplies especially weapons and ammunition ofte n nation neighboring an insurgent ao is used as depot insurgent bases 276 in counterinsurgencies there are two general types of insurgent bases safe houses and guerrilla base camps insurgents will normally establish multiple safe houses of guerrilla camps based upon functioning groups or cells urban insurgents tend to use safe houses while rural insurgents tend use guerrilla base camps additionally training camps may be established these training camps may be established within safe house howev er they normally will be establishe d either in rural guerrilla base camp or outside the territory controlled by the existing government often in foreign country safe houses 277 many legitimate and illegitimate organizations use safe houses safe house is typically occupied by member of the auxiliary and temporarily used to hide insurgents normally system of safe houses foundations of insurgency fmi 3242 215 have been carefully selected the occupant of the safe house has procedures to move insurgents along selected routes at the best times to avoid detection guerrilla base camps 278 like any other armed force guerrillas have requi rements for command and c ontrol rest resupply refit and training the larger the guerrilla force nd more active they are the more they will need established bases both semipermanent and temporary base camps must be relatively safe and secure in areas where insurgents can rest eat and plan more sophisticated guerrilla base camps have command posts training areas communications facilities medical stations and logistics centers these base camps however are not the same as conventional bases they are usually small in overall scope spread out and sometimes underground insurgents try to locate ba camps within insurgentcontrolled areas where cover and concealment provide security against detection in rural areas base camps tend to be in remote areas characterized by rough inaccessi ble terrain in urban areas base camps tend to be located in areas where the insurgent has popular support urban insurgents may rent houses for use as temporary base camps insurgents will normally avoid battling over their base camp once detected they will move to an alternate location routes into base camp will be constantly observed for secu rity mines booby traps specialpurpose munitions expedient devices and ambushe s are used as standard security enhancements if surprised and cornered they will vigorously defend themselves with delaying action while evacuating key personnel and equipment insurgent training camps 279 insurgent training camps are established both in urban and rural environments while some training is accomplished at urban sa fe houses or rural guerrilla base camps most training is accomplished at locations focused on training this may be special urban safe house remote guerrilla base camp or an insurgent training center in another country phasing and timing 280 insurgencies often progress through three phases in their efforts while the use of these three phases is common in most writings concerning insurgencies the titles used for these three phases vary considerably however what makes up each phase remains nearly identical phase ilatent and incipient 281 the first phase of an insurgency tends to begin with the government having stronger forces than the insurgents do as result insurgents often must concentrate on survival and building support insurgent efforts may include establishing and expanding the organization spreading its ideology through information operations starting or supporting antigovernment activity such as demonstrations and strikes raising funds through illegal taxation and crime organizing small local guerrilla forces that conduct smallscale intermittent operations using terrorism and sabotage to intimidate uncooperative government officials and members of the population phase iiguerrilla warfare 282 the second phase of an insurgency starts wh force correlations approach equilibrium and guerrilla warfare becomes the most important pervasive activity insurgent efforts may include increased scale of guerrilla attacks attempt to force government forces into the defense increased use of sabotage and terrorism intensified propaganda attempts to gain control of isolated geographi c areas and develop bases for further operations chapter 2 216 fmi 3242 government officials are being driven out of areas with strong insurgent support establishment of local shadow governments increased efforts to gain international recognition and support phase iiiwar of movement 283 the third phase of an insurgency normally begins when insurgents believe they have superior strength and their military forces attempt conventi onal operations to destroy the governments military capability insurgent efforts may include combining guerrilla forces and training them to fight as conventional forces over time these conventional forces form multiple echelons th forces confront the counterinsurgents in conventional battle acquiring more powerful and sophisticated w eapons through foreign assistance or capture obtaining support from external combat forces such as special or conventional forces expanding areas of insurgent control and increasing political activity 284 not all insurgencies progress through all three phases and linear progression through all three phases is certainly not requirement for success insurgent success can ccur in any phase also insurgencies can revert to an earlier phase and re sume development when favorable conditions return insurgent success can occur in any phase 285 movement from one phase to another phase does not end the operational and tactical activities of earlier phases it incorporates th em therefore it is difficult to termine when an insurgency moves from one phase to another in addition single insurgen cy may be in different phases in different parts of the country advanced insurgencies can rapidly shift split combine or reorganizethey are dynamic and adaptive organizational and operational patterns 286 insurgencies develop organizational and operational patterns from the interaction of many factors although each insurgency organizati on is unique there are often similarities among them and knowing the commonly accepted general patterns or strategies of insurgency helps in predicting the tactics and techniques they may employ against the governme nt other considerations include the operational environment level of success of the insurgency and the length of time an insurgency has been operating counterinsurgent must learn about the insurgency and adapt to it based off its operational organizational patterns 287 insurgent organizational and operational patterns va ry widely between one province or urban area and another different insurgent gr oups using different met hods may form loose coalitions when it serves their interests these groups may also fight among themselves the result is more than just threeblock warit is shifting mosaic war that is difficult for counterinsurgents to envision as whole in such situations an effective coin strategy must be mu ltifaceted and flexible insurg ents gain ground by sowing chaos and disorder anywhere c ounterinsurgents lose ground by fa iling to maintain stability order everywhere insurgents normally begin substantially weaker than the established government this sets the tone for how they operate and how they fight section ivstrategies even if modern insurgencies use more than one doctrinal model or theory for their strategy aspects of these strategies and recognizable characteristics do exist the six common insurgent strategies are urban militaryfocused protracted popular wa r identityfocused conspiratorial and composite and coalition at the tactical level counterinsurgent w ill deal usually only with the urban militaryfocused and protracted popular war strategies these insurgent strategies provide co mmon frame of reference for the counterinsurgent the savvy counterinsurgent can identify if an insurgency is using one or combination of the strategies knowing what strategy the insurgents are using facilitates the anticipation of insurgent courses of action coas foundations of insurgency fmi 3242 217 urban strategy 288 in the urban strategy the insurgents attack government targets with the intention of causing government forces to overreact agai nst the population the insurgents want the governments repressive measures to enrage the people so they will rise up support the insurgency and overthrow the government this strategy can be initiated without popular s upport its success relies almost exclusively on spontaneous uprising sparked by rage at government oppression however an insurgency occurring in an urban area does not necessarily mean that it uses th urban strategy on november 1 1954 the national liberation front in algeria used form of the urba n strategy when they launched series of bombings and attacks causing significant civilian casualties in order to shock the french into negotiations the urban strategy actions are often predictable and possess these characteristics insurgents often use terrorist attacks which they hope are highly visible and produce high casualties their true intention may not necessarily be to cause fear or terror but to provoke the government into overreaction insurgent propaganda tends to focus on government brutality calling atten tion to specific harsh government actions such as massacres tort ure of political prisoners disappearances of individuals and br utal responses to peaceful demonstrations insurgent political organization is minimal with sustained effort to indoctrinate political cadre or the masses insurgents make little or effort to subvert the government from within however infiltration of hn government and security forces still possible insurgents require only small amount of popular support militaryfocused strategy 289 the militaryfocused strategy believes that m ilitary action can create the conditions needed for success militaryfocused insurgen ts often believe that small group of guerrillas operating in an area where grievances exist can eventually gather enough support to ach ieve their aims the success of this small group depends upon successful military action nd popular uprising the most iconic examples of militaryfocused strategy are che guevara nd fidel castro both proposed attacks on military and government targets until they ga thered the support necessary to ize power militaryfocused strategy actions include attacks on host nation targets to gain popular support propaganda that incites people to join the insurgency and rise up against the government and that focuses on demonstrating the host nation governments weakness and illegitimacy little evidence of longterm effo rts at building political base little effort to building the political wing or infiltrating legitimate organizations protracted popular war strategy 290 the protracted popular war strategy is based on mao zedongs theory of protracted popular war this strategy is broken down into three distinct phaseslatent or incipient guerrilla warfare and war of movement each phase builds upon the previous phase and continues activities from the previous phases the protracted popular war strategy has both political wing nd military wing this strategy requires high level of organiza tion and indoctrination actions along multiple lines of effort and leadership to direct the shifting of phases according to circumst ances in all the variations of this strategy certain characteristic s tend to stand out such as continuous longterm efforts to build popular support inf iltrate legitimate government organizations and establish and main tain clandestine organization highlyindoctrinated leadership po litical cadre and guerrilla fighters extensive wellorganized unarmed auxiliary leadership that is able to ex ert control over the insurgency chapter 2 218 fmi 3242 ability to shift phases at the direction of its leadership including return to previous phase if necessary attacks on infrastructure and attacks designed to wear down the government and counterinsurgents continuous operations along multiple lines of effort although some phases will emphasize different lines of effort identityfocused strategy 291 the identityfocused strategy mobilizes suppor t based on the common identity of religious affiliation clan tribe or ethnic group in this st rategy legitimacy and popular support are tied to their identity and often effort is made to garner popular support outside their identity rather communities often join the insurgent movement as whole bringing with them their existing social or military hierarchy external support is garner ed from international elements of the same identity in sri lanka the tamil tigers have fought an insurgency against the gove rnment for decades in order to establish an ethnic tamil state and at times have received support from india contemporary characteristics of the identityfocused strategy include attacks on those who threaten the traditions and social structure of the identity little or need to establish shadow government already established protects what it considers the interest of the identity willingness to use tactics of other strategies mass base easily aligns with insurgency objectives conspiratorial strategy 292 the conspiratorial strategy attempts to subvert the government from within and often involves few leaders and militant cadre although subversiv activities may take place in other strategies particularly in the protracted popular war or urban strate gies conspiratorial strategies often attempt to have its illegal political party become legitimate political party enter th government legitimately and then take control of the government insurgents using the conspiratorial strategy do not intend to integrate into the national government but to ove rthrow the government once the insurgency succeeds in gaining legitimate political representation the newly legitimized politicians who may have been previously targeted by counterinsurgents must be reevaluated to see if they are s till legitimate targets in the russian revolution in 1917 the bolshevik party actively worked to break existing government while being elected to serve in the administration distinguishing characteristics of this strategy include insurgents seeking meetings with hn government to discuss ceasefires attacks on infrastructure designed to wear down and reduce the credibility of government political cadre distancing itself from the insurg ency by making public statements denouncing violence yet the insurgent leadership still controls the cadre public breach between militant and political elements of the insurgency although this is often deception formation of new alliances often with groups that seem to have little in common with the insurgency or its ideology apart from the desire for governmental change an end or reduction in guerrilla activity with an increase in political activity intensive efforts to gain intern ational moral and political support using sophisticated propaganda aimed at specific target audiences insurgent political wing seeks recognition and try into politics incl uding election to local district departmental regional or national offices foundations of insurgency fmi 3242 219 composite and coalition strategy 293 the composite and coalition strategy applies wh different insurgent groups using different strategies combine to form loose coalitions that rve the purposes of the different groups however the composite and coalition strategy is usually united in opposition to something for example an occupier or specific grievance rather than for positive objective within single ao there may be multiple competing entities each seeking to maximize its surv ivability and influence recently alqaeda in iraq provides the best example of composite and coaliti on strategy they founded th islamic state of iraq and became an umbrella group for many other estab lished insurgent groups contemporary actions of the composite and coalition strategy include unclear or vague objective multiple or disjointed strategies within single area of operations more likely to ally with criminal actors attacks on other members of the coalition shifts between strategies and phases 294 insurgencies often operate using different strategi in different phases in different geographical areas these decisions are based on the operational environment and insurgent objectives most insurgencies eventually move to the protracted popular war or subversive strategy after another strategy proves unsuccessful 295 insurgencies can also shift both phases and strate gy pressure from the counterinsurgent can force an insurgent to move laterally to new strategy or return to an earlier phase figure 26 for example an insurgency in phase i latent and incipient using an urban strategy builds sufficient strength to progress to phase ii guerrilla warfare once in phase ii the insurgents may believe they are strong enough to initiate series of attacks then if counterinsurgents ccessfully drive out the in surgents the insurgents will normally consolidate and reorganize elsewhere however this failure may force the insurgency back to phase i in that area additionally the insurgent leadership may transition from the urban strategy to protracted popular war strate gy when the insurgent l eaders believe they are r eady the insu rgency will return to phase ii guerrilla warfare 296 insurgencies are often vulnerable wh they shift between strategy or phases these shifts may be due to fractures within the insurgent leadership or setbacks shifts may also occur due to time changes in external support changes in leadership or count erinsurgent action these shifts are often rapid so counterinsurgents must be able to recognize and exploit them indicators of shift in strategies may be changes in propaganda message content uncharacteristic increas in communications unexplained pauses or sudden increases in guerrilla attacks shift of effort between urban and rural efforts displacement of insurgents from one location to another unanticipated statements of support fro m external actors for an insurgency increased organization indoctrination and secure means of communications increased efforts to infiltrate legitimate organizations such as trade unions professional or business organizations universities and so on new advocacy for rights of peasan ts farmers or other groups change of in focus of attacks such as the targeting of specific sector chapter 2 220 fmi 3242 figure 26 shifts between strategies and phases section vtactics insurgencies employ both violent and nonviolent tactics to achieve their objectives nonviolent tactics attempt to achieve political goals without the use of force insurgent violent tac tics are often accompanied by variety of nonviolent tactics used together these tactics along with supporting propaganda can assist in recruiting and gathering popular support historically insurgencies have fielded dedicated personnel to foment nonviolent action such as strikes and protests to supplement violent action insurgents are by nature an asymmetric threat asymmetric warfare is conflict in which weaker opponent uses unorthodox or surprise tactics to attack weak points of stronger opponent esp ecially if the tactics include rrorism guerrilla warfare criminal activity subversion or propaganda violent tactics by insurgents can include terrorism guerrilla warfare sabotage or conventional operations insurgents often use terrorism and guerrilla tactics to achieve their goals because they do not have the capability to contest the government or counterinsurgency forces in conventional operations violent tactics 297 violent insurgent tactics are norma lly characterized by elusiveness surprise and brief violent action these tactics are often divided between terrorism and guerrilla warfare early in the insurgency in phase iii of the insurgency it is common to see more conventional operations there are three general tactics available to insurgents that use violenceterrorism guerrilla tactics conventional tactics and criminal activity the challenge is that at any given time the insu rgent could use any of them for clarity the term guerrilla applies to any insurgent forces performing any of these four types of violence foundations of insurgency fmi 3242 221 298 although violence can alienate the population when not linked to vision of better life or the violence is indiscriminant the commitment to use violence is potent insurgent weapon targets of violence can be anything insurgents deem to be obs tructions to their cause host nation security forces foreign forces aid workers members of th population who do not accept insurgent claims and infrastructure are typi cal insurgent targets 299 normally organized groups of insurgents using rrorism or guerrilla warfare use violent tactics the differences between these two can become blurred especially within an urban environment or where the government exerts strong control although potentially nonviolent criminal activity provides ready source of income for an insurgency and for the purposes of this fm has violent nature violent tactics include but are not limited to for more see fm 324 ambushes assassination arson bombing and high explosives chemical biological radiological or nuclear weapons hijacking and skyjacking hostage taking indirect fire kidnapping raids or attacks on facilities sabotage seizure terrorism 2100 terrorist is an individual who uses violence terror and intimid ation to achieve result dod insurgents may use terrorism terrorist attacks employ violence primarily against noncombatants as way to increase the populations vulnerability and decrease their perception of secur ity insurgent terrorism techniques include assassination arson blackmail bombings hijacking kidnapping threats murder mutilation and torture the insurgent using terro rism often targets econom ic and political symbols to undermine the legitimacy of the government an overreaction by governme nt forces or other authorities adds to the populations resentment to ward the government and turns its support to the insurgency 2101 insurgents using terrorism generally require fewer pers onnel than guerrilla warfare or conventional operations inherently these ac tivities have greater security and lower support requirements insurgents using terrorism often select targets for their political and psychological impact their attacks can be effective in generating popular support within one faction when used against competing faction they can also be effective in forcing government reacti on that alters government policies to benefit insurgent objectives guerrilla tactics 2102 guerrilla tactics are typified by hitandrun attacks by lightly ar med small groups the guerrilla is the combat element of the insurgency guerrilla tactics emphasize ambushes raids snipers rocket and mortar attacks and the use of explosive devices guerrilla tactics may also include assassination coercion and kidnapping to achieve support or eliminate opposition principles 2103 the principles of guerrilla tactics as stated by mao zedong are still valid enemy advances we retreat enemy halts we harass enemy tires we attack enemy retreats we pursue chapter 2 222 fmi 3242 2104 guerrilla operations are generally offensive not defensive and are often harassing in nature guerrillas seldom attempt to seize and defend physical objectives and in general avoid decisive engagement their overall aim is often to cause confus ion to destroy infrastruct ure or security forces and to lower public morale guerrilla harassment atte mpts to keep government forces on the defensive and weaken the host nation which can include destroying resources and disrupting lines of communication one advantage of harassment is that it may create the perception that the guerrilla can strike anywhere and that the host nation cannot prevent it because of th is counterinsurgents the must not only win small battles but also win the battle of pub lic perception in rural areas guerrillas may seize remote area or conduct raids and smallscale attack s on remote targets and lines of communications numerical superiority 2105 while government forces outnumber the guerrilla th guerrilla seeks to attain local numerical superiority if guerrillas can successfully concentrate against counterinsurgen ts they can attain victory over small elements of government forces guerrillas often use simple techniques of speed surprise maneuver and especially infiltration near th target area small guerrilla elements will often mass in order to conduct specific largerscale operation the baited ambush is favorite guerrilla technique guerrillas often create incidents such as arsons bombings and hoaxes as the bait these baited ambushes can attempt to lure small government forces of all types into mechanical or manned ambush conventional tactics 2106 conventional operations are not always necessa ry for success however guerrillas may engage in conventional operations after an insurgency deve lops extensive popular and logistical support when they feel the conditions are set in surgents may generate conventiona l military force that can directly confront hn security forces these conventional operations may vary from small regional operation to general conventional warfare large conventional operations are usually an attempt to obtain the strategic or operational objectives criminal activity 2107 sustainment requirements especially funding often bring insurgents into relationships with organized crime or insurgents may turn to criminal activity themselves reaping windfall profits and avoiding the costs and difficulties involved in securing ex ternal support makes illegal activity attractive to insurgents taxing mass base usually yields low returns and alienates the population especially in cases where the insurgency provides essential services to the population in contrast kidnapping or hostage taking extortion armed robbery and trafficking drug human black market goods and so onfour possible insurgent cr iminal activitiesare very lucrative although they also alienate the population the activities of the fuerzas armadas revol ucionarias colombia farc are perfect example the farc often receives millions of us dolla rs from single highprofile kidnapping similarly failed and failing states with rich natural resources like oil or poppies are particularly lucrative areas for criminal activity 2108 devoting exceptional amounts of time and effort to fundraising requires insurgents to shortchange ideological or armed action indeed the method of raising funds is often at the heart of internal debates within the insurgency for example the farcs involvement in the drug trade has made it the richest selfsustaining insurgent group in history yet it continues to claim to pursue bolivarian and socialist or marxistleninist ends farc activities have increasingly been labeled narcoterrorist or simply criminal by variety of critics 2109 many insurgencies have degenerated into criminality this occurred as the primary movements disintegrated and the remaining elements were cast adrift such disintegrati on is desirable for the counterinsurgent it replaces dange rous ideologically inspired body of disaffiliated individuals with less dangerous but more diverse body this transiti on would mean the counterinsurgency would also transition to more of lawandorder approach successful counterinsurgents must recognize that the ideal approach eliminates both the insurg ency and any criminal threats foundations of insurgency fmi 3242 223 nonviolent tactics 2110 successful insurgents use nonviolent tactics in conjunction with violent tactics subversion and propaganda are the two most prevalent form s of nonviolent warfare although some subversive activities can bleed over to violent activities for the purposes of this fm subversion will emphasize the nonviolent activities that define the nonvi olent nature of subversion nonvi olent tactics include but are not limited to for more see fm 324 demonstrations denial and deception hoaxes infiltration strikes subversion 2111 subversion is action designed to undermine the m ilitary economic psychological or political strength or morale of regime dod in addition subversive activity is anyone lending aid comfort and moral support to individuals groups or organiza tions that advocate the overthrow of incumbent governments by force and violence dod all willful acts that are intended to be detrimental to the best interests of the government that do not fall into the categories of treason sedition sabotage or espionage are subversive activity 2112 insurgents use various subversive techniques in th eir attempt to convince the populace to resist the government and coin forces and support their insu rgency these techniques include demonstrations boycotts clandestine radio broadcasts newspapers and pamphlets in ddition movement leaders organize or develop cooperative relationships with legitim ate political action groups youth groups and trade unions this approach develops popular support for later political and military activities subversive activities often openly challenge in an organized pattern and just short of violence the contro l and legitimacy of the established government and coin forces 2113 one of the most visual forms of subversion is civil unrest the fomenting of riots organizing of strikes and staging of demonstrations can drain the power pr esence and capabilities of the government and conversely increase the power and prestige of the insurgency another means of subversion is infiltration of government orga nizations political parties labor unions community groups universities and charitable organizations 2114 to increase public credibility attract new suppor ters generate revenue and acquire other resources insurgent groups may establish their own front groups front groups are organizations that purport to be independent but are in fact created and controlled by the leaders of the insurgency historic example of front group is the sinn fein the irish republican army ira used sinn fein their political wing made up of political cadre to serve as the iras respectable public face propaganda 2115 insurgent groups commonly use propaganda to in crease their base of support or reduce support for coin forces the joint definition of propaganda is any form of communication in support of national objectives designed to influence the opinions emoti ons attitudes or behavior of any group in order to benefit the sponsor either directly or indirectly jp 102 in this case the insurgents use propaganda to further their own ends 2116 the insurgents propaganda efforts use activities such as clandestine radio broadcasts the internet newspapers graffiti and pamphlets that openly challenge the control and legitimacy of the established government insurgents w ill search for any leverage they can use in their propaganda this includes seeking support based on the common identity of religious affiliation clan tribe or ethnic group additionally insurgents often create new problems and reinforce existing problems they then can exploit insurgents will arrange for the coin cidental presence of photographers or cameras where planned events chapter 2 224 fmi 3242 occur if the government is unwilling or unable to addr ess these problems successfu lly the insurgency can claim they will solve them common insurgent propaganda efforts include the following encouraging the hn populace or sp ecific neutral parties to avoid supporting hn or other friendly governments forces increasing insurgent will to resist by fanning hatreds biases and predispositions inciting riots or orga nizing rallies which may include honoring martyred insurgents causing or exacerbating di slocated civilian crises creating or fostering public distrust of the hn security forces undermining the support of specific hn local leaders or businessmen creating or intensifying general ethnic or religious unrest or friction supporting or revitalizing disside nt or opposition organizations linking local groups with similar groups in neighboring countries or regions discrediting or ridiculing specific hn or counterinsurgent officials characterizing government leaders as puppets and tools of foreign coin forces spreading hostile coverage of coin personne l especially counter insurgent mistakes 2117 effective counterinsurgents must counter insu rgent propaganda this can be accomplished by conducting information engagement ie to exploit inconsistencies in the insurgents propaganda and their excessive use of force or intimidation additionally counterinsurgents must have coherent and unified information engagement plan this ie plan must be planned prepared and executed with input from all appropriate civil and military agencies especially the hn section vistrengths and vulnerabilities understanding insurgents typi cal strengths and vulnerabilities allows c ounterinsurgents at the tactical level to work toward neutralizing or avoiding their capabilities and exploiting their weaknesses the typical strengths and vulnerabilities of insurgents are explained below strengths 2118 the recognized strengths of insurgent warfare pr ovide base to analyze the specific insurgent threat two insurgent forces ar identical known strengths are app lied against specific situation the coin force encounters and are refined because of local analysis regardless iden tified insurgent strengths must be reduced or circumvented table 21 presents insurgent strengths and countermeasures for analysis during coin operations table 21 insurgent stre ngths and countermeasures insurgent strengths countermeasures indigenous insurgents are usually indigenous to the local area and have the support of at least some of the populace therefore they have the ability to blend with the cal populace in many cases they have two rolesa local resident one moment an insurgent the next moment this enhances their capability to operate without discovery in given area the counterinsurgent force must separate the insurgent from the rest of the populace this is best accomplished through the effective use of populace and resources control care must be taken to ensure that civilians are not injured or mistreated as result of counterinsurgent operations foundations of insurgency fmi 3242 225 table 21 insurgent strengths and countermeasures continued knowledge since most insurgents are indigenous their knowledge of the local populace customs issues language and terrain are first hand the insurgents use this understanding to develop working relationships with the populace the insurgent can apply this knowledge to the effective use of propaganda if insurgents can get some of the local populace to identify to some degree with th eir cause they can win their support and gain new recruits if insurgents cannot persuade locals to help or refrain from hindering they may resort to coercion the counterinsurgent force must overcome the insurgents advantage of local knowledge by fostering strong relationship with government security forces other counterinsurgent forces and the populace if possible counterinsurgent forces should include members of the local populace and reside within the local area maintaining continuous counterinsurgent operations in given area through permanently stationed counterinsurgent force is important the skillful use of local assets or creating local civilian defense force that has the support and backing of the government are some ways to accomplish this intelligence operations the insurgents inherent advantage with the population normally allows them to develop intelligence networks and infrastructure within the government and population these networks can provide insurgents with continuous and current information on government or counterinsurgent force dispositions strengths weaknesses and capabilities the counterinsurgent force must place counterintelligence operations intelligence collecting and intelligence analyses as high priority the use of compartmentalization deception operations security and communications security must be constantly emphasized since insurgents are indigenous their intelligence networks and infrastructures can be infiltrated to gather intelligence and turn insurgent operatives into double agents motivation some insurgents may be devoted to their cause to the point of fanaticism on the other hand insurgents who wish to abandon the movement face major challenges their ability to cease being an insurgent is difficult the government and the local populace may not welcome them back and the remaining insurgents will view them as turncoat and threat motivation within the insurgency is usually kept high through intimidation and threats of violence on them and their families the counterinsurgent force must therefore promote the belief that remaining an insurgent leads only to death and defeat while at the same time creating viable method for former insurgents to return to normal life host government reintegration reconciliation and amnesty programs remain the important elements of this success focused responsibility insurgents do not have the responsibility to maintain normal governmental obligations toward society this frees their efforts to conduct focused operations in support of their goals however they often provide some aid and services to the local community especially where government services fall short and they highly advertise this fact counterinsurgent forces can use the insurgents lack of provisions for the society as tool to increase government support of counterinsurgent operations and to decrease populaces insurgent support in addition they can show that the insurgents have acted irresponsibly increasing the hn governments ability to provide services to the population may marginalize insurgent efforts insurgent tactics the insurgent can use broad range of tactics from conventional warfare to terrorism they can escalate or deescalate their activity in reaction to government or counterinsurgent activity almost at will the counterinsurgents must remain flexible and adaptive to engage and if possible disband defeat or destroy the insurgent force while at the same time preventing the insurgent force from having tactical successes they must also learn and adapt quickly enduring hardship insurgents often come from impoverished backgrounds are young and are in good shape they can make do with less by both design and background successful insurgents are innovative in their tactics techniques and procedures they learn and adapt to changes in the operational environment the counterinsurgent force must therefore establish controls and eliminate resource support tight security and control on arms and ammunition must be maintained to include thorough destruction of unused abandoned discarded equipment hardships are still hardships and the harder life is for the insurgent the more likely they are to quit vulnerabilities 2119 the vulnerabilities of insurgents also provide base for analysis to gain the advantage over the insurgent and enhance effectiveness these weaknesses must be targeted and exploited table 22 displays insurgent vulnerabilities and considerations for analysis during coin operations insurgent strengths countermeasures chapter 2 226 fmi 3242 table 22 insurgent vulner abilities and considerations insurgent vulnerabilities considerations limited personnel insurgents operate in small bands to avoid detection by government and counterinsurgent forces due to the challenges of recruiting new insurgents insurgent personnel losses are not easily replaced insurgent methods to recruit replacements can be identified and exploited limited resources because of their covert nature insurgents must rely on resources that are stolen or clandestinely delivered from friendly entities such as internal or external supporters this is especially true for sophisticated equipment cash replacement parts and expendable supplies insurgent equipment losses are not easily replaced and methods of resupply can be discovered severed or tracked to sources and destinations foundations of insurgency fmi 3242 227 table 22 insurgent vulnerabiliti and considerati ons continued summary the central struggle of the majority of insurgencies is to gain and main tain the support of the population however the five elements of eac h insurgency the eight dynamics the strategy the tactics and the specific strengths and vul nerabilities are each unique to an individual insurgent group for the tactical leader from the platoon to the brigade it is imperative that they fi rst identify and underst and the insurgent group or groups that they are fi ghting before determini ng potential insurgent co as and friendly coas insurgent vulnerabilities considerations combat power the insurgents normally lack the combat power for sustained fight as result insurgents typically avoid decisive engagements with government forces by their own design insurgent operations are usually limited in scope and are driven by both engagement and disengagement plans insurgents will usually break off engagements when they become too intense as the potential for higher losses is not usually worth the risk however they may conduct stand up fight if they have large base of expendable guerrillas they think they can manipulate large political gain or in some cases rites of passage event individual factors the insurgent endures life of physical danger privation and many types of stress stresses include combat and the fear of combat the need to live covertly constantly fearing discovery by the government recognizing the numeric superiority of the government forces they face fear of criminal treatment if captured by the government and fear of violence to self and family often imposed by the insurgent organizat ion to ensure cooperation besides belief in the cause the insurgent may remain an insurgent due to fear of government reprisal or reprisals from the insurgent organization counterinsurgent forces can exploit these stresses offering insurgents pardon to include food shelter and protections from both the government and insurgent is sometimes enough incentive to induce insurgent desertions popular support the dependence of the insurgent on popular support is major weakness this popular support includes direct aid and active intelligence reporting if the popular support is withdrawn the insurgent will not be able to operate effectively if the populace turns against the insurgent the government can reap significant benefits willing locals can help locate capture or kill once popular insurgents operational factors insurgent operational weaknesses can include security requiring extensive resources that may slow down responsiveness bases and safe houses that are difficult to acquire and operate lack of sophisticated communications requiring insurgents to spend excessive amounts of time preparing to launch operations and lack of technology including the ability to maintain captured hightechnology items the counterinsurgent force can exploit these insurgent weaknesses by interdicting supply routes and facilities following the supply trail forcing deserti on because of hardships and inflicting combat losses that are hard to replace fmi 3242 31 chapter 3 foundations of counterinsurgency the best way to attain peace is to combine force with politics we must remember that

unity of effort along multiple lines of effort isolate th insurgent from the people and increase the legitimacy of the host na tion government the five re quirements for successful coin operations at the tactical level include together us and hn military commanders devise the plan for attacking the insurgent strategy and focus on bolstering governmental legitimacy hn and us forces establish control of area and secure the population continuously chapter 3 32 fmi 3242 operations should be initiated from the hn govern ments area of strength against areas under insurgent control regaining control of the insurgents areas requires the hn government to expand operations to secure and support the population information engagements favorably influence perceptions of hn legitimacy obtain local support for coin operations publicize insurgent violence and discredit insurgent propaganda foreign internal defense 33 foreign internal defense fid is the participation by civilian and military agencies of government in any of the action programs taken by another government or othe r designated organization to free and protect its society from subversion lawlessness and insurgency jp 3071 the fid programs are used to support friendly nations operating in or th reatened with potential hos tilities as tool of us foreign policy fid is nationallevel effort that involves numerous us government agencies all working together to eliminate the r oot causes of an insurgency 34 us military involvement in fid has traditiona lly been focused towa rd counterinsurgency although much of the fid effort remains focused on this important area us fid programs may aim at other threats to an hns internal stability such as civil disorder illicit drug trafficking or terrorism these threats may in fact predominate in the future as traditional power centers shift suppressed cultural and ethnic rivalries surface and the economic incentiv of illegal drug traffi cking continue typical tactical

military plan of their partner hn security force unit which are part of the idad plan joint interagency intergovernmental multinational 36 successfully conducting counterinsurgency require s host of organizations brigade battalion and company commanders must integrate and synchronize their operations directly with the activities and operations of other military forces and nonmilita ry organizations in th eir area of operations terms 37 leaders must understand the terminology between joint interagency intergovernmental and multinational operations joint 38 between military services

foreign government organizations for example great britain saudi arabia poland command responsibilities 312 when working with interagency intergovern mental nongovernmental nd multinational groups army commanders have inherent responsibilities that in clude clarifying the military s mission determining controlling legal and policy authorities and sustaining and caring for these organizations and indi viduals information sharing between the elements is essential to establish ground truth not all agencies may agree on the nature or scope of support re quired or on the operations progress 313 gaining and maintaining popular support presents formidable challenge that the military cannot accomplish alone achieving these ai ms requires synchronizing the fforts of many nonmilitary and hn agencies in coordinated approach coordination at the lowest level is essential for unity of effort likely participants in coin operations include the following us military forces multinational

institutions ipi us military forces 314 the militarys contribution is vital for coin efforts demanding and complex coin draws heavily on broad range of the forces capabilities and requires different mix of offensive defensive and stability operations from that expected in major combat operations air land and maritime components all contribute to successful operations and to the vital effort to separate insurgents from the people the army and marine corps usually furnish the principal us military contributions to coin forces 315 the most important military assets in coin are disciplined soldiers and marines with adaptive selfaware and intelligent leaders tactical units ma have specially trained or attached personnel who bring certain capabilities such as civil affairs psyop language

corporations and contractors 321 multinational corporations often engage in r econstruction economic development security and governance activities at minimum commanders should know which companies are present in their ao and where those companies are conducting business such information can prevent fratricide and destruction of private property interagency coordination in coin 322 tactical unit conducting coin operations can expect to work with wide range of agencies and will be expected to track manage support and coordi nate with all of these agencies some of whose agendas or desired outcomes may or may not coincide with the overall coin effort commanders at all levels will have to overcome many challenges and work to integrate all the agencies organizations pr esent in the ao so that everyone wo rks towards common end state 323 challenges to the integration of military and civilian agencies include different organizational cultures capabilities and structures some civilian organizations may not be trained and equipped to operate in austere unsecured environments or they may not be able to sustain themselves in remote areas some organizations may be averse to assu ming risk which may hinder the overall coin effort military and governmental organiza tions are heavily dependent on tablishing and implementing their internal operating procedures and they are often reluctant to adapt or change those procedures to accommodate the addition of new actors different expectations amongst the organizations can also serve to further heighten tensions and create friction among agencies 324 us government and civilian agencies provi capabilities critical to the successful accomplishment of the counterinsurgen cy mission most agencies have their own budgets and often will have more robust financial capabilities than military units an effective interagency ffort can use all of the organizations budgets in complementary way to f acilitate stability and development efforts civilian agencies can also provide links to st rategic resources that may not be av ailable to tactical units they may also have access to information resources and ablers that can help military units develop comprehensive understanding of the operational environment 325 military forces have several complementary characteristics that can be of value to other agencies the most obvious is the ability to provide security and transportation assets military forces also have the ability to provide an accurate assessm ent of whether an area is ready fo r or capable of supporting essential services and economic development projects once th indicators become apparent counterinsurgent forces have the ability to provi logistical support security and expertise to project 326 the formation of effective civilmilitary teams creates complementary capabilities that mitigate the inherent weaknesses of both th counterinsurgent force and civilia n agencies effective interagency teams

returning families whose homes were damaged during combat operations chapter 3 36 fmi 3242 full spectrum operations 327 fm 30 states that army forces conduct fullspectrum operations outside the united states by executing offensive defensive and stability operations as part of integrated joint interagency and multinational teams full spectrum operations entail simultaneous and continuous combinations of offensive defensive and stability or civ il support operations based on the mission one type of operation may predominate commanders shift the predominant type of operation based on the current situation and their assessment as they shape the operational environment and set the conditions to achieve the endstate figure 31 joint campaigns overseas offense offense offense defense defense defense stability stability stability figure 31 fullspectrum operations 328 like any army operation at the tactical level counterinsurgency operations are combination of offensive defensive and stability operations counterinsurgent offensive operations focus on eliminating the insurgents c ounterinsurgent defensive operati ons focus on protecting the populace and infrastructure from insurgent attacks stability operations focus on addressing the root causes that allowed to insurgency to come into existence determining the combination is not easy since it varies depending on the situation the mission and the commanders desired endstate all three of these operations may be ongoing within different parts of the area of operations at the same time offensive operations 329 these are combat operations conducted to defeat and destroy enemy forces and seize terrain resources and population centers they impose the co mmanders will on the enemy this active imposition of land power potentially makes the offense the decisi ve type of military opera tion whether undertaken against irregular forces or the armed forces of nationstate supporting the insurgency the physical presence of land forces also enhances stability operati ons through the threat of offensive action in areas they occupy during an insurgen cy offensive operations aim at destroying the guerrilla underground or leader in order to establish secure environment for the establishment or the reestablishment of the rule of law legitimate government and economic development the successf ul counterinsurgent unit designs their offensive operations to complement their other defensive and stability operations chapter 5 further discusses offensive operations defensive operations 330 these are combat operations conducted to defeat an enemy attack gain time economize forces and develop conditions favorable for offensive or stability operations they defeat attacks destroying as many attackers as necessary the defense preserves physical dominance over land resources and populations defensive operations retain terrain as well as protecting the hn population and key resources defensive operations during an insurg ency aim at securing the population protecting counterinsurgent forces securing key sites and securing key personnel the ccessful counterinsurgent unit designs its defensive operations to complement its other offensive and stability operations ch apter 6 further discusses defensive operations foundations of counterinsurgency fmi 3242 37 stability operations 331 these encompass various military missions tasks and activities conducted outside the united states in coordination with other instruments of nationa l power to maintain or reestablish safe and secure environment provide essential government servi ces emergency infrastructure reconstruction and humanitarian relief most stability operations are both multiagency and multinational forces engaged in stability operations may have to conduct offensiv and defensive operations to defend themselves or destroy forces seeking to undermine the eff ectiveness or credibility of the stability mission 332 stability operations consist of five primary taskses tablish civil security establish civil control support to governance restore essential services and support to economic and infrastructure development at the tactical level the primary stability tasks may serve as lines of effort or simply as guideposts to ensure broader unity of effort in this manual they become the nucleus for the seven coin lines of effort 333 the degree to which army forces engage in stability operations is dependent on the specific circumstances of any given operation in some opera tions the host nation can carry out most security operations and army forces are engaged in stability operations to offset any negative impact of military presence on the populace in other operations army forces within failed state may be responsible for the wellbeing of the local population to include providing basic civil functions while working with other agencies to restore essential services to the area or region an example of this was operation restore hope in somalia in 1992 and 1993 chapter 7 further discusses stability operations lines of effort in counterinsurgency 334 commanders use loes to visualize describe and direct operations when positional reference to enemy forces has little relevance such as an insurgency fm 30 defines line of effort as line that links multiple tasks and missions using the logic of purposecause and effectto focus efforts toward establishing operational and strategic conditions plan based on loes unifies the efforts of all actors participating in counterinsurgency toward co mmon purpose each loe represents conceptual category along which the hn government and coin force commander intend to attack the insurgent strategy and tactics and estab lish hn government legitimacy loes are closely related and are not sequential in nature successful achievement of the end state requires careful coordination of actions undertaken along all loes figure 32 shows example coin loes the figure also shows how the loes try to gain the support of the popul ation to reach the end state 335 success in one loe reinforces successes in th others progress along each loe contributes to attaining stable and secure environment for the host nation once measure of stability is achieved achievements in other loes like popular recogn ition of the hn governments legitimacy improved governance and progressive substantive reduction of the root causes that lead to the insurgency follow single list of loes applies to all insurgencies commanders select loes based on their understanding of the nature of the insurgency and what the coin force must do to counter it commanders designate loes that best focus counterinsurgent fforts against the insurgents strategy 336 commanders at all echelons can use loes lower echelon operations are nested within the higher echelons loes however lower echelon operations are conducted based on each units ao commanders and staffs synchronize activities along all loes to gain unity of effort this pproach ensures the loes converge on welldefined commonly understood end state 337 commanders at all levels should select the loes that relate best to achieving the desired end state the following list of possible loes is not allinclus ive however it gives commanders place to start establish civil security establish civil control support hn security forces support to governance restore essential services chapter 3 38 fmi 3242 support to economic and infrastructure development conduct information engagement figure 32 example lines of effort for counterinsurgency 338 these lines can be customized renamed changed altogether or simply not used commanders may combine two or more of the listed loes or split one loe into several for example some commanders may combine the loes restore essential services and support to economic and infrastructure development into one loe likewise other commanders may split out rule of law from the civil control loe 339 tactical units hn security forces and th hns government can only accomplish limited number of tasks at any one time the seven coin loes help prioritize and synchronize efforts along all of the loes one useful construct is the rheostat pproach with loesincreased effort along the establish civil security loe usually means less effort along the other loes units may see this during operations against powerful insurgency or during the clear phase of clearholdbuild operation in most cases restoring security to an ao enables units and the hn government to rapidly meet objectives along the other lines of effort in other aos units may in crease effort along the support to governance and support to economic and infrastructure development loes while seeing reduction in effort along the establish civil control loe this occurs during operations agains t weak insurgency or during the build phase of clearholdbuild operation figure 33 shows the rheostat approach to the loes 340 operations designed using loes typically employ an extended eventdriven timeline with short mid and longterm goals these operations combine the effects of longterm operations such as neutralizing the insurgent infrastructure with cyclic and shortterm events like regular trash collection and attacks against insurgent bases chapter 4 discusses considerati ons for planning loes and horizons foundations of counterinsurgency fmi 3242 39 section iihistorical theories this section compares three historic theories of counterinsurgency together they provide reference for forces engaged in coin operations coin operations are complicated even considering these theories will not guarantee success however unders tanding these aspects will help illuminate the challenges inherent in defeating an insurgency three counterinsurgency experts robert thompson david galula and charles callwell had very specific theories concerning the c onduct of counterinsurgency based on their experience figure 33 rheostat approach to the lines of effort robert thompsons principles for successful coin 341 robert thompsons five principles for successful counterinsurgency based on his experience in the malayan emergency follow the need for government to have clear political aim to function within the law to establish an overall plan wh ereby all political socioeconomic and military responses were coordinated to give priority to the elim ination of political subversion to secure the governments base area before conducting military campaign david galulas four laws for successful coin 342 david galulas four laws for successful counterinsurgency based on his experience in indochina and algeria follow the support of the population is necessary for th counterinsurgent as it is the insurgent support is gained through the active minority chapter 3 310 fmi 3242 support from the population is conditional intensity of efforts and vastness of means are essential charles callwells ideas for successful coin 343 charles callwells ideas for successful counterinsurgency based on his experience in the boer war and other british imperial operations follow following up successes single blow will of ten achieve results but succession of blows paralyzes the enemy matching the enemy in mobility and inventiveness collecting actionable intelligence seizing what the enemy prizes most section iiitactical considerations this section contains basic tactical considerations common to counterinsurgency operations categorized first by terrain and then by troops as for any type of opera tion the commander and staff must consider all relevant operational and mission variables and their effects on ope rations these additional considerations for terrain and troops allow the commander to better visualize th conduct of counterinsurgency operations as he accomplishes the assigned mission terrain 344 as with any type military operation terrain pl ays key role in counterinsurgency operations insurgencies are fought in either urban or rural terrain each with its own characteristics urban areas 345 the urbanization of the world popul ation continues to increase the concealment and anonymity that was once only provided by remote rural areas to the insurgent is now available in urban areas the transient nature and size of urban populations increasingly hinder counterinsurg ents ability to detect and identify insurgents in surgents use urban centers for freedom of movement easy access to their mass base and proximity to targets popul ar support at the outset of this kind of insurgency is not necessary but can be gained through intimidation and attacking ba sic services provided by the government with greater population density urban areas need more governme nt functions and services than rural areas this requires more government organiza tions for operations and balanced approach using all loes 346 insurgencies thrive in an urban environment operations against urban insurgents vary from operations designed to control the popul ation to operations that involve seeking out and killing or capturing the insurgent in these urban areas counterinsurgency forces may have to emphasize intelligence and police operations to counter cla ndestine organizational intelligence logistic and terrorist activities counterinsurgency forces may be required to reinforce hn police forces in combating riots and disorders provoked by the insurgents as well as conduc ting raids and cordon and searches military counterinsurgency forces must be able to communicat with hn police forces and other agencies involved in operations considerations during counterinsurgencies 347 when military forces must reinforce police or defeat insurgent forces inside the urban area leaders must closely control and coordinate operations however the local government determines the level of intensity at which urban operations are c onducted military forces s hould be withdrawn as soon as police forces can manage the situation basic urban counterinsurgency considerations include maintaining constant forward presence with the population acquiring and dissemi nating accurate and timely intelligence foundations of counterinsurgency fmi 3242 311 avoiding overreaction to insurgent activity ensuring the population has the basic level of essential services developing relationships with competent host nation officials using countersniper operations especially at roadblocks outposts and sentry posts reacting to the ambush of patrols and firing on helicopters emphasizing countermeasures against explosiv hazards to include improvised explosive devices and mines and booby traps of all types controlling access to weapons uniforms and other supplies the insurgents may use protecting industry and public services from attack and sabotage preventing riots protests and other large population incidents lines of effort 348 all urban operations require careful planning nd coordination particularly those operations involving applicati on of force the most vital requirement is accurate and timely intelligence military forces must be able to communicate with police and other agencies involved in the operations during urban operations actions must be taken across the all loes examples of actions along each loe are establish civil security 349 conduct targeted raids with hn security forces to attack key insurgent cells establish civil control 350 conduct investigative training for hn police forces to increase arrests and convictions establish block committee to control the population support hn security forces 351 maximize the number effectiveness and use of hn security forces to secure and control the population and to prevent the insurgents freedom of movement support to governance 352 establish or convene local or tribal council meetings to identify and solve the underlying issues of the insurgency restore essential services 353 provide projects such as the restoration of electrical power and sewer systems to blocks that support the government projects should provide positive reinfor cement of desired behavior support to economic and infrastructure development 354 provide funds to city managers to hire additional personnel nd initiate economic development projects hire from blocks that are neutral to increase their support for the government conduct information engagement 355 conduct information engagement s to highlight government ccesses and expose insurgent defeats and excesses rural areas 356 much of the guerrilla warfare in the 20th cent ury occurred in rural settingthe mountains of yugoslavia in wwii the jungles of south vietnam in the 1950s and 1960s and the jungles of columbia in the 1980s and 1990s the reduced potential for collateral damage limited infrastructure and the lack of chapter 3 312 fmi 3242 urban development and the characteristics of the rural setting itself influence both insurgent and counterinsurgent operations considerations during counterinsurgencies 357 counterinsurgency operations in rural environment may allow for the potential application of full military combat power conventional fire and ma neuver and less restrictive rules of engagement due to lower population density however leaders still plan for the application of the minimumessential force required to accomplish the mission 358 in the rural environment insurgents rely on friendly elements within the population to provide supplies and intelligence rural insurgents prefer to operate in regions providing plenty of cover and concealment such as heavily fo rested and mountainous areas that hinder the counterinsurgency force in gaining access and intelligence often operating from their own home or village rural insurgents will often move to camps if security does not permit them to remain at home insurg ent camps are also chosen with view toward easy access to th target population access to frie ndly or neutral border prepared escape routes and good observation of counterinsurgency force approach routes when counterinsurgency operations force the insurgents out of his preferred base camps he tends to establish camps in rugged inhospitable areas not easily penetrated like coin in urban areas rural counterinsurgency operations must focus on both locating and killing the guerrilla and on severing the supportive element of the population such as the mass base and aux iliary from providing supplies and intelligence 359 offensive operations are usually conducted in areas that either are under insurgent control or are contested in these areas ground or water modes of entry are often used but air assault or parachute operations can also be employed these operations use offensive tactics such as raid reconnaissance in force cordon and search hasty or deliberat attack pursuit or combination of these purpose 360 their purpose is to destroy the insurgent force and its base complexes expand controlled areas isolate guerrillas from their support demonstrate support for the government and for the populace in the local area harass the insurgent to prevent the buildup of personnel and logistical resources lines of effort 361 all rural operations must address all loes examples along each loe to consider include establish civil security 362 conduct raids with hn security for ces to attack key guerrilla groups establish civil control 363 reinforce police operations especially police stations and checkpoints as means to increase control of the population conduct census support hn security forces 364 use hn security forces to increase combat power expand the ao increase the number of villages secured and increase the legitimacy of the operation support to governance 365 establish or convene village district provincial or tribal council to identify and solve underlying issues foundations of counterinsurgency fmi 3242 313 restore essential services 366 provide projects such as wells to villages that support the government support to economic and infrastructure development 367 provide economic stimuli such as the donation of tractor or gasoline to v illages that are neutral to increase their support for the government conduct information engagement 368 conduct information engagements to genera support for the hn government highlight government victories and expose insurgent defeats and excesses border areas 369 in addition to the typical external support usua lly supplies that an in surgent group may receive from across border insurgents may also estab lish sanctuary base camps and conduct crossborder operations from adjacent countries 370 host nation police customs or paramilitary border forces should be responsible for border security however the guerrilla th reat may force the military to c onduct border operations particularly in rural areas us forces advise and assist host nation security forces to interdict the infiltration of insurgent personnel and materiel across international boundaries with the intent of isolating the insurgent forces from their external support and sanctu aries border operations normally require restrictive measures for tribal and ethnic groups who do not recognize the international boundary 371 border operations require close coordinati on and cooperation between the armed forces paramilitary forces and government ag encies involved physically sea ling the border may be impossible since doing so could increase the requirement for forces and materiel beyond available resources placing forces or barriers at every crossi ng and entry site may also be impossible commanders should prioritize where to place their forces or barriers routes 372 based on detailed terrain analysis and intelligence commanders can determine infiltration and exfiltration routes support site s frequency and volume of traffic type of transportation number and type of personnel amount and ty pe of materiel terrain and traffi c conditions and the probable location of base areas and sanctuaries continuous and detailed surveillance is required zones 373 restricted zones or friendly population buffer zones can be established if needed either of these operations which could require re locating many persons must be carefully planned although armed forces may assist civil authorities normally are re sponsible for planning and carrying out relocation program forced relocation is held to minimum the 1949 geneva conventions prohibit forced population resettlement unless ther is clear military necessity restricted zone 374 this is carefully selected area varied in width and tiguous to the border authorities normally relocate all persons living in this zone aut horities give public notice th at they will regard all unauthorized individuals or groups encountered in the restricted zone as infiltrators or insurgents friendly population buffer zone 375 this is an area where only civilians believed to be loyal to the governme nt live in the ao the government relocates all persons whose loyalty it cannot establish the government may use this operation chapter 3 314 fmi 3242 to establish information nets and employ loyal citizens in paramilitary units the operation denies insurgents potential civilian contacts and base areas for bordercrossing activities lines of effort 376 border operations must use actions across all loes one or two examples along each loe are establish civil security 377 conduct ambushes with and without hn security forces at likely insurgent crossing sites establish civil control 378 conduct training of hn police and border forces to increase the speed and results of searches support hn security forces 379 integrate and maximize the number and effectiveness of hn border police and army forces support to governance 380 establish or convene village or tribal c ouncil from both sides of the border to identify and solve issues restore essential services 381 provide projects such as restora tion of irrigation systems to villa ges that assist the governments efforts to close the border projects should provi positive reinforcement of desired behavior support to economic and infrastructure development 382 provide economic stimuli such as hiring village personnel to build border fences or to act as guards hire from villages that are neutra l to increase their support for the government conduct information engagement 383 create information engagements to canalize movement through official points of entry and establish the legitimacy of the border in the eyes of the populace troops 384 counterinsurgency operations typically involve actions that combine joint interagency multinational and nongovernmental organizations efforts the increased number of military and nonmilitary participants and their divergent ssions and methods are coordination and unity of effort challenge achieving unity of effort re quires the greatest possible common purpose and direction among all agencies one means of achieving this is using longrange plan designed around the seven coin lines of effort task organization 385 the organization for and conduct of counter insurgency operations depends on the mission variables and the oe however coin ope rations place premium on boots on the ground task organization is the temporary grouping of forces designe d to accomplish particular mission fm 30 task organization for counterinsurgency operations is often substantially different from how units are task organized in conventional operations during counter insurgency operations many units do not perform their traditional role for example in iraq and afghanistan many artillerymen have served in infantry civil affairs military police or intelligence roles foundations of counterinsurgency fmi 3242 315 troopstotask analysis 386 given the extended nature of coin tactical units must maximize all available assets to accomplish missions in each of the coin loes and stain soldier proficiency physical fitness and emotional and psychological wellbeing means to maxi mize the employment of all assets is referred to as troopstotask analysis this process enables units to correctly assign tasks to units of appropriate size and capabilities 387 often conducted during mdmp staffs and tactical units begin troopstotask analysis by determining standard size element to use as baseline infantry platoon armor platoon cavalry platoon company or others the staff determines the forces available often including hn security forces then the staff or tactical unit lists and prioritizes each task and determines the forces required to accomplish each task using the baseline unit as measure finally th tactical unit and staff uses the commanders planning guidance to array forces and assign tasks 388 figure 34 shows an example format for troopstotask analysis worksheet it

private contracting security firms since these elements may not completely understand th intricacies in the bcts assigned ao 391 the military force conducting counterinsurgency ope rations will not always consist of maneuver forces counterinsurgency operations are manpower in tensive and therefore infantry armor artillery reconnaissance and military police battalions are the primary tactical building blocks for combat in counterinsurgency environment the composition of th tactical force in count erinsurgency operations depends upon these available forces and the threat that is faced

assess the factors of metttc normally most ground combat elements are organized to fight as maneuver forces however the proper use of other forces can provide the counterinsurgency force with many advantages host nation security forces 392 the host nation security forces must be included or in some cases drive the unity of effort of the counterinsurgent effort hn security forces can be inte grated in planning cells share bases with us forces and at tactical level conduct parallel planning in corresponding staff sections additionally hn security forces give many benefits to

and leaders this task is most effectively initiated by clearinzone or cordonandsearch operation as well as patrolling ambushes and targeted raids offensive operations 3111 offensive operations predominate during the clear phase however defensive and stability operations are still conducted eliminating guerrilla fo rces does not remove th entrenched insurgent infrastructure while leaders and the underground exis t insurgents will conti nue to recruit among the population undermine the host na tion government receive supplie s and coerce the populace through intimidation and violence after guerrilla forces have been eliminated removing the insurgent infrastructure such as leaders underground and aux iliaries begins this should be done in way that minimizes the impact on the local populace 3112 if insurgent forces are not eliminated but are expelled or have broken into smaller groups instead they must be prevented from reentering the area once counterinsurgent units have established their bases platoons and companies cannot become static they should be mobile and should patrol throughout the area the local populace should be compensated for damages that occur while clearing the area of insurgents defensive and stability operations 3113 defensive and stability operations ar continued to maintain gains nd set the conditions for future activities these include isolating the area to cut off external support and to kill or capture escaping insurgents conducting periodic patrols to identify disrupt elim inate or expel insurgents as well as secure the population employing security forces and government representatives throughout the area to secure the populace and facilitate followon stages of development lines of effort 3114 although the clear phase emphasizes establishing civil security operations across the other loes must happen examples of complimentary actions across all loes include establish civil security 3115 conduct targeting of insurgent leaders and guerr illa bands cordon and searches of insurgent controlled areas and raids on safehouses establish civil control 3116 train and support police forces or paramilitary for ces to implement curfews to interdict insurgent movement support hn security forces 3117 train and use hn security forces to incr ease combat power during clearing operations support to governance 3118 identify key government and local leaders that can support the reestablishment of local government that can administer the area identifying the underlying issues of the population chapter 3 320 fmi 3242 restore essential services 3119 identify essential services that need immediate attention support to economic and infrastructure development 3120 identify potential quick win projects to stimulate the local economy and create additional support for the government conduct information engagement 3121 the message to the populace focuses on gaining and maintaining their overt support for the counterinsurgency effort as well as informing them that active support for the insurgency would prolong combat operations creating risk to themselves and their neighbors the message to the insurgent force focuses on convincing them that they cannot win and that the most constructive alternatives are to surrender or cease their activities hold 3122 after clearing the area of guerrillas the counterinsurgent force must then assign sufficient troops to the cleared area to prevent their return to defeat any remnants and to secure the population this is the hold task ideally host nation security forces execute this part of the clearholdbuild operation success or failure depends on effectively and continuously securing the populace and on reestablishing an hn local government although offensive and stability operations tinue in this phase uses defensive operations to secure the population bases 3123 cleared areas are best held by establishing count erinsurgent forces in ba ses among or adjacent to the area from these bases the counterinsurgent fo rces can then concentrate on two primary purposes to disrupt identify and ultimately eliminate the insurgents especially their leadership and infrastructure and to end popular support for the insurgency and to gain popular support for the government 3124 exactly where these bases are established and their actual force composition is key counterinsurgent decision the main consideration s hould be towards the desired effect on the population especially increasing their security if area is s upportive of the insurgency then base established in known insurgent strongholds may sever the relationships between insurgents and the populace however if the area is neutral or has pockets of support for the government then the base should be established where it can best help in developing the area securing the populace 3125 if adequate hn security forces are not available units should consider hiring and training local paramilitary forces to secure the cleared village or neighborhood not only do the members of the paramilitary have stake in their areas security they also receive wage providing jobs stimulates the economy having job improves morale and allows locals to become potential member of the local governmental process 3126 contact with the population should be continuous and both planned and unplanned being based within the population forces information engageme nt and provides opportunitie s for contact with the population from the first day soldiers actions in these areas if culturally astute can build bonds with the local populace and in many cases change the attitudes of the people ultimately the goal of this contact is twofold to gain better picture of the actual situation and to turn the populations support toward the government 3127 another consideration is to secure key physical infrastructure because resources are always limited parts of the infrastructure vital for stability and vulnerable to attack must receive the priority foundations of counterinsurgency fmi 3242 321 of protection this can be accomplis hed by analyzing the risk and like lihood of attack on various sites in the ao chapter 7 discusses one technique for this lines of effort 3128 although the hold phase emphasizes defensive actions operations across all loes must be employed examples of complimentary actions along multiple loes include establish civil security 3129 continuously secure the people and separate them from the insurgents establish firm government presence and control over the area nd populace by recruiting organizing arming and training local paramilitary forces and integrate them into operations against the insurgents continue to conduct raids on insurgent leaders or members of the underground establish civil control 3130 train and support police force to combat crim and enforce curfews to curtail insurgent movement support hn security forces 3131 conduct combined patrols checkpoints cordon and searches and raids with hn security forces support to governance 3132 establish or reestablish government political apparatus to replace the insurgent apparatus restore essential services 3133 establish contracts empower or finance local governments to initiate sweatmso repairs support to economic and infrastructure development 3134 conduct local improvements signed to convince the populace to support the host nation government participate in securing their area and contribute to the reconstruction effort conduct information engagement 3135 information engagements should affirm that security forces supporting the host nation government are in the area for the long term and are securing the population from insurgent intimidation coercion and reprisals build 3136 the build phase of clearholdbuild operations consists of carrying out programs designed to remove the root causes that led to the insurgency improve the lives of the inhabitants and strengthen the host nations ability to provide eff ective governance stability operations predominate in this phase with many important activities being c onducted by nonmilitary agencies during this phase the host nation security forces should have primary responsibility fo r security progress in bu ilding support for the host nation government requires protecting the local populace people who do not believe they are secure from insurgent intimidation co ercion and reprisals will not risk over tly supporting counterinsurgent efforts securing the populace 3137 to secure the populace security forces should continuously conduct patrols and use measured force against insurgent targets of opportunity just like in the hold phase if the hn security forces are inadequate units should consider hi ring paramilitary force to secure the village or neighborhood contact chapter 3 322 fmi 3242 with the people is critical to the local counterinsurgency efforts success actions to eliminate the remaining covert insurgent support infrastructure ch as the underground auxiliary and mass base must be continued because any insu rgent presence will continue to threaten and influence people end state 3138 during the build phase host nation government re presentatives reestablish government offices and normal administrative procedures national nd international development agencies rebuild infrastructure and key facilities local leaders are developed and given authority life for the areas inhabitants begins the return to normal lines of effort 3139 although the build phase continues to secure the population and separate them from the insurgents the focus will shift to the other loes examples of complimentary actions along multiple loes

counterinsurgency fmi 3242 323 the strategic hamlet program successful clearhold build operations cords program and tal af ar are discussed in fm 324 this vignette highlights the challenges of executing clearholdbuild operation properly in 1962 the military assistance command vietnam macv launched t he strategic hamlet program to compliment its advisory efforts with the republic of vietnams military the strategic hamlet program was an extremely ambitious program designed to build fortified hamlets reloca the population to the hamlets and train paramilitary forces known as the regional or provinci forces across south vietnam together this would increase security and quality of lif for the population with the goal of fortifying half the countrys hamlets in only 18 months the program struggled with providing governance and solving bureaucratic issues ensuring security for all the vill ages and limiting corruption additionally the program met resistance from locals who felt an ances tral connection to their original hamlets although the program was abandoned in 1964 after the war the nort h vietnamese army acknowledged that the wellrun hamlets forced thei r guerrilla forces to relocate to other insurgent controlled areas the south vietnamese strategic hamlet program failed to meet all fi ve prerequisites for clearholdbuild operation especially obtaining an adequat number of troops securing suffi cient resources and providing local government up to the task section vother major coin tactical operations major counterinsurgency tactical operations include stri ke operations and popul ace and resource control operations strike operations are operati ons to find fix and finish insurgent forces in areas under insurgent control where the counterinsurgent does not want to maintain permanent presence afterwards population and resources control operations are government operations to control th populace deny insurgents access to the populace and resources and reestablish law order strike operations 3147 strike operations are short duration generally one day to several weeks offensive tactical operations conducted in contested or insurgent contro lled urban or rural areas to find fix and destroy insurgent forces small highly mobile combat forces operate in disperse d formations to locate and fix the insurgents upon locating the insurgents commanders di rect their forces to attack pursue and destroy them if contact is lost the units resume aggressive patrolling to reestablish contact and destroy insurgent forces before they can rest reorganize and resume operations strike operations seek to destroy insurgent forces and base areas isolate insurg ent forces from their support and inte rdict insurgent in filtration routes and lines of communications locs strike forces ar organized as selfsuffici ent task forces capable of operating in areas remote from logistical bases ground or water borne means of entry may be used as well as air assault or parachute deliveries stri ke operations use offensive tactics such as raids reconnaissance in force cordons and attacks hasty or deliberate attacks and pursuits it is often complementary operation to clearholdbuild operation 3148 speed and surprise are important in strike operations the sudden and unexpected delivery of combat forces into an insurgen theld or contested area provides significant advantages to the forces conducting these operations speed and surprise can be ach ieved by using air assaults to insert the first forces into the area of operations subsequent forces can be delivered on later airlifts or by other modes of transportation fires can also be used to bloc k escape routes or areas that are not secured by ground forces 3149 strike on an insurgent force normally requires superior combat power coin forces attempt to immediately engage and destroy insurgents before they can disperse depending on the situation hasty or deliberate attacks are made on ba ses that contain fortifications af ter successful attack on insurgent forces troops thoroughly search the area for insurgent personnel supplies equipment and documents all captured enemy documents must be pl aced into intelligen ce channels as soon as possible to ensure that it chapter 3 324 fmi 3242 is properly exploited by domex personnel pursuit opera tions are undertaken to destroy or capture forces attempting to flee artillery air support nd air assault forces support ground pursuit purpose 3150 strike operations may also be used as mean s to encourage reconcila ble insurgents to the negotiation table strike operations are conducted to harass the insurgent to prevent the buildup of personnel and logistical resources destroy the insurgent force and its base complexes demonstrate government resolve and garner support from the populace in the local area set the conditions to expand c learholdbuild operations lines of effort 3151 along the loes in strike operation tactical units should examine establish civil security 3152 conduct attacks raids and cordon and searches with hn security forces on insurgent forces and bases establish civil control 3153 conduct prc operations such as census ch eckpoint or search operation in villages or blocks to control the populace support hn security forces 3154 increase combat power by using hn security forces support to governance 3155 establish or convene local or tribal council meetings to identify and solve the underlying issues of the insurgency restore essential services 3156 ensure projects provide positive reinforcement of desired behavior such as digging well for tribal sheik who provides intelligence support to economic and infrastructure development 3157 hire people from villages or blocks that are neutral to increase support for the government conduct information engagements 3158 use information engagements to highlight government success and expose insurgent defeats and excesses populace and resource control operations 3159 populace and resource control prc operations are government actions to protect the populace and its materiel resources from insurgents to deny insurgents access to the populace and material resources and to identify and eliminate the insurgents their organization their activities and influence while doing so the objective of populace and resources control is to assist in preserving or rees tablishing state of law order within an area or entire nation prc operations are normally nontactical policetype operations and responsibility of hn governments however us for ces may be required to conduct prc operations until foundations of counterinsurgency fmi 3242 325 hn security forces possess the will and capability prc operations may be conducted independently of clearholdbuild operations or strike operations or as an integrated part in each of these operations 3160 in peacetime police forces protect the population and resources of state from criminal activity by both armed and unarmed criminals during an insurgency however the number of armed insurgents the willingness of insurgents to use violence against the police and the populace and the potential for civilians to become displaced or refugees often creates situa tion where police forces and their operations can not successfully curtail the insurgents nor protect the population and resources objectives 3161 typical objectives for populace and resources control operations include establish and maintain secure physical and psychological environment for the population limit insurgent freedom of movement and initiative sever relationships between the population and insurgents identify and neutralize in surgent support activities establish and maintain security of resources categories 3162 populace and resources control measures can be classified into four general categories surveillance and intelligence measures establish control measures enforce control measures protection measures surveillance and intelligence measures 3163 surveillance and intelligence measur include both overt and covert surveillance of known likely or potential insurgents their target s and the creation of qrf to xploit intelligence or conduct greater surveillance of insurgent targets expanded police intelligence and surveillance operations to include police informants and agent networks may link criminal acts from robberies kidnappings terrorism and extortion to insurgent activities 3164 surveillance must be established and mainta ined over key individuals groups and activities of interest increased surveillan ce must be maintained over critical locations especially government and civilian sources of weapons and ammunition this includes maximum use of sensors cameras and other electronic surveillance equi pment to provide continuous coverage of suspected areas and routes used by insurgents an additional means of gathering intelligence is to monitor local media radio newspaper both for rumor control and counterpropa ganda purposes as well as intelligence tipoffs in addition the public and private actions of influential local leaders provide additional insight it is important to live forward with the local people and listen to what they are saying still other intelligence and surveillance measures include establish general covert surveillance measures at marketplace and stores use humint collection teams hcts or the hn police to recruit locals for surveillance and intelligence establish system of block or village wardens with reporting procedures as well as incentives hold the wardens accountable for knowing what is going on in their block or village establish control measures 3165 successful counterinsurgency operations typically use increased control measures to limit insurgent activities and thei r ability to hide within the population normal security functions must be performed efficiently and effectively which is especially true if they ar in any way part of the root causes of the insurgency however due to the insurgency additional security measures and operational techniques chapter 3 326 fmi 3242 must be implemented two such considerations are increasing the size of policeborder patrols due to the threat and establishing qrfs to rapidly reinforce any patrol or site 3166 combating an insurgency requires increased cont rol measures to limit the insurgents freedom of movement and their supporters control measures should be well planned and coordinated to ensure rapid and efficient operations with minimum of delay and inconvenience to the people all control measures must be authorized by national laws and regulations as we ll as be enforceable each control measure should be tailored to fit the situation and used to establish or reinforce the credibility of the host nation government 3167 the host nation government should explain nd justify all control measures to the hn population they should be the leas t restrictive to accomplish the purpose local civilians must understand that these measures are necessary to protect them from insurgent intimidation coercion and reprisals ideally the local population and thei r leaders should accept the needed measures before implementation and that their support will minimize the inconvenience of the measures these restrictions must be lifted as soon as the situation permits 3168 once control measures are in place the host nation government should implement system of punishments for offenses related to them these punishments should be announced and enforced equally all inconveniences and discomforts these measures cause should be blamed squarely upon the insurgents psyop products widely disseminated to the population can help ensure the measures have the intended effect and undermine popular support for the insurgency control measures fall under the populace control or resource control categories populace controls 3169 population control measures include curfews travel permits and passes movement restrictions restricted areas census or registration of residents block committee national or regional identification system or id cards licensing for jobs such as medical security construction and drivers immigration restrictions resource controls 3170 resource control measures include control of select resources to include foodstuffs medical supplies and key equipment through rationing or purchase permits registration of firearms registration of automobiles and trucks export and import restrictions techniques 3171 enforcement operations must be conducted both day and night checkpoints and roadblocks are set up to check and control the movement of personnel vehicles and material and prevent actions that aid the insurgency during counterinsurgency operations checkpoints and roadblocks assist the government and counterinsurgent forces in main taining the initiative agai nst the insurgents by disrupting interfering with and deterring insurgent operations and disrupting the insurgents decisionmaking cycle it is important to conduct checkpoints and roadblocks w ith interpreters hn police or other hn security forces checkpoints and roadblocks used together can channel vehicles and personnel into checkpoint or search foundations of counterinsurgency fmi 3242 327 roadblock 3172 barrier or obstacle usually covered by fire used to block or limit the movement of vehicles along route checkpoint 3173 checkpoints are manned locations used to control movement that may be established from 1 to 72 hours depending on the purpose of the operation inspections 3174 this includes random cordons and searches both day and night of homes shops and buildings for arms propaganda material and insurgents the use of military working dog teams can be very effective in intercepting contraband to d ecrease population resentment it is important to ensure intelligence supports the inspections an inspection can also be used as subterfuge for meeting with key people rewards for cooperation and compliance 3175 separate yet related function is the reward ing of cooperation or compliance the ultimate reward to the society as whole is the removal or reduc tion of restrictions however this must be balanced with the increased potential of the insurgent to gain benefit from these reduced or removed restrictions cooperative towns villages or neighborhoods ma be collectively rewarded by essential service projects or economic stimulation projects at the individual level the government may provide monetary or material rewards for information on suspicious activities protection measures 3176 form of protection measures is internment and resettlement which consist of those measures necessary to provide shelter sustain guard protect and account for people enemy prisoners of war epws and civilian internees cis us military prisoners and dislocated civilians dc resettlement of population may vary from geogr aphic based resettlement to the re settlement of specific population group within defined area resettlement operations should be under host nation direction and control for more information see fm 31940 section viphases major counterinsurgency tactical operations are longte rm population security operations conducted in territory generally under host nation government control to estab lish regain or maintain control of those areas and to provide adequate security and control to th populace to allow restoration of essential services and improvements to the economy they typically move through three phases they combine offensive defensive and stability operations to achieve the stable and secure environment needed for effective governance essential services and economic developmen t to flourish at the operational level the phases arethe initial response phase the transformation phase and the fostering sustainability phase at the tactical level these three phases may resemble the three parts of clearholdbuild operation understanding this evolution and recognizing the relative maturity of the ao are important for the proper planning preparation execution and assessment of coin operations it is also important to recall that the insurgent also operates in three stageslatent and incipi ent guerrilla warfare and war of movement this knowledge allows commanders to ensure that their activities are appropriate to the current situation initial response phase 3177 the initial response phase generally reflects tasks executed to stabilize the operational environment in crisis during this phase military forces perform stability tasks during or directly after conflict where the security situa tion hinders the introduction of civ ilian personnel activities during the chapter 3 328 fmi 3242 initial response phase aim to provide safe secure environment as well as to attend to the immediate essential service needs of the host nation population at the tactical vel the initial response may appear to be similar to the clear phase of clearholdbuild operation units may also incorporate strike operations and prc operations during this phase against dete rmined insurgency the initial response may last months or years transformation phase 3178 the transformation phase represents broad range of postconflict reconstruction stabilization and capacitybuilding the transformation phase may be executed in either crisis or vulnerable states counterinsurgent forces are most active here working aggressively along all lines of effort loes the desire in this stage is to develop and build enduring capability and capacity in the hn government and security forces as civil security is assured focus expands to include the development of legitimate governance provision of essential services and stimul ation of economic development relationships with hn counterparts in the government and security forces and with the local populace are developed and strengthened these relationships increase the flow of intelligence this intelligence facilitates measured offensive operations in conjunction with th hn security forces the host nation increases its legitimacy through providing secur ity expanding effective governance providing essential services and achieving incremental success in meeting public expectations 3179 at the tactical level the transformation phase may look lot like the hold phase of clearholdbuild operation units may use strike operations and prc operations that complement their holding efforts once again tenacious in surgency may cause th transformation or hold phase to last months or even years fostering sustainability phase 3180 fostering sustainability phase compasses longterm efforts th at capitalize on capacitybuilding and reconstruction activities to establish conditions th at enable sustainable velopment this phase is characterized by the expansion of stability operations across contested regions ideally using hn security forces the main goal for this phase is to transition responsibility for coin operations to hn leadership and security forces in this phase the multinational force works with the host nation in an increasingly supporting role turning over responsibility wherever and whenever appropriate qrf and fire support capabilities may still be needed in some areas but more functions along all loes are performed by hn security forces with the assistance of multinational advisors in this phase the host nation has established or reestablished the systems needed to provide effective and stable governance that sustains the rule of law the government secures its citizens continuously sustains and builds legitimacy through effective governance has effectively isolated the insurgency and can manage and meet the expectations of the population 3181 at the tactical level the fostering sustainability phase may resemble the build phase of clearholdbuild operation due to the stable security nvironment prc operations may be relaxed in ungoverned areas there still may be requirement for strike operations to disr upt the remnants of an insurgency this phase progresses at the pace of the hns ability to rebu ild their infrastructure and institutions assume control of their security and provide legitimate governance to the people summary the foundations of coin are the guiding principles for any unit c onducting counterinsurgency operations once understood and applied they enable commanders to craft coherent plan that achieves unity of effort amongst all organizati ons in the area of operations fmi 3242 41 chapter 4 comprehensive tactical planning in counterinsurgency the fight against the guerrilla must be organized methodically and conducted with unremitting patience and resolution except for the rare exception it will never achieve spectacular results so dear to laurel seeking military leaders roger trinquier modern warfare french view of counterinsurgency 1964 the aim of counterinsurgency operations is to set the conditions that eliminate insurgency by securing and garnering the support of the population as well as increasing the legitimacy of the host nation government to accomplish this tactical coin planning uses all capabiliti not just military capabilities this chapter shows the tactical planning process of counterinsurgency operations through sections on basic tactical design planning horizons the military decisionmaking process mdmp troopleading procedures tlp and targeting section ioverview the battlefield of the twentyfirst century has proven to be complex due to increasing urbanization globalization and religious fundamentalism multiple enemy frie ndly and neutral act ors and ambiguous guidance and direction it is through planning that the commander is able to see the desired outcome lay out effective ways to achieve it and communicate his vision intent and decisions to his subordinates focusing on the results he wants to achieve fm 50 progress in counterinsurgencies is slow and difficult to measure it can continue for weeks months even years with the complexity of counterinsurgency operations commanders and staff have relied upon end states the seve n coin lines of effort measures of effectiveness and performance and tight planning horizons to impose or der on the chaos and craft functional plans to guide counterinsurgent efforts to increase the legitimacy of the host nation government along multiple lines of effort end state 41 at the tactical level this is the set of conditions that when achieved accomplish the mission 42 condition is specific existing circumstance framed in military terms that when achieved describes one aspect of the desired end state achievem ent of all of the conditions obtains the end state for tactical commanders the end state is typically t of required conditions usually for each loe that defines the achievement of the commanders tactical objective 43 historically successful counterin surgencies commonly focus on th political end state unified in their approach and flexible in addressing the core insurgency issues they secure the people enhance the legitimacy of the host nation governme nt and above all show patience 44 military operation must be linked to political nd state composed of various conditions that the populace supports unity of action 45 close coordination and effective cooperation between the host nati on civil police and military the us counterinsurgency force and all other coalition partners allows the full strength of each to engage all levels of the insurgency unity of effort is key chapter 4 42 fmi 3242 root causes 46 root causes are the grievances of the people u ltimately for an insurgen cy to be successful it must provide solution to the key issues of the people at the same time for counterinsurgency to be successful it too must address these key issues protection of the people 47 most insurgencies use coercion and terror to gain support from the people and to inhibit the peoples support of the government the target of this coercion and terror is frequently the people connected to the governmentpolice local administrators and teachers as such if the counterinsurgent wishes to receive the support of the people they must not only protect their suppor ters and their families but also their communities often protecting and controlling the pe ople enables the counterinsurgent to achieve the other conditions enhancement of the legitimacy of the hn government 48 the us and other counterinsurgency partners mu st always focus on strengthening the host nation governments ability to defend itself and its populace from the insurgency patience 49 there is decisive battle in counterinsurgency operations ofte n it takes years to create an environment where host nation government can and will defend itself and its people measures of performance and effectiveness 410 tactical units must measure progress toward mission accomplishment commanders continuously assess the operational environment and the progress of operations and compare them to their initial vision and commanders intent units evaluate the operati ons progress or success through intelligence assets patrol reports engagement with local leaders graffiti or surveys commanders adjust operations based on their assessment to ensure obj ectives are met and the desired end state is achieved 411 the assessment process measures the efforts that support operational and tactical objectives and progress toward the desired military end stat of the counterinsurgen cy across all loes the assessment process uses measures of performance nd measures of effectiveness to gauge progress they are defined as follows measure of performance 412 an mop is criterion used to assess friendly actions that is tied to measuring task accomplishment jp 102 mops confirm or deny that the task has been correctly performed an example of mop is how many people registered to vote at the school this week measure of effectiveness 413 an moe is criterion used to assess changes in system behavior capability or operational environment that is tied to measuring the attainment of an end state achievement of an objective or creation of an effect jp 30 an example of moe is did the well project provide clean drinking water to the village comprehensive tactical planning in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 43 purposes 414 measures of effectiveness and of performance help commanders determine when all or part of the mission has been accomplished the criteria used depe nd on the situation many times the mop and moe must be determined and evaluated by the hn government or security forces they often require readjustment as the situation changes and objectives volve if an effect cannot be measured directly then indicators of achieving the effect are measured m easure of effectiveness or measure of performance has four characteristics they are measurable 415 they require quantitative or qualitative standards that can be used to measure them discrete 416 each criterion measures distinct aspect of th operation excessive numbers of moes and mops become unmanageable at that point the cost of collection efforts outweighs the value of assessing relevant 417 each moe and mop must be relevant to the result or outcome the key is visualizing the desired result or outcome and identifying the most accurate and simplest indicator of it responsive 418 moes and mops must detect changes quickly enough for commanders to respond immediately and effectively 419 commanders and staffs also develop standard or baseline as comparison and identify trends from this information and analysis of why trend is up or down staffs can identify trouble spots and plan operations to reverse negative trends they can also capitalize on positive trends by determining what is causing the positive increases and apply those tactics techniques and procedures more broadly 420 measures of effectiveness and measures of performance are included in the approved plan or order and reevaluated continuously throughout prep aration and execution higher echelon staffs should ensure that the number of moes and mops do not overly burden lower echelonsespecially battalion and below welldevised moes and mops supported by effective management of available information help commanders and staffs understand links betw een tasks end state and lines of effort planning horizons 421 during operations headquarters sends tactical unit an operations plan or operations order tactical units must then consider the scope of their mission and determine the planning horizons planning horizon is point in time commanders use to focus the organizations planning efforts to shape future events planning horizons which in major combat operations are measured in hours and days for tactical commanders may in coin operations be measured in weeks months and years 422 in contrast tactical commande rs who have responsibility for terrain and mission covering multiple objectives that must be achieved systematically require extended planning horizons managing extended planning horizons have an impact on tacti cal unit the staff processes must be organized to facilitate multiple outlooks as an extended outlook does not relieve the immedi acy of current operations however this may be challenging for company commander without staff 423 fm 50 defines three planning horizonslong d and shortrange plans these horizons create useful construct for operations executed by t actical units in counterin surgency additionally the familiar quarterly training guidan ce and brief processes in fm 70 fit the longterm nature of counterinsurgency operations chapter 4 44 fmi 3242 longrange planning 424 longrange planning encompasses the range of time where the situation is too uncertain to plan for specific operations commanders must visualize what conditions they desire to exist resulting from the cumulative effect of all their tactical objectives visualizing the time required to establish these conditions places approximate bounds on the extent of future planning in genera l when units are in rotation and have planned transfer of au thority the longrange pl an should consider the conditions that the commander desires to exist at th ree months after the transfer 425 the longrange plan provides construct for commander to describe his vision of the operational environment and their units role over time us ing lines of effort in addition to describing the units tactical objectives and the c onditions they create the plan provides description of major events providing long lead time on major events can be critical to anticipating resources and identifying milestones or identifying and completing series of interrelated tasks well in advance of the event friendly forces as in transfer of authority the population as in elections or the insurgency could drive the event as it changes in phases strategies or organization 426 management of longrange plans allows the unit to synchronize its effort s with adjacent units and the higher headquarters when an objective requires the cumulative effect of hundreds of company platoon and squad missions to achieve the desired end st ate longrange plans using lines of

more tactical objectives to unit than they can addr ess simultaneously the counterinsurgent must truly plan for full spectrum operations transitioning from tasks that support one objective onto tasks that support different objective often within the same day systematic approach must be developed that is tailored to the situation based on continuous assessment while the co mplexities of major combat operations should not be underestimated counterinsurgencies bring different set of complexities that requires staffs to apply analytical tools to achieve mission success chapter 4 46 fmi 3242

visuali ze describe and direct operations when positional references to an adversar have little relevance lik in counterinsurgency ideally loes combine the complement ary longterm effects of stability tasks with the cyclic shortterm events typical of combat operations using lines of effort tactical commanders develop tactical tasks and tactical missions allocate res ources and assess the effectiveness of the operation the commander may specify which line of effort represents the decisive operation and which are shaping operations commanders synchronize activities along multiple loes to achieve the conditions that compose the desired end state and do not view them as sequential road map to success 433 the seven counterinsurgency lines of effortest ablish civil security establish

their first primary subtasks comprehensive tactical planning in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 47 establish civil security 434 civil security involves protecting areas resources and the populace from both external and internal threats fm 307 ideally army forces fo cus on the external threats while police and security elements address internal security against terrorists criminals and small hostile groups however during an insurgency the army may also address the internal security against criminals terrorists and guerrillas 435 most societal and government functions require secure environment and obtaining civil security is often prerequisite for other stability tasks to be effective although us and multinational forces can provide direct assistance to establish and maintain security this situation is at best provisional solution ultimately the host nation must secure its own people typical civil security tasks include enforce cessation of hostilities peace ag reements and other arrangements conduct disarmament demobili zation and registration conduct border control boundary security and freedom of movement support identification protect key personnel and facilities clear explosive and cbrn hazards establish civil control 436 civil control regulates selected behavior and activities of indivi duals and groups fm 307 this control reduces risk to individuals or groups and prom otes security civil control channels the populations activities to allow provision of security and essential services while coexisting with military force conducting operations typical civil control tasks include establish public order and safety establish interim criminal justice system support law enforcement and police reform support judicial reform support property dispute resolution processes support corrections reform support public outreach and community rebuilding programs chapter 4 48 fmi 3242 figure 41 lines of effort comprehensive tactical planning in counterinsurgency fmi

developing equipping training and employing hn security forces it may expand to multinational opera tions where hn forces and us forces fight alongside one another hn security forces include military forces police corrections and border guards typical civil control tasks include measure assess hn security forces organize hn security forces rebuildbuild infrastructur for hn security forces train hn security forces equip hn security forces advise hn security forces mentor hn security forces support to governance 438 sometimes hn government exists or the govern ment is unable or unwilling to assume full responsibility for governance in those cases this loe may involve establishing and maintaining military government or civil administrati on while creating an hn capability to govern when well executed these actions may eliminate the root causes of the in surgency governance activ ities are among the most important of all in establishing lasting stability for region or nation stability operations establish conditions that enable interagency and host nation actions to succeed military efforts help to build progress toward achieving effec tive legitimate governance by re storing public administration and resorting public services while fostering longterm efforts to establish functional effective system of political governance military actions help to shape the environment so interagency and hn actions can succeed typical support to government tasks include support transitional administrations support development of local governance support anticorruption initiatives support elections restore essential services 439 army forces establish or restore the basic services that address the life support needs of the hn population and protect them until ci vil authority or the host nation can provide them fm 30 the counterinsurgent force works toward meeting the populations basic needs ideally the military is simply providing the security for the humanitarian assistance by supporting other government intergovernmental and host nation agencies when the host nation or other agency cannot perform its role army forces may provide the basics directly typical restore essential services tasks include provide essential civil services tasks related to civilian dislocation support famine prevention and emergency food relief programs support public health programs support education programs support to economic and infrastructure development 440 military task executed to support the economic sector are critical to sustainable economic development fm 307 the economic development loe includes both shortand longterm aspects the shortterm aspect concerns immediate problems such as largescale unemp loyment and reestablishing an economy the longterm aspect involves stimula ting indigenous robust and broad economic activity the stability nation enjoys is often related to its pe oples economic situation and its adherence to the rule chapter 4 410 fmi 3242 of law however nations economic health also depends on its governments ability to continuously secure its population support to economic and infrast ructure development helps host nation develop capability and capacity in these areas it may involve direct and indirect military assistance to local regional and national entities ty pical support economic and infrastru cture development tasks

the integrated employment of public affairs to inform us and friendly audiences psychological operations combat camera us govern ment strategic communication and defense support to public diplomacy and other means necessary to in fluence foreign audiences and leader and soldier engagements to support both efforts fm 30 informa tion engagements are part of all military operations in an area all leaders must be directly involved in conducting information engagements these shape the information environment in three ways by informing audiences using factual information with public affairs by influencing selected audiences in the area of operations with psychological operations and facetoface meetings and most important by pe rsuading audiences through th actions of soldiers considerations for constructing an information engagement plan 442 effective information engagement plans can ra lly popular support for counterinsurgent efforts marginalize insurgent violent actions and neutralize the insurgencys political decisionmaking capabilities everything that tactical unit does or fails to do in coin plays part in its information engagement plan therefore information engageme nts must be synchronized and nested through common multiechelon themes themes must be tailored to differe nt target audience by the manner in which they are presented or distributed in coin perception is often more important than truth successful planning characteristics 443 to effectively craft an ffective information engagement plan tactical units must ensure that it is decentralized to the lowest level executed in timely manner acc ount for hn culture be planned with hn counterparts and easily be combined into all co in operations the commander should take an active interest in his information engagement plan he does this through his information engagement intent emphasis to his staff and soldiers and assignment of information ngagement responsibilities the staff should be integrated into the information engageme nt plan and dedicated to information engagement success higher headquarters should prevent information fratricide by subordinate units through integrating mechanisms which most often comes through daily or weekly synchronization meetings themes 444 tactical units most often implement their information engagement plans through the construct of themes that address target audiences themes may incl ude simple messages that can easily be repeated the bumper sticker and are often referred to as tal king points successful them are those that keep objectives simple and achievable manage expectations and pe rceptions of the hn populace k eep counterinsurgent goals attainable use previous hn contacts and relationships can be distributed using formal and informal methods by soldiers at all levels formal methods include posting public notices briefings to community leaders and talking to local media comprehensive tactical planning in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 411 informal methods include patrol s talking to local citizenry handing out leafle ts and using loudspeakers respond to events and insurgent propaganda rapidly admit mistakes and deals with the populace honestly target audiences 445 in coin themes must be tailored to resonate with the target audience the tailoring process should take into account cultural understanding in addition audiences can be separated as far down as neighborhoods ethnicity religi on class and other factors the audience may include the us civilian population international forums us soldiers hn population and insurgents hn population 446 themes that target the hn populace should focus on rallying them against insurgent activities and highlight successes of the hn governme nt and hn security forces both themes will reinforce legitimacy these themes generally build cohesiveness among the population and counter insurgent divisive themes cohesive themes highlight commonality of ultimate goals commonality of labor economic and material problems ability to separate facts from perceptions and solve important problems ethnic similarities and common origins religion and social similarities traditional or historical evidence of unity failure of traditional solutions accompanied by awareness of need for new solutions patriotism and nationalism ability to provide information to the government without fear of reprisal insurgent 447 insurgents manage perceptions through propaganda and disinformation rarely do they have to tell the truth in technologically advanced insurgencies filming an attack may be as important as the attack itself therefore themes aimed at insurgents must divide insurgent groups into smaller groups and separate the insurgents from the population also th emes should counter insurgent propaganda in many successful information engagement plans reconciliation and amnesty for certain insurgents have been key components divisive theme categories political social economic and id eological differences among elements of the insurgents leadership rivalries within the insurgent movement portrait of insurgents as cr iminals inept and counter to the goals of the hn populace danger of betrayal from among the insurgents harsh living conditions of insurgents selfish motivation of opportunists supporting the insurgents separate foreign fighters from domestic groups using patriotism and nationalism when appropriate separate public from the perception that insurgents are noble public outcry reconciliation or amnesty chapter 4 412 fmi 3242 countering insurgent propaganda proactive and designed to neutralize the psychological impact of future attacks acknowledge the possibility even lik elihood of future attacks criminal attacks against hn population foreign ties and leadership highlight insurgent ineptitude public affairs 448 this is commanders responsibility its purpose is to proactively inform and educate through public information command information and direct community engagement public affairs have statutory responsibility to factually and accurately in form various publics without intent to propagandize or manipulate public opinion public affairs facilita tes commanders obligation to support informed us citizenry us government decision makers and as tactical requirements may dictate nonus audiences public affairs and other informati on engagement tasks must be synchronized to ensure consistency command credibility and operations security as part of the planning process for more information see jp 361 ar 3601 fm 461 and fm 3611 media 449 in coin environment the most difficult portion of information engagementwhen necessary involves dealing with the media media contacts normally should be handled by the appropriate public affairs officer pao however this is not always possible and silence is not always the best solution refusal to speak with accredited members of the media may cr eate strong negative impressions with strategic implications best practices stress the human aspects of story including the impact of opposing operations on people with which readers viewers or listeners can identify point out the needs of the unfortunate and the fact that both soldiers and hn counterparts are working to address those needs if you do not know the answer try to get it and then either inform the reporter or refer the reporter to another source this may establish your team as helpful source and develop relationship that can help ensure future balanced coverage resist the temptation to attack other groups or organizations and avoi d committing information fratricide if questioned about anot her agencys activities refer to that agency for comment never speak for other organizations keep trusted reporters and editors who c over the ao about significant activities there answer media inquiries promptly accurately and courteously learn reporters deadlines and use them to the friendly forces advantage encourage media to see what hn and us soldiers are doing avoid reacting emotionally to skepticism or hostility discuss issues calmly use facts to back up statements stay focused on the mission follow the policies of higher hq and pao for media interviews remain friendly yet professional use reporters names use clear understandable language be prepared anticipate questions and think about various responses get to know the interviewers research the medias organizations and views find out how the reporter previously conducted interviews comprehensive tactical planning in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 413 emphasize the interests of the local nationals or other beneficiaries of the mission avoid speculation state only facts that can be verified quote statistics with care as data is easily repurposed avoid repeating questions especially those with incorrect or inflammatory language as this could easily be misquoted or taken out of context refuse offtherecord discussi onsthere is such thing avoid saying comment which can make you sound evasive stay objective save personal opinions and beliefs for more appropriate time and place psychological operations 450 these operations convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions motives objective reasoning and u ltimately the behavior of foreign governments organizations groups and individuals the purpose of psychological operations is to induce or reinforce foreign attitudes and behavior favorable to the originators objectives jp 102 psychological operations can be directed at the civilian populace as whole sp ecific groups or individuals outside the united states and its territories psychological operations can influe nce and modify the behavior of foreign target audiences in support of us objectives in coin operation psyop seeks to increase popular support for the host nation government typi cally psyop directs its messages at the populace however psychological operations may focus on convincing enemy fi ghters to surrender rather than risk destruction therefore these capabilities may be integrated into counterinsurgency targeti ng psychological operations units may also be taskorgan ized with maneuver forces population 451 the psyop message to the population in coin has three key facets obtain buyin by coin force for acti ons that affect the populace such as control measures census win over passive or neutral people by showing hn legitimacy and commitment encourage locals to provide information about the insurgency to us or hn security forces insurgents 452 the psyop message to the insu rgents has three key facets divide insurgent leaders and guerrillas by emphasizing differences in ideology within the insurgency in the degree of sacrifice required by different groups divide insurgents and mass base by emphasizing failures of the insurgency successes of the government create means for insurgents to abandon the movement and return to the society leader and soldier engagement 453 the actions of leaders and soldiers are the most powerful components of information engagement visible actions coordinated with carefully chosen truthful words influence audiences more than either does alone local and regional audiences as well as adversaries compare the friendly forces message with its actions facetoface interaction by leaders and soldiers strongly influences the perceptions of the local populace meetings conducted by leaders w ith key communicators civilian leaders or others whose percep tions decisions and actions will ffect mission accomplishment can be critical to mission success these meetings provide the most convincing ve nue for conveying positive information assuaging fears and refuting rumors lies and misinformation chapter 4 414 fmi 3242 techniques 454 at the tactical level there are three primary means unit can use to disseminate its message word of mouth announcements and town hall meetings word of mouth 455 this is the most basic form of sending and recei ving information and ultimately the form that every other method will become word of mouth is th quickest most common most inaccurate and most uncontrollable means of disseminating information but it may be the best way to send message rumors spins casual conversations and dinnertable discussions whatever form they take word of mouth travels like wild fire it spreads out of control and the stor grows and changes with each conversation everything unit does is observed and discussed by the locals and spun by the enemy units should be prepared to counter false information patrols must inter act with the populace they must listen for rumors and correct the ones they hear but do not waste time arguing about them units must spread positive image and reinforce the good things the governme nt is doing in the area to help the populace announcements 456 both written and verbal announcements are quick and controlled means of sending messages flyers loud speakers and public speaking are useful ways of informing the populace of progress incentive programs civil projects and operations town hall meetings 457 town hall meetings are an effective means of discussing points and counter points to coalition or government presence operations and the unifying message they tend to draw the people that are most interested in the issues and have the most legitimate grievances this type of meeting also exposes the leaders of the community and the general opinion of the locals these are planned meetings with an open forum units should exercise caution and not allow themselves to get trapped in arguments that take them off their message keep in mind that it is an open forum and the insurgents will ensure that people sympathetic to their cause are present and are fighting for their interests in the political arena section iiimdmp and tlp the army has two tactical planning processes the military decisionmaking process mdmp and troopleading procedures tlp the mdmp is more appropriate for headquarters with staffs it provides logical sequence of decisions and interactions betw een the commander and staff for developing estimates and effective plans orders leaders at company level nd below use tlp to plan and prepare for an operation the preferred method of planning is reverse planning the commander visualizes and describes the end state and the staff plans from the operations end state work ing backward in time counterinsurgency can create situations where the end state serves as distant aiming point for tactical objective over time and through continual assessment the end state and conditions th at define mission success become more clear forward planning involves starti ng with the present conditions and laying out potential decisions and actions forward in time identifying the next feasible step and the next after that the counterinsurgent must effectively combine the two methods of planning to achieve both the immediate objective and those which must be accomplished over time military decisionmaking process 458 the military decisionmaking process is planning model that establishes procedures for analyzing mission developing analyzing and comparing courses of action against criteria of success and each other selecting the optimum course of acti on and producing plan or order the mdmp helps organize the thought process of commanders and staff it is the process used by tactical counterinsurgent forces to organize large amounts of information orchestrate the appropriate sequence of action to defeat the comprehensive tactical planning in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 415 insurgency the process of developing longrange plans uses the military decisionmaking

tempo phasing or timing pay attention to balanced development across all lines of effort prioritize supporting objectives and targets to resources develop order with tasks and isr plan make current operations plans execute nearterm missions assess current operations new intelligence or new missions use this assessment to drive the process through another cycle 459 commanders modify the process as needed to fit the situation while typical modification of the mdmp is driven by the need to save time the counterinsurgent unit has two key reasons to modify the process the end product of longrange planning is not an operations order that is prepared for execution in the traditional sense the longrange plan provides focus for shortrange planning and ensures that the operations currently being conducted are having the desired effect on the end state each planning session within c ounterinsurgency is interrelated to the planning that preceded it units will conduct thorough mdmp initially nd then build continuously on those products and their situational understandi ng as they progress through succe ssive planning cycles units throughout their rotation continue to learn and adapt through assessment the commander will focus his staff on areas that require further detailed analysis and limit effort on areas where sufficient analysis has already been conducted 460 this analysis is captured in the staffs running estimate running estimate is staff sections continuous assessment of current and future operations to determine if the current operation is proceeding according to the commanders intent and if future operations are supportable this along with the commanders assessment and those of subordinate commanders build growing understanding of the chapter 4 416 fmi 3242 units operations area and allows the unit to modify the mdmp not out of necessity of time but through the ability to rapidly and accurately define problems and solutions 461 insurgencies are inherently complex and dynamic they cannot be fully understood through single cycle of the mdmp it is th cumulative effect of analysis and planning that builds and refines knowledge of units area of operations captured in the running estimate over the course of many successive planning cycles that allows th successful defeat of the insurgency 462 by developing comprehensive and iterative plan the counterinsurgent force follows the conventional mdmp steps however fighting an insurgency or more precisely conducting counterinsurgency operations is not conventional military opera tion as such the operational environment of counterinsurgency dictates some unique considerations to the conventional mdmp steps these considerations apply primarily to four md mp stepsreceive the mission mission

perform an initial assessment issue the initial guidance and issue the initial warning orderare largely unchanged units should account for additional time when working with hn security forces and tinue to refine their metttc analysis especially the ci vil considerations using ascope 464 during receipt of the mission two basic consid erations apply first the strategic mission of defeating the insurgency applies to all levels at all times this means that all operational or tactical missions activities and tasks are nested within this mission and can have direct lasting impact on its success or failure second it is here that the commander begins to visualize the ope ration it is critical for the commander to create comprehensive vision of the nd state from this desired end state the staff develops the lines of effort that support creating the commanders vision all lines of effort are focused on their own end states and those nd states are nested with the co mmanders overall end state

sketches th at show how the unit will accomplish the mission and explains the concept of operation step 4 coa analysis wargame 490 it is during coa analysis wargaming that the most significant and unique considerations apply coa analysis wargaming includes rules and steps that help commanders and staffs visualize the flow of battle wargaming focuses the staffs attention on each phase of the operation in logical sequence it is an iterative process of action reaction and counteraction however the standard wargaming methods of the belt avenueindepth or box method may not capture the complexity of the coin environment that commanders and planners must ve to conduct successful counterin surgency operations the box method is the traditional method that comes the closest to facilitating coin wa rgaming the traditional wargaming process is shown in figure 43 figure 43 course of action analysis wargame comprehensive tactical planning in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 421 491 to wargame an operation the staff visualizes it from start to finish evaluating the enemys actions and then modifying their plan with only one coa this step is often used to synchronize the plan across the warfighting functions analyzing coa modeling it gives the staff deeper understanding of the complex and adaptive oe of coin and how particular actions will affect it eight steps of coa analysis modeling 492 conduct the model using the same eight steps as laid out in fm 50 for the wargaming process gather the tools list friendly forces list assumptions list critical events determine evaluation criteria select the wargame method select method to record and wargame the operation all of these steps are still valid and essential within some steps there are modifications that must occur to successfully model 493 different groups may conduct specific loe modeli ng sessions prior to larger group conducting larger scale modeling session for some loe the wargaming method may be more appropriate unlike wargaming modeling is not onetime event mode ling sessions should be rerun as operations events and the operational environment changes 494 steps one through four remain unchanged in this technique step five determining evaluation criteria can be complicated this is where the planners develop the operations measures of effectiveness and measures of performance these measures ar derived from the commanders end state and the conditions leading to the end state these measures show when the unit is successful and achieves the commanders end state additionally the measures should also tell commanders when they are gaining the ability to influence the system 495 the number of insurgent attacks can be mislead ing indicator measures of effectiveness are more accurate when there are multiple supporting measur that look at similar issues with the intent of seeing the whole in counterinsurgency the three major areas to measure are the strength of the government the support of the people and the strength of the insurgency by measuring these three areas through variety of quantifiable measurements such as the ability to complete an essential service the number of tips reported to the police and the volum and type of insurgent propaganda the commander should have good feel for success and wo rkable measures of effectiveness 496 for step seven select method to record and display the results the recording method must capture the depth of the lessons that will be gained from the modeling and there must be method to refine certain critical products there are four areas where the planners should focus on capturing new information 1 the planners must capture any greater dept h of understanding for each of the variables 2 they must record any new understanding of the variables and how they relate 3 they must update the rules of behavior for each variable 4 they must update the collection matrix 497 an expanded synchronization matrix figure 44 captures the actions of us forces hn forces and the insurgents using the warfighting functions wffs it also shows the population groups across the political economic and social categor ies using synch matrix to s how these factors can reveal the complexity of the operational environment over time based on their deeper understanding of the system new critical information requirements

better understanding of the complex system that makes up an insurgency and to accurately forecas t how actions affect the system like wargaming there are many different techniques to conduct the actual modeling session for the purposes of this manual the turnbased technique using four groups is used modeling technique 499 during each turn each group states their actions followed by the next groups actions the four groups are the us coin forces the host nation includes other friendly forces all neutral elements ipi the population ngos and so on and the insurgents before beginning the group must clearly explain the concept rules and limitations for the modeling session to everyone to include specific guidance to key individuals two key parts of coin modeling are modeling the individual loe and modeling the overall area or sector affected in typical staff the s3 plays the role of us and hn forces the s9 plays the neutral elements and the s2 plays the role of the insurgents the xo facilitates the staff plays its respective parts as accurately as possible portr ay their group in the coming modeling session 4100 like with wargames the staff needs visual reference to conduct the modeling process this may be sand table map or some other visual board most of the items that compose this visual board come out of the mission analysis and must include more than just the hills and roads and other normal military aspects of terrain for the model to be successful it has to set the stage for the other planners to be able to see the world through their groups eyes that means the visual board should include significant cultural comprehensive tactical planning in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 423 sites and key social infrastructure sites the more tailed the board the more accurate and meaningful the modeling will be 4101 as operations unfold and more intelligence is gathered the planners should update the rules of behavior and capabilities for each group as the knowledge of the indi vidual groups and the system as whole is improved the planners will be able to identify how to more effectively influence the system this planning tool does not stop when the operation or der is issued modeling is an effective way of understanding the counterinsurgency system and ongoing operations step 5 coa comparison 4102 staffs analyze and evaluate the advantages and disadva ntages of each coa as well as identifying the one with the highest probability of success against the most lik ely enemy coa additional coin evaluation considerations may include effect on or role of the hn government effect on or role of the hn security forces effect on groups of the population impact on information engagement step 6 coa approval 4103 either after participating in the coa compar ison process or upon receipt of coa recommended decision the commander makes coa decision by approving coa to execute step 7 orders production 4104 units in coin operations issue warning order or warnord and after the commander selects coa issue written operation orde r however additional time for orders production may be needed if the order must be translated into another language to ensure nothing is lost in the translation and ensure success in multinational operations the staff must keep orders and rehearsals simple troopleading procedures 4105 troopleading procedures tlps give smallunit leaders dynamic framework for analyzing planning and preparing for an operation 4106 tlps in coin environment differ little from those described in fm 50 the next sections will provide brief description of th eight steps along with some add itional considerations for coin operations figure 45 shows addition coin considerations during tlps chapter 4 424 fmi 3242 figure 45 tlps in coin step 1 receive mission 4107 receipt of mission may occur with written or verbal warnord frago or opord due to the ambiguity in coin operations companies or platoons often start planning after identifying an insurgent vulnerability receiving humint or afte r having conversation with local leader 4108 upon receipt of mission lead ers must rapidly assess the s ituation using metttc leaders must provide additional emphasis on analyzing civil considerations by using the ascope method 4109 in time constrained situation an ongoing asse ssment of the ao using the operational variables pmesiipt should provide rele vant information to accomplish the mission based on current information leaders estimate and allocate 13 of av ailable time to plan and prepare for the mission including time to accommodate the language barrier with hn security forces and the remaining 23 of the available time for subordinates planning and rehearsals this remains relevant in coin environment step 2 issue warning order 4110 once done with the initial assessm ent leaders issue the best possible warnords often called warnord 1 with the information at hand they also draw relevant information from their ongoing assessment of the ao using the operational variab pmesiipt typically three warnords are issued each builds upon the previous one normally warnord consists of mission time and place of the opord units participating in the operation specific tasks time line of the operation step 3 make tentative plan 4111 once the warnord is issued l eaders build tentative plan by combining mission analysis coa development coa analysis coa comparison and coa approval within companies and platoons these steps are less structured and are often done mentally by the leader comprehensive tactical planning in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 425 mission analysis 4112 leaders use the metttc format to conduct mission analysis as they expand on the hasty analysis they conducted in step one after mission analysis is complete an updated warnord warnord 2 is issued in coin environment special consideration must be given to mission 4113 units create their restated mission statement after analyzing higher headquarters mission or analyzing their particular probl em it may take multiple times of conducting mission analysis to fully grasp the problem enemy 4114 units use the tools from chapter 2 elements of an insurgency dynamics of an insurgency the six insurgent strategies insurgent tactics and the strengths and vulnerabilities of insurgents to help further identify the group or groups of insu rgents they may encounter then define composition disposition recent activities most probable c oa and most dangerous coa terrain and weather 4115 significant changes from fm 50 troops and support available 4116 leaders must determine the amount and type of friendly forces available especially host nation security forces coalition forces and the nonmilitary enablers time 4117 use the acronym hopep higher operational pl anning enemy and populace to identify the various timelines civil considerations 4118 leaders must use the ascope method to analyze areas controlled by various demographic groups to obtain better understanding of the ao coa development 4119 leaders use coa development to determine one or more ways to accomplish the mission in timeconstrained environment leaders may only be able to craft one coa for long mid and shortrange plans companies will need to deve lop tasks along all lines of effort the six steps of coa development in coin are unchanged but special consideration should be given to analyze relative combat power 4120 leaders compare friendly incl uding host nation all enablers and insurgent combat power leaders may incorporate analysis of proand antigovernment populations generate options 4121 options should always consider employment of hn security forces and the hn government array forces 4122 array all enemy forces such as different insurgen t groups as well as all friendly forces to include host nation security forces small units may also ve to develop plans to employ special teams such as military working dog teams tactical site exploitati on teams uass or attack reconnaissance and assault aviation chapter 4 426 fmi 3242 develop concept of operations 4123 leaders describe the operation from start to finish especially critical is the creation of graphic control measures such as phase lines and building numbe rs to assist with c2 and clarify roles and tasks the coa must achieve unity of effort amongst all organizations assign responsibilities 4124 assign responsibilities for each task incl uding those for hn security forces prepare coa statement and sketch 4125 leaders prepare coa statement that describes ll significant actions from start to finish as well as sketch coa analysis wargame 4126 to wargame leaders visualize the operation from start to finish evaluate the enemys actions and then modify their plan with only one coa often this step is used to synchronize the plan across the wff coa comparison and coa approval 4127 these two steps are normally done mentally by the leader during tlp step 4 initiate movement 4128 as in any military operation leaders may choose to initiate movement necessary to enable mission preparation or position the unit for execution in coin this may mean moving us forces to an hn security force patrol base to conduct combined planning and movement step 5 conduct reconnaissance 4129 whenever time and circumstances allow leader s personally observe the ao for the mission since there is substitute for first hand information leaders may also consider using map joint land attack cruise missile defense elevated netted sensor system jlens uas or attack reconnaissance aviation to conduct the reconnaissance if time opsec or othe r considerations preclude personal reconnaissance step 6 complete plan 4130 leaders incorporate the results of the reconnaissance update information refine their products make coordination with adjacent units including host nation units and issue the final warnord extra time may be needed to translate the order into the host nations language step 7 issue opord 4131 leaders issue verbal or written orders to their subordinates using the standard fiveparagraph field order format in addition leaders use map overhead imagery or terrain model to enhance subordinates understanding of the ssion additional time may be required to brief the opord in two languages if hn forces are participating in the operati on units who have experienced opsec issues with hn security forces may choose to issue the opord to the hn unit just prior to crossing the line of departure step 8 supervise and refine 4132 throughout the tlps army leaders monitor preparations refine the plan coordinate with adjacent units and conduct rehearsals coin operations us the standard five types of rehearsals they are the confirmation brief the back brie f the combined arms rehearsal the support rehearsal and the battle drill or sop rehearsal comprehensive tactical planning in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 427 4133 additional time may be required to conduct reh earsals in two languages units who have experienced operational security opsec issues with hn security forces may choose to have hn forces conduct generic rehearsals for example clear room or establish checkpoint versus the actual complete operation section ivtargeting insurgents in major combat operations targeting focuses on identifying capabilities or resources the maneuver command er must have effects for his operation to succeed then att acking them with fire suppor t aviation and close air support during counterinsurgency operations the role of targeting can include broad range of both enemy and stability targets that use all seven coin lines of effort to attack or influence them role in coin 4134 the expanded use of targeting in coin gives the planner two key benefits prioritization and synchronization because the c ounterinsurgent often faces multiple objectives many without clear positional references friendly courses of action may not be easily represented in terms of various forms of maneuver each may instead portray series of targ ets that the unit must infl uence over specified time 4135 the targeting process focuses operations and th use of limited assets and time commanders and staffs use the targeting process to achieve ffects that support the objectives and missions during counterinsurgency operations it is important to understa nd that targeting is done for all operations not just attacks against insurgent the targeting process can support psyop civilmilitary operations and even meetings between commanders and host nation leaders based on the commanders desires 4136 the synchronization of rstaisr assets with available combat power is the greatest contribution targeting brings to the counterinsurgent the indir ect nature of irregular warfare often creates limited opportunities to strike or influence targets integrating th intelligence process and the operations process through targeting can be used to ensure that maneuver units strike the right targets at the right time or are prepared to strike targets of opportunity 4137 effective targeting requires the creation of ta rgeting board or working group although in many cases the targeting staff is similar to the planning staff it is typically chaired by the xo or fire support coordinator and includes representatives from across the staff including s2 s3 s5 s7 s9 air liaison officer and staff judge advocate the goal is to pr ioritize targets and determine the means of engaging them that best supports the commanders intent and operation plan the focus of the targeting cell in counterinsurgency environment is to target people both the insurgents and the population 4138 effective targeting identifies the targeting options both lethal and nonlethal to achieve effects that support the commanders objectives lethal assets are normally employed against targets with operations to capture or kill nonlethal assets are normally employed against targets that are best engaged with psyop negotiation political programs economic programs and social programs figure 46 shows examples of potential targets chapter 4 428 fmi 3242 figure 46 lethal and nonlethal targeting counterinsurgency targeting process 4139 the targeting process comprises the four functions of decide detect deliver and assess d3a targeting is critically linked to the mdmp the decide function derives critical information that develops from mission analysis through course of action approval both detect and assess functions are tied to the units rstaisr plan which is driven by ipb the mdmp and tactical site exploitation figure 47 shows the links between the targeting cycle and mdmp comprehensive tactical planning in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 429 figure 47 targeting and mdmp 4140 the commanders guidance drives the targeting process commanders issue targeting guidance during decide actions during detect may give commanders the intelligence needed to refine their guidance target identification may be difficult once counterinsurgency operation begins the focus during deliver should be on decisive points that the commanders can engage immediately after delivering units assess the effect 4141 the unit s2 must understand that the targeting process depends on the effective and timely use of the intelligence cycle and on the exploitation of objectives and detainees target development against insurgents results from complete and accurate s ituation development during peacetime contingency planning and analysis of the operational environment during conflict the ipb supports the target development process and provides the commander with th intelligence needed to select valid target nodes to engage decide 4142 this function focuses and sets priorities for in telligence collection and bot h lethal and nonlethal plans intelligence and operations personnel with the commander and other staff members decide when target is developed well enough to engage continuous staff integrati on and regular meetings of the intelligence cell and targeting board enable this function specifically intelligence analysts need to identify individuals and groups to engage as potential counterinsurgency supporters targets to isolate from the population and targets to eliminate during the decide activity the targ eting board produces prioritized list of targets and recommended course of action ssociated with each executi ng targeting decisions may chapter 4 430 fmi 3242 require the operations section to issue fragmentary orde rs each of these orders is task that should be nested within the higher headquarters plan and th commanders intent targeting decisions may require changing the intelligence synchronizati on plan the targeting working group participates in coa analysis and collaboratively develops the following decide function products highpayoff target list 4143 an hpt list is prioritized list of targets by phase of the joint operation whose loss to an enemy will contribute to the success of the mission jp 360 intelligence synchronization plan 4144 this is what the intelligence fficer uses with staff input to synchronize the entire collection effort to include all assets the commander controls assets of lateral units and higher echelon units organizations and intelligence reach to answer the commanders cr itical information requirements fm 20 target selection standards 4145 target selection standards establish criteria incl uding accuracy that must be met before an attack for targets to be attacked using lethal means requirements might include picture address 8digit grid and enough evidence to prosecute for targets to be attacked by nonlethal means requirements may include background information on an individual mee tings he may attend and known associates attack guidance matrix 4146 the attack guidance matrix lists which targets or target sets approved by the commander to act on how and when to act on them and the desired effects target synchronization matrix 4147 the target synchronization matrix combines data from the highpayoff target list intelligence synchronization plan and the attack guidance matrix it lists highpayoff targets by category and the agencies responsible for detecting them attacking them and assessing the effects of the attacks targeting frago 4148 the targeting frago tasks units to execute the lethal and nonlethal plans detect 4149 the detect function involves cating hpts accurately enough to engage them targets are detected through the maximum use of all available ssets the s2 must focus the intelligence acquisition efforts on the designated hpts and pir situa tion development information through detection and tracking will be accumulated as collection sy stems satisfy pir and in formation requirements tracking is an essential element of the detect function of the targeting process tracking priorities are based on the commanders concept of the operation and targeting priorities tracking is executed through the collection plan since many critical targets move frequently 4150 detection at the tactical level is achieved through variety of means such as humint source an anonymous tip uas combat patrol sigint domex rotary wing aircraft usaf aircraft or military working dog teams the best means of tecting target during an insurgency is humint though as such the detect activity requires detailed understanding of social networks insurgent networks insurgent actions and the communitys attitude toward the c ounterinsurgent forces 4151 for target that must be engaged by nonlethal means the detect function may require patrols to conduct reconnaissance of leaders home to determine if they are there an assessment of potential project or attendance at gree ting to meet with leader comprehensive tactical planning in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 431 rsta and isr operations 4152 reconnaissance surveillance and target acquisition rsta and inte lligence surveillance and reconnaissance are activities that synchronize nd integrate the planning nd operation of sensors assets and processing exploitation and disseminati on systems in direct support of current and future operations this is an integrated intelligence and operations function jp 201 rstaisr provides relevant information about all aspects of the opera tional environment rstaisr helps commanders assess the degree to which information superiority is achieved rstaisr also directly supports information engagements by defining targets in detail and by help ing assess the effectiveness of friendly and adversary information engagements 4153 reconnaissance and surveillance operations he lp to confirm or deny insurgent coas and estimates of guerrilla capabilities and combat eff ectiveness reconnaissan ce and surveillance also confirm or deny assumptions about the operationa l environment and threat made during planning 4154 doctrine requires the staff to carefully focus rs taisr on the ccir pir and ffir and be able to quickly retask units and assets as the situation changes this ensures that the enemy situation drives rstaisr operations the s2 and s3 play critical role in this challenging task that is sometimes referred to as fighting isr through rstaisr commanders and staffs continuously plan task and employ collection assets and forces they collect process nd disseminate timely and accurate information combat information and intelligence to satisfy the commanders critical information requirements and other intelligence requirements 4155 rstaisr synchronization analyzes information requirements and intelligence gaps evaluates available assets both internal and external to the orga nization determines gaps in the use of those assets recommends rstaisr assets controlled by the organization to collect on the ccir and submits requests for information for adjacent or higher collection s upport fm 30 collection tasks linked to decision points play critical part in the operation the reconnaissance and surv eillance plan must ensure that information tied to decision points reaches the comma nder and staff in time to support the decision the reconnaissance and surveillance plan also ties directly into the targe ting process collection assets are identified prioritized and planned to detect certain targets during the decide and detect phases of the d3a process the collectors information if it meets the established criteria may trigger the deliver function after delivery the collectors also identified in the decide phase provide information to assess the attack these may be the same collector or different asset if not different asset is tasked to do this one tool to achieve this is daily rstaisr and operations synchronization meeting which is discussed in the targeting section of this chapter the rstaisr synchronization plan is an output of this meeting and coordinates and synchronizes the rstaisr for more see fm 20 deliver 4156 the deliver function of targeting begins in earnest with execution the targeting process provides speed and efficiency in the deliver of lethal or nonlethal fires on ta rgets in accordance with the attack guidance matrix or the targeting frago within the deliver functi on the system or combination of systems selected during the decide phase is employed 4157 for target that requires lethal means units may eliminate the target usi ng joint direct attack munition jdam from usaf aircraft an excalibur round joint tactical attack cruise missile system jtacms or sniper however many times it is more important to capture the target so commanders will choose to execute raid or cordon and sear ch for target that requires nonlethal means commander may choose to use an information engageme nt to convince local leader or to conduct project to garner the populations support through money or employment 4158 target exploitation in the counterinsurgency environment is similar to that in law enforcement an exploitation plan not only facilitates gathering evidence for future court cases but also may lead to followon targets after successful exploitation see chapter 6 for details on tactical site exploitation chapter 4 432 fmi 3242 assess 4159 at the tactical level commanders use assessment to get series of timely and accurate snapshots of their effect on the insurgent and the population it provides commanders with an estimate of the insurgents combat effec tiveness capabilities and intentions as well as an accurate understanding of the people this helps commanders determine when or if their targeting efforts have been accomplished the assess phase relies heavily upon moes and mops 4160 producing the assessment is primarily an intelligence responsibility but requires coordination with operations civil affairs public affairs information operations and psyop to be effective as part of the targeting process assessment helps to determin if another engagement of the target is necessary targeting of battle rhythm 4161 during coin operations brigades and battalions typically use one or two week targeting battle rhythm the target cycle drives the tactical units daily and weekly operations figure 48 shows an example of targeting cycle and battle rhythm figure 48 targeting of battle rhythm 4162 another important facet of the battle rhyt hm is the daily rstaisr and operations synchronization meeting due to the air tasking order cycle this traditionally synchronizes operations from 96 hours to 24 hours in the preparation to hand over to current operations in counterinsurgencies this meeting must synchronize all acti ons along the seven coin loes pecially critical is planning and requesting higherlevel assets such as air force aircraft jamming uas s isr and aviation ahead of the higher headquarters decision cycle there are three outputs from this meetinga 96hour synchronization matrix 96hour rstaisr plan and daily frago

characteristics of the offense 52 the characteristics of the offense are surprise audacity tempo nd concentration for coin an additional characteristic flexibility is added surprise 53 units achieve surprise by striking the enem at time place or manner in which he is unprepared total surprise is rarely attainable or essential in conventional operations but is often essential during coin operations concentration 54 this is the massing of combat power particularly its effects at the decisive point to achieve the units purpose during coin insurgents avoid situations in which ushn security forces could potentially mass combat power unless the potential collateral effects of use of that combat power will distance the population from the ushn government this outweighs combat losses ushn security forces always seek to mass nonlethal and lethal combat power though not always visibly tempo 55 this is the rate of military action relative to the insurgency tempo is not the same as speed successful coin units control or alter tempo to maintain the initiative such action promotes surprise enters the enemys decision cycle increases the protection of the ttacking force and decreases the insurgents ability to defend or plan effectively audacity 56 this is simple plan of action boldly executed audacity is critical to successful coin offensive operations and is completely reliant on thor ough understanding of the operational environment creativity and mental agility are characteristics of an udacious counterinsurgent flexibility 57 this is the ability of military unit to adapt to unplanned or unexpected conditions of the operational environment to achieve its tactical purpose and support the loe types of offensive operations 58 the types of offensive operations are movement to contact attack exploitation and pursuit movement to contact 59 this develops the situation and establishes or re gains contact with the enemy insurgent forces fm 30 it also creates favorable conditions for subs equent tactical actions and stability operation at tactical level every movement can be treated as m ovement to contact because of the lack of information concerning insurgent location strength capabilities and intentions specific types of movements to cont act include search and attack and cordon and search operations attack 510 this destroys or defeats enemy insurgent for ces seizes and secures terrain or both fm 30 attacks require maneuver supported by direct and indi rect fires attacks may be hasty or deliberate offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 53 depending on the time available for planning and prepar ation commanders execute hasty attacks when the situation calls for immediate action with available forces and minimal preparation they conduct deliberate attacks when they have more time to plan and prepare 511 tactical units normally conduct synchronized and special purpose attacks during coin operations special purpose attacks are ambushes spoiling attacks counterattacks raids feints and demonstrations this chapter focuses on the tac tics of raids ambushes and sniper employment exploitation 512 this rapidly follows successful attack and diso rganizes the enemy in depth fm 30 tactical commanders exploit successful offensive operations in coin failure to exploit may allow the insurgent to egress reposition or disappear into the population an example of tactical unit conducting an exploitation in coin would be sending unit on raid based on information and intelligence gathered n cordon and search that occurred earlier in the day eff ective search procedures tactical site exploitation tactical questioning and use of isr assets are key to units being able to effectively conduct an exploitation pursuit 513 this is conducted to catch or cut off hos tile force attempting to escape with the aim of destroying it fm 30 pursuit operations begin when an insurgent forces attempts to conduct retrograde operations unlike conventional operations where the emys transition to retrograde operations leaves him vulnerable to loss of internal cohesion and complete destruction the insurgents transition to retrograde operations may make it more difficult for tactical units to engage capture or kill him successful pursuit of the insurgent relies on maintaining contact through surveillance assets patrols and hn security forces 514 tactical leaders must recognize the potential of the insurgent to conduct baited ambush during retrograde operations critical to mitigating risk to friendly forces during pursuit is maintaining one of the eight forms of contact d irect indirect nonhostilecivilian obs tacle cbrn aerial visual and electronic and positioning of adjacent units such as av iation hn security forces surveillance assets other ground forces and quick reaction forces qrf offensive operations in clear hold build operations 515 offensive operations are the initial focus in clear hold build operations these operations establish civil security and establish civil control both are pivotal in setting the conditions for balanced development across the seven coin loes offensive operations will continue to be conducted in the hold and build phases this keeps insurgents from reestablishing influence over an area and is based on change in the insurgencys orga nizational and operational patterns mission variables in coin 516 in counterinsurgency operations tactical units face unique set of considerations based on the mission variables specific considerations for types of offensive operations will be discussed later however some considerations fo r all offensive operations include mission offensive operations should be based on the best intelligence av ailable while inflicting the minimal damage to the population infrastructure and local economy to further gather inte lligence units must be prepared to conduct leaders should consider having consequen ce management and perception management plan in case the offensive actions go poorly chapter 5 54 fmi 3242 enemy leaders must pay careful attention to insurgent escape routes as most insurgents will seek to flee from most other enemy considerations include the insurgent resistance in the direction of attack into the target area insurgent resistance in the objective area insurgent resistance at the target insurgent resistance parting the objective terrain and weather leaders often seek to conduct operations duri ng limited visibility or early morning hours in order to surprise the targets troops and support available tactical units are often taskorganized with additional teams or units chapter 3 host nation security forces are essential for every offensive operation time available leaders allocate sufficient time to conduct the operation in coin this should include time to conduct and tactical questioning civil considerations the level of inconvenience to the local populace should discourage insurgents and insurgent sympathizers from remaining in the locale and encourage the local population to provide information on the insurgents the level of inconvenience should not be so great as to turn the local population towards active or passive support of the insurgency actions on the objective must include how to d eal with nonhostile persons bystanders family members and detainees section iicivil security and control establishing civil security promotes safe environment establishing civil control involves regulates selected behavior and activities of individuals and groups it reduces risk to individuals and gr oups and provides security from both external and internal threats fm 307 together actions along these loes in coin often take the form of unilateral and combined offensive operations against insurgent leadership guerrillas underground and auxiliary these offens ive actions help establish public or der and safety in coin offensive operations are more successful when supported by effective targeting search and attack 517 this technique is used for conducting movement to contact that shares many of the characteristics of an area security mission fm 390 search nd attack is specialized technique of conducting movement to contact in an environment of noncontiguous aos in coin search and attack uses multiple coordinated smallunits t eam squad or platoon that conduct decentralized movement to find and attack the enemy commander normally employs this form of movement to contact when the enemy is operating in small disp ersed elements often searches and attacks are used to support the establish civil security subtask of force cessation of hostilities peace agreement and other arrangements 518 search and attack operations are used in both urban and rural terrain they are followed by operations supporting the other loe such as restori ng damaged infrastructure or conducting information offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 55 engagements in neighborhood this t actic disrupts insurgent activities wh ile trying to solve some of the root causes of the insurgency the search and attack is typically used during the clear phase of clearholdbuild operation it may also be used in strike operation 519 to develop specific search and attack concept the commander must understand the oe by using the operational variables the mission variables and mission analysis the troopleading procedures tlp and military decisionmaking process mdmp applied to the coin oe serve as the planning foundation for commanders and leaders considerations during counterinsurgencies 520 specific considerations using elements of th mission variables to search and attack in coin are mission 521 leaders determine whether the search and attack is enemy or terrainorien ted if enemyoriented the search and attack should attack the enemy while inflicting minimal damage to the population infrastructure and local economy if terrainoriented the search and attack must be prepared to locate base camps caches safe houses or subterranean structures time available 522 the size of the area especially the interior layout of urban buildings impacts force size and search time phases 523 search and attack has three basic phases organize plan and execute organize 524 the commander taskorganizes his unit into reconnaissance fixi ng and finishing forces each with specific purpose and task the size of the rec onnaissance force is based on the available intelligence about the size of insurgent forces in the ao the less known about the situation the larger the reconnaissance force the reconnaissance force ty pically consists of scout infantry aviation and electronic warfare assets the fixing force must have enough combat power to isolate insurgents once the reconnaissance force finds them the finishing force must have enough combat power to defeat insurgents the commander can direct each subordinate unit to retain finish ing force or he can retain the finishing force at his echelon the commander may rotate his subordinate elements through the reconnaissance fixing and finishing roles howeve r rotating roles may require change in task organization and additional time for training and rehearsal reconnaissance force 525 the reconnaissance force finds the enemy force us ing all means available it can serve as an element of the fixing force or follow and assume the role of the attack force if sufficiently resourced if the reconnaissance element makes contact without being detected by the insurgent the commander has the initiative in coin hn secur ity forces are often the best suited to conduct the reconnaissance if they have the training equipment and capability fixing force 526 although sometimes included in the reconnaissance force in coin the fixing force develops the situation and then executes one of two options based on the commanders guidance and the mission variables the first option is to block identified r outes that the insurgent can use to escape or use for reinforcements the second option is to conduct an attack to fix the insurgent in his current positions chapter 5 56 fmi 3242 until the finishing force arrives the fixing force attacks if that action meets the commanders intent and it can generate sufficient combat power against the insurgents depending on the insurgents mobility and the likelihood of the reconnaissance force being compromi sed the commander may need to position his fixing force before his reconnaissance force enters the ao finishing force 527 the finishing force must possess and maintain fficient combat power to defeat the insurgent templated the finishing force may move behind the reconnaissance and fixing force or it may locate where it is best prepared to rapidly maneuver on the insurgents location by foot vehicle or air the finishing force must be responsive enough to engage th insurgent before he can break contact with the reconnaissance force the finishing force destro ys or captures the insurgent by conducting hasty or deliberate attacks or employing indirect fire attack reconnaissance aviation or close air support to destroy the insurgent the comma nder may direct the finishing force to establish an area ambush and use his reconnaissance and fixing forces to drive the insurgent into the ambushes plan 528 the commander establishes control measures th at allow for maximum decentralized actions and smallunit initiative control measures facilitate the rapid consolidation and concentration of combat power before an attack the minimum control measur for search and attack are an ao objectives checkpoints phase lines limits of advance and contact points the use of target reference points trps facilitates responsive fire support once reconnaissa nce force makes contact with the enemy the commander uses objectives and checkpoints to guide the movement of subordinate elements the commander uses other control measures as needed such as phase lines restrictive fire lines and marking systems zones 529 the commander next determines how the area of operations will be broken down two options are multiple 530 assigning multiple small zones that keep subordinate elements concentrated and allow controlled phased movement throughout the overall area this f acilitates overall control and allows subordinates to rapidly mass their combat power single 531 concentrate the main effort in one zone and use fi re teams or squad patrols to reconnoiter the next zone once the main effort has completed thorough r econnaissance of the initial zone it then moves into the zone that the small units have reconnoitered as they then move to their next zone small patrols provide the initial reconnaissance in formation which commanders eval uate and then focus additional reconnaissance efforts orientation 532 the commander determines how the search and ttack will be conducted within the designated zones the zones may be searched selectively or sy stematically the commander mu st visualize describe and direct how subordinates will conduct the reconna issance and how the attacking force will maneuver against the enemy two methods include decentralized attack 533 each subordinate element is tasked to find fix finish and exploit all enemy forces in their area within their capabilities if more combat power is required then the bct will employ additional assets the reserve or adjacent units offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 57 centralized attack 534 the commander retains control of the attack fo rce while each subordinate element is tasked to find and fix the enemy in their ao this method works well when insurgents use base camps execute 535 the four typical steps in search and attack operations are enter the ao s earch the ao locate the enemy and conduct the attack enter the ao 536 commanders determine how combined forces enter conduct movement and establish objective rally points orps and bases patrol bases combat outpos ts or joint security stations within the ao by considering the eight forms of contact possible with the insurgent or the population this technique allows commanders and subordinate leaders to identify their units potential contact with the enemy and population throughout all phases of the search and attack leaders sy nchronize the actions of adjacent units and provide specific tasks to ensure subordinates understand actions on contact with both enemy and civilians within the roe units may enter the area or zone by infiltrating as an entire unit and splitting or by infiltrating as smaller subordinate units via ground air or water figures 51 and 52 figure 51 infiltration by company figure 52 infiltration by squadplatoon search the ao 537 reconnaissance elements search areas to locate the enemy without detection this allows more time for leaders to plan and coordinate an attack ge nerally small units are used since they move quickly and with more stealth among the population regardless of the ao once an element of the insurgency is discovered the commanders concept intent nd the situation on the ground dictates whether the reconnaissance element follows the in surgent or fixes the in surgent until the attack force is in position specific tasks may include route area and zone reconnaissance or other surveillance tasks locate enemy 538 reconnaissance units must locate insurgent forces tracks or other indicators of direction or location in rural and some border operations welltrained trackers can identify and follow insurgent tracks that are hours or even days ol d units tracking the insu rgent must be prepared to react to insurgent contact and avoid likely ambush situations leaders mu st ensure support for the reconnaissance force if it is compromised in urban areas tracking the insurgent is more difficult due to the nature of the terrain and the insurgents use of the population leaders rely on humint thorough knowledge of their ao uas attack reconnaissance aviation and sound co mmunication and coordination with adjacent units to find the elusive insurgent chapter 5 58 fmi 3242 conduct the attack 539 the attack in search and attack has four elements concentrate combat power 540 once the insurgent is discovered the plan must support the rapid concentration of combat power to fix and destroy the insurgent l eaders at each echelon must plan to destroy the insurg ent within their capabilities or at least fix the insurgent fix the enemy 541 if the insurgent cannot be destroyed by the forces on hand then the forces must fix the insurgent until finishing forces arrive fixing forces block eg ress routes with indirect fires maneuver forces obstacles or all three they also suppress the insurgents weapons systems obscure his vision and disrupt his command and control specific tasks may include establishing blocking position an ambush or support by fire position react to contact 542 if unit makes contact it takes immediate action to fix or destroy the insurgent the speed and violence of hasty attack may compensate fo r the lack of reconnaissance or combat power however this is rarely true against prepared insurgent defense or during periods of limited visibility leaders should not assume the discovered insurgent force is alone there may be mutually supporting positions or units finish the enemy 543 an initial attempt to finish the insurgent by squad or platoon in contact may become fixing effort for platoon or company attack cordon and search 544 cordon and search operation is conducted to seal cordon off an area in order to search it for persons or things such as items intelligence data or answers to pir effective cordon and search operations possess sufficient forces to both effectively cordon target area and thoroughly search that target usually this operation contributes to establishing public order and safety key establish civil control subtask it is also one of the techniques used in the clear phase of clearholdbuild operation 545 cordon is tactical task given to unit to prevent withdrawal from or reinforcement to position cordon implies occupying or controlling terrain especia lly mounted and dismounted avenues of approach search implies the physical and visual inspection of an ar ea both the object of the search and the physical area of the search influence the type and degree of the search fm 3905 fm 39015 and fm 30620 and for additional information on s earches and site exploitation methods 546 the two basic methods of executing cordon and search are cordon and knock and cordon and enter they differ in level of aggression based on the enemy sitemp and identified operational risk actual cordon and search operations vary between these two levels 547 key factors to consider in selecting the method to use include the enem threat the local populace support the level of intelligence available and the capabilities of the hn security forces in both methods the cordon is still established with as much speed or surprise as possi ble to isolate the objective both methods may require some integrated hn security forces or civil authorities to obt ain the agreement by the occupants of the targeted search area figure 5 3 compares the characteristics of permissive and nonpermissive cordon and search operations offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 59 figure 53 comparison of cordon and search methods cordon and knock 548 this is less intrusive than cordon and search it is used when the populace is seen as friendly or neutral when resistance is expected and when the goal is to disrupt and inconvenience the occupants as little as possible one version of this is called the tactical callout this is procedure where occupants are asked to exit the before search forces enter if occupants refuse to exit or if the ground commander believes that the potential exists for an insurgent encounter he may escalate to cordon and enter 549 second version of the cordon and knock is cordon and ask which means occupants or the local host nation authorities are asked for permission to search particular location if permission is denied entry occurs however the cordon and knock and the cordon and ask require some degree of integration with hn security force or hn authorities to obtain the agreement by the occupants of the target to the subsequent search at minimum sufficient number of translators preferably one w ith each element is required cordon and enter 550 this approach is intrusive the intent is to rapidly breach barrier s to gain entry into the search area typically using speed and surprise to allow the unit to quickly gain control this action allows units to maintain the initiative over pot entially unknown insurgent force operati ng in the search area intrusive entry ranges from soldier simply opening door without occupant permission to mechanical ballistic or explosive breaching in addition mounted units can use vehicles to breach the cordon and enter approach does not explicitly require integrated hn security forces or hn authorities because occupants permission is not required however during counterinsurgency obtaining the leadership or direct support of the hn is always preferred commanders assu operational risk in coin by foregoing these considerations some considerations when using the cordon and enter method follow these considerations may be more or less important than capturing the target individual site or equipment gains in security by violent capture of key insurgent leader may result in far more substantial losses along the other loe risk to civilian occupants and bystanders collateral damage to infrastructure perception of the populace risk to soldiers rehearsals level of training of breach element effects on subsequent tactical site exploitations approaches 551 leaders plan and execute cordon and search operations using either systematic or selective approach systematic approach is the search of all buildings in th targeted area while selective approach is the search of specifi c locations within targeted ar ea the approach used depends on numerous factors however the purpose of the operati on is still to capture the designated personnel site or equipment chapter 5 510 fmi 3242 considerations 552 if intelligence indicates enemy presence and th local populace is either neutral or supportive of the insurgency then the principles of speed and rprise are the keys to successful cordon and search specific considerations using elemen ts of the mission variables are mission 553 leaders determine the focus and method of the cordon and search based on the anticipated threat and the level of violence in the area of operations enemy 554 cordon elements cannot effectively block pedestrian egress or ingress therefore commanders should consider how to best physically stop pedestrian traffic lethal fire is not universal means of enforcing the nature of cordon troops and support available 555 the size and composition of the cordon and search force is based on the size of the area to be cordoned the size of the area to be searched and the suspected emy sitemp normally military commander with the police in support best controls search involving battalion or larger force the police with the military in support best control search involving smaller forces regardless of the controlling agency hn police are the be st choice for performing the actual search however they must be available in adequate numbers and be trained in search operations time available 556 as time available to plan and prepare for cordon and search mission is generally limited it is often necessary to conduct planning while rec onnaissance and intelligence collection are ongoing the size of the area especially the in terior layout of urban buildings impacts force size and search time leaders should plan on allowing time for followon missions based on exploitable information civil considerations 557 cordon and search operations are great opportun ity for all soldiers to conduct information engagements with the population each soldier s hould know and understand the information engagement task and purpose phases 558 the phases of cordon and search are the planning phase reconnaissance phase movement to the objective phase isolate the objective phase search phase and the withdrawal phase plan 559 establishing the cordon requires detailed planni ng effective coordination and meticulous integration and synchronization of available assets to achieve the desired effects this requires the commander to consider both lethal nd nonlethal effects each subordinate cordon position such as traffic control point or blocking position must have designa ted leader and clearly understood task and purpose 560 cordon and search operation can usually support the conduct engagement loe commanders must develop integrate and nest the information message in accordance with the purpose of the search often the best message in coin is ones actions or that of the entire unit 561 search of an urban area varies from few easily isolated buildings to large welldeveloped urban city leaders should divide the urban area to be searched into zones buildings should be numbered and assigned specific search parties for coordination and clarity offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 511 enablers 562 assets employed during the cordon and search may

prevents the egress of individuals from the search area and prevents outside support to the search area is critical to the success of the s earch effort based on the mission va riables metttc two cordons are often established an outer cordon to isolate the objective from outside reinforcements or disruptions and an inner cordon to prevent individuals from leaving or communicating with someone outside the search area both cordon elements must maintain 360degree security uas scouts attack reconnaissance aviation or sniper teams should be considered by tactical units for use in observing the

tools for objective analysis may be obtained from attack aviation photographs maps and local emergency services departments movement to the objective 573 the timing routes and execution of movement to the objective should consider the factors of metttc and whether it should be simultaneous or phased if cont act is made in the movement commanders should consider whethe r they wish to send forces fo rward to initiate the cordon isolation of the objective 574 although analysis of the mission va riables using metttc determin specifics unit typically establishes the outer cordon first establishes the inner cordon second and moves the search element to the objective last commanders should consider the valu of using the opposite technique of forming the cordons following rapid movement to the objective to gain surprise timing is when executing either technique is important the quicker these three ev ents are accomplished the less time personnel on the objectives have to egress find concealment or destroy materials or equipment position the reserve element 575 the reserve element or qrf is mobile force positioned in nearby area with multiple planned ground water or air routes to the objective area its mission is to aid the search and security elements if they require assistance or beco unable to achieve their purpose establish the cordon 576 there are two techniques for emplacing th actual cordon positions simultaneously and sequentially careful consideration must be given to both because each has advantages and disadvantages units establishi ng cordon position themselves to be able to block movement to and from the objective area this may be by observed fire but usually it will be by physically controlling routes cordon positions should be occ upied rapidly just prior to the s earch element reach ing the objective establishing the cordon during period of limited visibility increases move ment security but makes control difficult cordon positions once occupied will be detect ed by locals as they conduct their daily business 577 both the outer and inner cordon leaders must maintain situational understanding of not only their aos but also each others cordon and the progress of operations of the s earch element in doing so they can anticipate insurgent activity cont rol direct and indirect fires and achieve their task and purpose 578 the various positions of the outer and inner cordons may include vehicle mounted platoons or sections dismounted platoons or squads interpreters detainee security teams crowd control teams tactical psyop teams observation pos ts traffic control points or blocking positions host nation security forces military or police and aviation assets 579 the outer cordon usually focuses on traffic cont rol points and blocking pos itions while the inner cordon focuses on overwatching the objective and preven ting exfiltration or reposition of persons within the search area figure 55 shows the typical establishment of cordon and figure 56 shows the details of an inner cordon in an urban setting note the t echnique of assigning each bu ilding number to increase clarity and coordination between units chapter 5 514 fmi 3242 figure 55 typical establishment of an urban cordon figure 56 urban inner cordon search 580 search may be oriented toward people materi buildings or terrain it usually involves both hn police and military personnel it must be systematic action to ensure that personnel documents electronic data and other material are identified evaluated collected and protected to develop intelligence and facilitate followon actions 581 the tempo at which search operation is conducted should be slow enough to allow for an effective search while not so slow that it allows the insurg ent force time to react to the search search teams must consider return to an area after an initial search this can surprise and remove insurgents who may not have been detected or may have returned all searches should create pressure on insurgents offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 515 and sympathizers to not stay in the area but not inconvenience the local residents to the degree that they will collaborate with the insurgents 582 special laws regulate the search powers of military forces misuse of search authority can adversely affect the outcome of operations and future legal proceedings therefore all searches must be lawful and properly recorded to be of value these laws must be disseminated to the population to ensure understanding and compliance additi onal information on searches can be found in fm 30620 search teams must have instructions for three basic categories personnel 583 this includes both male and female and bot h persons of interest and other persons physical items 584 this includes weapons equipment documents computers and cameras information mediums 585 this includes data inside computers cameras and cell phones withdrawal 586 during this phase the unit may be the most vulnerable to mitigate risk commander may choose to relief in place staybehind elements to cover the withdrawal different routes and timing simultaneous or phased withdrawals search operations 587 search is the deliberate examination of pers on place area or object using soldiers animal or technological sensors to discover something or someone examples include searches of enemy or detained personnel military objective areas pe rsonnel or vehicles at checkpoint and lines of communication 588 search is conducted under wide variety of s ituations and for wide variety of purposes typically person is searched in order to find someth ing that is concealed place area or object such as car or desk is searched for something that may or may not be concealed for more on vehicle searches see chapter 7 communication objects such as letters books computers cell phones and other media and signaling tools are searched to discover information 589 during counterinsurgency the rules of engagement and various agreements between the host nation and us counterinsurgent forces often describe search situations and may limit search methods 590 during search it is important to keep the local population informed as much as tactically possible that search contributes to their safety and security this communication should begin during the actual search if possible but is often accomplished af ter the search by followup patrols followup patrols can not only aid in mitigating some of the negative aspects of the search but also see if missed individu als have returned to the sear ched area follow up patrols which include civil affairs teams or tactical psyop teams provide great capability to conduct consequence management assisting in the achievement of information engagement often through reinforcing themes and collecting information for development into intelligence chapter 5 516 fmi 3242 techniques 591 search can orient on people materiel buildings or terrain fm 3218 key basic considerations for conducting search in various includes searching individuals tactical site exploitation aerial searches searching subterranean areas search ing individuals detention of individuals tactical questioning and detainee processing individuals 592 any individual can be an insurgent auxiliary or member of the mass base however searchers must avoid mistaking all suspects for the enemy because there may be little or host nation personnel identification procedures identifying the correct person as an insurgent may be very difficult it is during the initial handling of individuals bout to be searched that the greatest caution is required during the search one member of search team always covers the other member who makes the actual search when females have to be searched every precaution is made to prevent violating local customs and mores if female searchers cannot be provided consider using the medic to search female suspects teams 593 soldiers conduct individual searches in search teams that consist of the following searcher 594 actually conducts the search th is is the highestrisk position security 595 maintains eye contact with the person being searched observer 596 supervises search and warns of suspicious behavior or actions methods 597 the most common search methods used to search an individual are frisk and wall searches third less common method used in very select situations is the strip search frisk search 598 quick and adequate to detect weapons evidence or contraband frisk search is more dangerous because the searcher has less contro l of the individual being searched wall search 599 affords more safety for the searcher by leaning the suspect against any upr ight surface such as wall vehicle tree or fence the search team places the subject in the kneeling or prone position if more control is needed to search an uncooperative individual strip search 5100 considered only when the individual is suspected of carrying documents or other contraband on his or her person this extreme search method should be conducted in an enclosed area and by qualified personnel when available search with sensors 5101 metal detectors or thermals can identify hidden items offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 517 population control 5102 three basic methods are used to control the population during search of an urban area assembly of inhabitants in central location restriction of inhabitants to their homes and control of the heads of the households assemble inhabitants in central location 5103 this method moves inhabitants from their homes to central area it provides the most control simplifies thorough search denies insurgents an opport unity to conceal evidence and allows for tactical questioning however this method has the disadvantage of taking the inhabitants away from their dwellings and possibly encouraging looting which in turn engenders ill feelings specific element m ust be identified to control th centralized inhabitants tpt using loudspeaker can facilitate assembly by giving specific instructions to the inhabitants of the search area restrict inhabitants to their home 5104 this technique prohibits movement of civilians allows them to stay in their dwellings and discourages looting the use of tpt to broa dcast stayindoors messages facilitates clearing the streets of civilians and aids in restricting their moveme nt the security element must enforce this restriction to ensure compliance the disadvantages of this method are it makes control and tactical questioning difficult and gives inhabitants time to conceal contraband in their homes control heads of households 5105 the head of each household is told to remain in front of the house while everyone else in the house is brought to one room the security element controls the group at the central location controls the head of each household and provides external security for the search team when dealing with the head of household it is important to explain the purpose of the search using an interpreter during the search the head of the household accompanies the search team through the house this person can be used to open doors and containers to facilitate the search it is im portant for the head of th household to see that the search team steals nothing houses or buildings 5106 the object of house search is to look for contraband and to screen residents to determine if any are guerrillas auxiliaries members of the underground or the mass base search party assigned to search an occupied building should consist of at least one local police officer protective escort for local security and female searcher if inhabitants remain in the dwellings the protective escort must isolate and secure the inhabitants during the search forced entry ma be necessary if house is vacant or if an occupant refuses to allow searchers to enter if the force searches house containing property while its occupants are away it should secure the house to preven t looting before us forces depart the commander should arrange for the community to protect such houses until the occupants return 5107 try to leave the house in the same or better cond ition than when the search began in addition to information collection the sear ch team may use digital cameras or video recorders to establish the condition of the house before and after the search ll sensitive material or equipment found in the house should be documented before it is removed to incl ude date time location the person from whom it was confiscated

detained by armed force under the law of war leaders and soldiers are personally responsib for detainees under their control mistreatment of detainees is criminal offense under the geneva convention and the 1996 war crimes act one of the most conspicuous violations of the geneva conve ntion is the unauthorized photography of detainees note avoid photographing detainees for nonmilitary or unofficial purposes doing so is unauthorized tactical questioning 5117 units recognize value of timely information nd intelligence during coin operations and thus may tactically question an insurgent on the objective units designate or construct detainee holding area ensuring detainees are unable to communicate in any manner leaders then conduct tactical questioning of priority detainees away from the group as they carefully gather facts and details required to establish consistencies or inconsistencies leaders then sort deta inees into those to be taken off target those without further value those longer of interest and those who require i mmediate battlefield interrogation by qualified personnel leaders wanting the ability to interrogate personnel duri ng potential operations should request and incorporate qualif ied interrogators into their missi on task organization to facilitate timelier information or intelligence necessity for soldier presence 5118 the terminology may change but the need for soldiers at the point of capture or point of detainment to ask questions remains trained inte rrogators are seldom on hand but soldiers are always present experiences from recent operations show that us forces using immedi ate tactical questioning techniques with their soldiers on target find important information that leads to actionable intelligence tactical questioning must not violate the law of war or any legal agreements sofas and coalition agreements typical questions should focus on discovering other nearby insurgents their intentions their equipment how they are financed or their means of support backtracking of route 5119 successful technique to determine where the individuals were before they came to the point of capture is to verbally backtrack their route the detainee is questioned as to when heshe arrived how heshe traveled to the point of capture foot or vehi cle and from what direction with general direction and means of travel the route can be developed using map the soldier asks leading questions to determine the route the detainee identifies significan t terrain features seen at specific locations such as rivers bridges key buildings or hills talking jogs the detainees memory gradually the detainee reveals their route where they originated considerations for successful tactical questioning follow offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 521 know your linguist use more than one to doublecheck the in tegrity and accuracy of information and re liability of linguist have basic knowledge of languages of detainees learn to identify physical behavior and posture resistance or defensive postures use multiple observers study your target before he becomes detainee on the objective study behavior values and interests of others in the oe before conducting tactical questioning consider placing uniformed linguist in the area of detainees and allow the detainees to communicate so that the uni formed linguist can collect in formation deception collection conduct questioning of one individual in separate room from other detainees so that if the detainee answers he maintains plausible deniability with members of his community commanders can prepare four to five questions related to information requirements these can be briefed as part of the patrol order and used by leaders during operations prepare tactical questioning plan for information that you believe the detainee may have aerial searches 5120 unmanned aerial systems uas close air support cas and rotary wing aircraft attack and

reconnoiter an assigned area or route in search of insurgent elements they may conduct snap checkpoints on roads to interdict insurgent mounted and dismounted movement when the element locates known or suspect ed element it can instruct attack aviation teams to engage the insurgent element or it may also choose to land and attack the enemy with dismounted assault this technique can be useful in open rural areas unless an air defense threat is present use of aerial patrols should be used in operations when fficient intelligence is availa ble to justify their use or friendly groundbased operations have become predictable to the insurgents such patrols are most effective when used in conjunction with ground operations 5122 in aerial or airground search operations helicopters insert

aircraft slight depression in or around group of small trees lone individual especia lly female in the area fresh cooked food with one attending the site fresh human feces in an area urban visual indicators 5130 visual indicators in an urban operational environment include sewer storm drain or utility grates or manhole covers disturbed soil in mature gardens offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 523 presence of flooring materials in homes businesses and other structures not under construction raid 5131 this is an operation to temporarily seize an area in order to secure information confuse an adversary capture personnel or equipment or to stroy capability it ends with planned withdrawal upon completion of the assigned mission jp 30 raid is conducted to destroy position or installation destroy or capture insurgents or equipment free friendly prisoners or seize possible intelligence and is followed by rapid withdrawal by capturing insurgents information can be developed into intelligence and confiscating contraba nd can contribute to improved public order and safety it is often used as part of strike operation for additional information on raids see fm 3218 and fm 32110 5132 raid in coin environment can differ from raid in conventional operations since the requirement for minimizing collateral damage may be significant factor in addition the time on the objective prior to withdrawal may be greater due to the requirement to conduct detailed as in all raids the success of the raid is based on accurate timely and detailed intelligence and planning considerations 5133 raids in coin could have lasting effects on the population and the insurgents specific considerations using elements of the mission variables are mission 5134 in coin raids target insurgents terrain intelligence or equipment missions are often executed in conjunction with form of cordon to prevent enemy escape into the population units should plan and rehearse according to target intelligence the commanders inte nt and the purpose of the raid enemy 5135 the objective of the raid may be valuable asset th insurgency is prepared to defend often the insurgent will have additi onal forces in the area positioned to aler t react facilitate egress or conduct combat effective reconnaissance can in crease awareness of these factors time available 5136 leaders should plan on allowing time for followon missions based on exploitable information also units should not stay on the objective too long techniques 5137 the minimum task organization for raid is headquarters section an assault element and security element depending on m etttc variables support element may be formed separately or integrated into the assault element additional specialty teams should consist of detainees or epws or casevac teams squads are typically too small to execute raids especially in urban aos figure 58 shows the concept of operations for typical raid chapter 5 524 fmi 3242 figure 58 example raid concept 5138 typical raid during counterinsurgency is executed in five phasesinsertion seal off the objective assault the objective secure the objective and wit hdrawal the following are some considerations for each phase insert 5139 insertion in coin is less difficult than infiltration especially in urban terrain due to constant civilian interaction units should us whichever method is most likely to achieve surprise deception such as disguising intent with other activities such as establishing checkpoint may be useful other considerations include insertion by airborne or air assault can enhance surprise launch the raid at an unexpected time or pl ace by taking advantage of darkness and limited visibility and moving over terrain that the enemy may consider impassable infiltration of sniper team before the raid avoid detection in rural areas through proper movement techniques and skillful camouflage and concealment to include taking advantage of natural cover of the terrain in urban areas avoiding detection is diffi cult therefore planning to delay detection or awareness of the objective is better th is can be accomplished by rapid movement or deception seal off the objective 5140 units should ensure insurgents can neither leave nor reinforce the objective in many cases this may be the decisive operation some considerations include all forces must understand and adhere to rules of engagement roe and escalation of force eof procedures establish an outer cordon to block avenues of approach into the objective areas support force provides initial overwatching fire for the assault force can be aviation use of aerial uas or aviation support to maintain observation as needed offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 525 assault the objective 5141 any insurgent element at or near the objective is overcome by surprise and violence of action some considerations include time the assault as close as possible to the execution of the cordon perform quick violent precise and audacious actions that focus full combat power at the decisive point breach rapidlyif possible the breach should be the first overt action of the raid if fires are used the support element either provides heavy volume of fire or precision fires dictated by civil considerations fires must be closely controlled to ensure precision using fcms marking and signaling on order or as planned fires are lifted and shifted to support the assault element by suppressing enemy fire from the objective secure the objective 5142 units secure the objective by detaining insurgents controlling personnel on or near the objective clearing the objective of other threats conducting and setting conditi ons that prevent insurgent fires from outside the objective withdraw 5143 as planned the unit withdraws from the objective area support force may provide suppressive fires for withdrawal or provide escort away from the objective commanders consider use of stay behind measures or devices to monitor back fill of insurgents or population suppor t for the insurgency raid in coin environment may modify phase five and withdraws at the discretion of the commander ambush 5144 an ambush is form of attack by fire or ot her destructive means from concealed positions on moving or temporarily halted enemy fm 390 ambush patrols are combat patrols with missions to establish and execute ambushes to harass or destroy insurgents or capture personnel and equipment for further information on ambush see fm 3218 and fm 32110 by eliminating insurgents an ambush contributes to improving public order and safety key civil security subtask it may be used in clearholdbuild operations or strike operations types 5145 the two types of ambushes follow point ambush involves elements deploy ed to support the attack of single killing zone an area ambush involves elements deployed as multiple related point ambushes categories 5146 based on the amount of preparation time ambushes can be hasty or deliberate hasty ambush is an immediate action drill of friendly force with little or information on the insurgent force the discovery of nearby insurgent element usually moving provides limited opportunity for friendly force to has tily occupy position from which to ambush the guerrilla deliberate ambush is planned operation against sp ecific insurgent fo rce sufficient detailed information of the enem force such as the size na ture organization armament equipment route direction or movement time line is available to permit the detailed planning of an ambush chapter 5 526 fmi 3242 characterizations 5147 an ambush is characterized as either near or far these are based upon the proximity of the insurgent to friendly forces near ambush is an ambush with the assault element within hand grenade distance of the kill zone less than 50 meters close terrain such as urban jungle and heavy woodlands may require this positioning it may also be appropriate in open or mountainous terrain in rise from the ground ambush far ambush is an ambush with the assault elem ent beyond reasonable assaulting distance of the kill zone beyond 50 metersthis locati on may be appropriate in open terrain offering good fields of fire control measures 5148 the ambush commanders control of all elements at the ambush site is critical this includes the initial occupation time in position execution nd withdrawal commanders should develop control measures for the occupation execution fire control measures fratricide and collateral damage prevention especially if assault element or nonlinear ambush initiation of assault and actions on the objective tactical site exploitation considerations 5149 wellplanned and wellexecuted ambushes are usef ul offensive technique to employ against insurgents it is an effective technique to interdict and disrupt movement of insurgent forces within an area specific considerations using elemen ts of the mission variables are mission 5150 tactical units should attempt to ambush insurgents in manners they least expect and in ways that minimize compromise by and risk to the hn populace it is difficult for us forces to emplace an ambush in populated areas due to size of units appearance and insurgent presence amongst the population enemy 5151 commanders ensure ambush plans are flexible as to allow adjustment and initiative at the ambush site troops and support available 5152 small ambush party is generally more practical but likely less secure the size of the party depends on the size of the unit targeted the estimated insurgent strength in th area and an analysis of operational risk in coin some popular units used to execute ambushes are small capture teams scts small observation teams sots and small kill teams skts most scts sots and skts in an urban ao conduct area ambushes techniques 5153 an ambush in coin has five basic phases planning organizing moving occupying and executing offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 527 plan 5154 key steps in planning deliberate ambush include determine the target and purpose of the ambush kill or capture determine the advantages and disadvantage for executing the ambush during limited visibility amongst the population or vicinity of sensitive sites determine if the ambush will be point ambush or an area ambush select the appropriate ambush formation determine if the ambush will be near ambush or far ambush determine communication requirements determine weapons requirements and limitations determine compromise contingency plans determine what if any special equipment is required this includes money for damage compensation or the need to video or photograph the area for documentation withdrawal organization 5155 an ambush patrol is organized in the same manner as other combat patrols to include headquarters an assault element support element nd security element if an ambush site is to be occupied for an extended period double ambush forces may be organized to allow continuous coverage one ambush force occupies the site while the other conducts routine maintenance rests and eats at the objective rallying point or alternate and supplementary concealed loca tions they alternate on command usually after more than eight hours movement 5156 deliberate ambushes should include an objective rally point orp units should plan movement to the orp from the orp to the ambush site and back and withdrawal from the ambush site is back to the orp or to another final destination in addition leaders should plan movement that allows the unit to enter the ambush site from the rear and avoid moving into the kill zone or across the suspected route of the enemy force to be ambushed in coin the presence of people near the ambush positions requires carefully planned movement units should use maps imagery video humint and aerial photographs to analyze the terrain and hn population if possi ble units conduct ground reconnaissance and avoid selecting obvious ambush sites surprise is even more difficult to achieve in these areas an ambush site should provide clear fields of fire concealed positions canalization of the insurgents into the killing zone little or cover and concealment in the kill zone covered routes of withdrawal to enable the ambush force to break contact and avoid pursuit egress route for th insurgent force defensible position if compromised occupation 5157 in coin especially urban environments it can be extremely difficult to occupy ambush sites or positions uncompromised due to locals as rule the ambush force occupies the ambush site at the latest possible time permitted by the tactical situation and the amount of site prep aration required this not only reduces the risk of discovery but also reduces the time soldiers must remain still and in position techniques 5158 some techniques include using staybehind elements chapter 5 528 fmi 3242 alternate infiltration methods such as hn security force vehicles subterranean urban or subt erranean structures rural feints deception firing positions 5159 the unit typically moves into the ambush site from the rear security elements are positioned first to prevent surprise while the ambush is being establis hed position automatic and precision fire weapons so each can fire along the entire kill zone if this is impo ssible then ensure that automatic weapons have overlapping sectors of fire the point is to cover the entire kill zone and to achieve large volume of near simultaneous concentrated fires into the kill zone fires that can inflict maximum damage on the insurgent the unit leader then selects position where he can see when to initiate the ambush claymores explosives and m203 grenade launchers are examples of what may be used to cover any dead space left by the automatic and precision fire weapons all weapons are assigned sectors of fire to provide mutual support multiple positions also provide interlocking or overla pping support the unit leader sets time by which positions are to be prepared kill zone 5160 if soldiers must enter the kill zone to place booby traps specialpurpose munitions or expedient devices they must remove any tracks or signs that ght alert the insurgents nd compromise the ambush under strict roe units may choose to record the ambush using video cameras execution 5161 clear target engagement criteria is all that is needed to execute an ambush audible and visible signals such as whistles and pyrotechnics must be ch anged often to avoid establishing patterns or alerting the insurgents to friendly actions or positions signal by the security force to alert the patrol leader to the in surgents approach may be given by handandarm signals radio as quiet voice message transmission of prearranged number of taps or by signaling with the pushtotalk switch or field telephone when there is danger that wire between positions will compromise the ambush signal to initiate the ambush given by the patrol leader or designated individual may be shot or the detonation of mine s or other types of explosives the ambush should be initiated with mass casualtyproducing weapon claymore machine gun or similar system signal for lifting or shifting fires may be given by voice command whistles or pyrotechnics all fire stops immediately so the assault can be made before the insurgent can react signal for withdrawal may also be by voice command whistles or pyrotechnics surprise must be achieved or the attack is not an ambush surprise allows the ambush force to seize and retain control of the situation units achieve surprise by careful planning preparation and execution c oncealment and fire discipline are also critically important formations 5162 whether independent or part of an area ambush point ambush is positioned along the expected avenue of approach of the insurgent force the selection of the type of ambush formation is important because it determines the volume of c oncentrated fire required to isolate trap and destroy the insurgents the formation to be used is determined by carefully considering possible formations and the advantages and disadvantages of each in relation to terrain c onditions of visibility for ces weapons and equipment ease or difficulty of control force to be attacked and overall combat situation types of ambush formations include linear lshaped zshap ed tshaped vshaped triangle and box offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 529 linear 5163 in linear ambush the attack element is deployed generally parallel to the insurgent forces route of movement road trail and stream this positions th attack element parallel to the long axis of the kill zone and subjects the insurgent for ce to heavy flanking fire figure 59 an advantage of the linear formation is its relative ease of control under all conditions of visibility the size of the force that can be trapped in the kill zone is limited by the area the attack element can effectively cover with highly concentrated fire the force is trapped in the kill zone by natu ral obstacles mines booby traps or expedient devices and direct and indirect fires figure 59 linear formation ambush 5164 disadvantage of the linear forma tion is the chance that lateral di spersion of the force may be too great for effective coverage the linear formation is ppropriate in close terrain that restricts insurgent maneuver and in open terrain where one flank is re stricted by natural obstacles mines booby traps specialpurpose munitions or expedient devices similar obstacles and casualty producing systems can be placed between the attack element and the kill zone to provide prot ection from insurgent counter ambush measures when destruction ambush is deployed in th is manner access lanes are left so the force in the kill zone can be assaulted the line formation can be effectively used in rise from the ground ambush in terrain seemingly unsuitable for ambush lshaped 5165 the lshaped formation figure 510 is variation of the linear formation the long side of the attack element is parallel to the kill zone and delivers flanking fire the short side of the attack element is at the end of and at right angles to the kill zone and delivers enfilading fire that interlocks with fire from the other leg chapter 5 530 fmi 3242 figure 510 lshaped formation ambush 5166 the lshaped formation is flexible it can be tablished on curving stretch of trail near stream or at sharp bend in trail or stream when appropriate fire from the short leg can be shifted to parallel the long leg if the insurgent force attempts to assault or escape in the opposite direction in addition the short leg prevents escape in that direction or reinforcement from that direction positive means of controlling fires such as aiming stakes are needed to prevent the fire from one leg hitting soldiers positioned on the other leg other 5167 other traditional ambush formations that are hi ghly metttc dependent and usually better for rural operations include the following zshaped formation 5168 the zshaped formation is variation of the lform ation the attack force is deployed as in the lformation but with an additional side so that the formation resembles the letter z the additional side may serve to engage force attempting to relieve or reinforce the guerrillas restrict flank prevent an envelopment of the ambush force tshaped formation 5169 in the tshaped formation the ttack element is deployed across and at right angles to the route of movement of the hostile force so that the attack element and the target form the letter t this formation can be used day or night to establish purely harassing ambush it can be used at night to interdict movement through open hardtoseal areas vshaped formation 5170 the vshaped attack element is deployed along bot h sides of the insurgent route of movement so it forms v care is taken to ensure that neither group fires into the other the vformation is suited for open terrain but can also be used in the jungle triangle formation 5171 the triangle is variation of the vformation th at can be employed in three ways the most common technique is the closed triangle the attack ement is deployed in three groups positioned so that they form triangle an automatic weapon is placed at each point of the triangle and positioned so it can be shifted quickly to interlock with either of the others elements are positioned so their fields of fire overlap mortars may be positioned inside the triangle when deployed in this manner the triangle ambush becomes small unit strongpoint that is used to interdict night movement through open areas when insurgent offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 531 strategy is likely to be from any direction advantages include ease of control allround security and guerrillas approaching from any direction can be fired on by at least two automatic weapons disadvantages include the requirement for an ambush force of platoon size or larger to reduce the danger of being overrun by large guerrilla force one or more legs of the triangle may come under guerrilla enfilade fire and lack of dispersion particularly at the points increases danger from guerrilla mortar fire box formation 5172 the box formation is similar in purpose to the triangle ambush the unit is deployed in four elements positioned so each element becomes corn er of square or rectangle advantages and disadvantages are much the sa as the triangle formation variations 5173 common ambush variations during counterinsurgency operations include baited trap 5174 variation of the area ambush is the baited trap ambush central kill zone is established along the insurgents avenue of approach point ambushes are established along the routes over which units supporting or reinforcing the insurgent force will have to approach the in surgents in the central kill zone serve as bait to lure relieving or reinforcing insurgent units into the kill zones of the outlying ambushes items such as infrastructure sensitive equipment cach and security measures can be used as bait spider hole 5175 this type of point ambush is designed for open areas that l ack the cover and concealment and other features normally desirable in good ambush site this technique is effective in less populated rural areas or urban areas with subterranean concealed in spider hole type of covered and concealed foxhole the attack element is deployed in the formation best suited to the overall situation soil is carefully removed and positions expertly camouflaged this am bush takes advantage of the tendency of patrols and other units to relax in areas that do not appear to favor ambush the chief disadvantage of this technique is that the ambush elements vulnerability if compromised sniper operations 5176 sniper operations are effective for both insurgent and counterinsurgent in the coin environment snipers if employed correctly are coin for ce multiplier and provide the commander an immediate means to enter the insu rgent decision cycle 5177 small kill teams skts small observation teams sots and small capture teams scts differ by task manning and equipment skt focuses on destroying of insurgent elements scts focus on the capture of those elements sots are for reconnaissan ce in coin more may be gained by capturing than by killing the insurgent however skts can give commanders deterrent to insurgent activity 5178 sniper teams sometimes as part of skts sots or scts are employed in populated urban areas or large rural areas with adequate fields of fire for mission success all three teams employ specific point and area weapons systems all three also rely on redundant communications marking materials detailed infiltration plans exfiltration mutu support security compromise tingencies and engagement criteria considerations 5179 sniper employment in coin must be carefu lly considered the infiltration or exfiltration of snipers skts and scts must be meticulously pl anned with the understanding of the habits behaviors and density of the local population besides the basic mission of precision fires and surgical elimination of individuals they are valuable for isr collection route and area security augmentation countersniper operations and counter mortar or rocket operations compromise and contingency planning is critical chapter 5 532 fmi 3242 to sniper employment commanders base this detailed planning on thorough analysis of the mission variables with specific attention to terrain and civil considerations specific cons iderations using elements of the mission variables are mission snipers must have clear engagement criteria and thorough understanding of the roe engagement criteria must be refined so the indi vidual sniper can make the correct engagement decision while the target is engageable once an engagement area and sniper position are identified then leaders should determine mutually supporting position for security team to occupy current and planned locations of sniper t eams should be tracked by the headquarters responsible for the area in which the snipers are operating often this means designating their locations as fire area that can be tracked by all forces operating in the area to prevent fratricide enemy sniper positions need to be defendable in case of compromise by the enemy terrain and weather snipers small kill teams small observation teams and small capture teams can aid commanders in denying terrain and freedom of movement to insurgent elements while providing security to sensitive or critical sites in both rural and urban areas troops and support available in addition to robust communications capability commanders resource these elements with linguists medical personnel rveillance equipment and sustainment resources the qrf is typically involved in the detailed planning of these operations and can be deployed forward to minimize reaction time skts sots or scts are taskorganized with sniperqualified personne l or squad designated marksman weapons squads and specialty skills personnel they may be comprised of sniperqualified individuals or squad designated marksman techniques 5180 all sniper operations in coin should consider sn iper positions sniper secu rity sniper insertion and sniper extraction positions tactical leaders must continually analyze the oe for potential sniper team overwatch positions leaders reconnoiter to determine the suitab ility of potential positions leaders reconnoiter to determine the suitability of potential positions when employing sniper teams leaders ensure each position provides mutual support against threat the insurgent often will engage from areas of passive support and where he has sense of security detailed reconnaissance and accu rate knowledge of the oe allows leaders to recognize advantages and disa dvantages of different positions and types of areas there are two basic areas for sniper positions in an urba n environmentresidential areas and industrial areas both areas include the us of elevated positions or gr ound level positions roofs are not always the best place to operate since roofs are often not the highest location in the area and are often wide open with little cover successful position selection techni ques in coin are rent uninhabited dwellings or other structures teams are careful not to establish pattern or expose the property owner to the insurgency owners may compromise the snipers offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 533 positions in locally occupied homes teams however must consolidate the family in one part of the house with security element when exfiltrating the residence compen sation should be provi ded to the owner staybehind opportunities teams may have the opportunity to achieve surprise if insurgents attempt to return to areas after another counterinsurgent unit has conducted an operation security sniper teams should move with security element squad or platoon whenever possible this allows the teams to reach their area of operation faster and safer than if alone the security element also protects snipers during operations wh moving with secur ity element snipers follow these guidelines the leader of the security ement leads the sniper team snipers must appear to be an integral part of the security element to do so each sniper carries his weapon system in line with and cl ose to his body to hide the weapons outline and barrel length snipers also conceal from view all sniperunique equipment optics and ghillie suits sniper uniforms must be the same as that of security element members snipers and element members maintain proper intervals and positions in the element formation infiltration the key to sniper inf iltration is undetected occupation of hide positions an insertion may be as simple as drop off in close proximity nd moving dismounted to the position it can be as complex as conducting cordon and searchknock and leaving staybehind team planning considerations for insertion include the missi on variables and detailed understanding of the terrain and people planning considerations includestree tlights barking dogs nightlife establishments insertion vehicle noise hmmw v engines vehicle ramps hitting the ground and local nationals who may sleep on their roof or outdoors during hot summer months exfiltration exfiltration is just as important snipers do not want to compromise position you may want to use again in the future the amount of time spent in sniper position is dependent on the situation sniper teams should have preplanne d emergency exfiltration route to safe zone known by all supporting elements the snipers can withdraw dismounted during hours of limited visibility to designated rally point where the qrf can retrieve them some units use quick reaction force qrf as means of reinforcement or emergency extraction as well as maintaining or regaining contact with insurgents engaged by the snipers when properly employed the us sniper teams can contribute significantly to the fight by overwatching key areas serving as an economy of force eliminating insurgents and causing uncertainty within the insurgents for further information on conventional sniper employment techniques see fm 32111 coin patrols 5181 patrol is detachment sent out by larger unit to conduct combat or reconnaissance operation patrol may be fire team squad platoon or compan conventional patrolling doctrine applies to counterinsurgency opera tions but some modifications mu st be made to account for the insurgents activities and the operational environment aggressive patrolling in an area greatly reduces the insurgents freedom of movement disrupts operations and weakens their influence on the local population furthermore patrolling becomes more significant in c ounterinsurgency operations because of the difficulty in locating and identifying insurgent forces this section discusses the important role patrols play in defeating the insurgent force there are two types of patrolling in coin operations reconnaissance chapter 5 534 fmi 3242 patrols and combat patrols patrols are an integral part of clearholdbuild operations strike operations and prc operations considerations 5182 specific considerations using elements of the mission variables for coin patrols are mission 5183 leaders must brief all patrol members as to the task and purpose of the operation every coin patrol has task and purpose that is nested within one of the loes 5184 leaders must plan patrol routes carefully and coordinate in detail with higher lower and adjacent units to include host nation security forces aviation elements fires isr elements and reserve forces all patrols conduct rehearsals and patrol brief at minimum enemy 5185 smallunit patrols are more effective than larger unit patrols against insurgent activities this is because they can cover more territory than large unit and are more di fficult to track and predict this keeps the insurgen t off balance terrain and weather 5186 patrol leaders must learn and know the routes terrain and weather implications on the hn population the counterinsurgent and the insurgent for example urba n patrol techniques will differ from rural patrol techniques troops and support available 5187 communication between patrol vehicles riflemen nd higher headquarters is essential within the patrol radios data transfer devices voice commands and visual signals may be used vehicularmounted radios and data systems are usually the best mean s for communication within the patrol and to higher headquarters aircraft may be used to relay radio messages for long distance patrol communication blue force tracker text messages or single channel tacsat provide excellent means of maintaining long haul communications 5188 tactical units may be involved in patrolling in one of three ways patrol as complete unit provide subordinate unit for patrols as directed by higher or send out patrols to support their own operation normally the planned action at the objec tive determines the type of the patrol usually categorized as either combat or reconnaissance patrols may be mounted or dismounted or combination civil considerations 5189 patrols are often the easiest way for tactical units to engage the hn population across multiple loes mounted patrols versus dismounted patrols 5190 patrols may be mounted or dismounted mounted patrols allow greater coverage of distances than dismounted patrols but sacrifice interaction with the populace and the opportunity to conduct more effective information engagements mounted patrol s can operate in insurgent controlled areas too dangerous for dismounted patrols wh ile carrying more or heavier equi pment weapons and ammunition 5191 dismounted patrols can be physically demanding and patrol members must be in good shape additionally contact with insurgents in close combat is physically demanding the patrol leader ensures patrol members carry only mission essential equipment offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 535 5192 mounted patrol is prepared in the same manner as dismounted patrol leaders ensure vehicles are mechanically fully mission capable and properly supplied with fuel oil ammunition and water drivers and other personnel receive the same pa trol brief as dismounted patrol members 5193 mixture of mounted and dism ounted patrolling can provide gr eater flexibility the dismounted element can interact with the population the mounted element provide increased firepower communications and casevac urban patrols 5194 the basics of patrolling remain the same in both urban and rural environments however the differences between the urban and the rural environmen t require specific patrol considerations urban areas have high population density and patrols must be prepared for population related incidents the population may interact with the patrol in many ways such as asking for medical attention or demonstrating against the presence of the patrol itself basic urban patrolling consideration include while contact with insurgents may happen contact with elements of the population is certain if available armored vehicles should be ready to rapidly reinforce urban patrols to provide additional firepower at least one soldier in each squad or team should be dedicated to scanning the rooftops and upper level windows actions at halt must include 360 degree secur ity soldiers should seek cover and face out cover in an urban environment may be light pole building corner or even parked car urban patrols should thoroughly scan the far side of all open ar eas since insurgents will use them to achieve standoff if contact is likely then the patrol should move by bounds moving by bounds with one element overwatching another element is used in urban terrain just as in rural terrain react to contact in an urba n environment often includes the basic elements of cordon and search once contact is made return fire is initiated and simultaneously the area should be cordoned to prevent the insurgents escape combined patrols 5195 the combined patrol is patrol conducted with host nation security forces and us units they are an important piece in in creasing the legitimacy of the hn government and improving the skills of the hn security forces mutual support 5196 commanders consider mutual support when taskorganizing forces and assigning areas of operations mutual support is support units render each other against an emy because of their assigned tasks their position relative to each other nd to the enemy and their inherent capabilities jp 102 mutual support has two aspects supporting range and supporting distance supporting range 5197 supporting range is the distance one unit may be geographically separated from second unit yet remain within the maximum range of the second units weapons systems fm 30 it depends on available weapons systems and is normally the maximum range of the supporting units indirect fire weapons for small units such as squads sections or platoons it is the distance between two units that their direct fires can cover effectively if one unit cannot effectively or sa fely fire in support of the other unit they may be out of supporting range even though thei r weapons have the requisite range supporting distance 5198 supporting distance is the distance between two units that can be traveled in time for one to come to the aid of the other it is function of terrain and mobility distance enemy capabilities friendly capabilities and reaction time duri ng counterinsurgency operations co mmanders should always consider chapter 5 536 fmi 3242 supporting distance units maintain mutual support when one unit can draw on another units capabilities for support types of patrols 5199 there are two types of patrols reconnaissance patrols 5200 this type of patrol collects in formation and confirms or dispr oves the accuracy of information previously received they are us ed to locate insurgent units and base camps to reconnoiter specific locations locate leaders and gather intelligence reconnaissance pa trols provide the commander with timely accurate information of in surgents the population and the rrain this information is vital in making tactical decisions leaders must ensure that pattern is established that would allow an insurgent force to ambush reconnaissance units reconna issance patrols are further classified into two types route reconnaissance patrols 5201 these are form of reconnaissance that focuses along specific line of communication such as road railway or cross country mobility corridor it provides new or updated information on route conditions such as obstacles and bridge classifications insurgent and civilian activity and traffic patterns along the route route reconnaissance includes not only the route itself but also all terrain along the route from which the insurgent could influence the friendly forces movement zone reconnaissance patrols 5202 theses are conducted to obtain information on enemy terrain people and routes within specified zone the commander may re quire information of an extended area or may desire information of several locations within an area zone r econnaissance patrol secures this information by reconnoitering the area maintaini ng surveillance over the area or by making the coordinated area reconnaissance of designated locations within the area area reconnaissance patrols 5203 this is conducted to obtain information on specific location or small specific area usually known or suspected position or activity an area rec onnaissance patrol secures this information by reconnoitering the location or by mainta ining surveillance over the location 5204 in addition to reaching the objective without di scovery reconnaissance patrol also tries to conduct its reconnaissance or surveillance without being discovered stealth patience and maximum use of concealment are mandatory reconnaissance patrol must be prep ared to fight to protect itself 5205 continual technological improve ments have significant impact on reconnaissance abilities sensors and video cameras can be emplaced to be remotely monitored computer and electronic technology must be leveraged to extract informa tion from wide array of technological systems day and night patrols 5206 these use about the same techniques as other patrols the main differences are day reconnaissance requires greater use of concealment th patrol is more likely to be seen than at night and usually will not be able to move as close to the objective night reconnaissance requires stealth sounds carry farther at night and reduced visibility usually requires closer approach to the objective offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 537 combat patrols 5207 in counterinsurgency operations the term security patrol has often been used however this is still combat patrol combat patrol provides security and harasses destroys or captures enemy troops equipment and installations combat patrol also co llects and reports information whether related to its mission or not combat patrols in counterinsurgency include raids ambushes security saturation and satellite patrols regardless of the name all count erinsurgency combat patrol s have the general mission of seeking out and attacking targets of opportunity raid and ambush patrols 5208 raids and ambushes were discussed earlier in chapter 5 security patrols 5209 the difference between security patrol and raid or ambush patrol is that combat activity is not the primary mission of the security patrol this is tr ue even if combat is expected during the patrol security patrols normally seek to control critical roads and trails maintain contact between villages and units provide security for friendly forces provide s ecurity in rural areas and interdict insurgent routes of supply and communication saturation patrols 5210 this is when units use numerous combat patrols to saturate an area of spected insurgent activity by moving over planned and coordinated routes wh ich are changed frequently to avoid establishing patterns saturation patrols are extremely effective against insurgents use of saturation patrols results in the following denial of an area to an insurgen t force as it seeks to avoid contact with the saturation patrols ability to harass insurgent forces opportunity to discover insurgent forces chance to gain an intimate knowledge of the area of operations chance to reassure the local population that the government provides protection and security satellite patrols 5211 this patrol technique adds depth to patrol deters ambushes and provides patrols with maneuver element on enemy contact figure 511 show s satellite patrol moving through builtup area 5212 the satellite patrol uses base unit to control smaller units or satellites that leave and return to the base unit the advantage of this technique is th unpredictability to the enem of the route size locations and the patrols overall axis of advance satellite patrols are given either an area or an axis of movement as with all other patrols they should have specific task and purpose units have specific requirements including organization 5213 at minimum the patrol has one base and one satellite unit size 5214 the size of the base unit and satellites is metttc dependent normally satellite unit consists of either squad or fire team all units must be able to defend themselves until reinforcements arrive command and control 5215 the base unit is under the direct control of the nior leader and must have radio communications with each of the satellites units this facilitates control and actions if contact is made the base unit sets the pace and maintains the general direction of the patrol controlling multiple small satellite patrols is difficult and requires an experienced lead er and excellent communications chapter 5 538 fmi 3242 figure 511 satellite patrol movement movement 5216 all units must know the overall route and if possible left and right boundaries both the base unit and the satellite units move in ways to confuse the enemy as to the patrols actual axis of advance standard movement techniques are still used satellites move away from the base unit for limited periods of time to inspect potential ambush s ites dead spaces parallel roads or other assigned missions the time that the satellite is separated from the base unit should be prescribed by the patrol l eader prior to departure training 5217 units may experience initial difficulty with this technique because of the dispersed unpredictable and seemingly random movement of the satellite patrol s to properly execute the technique units must train and practice actions on contact 5218 the unit in contact reacts normally all other units move towards the unit in contact the satellite patrol leader coordinates as needed their routes actions and linkup patrol debrief 5219 one of the best ways to turn information into intellig ence is to conduct patrol debrief following every patrol when the patrol is over the unit has not completed its mission the leader must ensure that all the information collected during the patrol is turned over to the appropriate staff section for evaluation offensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 539 additionally all patrol members must be debriefed to collect any information not already identified the unit must also conduct an afteraction review of the entire mission from start to finish the unit must record what operations were executed correctly and what coul d have been done better this information must be passed on so that others can learn from the operation finally unit members must account for and clean their equipment in order to be ready for the next operation the debrief at minimum should include specifics on the 5 ws who what when where why and how photos or sketches answers to priority intelligence requirements pirs and other information requirements actionable intelligence recap of route reports of enemy contact engagements conducted who engaged the guerrilla force what concerns have the hn population brought to the patrols attention what promises did the us make as result of these concerns tips or actionable information for intelligence noteworthy observations propaganda graffiti and so on changes in the hn population which leaders can use to improve understanding of community dynamics these changes may be detected in peoples attitudes toward coalition forces local infrastructure civil leadership local organization civil institutions section iiiother lines of effort offensive operations enable and complement the othe r lines of effortsupport hn security forces restore essential services provide support to economic and infrastructure development provide support to governance and conduct information tasks without the increased security resulting from offensive operations units may not be able to accomplish any signi ficant tasks in the other loe support host nation security forces 5220 the preferred method is to conduct all offensive operations combined with hn security forces to improve their tactical and technical competence and develop their professionalism this technique also takes advantage of both forces st rengths and capabilities especially the hn security forces language skills and cultural knowledge an example of this is combined cordon and search of suspected insurgent village where us forces establish the outer cordon and th hn security forces conduct the actual search of the village support to governance 5221 in coin tactical units must consider how offensive operations can be used to assist their efforts to strengthen the local government for instance unit might conduct combined cordon and search based on tip provided by the local mayor assist in securing polling sites during local or national elections or set the conditions for completion of government project units must remember that all offensive operations support one or another groups political agenda eliminati ng one insurgent group may lead to another group filling the power vacuum chapter 5 540 fmi 3242 restore essential services 5222 tactical units must consider how to incorporat essential service projects as complementary portion of their offensive operations for instance delivering water to neighborhood without clean drinking water can be useful in several ways for example it may afford the opportunity to gather intelligence for an upcoming raid reconnoiter for cordon and search serve as deception for the emplacement of sniper or allow the covert positioning of force for later attack units must be careful about too closely linking projects and offensive operations to ensure that they do not inadvertently decrease the populations support support to economic and infrastructure development 5223 tactical units conducting coin must consider how offensive operations can assist in stimulating the economy of their local area for instance raid on an insurgent group that has been extorting money from the local factory to finance their operations may dramatically increase the capital available to conduct repairs to the factory this in turn creates jobs in th village as in essential rvices projects the economic project may serve as means to gather intelligence for an upcom ing raid reconnoiter for cordon and search serve as deception for sniper team or be used to position forces for an attack units may decide not to conduct an offensive operation due to the economic impact of the operation conduct information engagement 5224 all tactical unit offensive operations must cons ider and incorporate information engagements options range from simple explanation of the purpose of raid to the head of the household to handing out leaflets as part of the outer cordon to using tactical psyop teams to keep the population from interfering with operations to attendi ng city council meeting to explai n recent raid in each endeavor the counterinsurgent force must us information tasks to increase th hn governments legitimacy isolate the insurgent and garner the support of the population summary offensive operations are cr itical part of counterinsurgency cam paigns and help host nations establish civil security and civil control key operations include search and attacks cordon and searches searches raids ambushes and coin patrols pecially in the clear phase of clearholdbuild operation offensive operations can s upport other loes such as support host nation security forces and restore essential services commanders conduc t offensive operations in coin with constant considerations of the population in support of the seven coin loes fmi 3242 61 chapter 6 defensive considerations in counterinsurgency defensive attitude is almost always to be deprecated and only under certain special circumstances is it to be recommended the operations of regular troops in such warfare small wars must never be allowed to stagnate the troops must be up and doing striking their adversaries when these attempt resistance hunting them down when they shun combat col c callwell small wars 1896 insurgents will not passively let count erinsurgent forces disrupt their plans and isolate them from the populace they w ill attack counterinsurgent forces when they feel that they have good chance of success additionally the insurgents will choose targets with an eye towards re ducing the legitimacy of the established government the conduct of defens ive operations in coin is very much like that in conventional defense however in coin the counterinsurgent must be concerned with securing the hn population hn government and infrastructure this chapter will examine defensive operations defensiv operations as they apply specifically to establishing civil security and civil contro l defensive operations as they apply to the other lines of effort and security operations section ioverview tactical formations conduct three types of defensive operations in every environmentarea defense mobile defense and retrograde at the tactical level c ounterinsurgency units focus mostly on executing an area defense although there may be instances where mobile defense or retrograde are appropriate area defense 61 this type of defensive operation concentrates on denying enemy forces access to designated terrain for specific time rather than destroying the enemy outright fm 30 in counterinsurgencies both the insurgency and the counterinsurgent are vying for the support of the population as if it were terrain the focus of the area defense is on retaining terrain where the bulk of the defending force positions itself in mutually supporting prepared positions in count erinsurgencies commanders choose an area defense to secure the population by living among the population employing the seven coin lines of effort examples of an area defense in counterinsurgencies are combat outpost next to city market permanent squad position at an electrical plant and checkpoint near police station mobile defense 62 this type of defensive operation concentrates on the destruction or defeat of the enemy through decisive attack by striking force fm 30 the mobile defense focuses on defeating or destroying the enemy by allowing him to advance to point where he is exposed to decisive counterattack by the striking force mobile defense ope rations are less common in counterin surgencies because insurgents rarely mass however strike operations can be useful in destroying guerrilla bases another example of mobile defense at the tactical level is the use of quick reaction forces to exploit tactical intelligence retrograde 63 this type of defensive operation involves organized movement away from the enemy fm 30 the enemy may force these operations or commander may execute them voluntarily chapter 6 62 fmi 3242 in counterinsurgencies retrograde operations ar generally conducted intentionally after unit is transitioning responsibility of an area of operations to host nation security force or relief in place with another us unit major counterinsurgency operations 64 in clearholdbuild operations defensive operations are fo remost in the hold phase although operations occur during all three phases these operations help to establish and maintain civil security and civil control enabling units to set conditions acr oss the seven coin loes defensive operations in the hold phase deal primarily with securing the hn popul ation and isolating insurgents from their support 65 in strike operations and populace and resource control opera tions defensive operations are conducted in concert with stability and offensive opera tions in strike operations units conduct defensive operations to establish bases where they can c onduct offensive operations in prc operations units conduct defensive operations to prot ect the populace and its materiel res ources from insurgents to deny insurgents access to the populace and materiel resources and to identify and elimin ate the insurgents their organization their activities and influence while doing so section iicivil security and control tactical units conduct most defensive operations under either the establish civil security or establish civil control lines of effort in coin operations especially clearholdbuild operations the most common method that tactical units employ to secure the population is the establishment of bases units use site selection techniques to decide where to put bases and focus s ecurity certain defensive actions like counterambush counteried and countersniper clearly contribute to increased civil security or increased civil control as they reduce violence against hn and us forces as well as the hn population throughout units must use appropriate protection measures site selection 66 brigades battalions and companies routinely possess enormous aos during counterinsurgencies some as large as us states within these large aos there can be hundreds or thousands of essential service structure governmental infrastructure economic assets population centers and important leaders that may be targets for the insurgency there are many techniques to conduct security operations at the tactical level tactical units need framework to decide how best to secure the hn population and hn infrastructure 67 it is not possible to protect every asset and every point eventually the insurgent will attack primary goal is to protect those vital assets and poi nts to such degree that if they are attacked the damage to them is minimal while the insurgents losses are heavy the carverp vulnerability prioritization matrix is method for units to help the hn government in deciding what hn assets to protect carverp riskvulnerability prioritization matrix 68 this matrix considers targets within the hn population government and infrastructure it allows leaders to identify target vulnerab

each of the criteria and if needed identify the contro l and mitigation for each assessment transfer this information to the matrix and sum the values this sum represents the assessed desirability of the potential target from the insurgents perspective the higher the number the more likely the insurgent will attack the target step 4facilities category 613 using this sum identify the facilities category figure 64 both the identification and the prioritization of vital assets and key points should be the responsibility of the host nation however us commanders should participate in the planning process fo r assets within their area of operations to assist in this process it is useful to have simple method of categorizing the facilities to be considered figure 64 shows suggested thod for categorizing facilities step 5prioritization 614 compare this target to others to determine priority criticality criteria criticality refers to asset value this is the primary cons ideration in

3242 67 protection 615 protection is the preservation of the effectiveness and survivability of missionrelated military and nonmilitary personnel equipment facilities inform ation and infrastructure deployed or located within or outside the boundaries of given operational area jp 30 the elements of protection are the same in concept between conventional operations nd coin however one important aspect is that counterinsurgents are responsible for protecting cal citizens by ensuring that the local population is secure counterinsurgents increase their effectiveness in all other ta sks and gain allies who will provide information and cooperation this increases the security of tactical units technique considerations during counterinsurgencies 616 individual and small groups of soldiers leaders nd civilians are targets fo r the insurgents this targeting not only includes lethal operations such as attacks against an individual but also nonlethal operations such as kidnapping subversion or character attacks established individual protection measures remain the first line of defense basic siteprotecti on operations building block to secure the population include the following static posts or bases 617 each static post has fulltime detachment at the location of the vital asset the size of the detachment is determined by the size of the vital asse t the threat and the distan ce to the nearest available reserve consideration must be given to conserving manpower by employing surveillance devices and intruder alarms observation post 618 although an op has too little combat power to s ecure the vital asset it can immediately call for support vehicle patrols 619 vehicle patrols may be used to give periodic cove rage to many low category vital assets timings for patrols must be varied to prevent the likelihood of ambush and to retain the element of surprise patrols should be strong enough to deal with anticipated threats and they must be supported by local reserve foot patrols 620 foot patrols also give periodic coverage to low category vital assets foot patrols will be particularly valuable at vital assets where movement is congested observation is difficult and concealment is easily afforded to enemy forces such as those in busy city blocks airmobile patrols 621 airmobile patrols may be used as supplement to vehicle and foot patrols they will be valuable for checking vital assets over extended distances or where access is difficult random antiterrorism measures 622 one means to disrupt insurgent attack plans is to implement random antiterrorism measures rams these consistently change the look of s ecurity posture to defeat surveillance attempts and introduce uncertainty to sites overall security plan thereby making it difficult for the enemy to accurately predict friendly ac tions examples of rams are moving jersey barriers vehicular barriers class iv objects or objects in other classes to route traffic around base starting random security patrols in the surrounding blocks chapter 6 68 fmi 3242 installing floodlights that operate at random times changing guard shift at random times changing access time for entry points changing access procedures at random changing the way personnel are searched on random basis observing surrounding areas with uas or jlens at random times armor protection 623 vehicle and personnel armor protection saves lives and makes it more difficult for an insurgent to conduct lethal attack however the added weight will cause vehicles especially the engine to wear out much faster than normal individual body armor also contributes substantial weight to the soldier and degrades his maneuverability and endurance hardening hardening vehicles or static sitesincreases protection makes an insurgent att ack more difficult uses natural or manmade materials to pr otect personnel equipment or facilities concrete or expedient barriers sandbags walls shields berms or some other type of physical protection protects resources from blast direct and indirect fire heat radiation or electronic warfare concrete and expedient barriers is intended to defeat or negate the effects of an attack combat identification 624 cid is the process of attaining an accurate characterization of detected objects in the oe sufficient to support an engagement decision jp 30 these objects all of which are potential targets must be quickly discriminated as friendly enemy or neutral th is is necessary to ensure that enemy forces can be destroyed friendly entities can be identified and prevented from becoming fratricide victims and neutral entities can be identified to prevent collateral damage common combat identification techniques include the use of glint tape infrared lights and strobes heat sources vs17 panels flares counterinsurgency bases 625 us counterinsurgency forces operate within host nation and must have base from which to operate typically bases try to secure the population and isolate the insurgency from its support base is locality where operations are projected or s upported jp 102 all bases must be securable and defendable bases vary in accordance with the size of the unit occupying the base and the mission of the units using the base all types of bases require clear command relationships in counterinsurgencies forward operating bases fobs combat outposts and patrol bases are three types of bases forward operating bases 626 normally each ao has at least one fob the size of the area its physical characteristics and the number and size of the units operating within the area often require additional operating bases the fobs established by brigade or battalion are often semipermanent and provide deployed units with command control and communications facilities sustainment personnel systems support staging areas defensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 69 and intelligence activities they provide units with relatively secure locations from which to plan and prepare for operations during counterinsurgency operations they also aid in limiting insurgent mobility nearby and providing secu rity to the local population 627 some differences exist between brigade and ba ttalion fobs brigade fo bs are larger than battalion fobs and they provide rear location for elements of battalions such as forward support companies battalion fob is normally staffed with the minimum personnel needed to operate and provide security it should also maintain two methods for sustainment road and either air or water combat outposts 628 this is reinforced observation post that can conduct limited combat operations fm 390 in counterinsurgency operations combat outposts are often company and platoonsized bases inside of insurgentinfluenced territory they represent cornerstone of counterinsurgency operations in that they are means to secure the population located in strategically important areas combat outpost provides security in its immediate area and direct contact with the local populace these benefits are unavailable from remote bases although the strategy carries with it potential downsides in terms of increased protection concerns and limiting flex ibility the bases provide huge increase in overall security in the area 629 properly placed combat outposts often increase overall security emplacing company or platoon combat outpost in sector is deliberate operation requiring detailed planning and additional logistical support the unit must first decide the task and purpose of the outpost by analyzing their sector purpose 630 outposts may be employed to secure key lines of communication or infrastructure to secure and coopt the local populace to gather intelligence to assist the government in restoring essential services to force insurgents to operate elsewhere priorities of work 631 for the initial establishment of combat outposts priorities of work need to be considered some considerations include ensuring the position is free of noncombatants removing them from the area of operations before occupying the position selecting key weapons and crewserved weapon positions to cover likely mounted and dismounted avenues of approach clearing fields of fire prepare loopholes aiming stakes sector stakes and target reference point markings construct positions with overhead cover and camouflage identifying and securing supra and subsurface avenues of approach such as rooftops sewers basements and stairwells constructing barriers and emplacing obstacles to deny the enemy any access to streets underground passages and buildings and to sl ow his movement in general integrating barriers or obstacles with key weapons improving and marking movement routes between positions as well as to alternate and supplementary positions stockpiling ammunition food firefighting equipment and drinking water chapter 6 610 fmi 3242 patrol bases 632 when patrol halts for an extended period it takes active and passive measures to provide maximum security by occupying patrol base patrol base can be permanent or temporary situations 633 common situations that require establishing patrol base include requirement to cease all move ment to avoid detection requirement to hide the unit during lengthy detailed reconnaissance of the objective area need to prepare food maintain weapons and equipment and rest after extended movement need to formulate final plan and issue orders for actions at the objective requirement for reorga nization after patrol has infiltrat ed the enemy area in small groups need for base where several consecutive or concurrent operations such as ambush raid reconnaissance or surveillan ce patrols can be conducted purposes 634 in counterinsurgency operations collocating patrol bases in population centers enables combined forces to deny the insurgent access to the local population to influence and assist the local government to provide security to help host nation security forces provide their own unaided security methods of establishment 635 patrol bases in the current fight can be blished using either of two methods the same priorities of work described for combat outposts apply also to patrol bases move in with the indigenous population the advantages of the first method are that soldiers will have more direct contact with the local government the locals will identify combined forces with the emerging host nation government and the construction will be less intensive the disadvantages are that soldiers may live in unsanitary conditions the mass base or auxiliary may inform insurgents about out going patrols with relative ease attacks on the base will have collateral damage considerations and houses are often not suited for defense build new patrol base although more isolat ed from the population new patrol bases are usually on chosen ground and therefore easier to defend additionally they are far more resource and personnel intensive during constructi on it is generally advisable to set aside detailed planning time before sending combined force to occupy the terrain planning considerations for base defense 636 regardless of the ongoing operation the type of base or the location of base the characteristics of the defense do not change the best technique for base defense is the perimeter defense terrain 637 proper evaluation and use of the terrain in the area is essential to hold down the number of additional forces required for ba defense key terrain factors to consider include the following use of the terrains natural defensive characteristics use of artificial obstacles to enhance the terrains natural defensive characteristics control of all roads and waterways leading into the base control of military lines of communications and civilian commerce routes defensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 611 control of land areas surrounding the base to range beyond that of enemy mortars and rockets host nation security forces 638 the base commander should consider the integration of host nation security forces in the overall base defense effort particular emphasis is on inte gration of host country fo rces in patrol and populace control activities both host and thir d country forces provide local secu rity for their own units however to ensure maximum benefit all such local plans should be coordinated and integrated with the base master defense plan communication 639 control is the key to successful base defe nse to achieve the necessary control communication capability must be established between the base defense operations center and sector commanders and between the sector commander and his bunkers towers and reserve bunkers or towers within each section can communicate laterally within the sector and flank bunkers of one sector can communicate with flank bunkers of adjacent sectors sustainment 640 depending on the mission and status of the battalion the type of transport available the weather and the terrain resupply may be by air or ground the availability of landing zones and drop zones protected from the enemys observation and fire is the main consideration if selecting organizing aerial resupply protection 641 all units in the base area are responsible for preserving its fighting potential protective measures reduce the probability and the effects of damage caused by hostile action responsibility for the conduct of protective measures is assigned to fire fighting units chemical units medical units and other units in addition all units assigned to the base are task ed to conduct activities such as dispersion camouflage blackout field discipline and use of shelters security 642 early warning of pending actions ensures the base commander time to react to any insurgent threat outposts patrols ground surveillance and c ountermortar radar milita ry working dogs teams and air reconnaissance and surve illance provide early warning in formation provided by civilians and actions of indigenous personnel near the base are excellent indicators of pending enemy actions allround security is essential defense in depth 643 alternate and supplementary positions observati on posts and mutually supporting strong points in front of the base forward defense area extend th depth of the defense the commander plans fires throughout the defensive area up to the maximum range of available weapons portable obstacles may be placed around critical targets during re duced visibility to disrupt the emys plan and add depth to the defense chapter 6 612 fmi 3242 patrols 644 base defense operations to counter small groups of enemy forces include aggressive frequent patrolling by squadand platoonsize forces to detect capture or destroy small groups of insurgents dogs if available may be used to add security and additional detection ability to patrol operations populated areas near the base are searched nd surprise checkpoints are established along known or suspected routes of insurgent movement maximum use of offensive action 645 since the objective of the base defense is to ma intain secure base the defender maximizes the use of offensive actions to engage enemy forces outside the base on initial occupation of the base site friendly forces take offensive actions to destroy emy forces in the immedi ate area the area commander employs patrols raids ambushes air attacks nd supporting fires to harass and destroy any remaining enemy force once the enemy has been cleared from the area the base can be defended by smaller force the base commander maintains constant liaison with major tactical unit commanders in the area to stay abreast of efforts to remove the threat mutual support 646 defending forces are positioned to ensure mutual em ployment of defensive resources that include fires observation and maneuver elements mutual support between defensive elements requires careful planning positioning and c oordination because of the circular asp ects of the base area surveillance obstacles prearranged fires and maneuvers are used to control gaps allaround defense 647 in defensive planning the base commander must be prepared to defend ag ainst enemy attack from any direction plans are sufficiently flexible and reserves are positioned to permit reaction to any threat base defense forces are assigned primary and lternate positions and sectors of responsibility all personnel are assigned duty stations or shelters responsiveness 648 attacks against base may range from longrange sn iper mortar or rocket fire to attacks by suicide bombers or major forces the insurgent has th advantage of deciding when where and with what force he will attack the defender positions his forces and plans fires and moveme nt so he can respond to the widest possible range of enemy actions the defende r prepares plans to include counterattack plans and rehearses evaluates nd revises them as necessary quick reaction force 649 qrf is designated organization for any immediate response requirement that occurs in designated area of operation fm 3906 qrf increases the overall flexibility of base defense and is available for contingencies usually battalion will maintain platoon sized qrf combat outpost construction considerations 650 building combat outpost is complex task that must be well thoughtout with clear vision from the beginning for expansion and development it is always best to have trained engineers either military or civilian construct the base heavy consideration must be given to using local companies or personnel in constructing the base this will benef it the local economy however it will also increase the security risk figure 65 shows typical combat outpost construction in iraq the following considerations are critical defensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 613 protection 651 protection involves enemy and security considerations enemy coverage of dead spaces creation of safety zone to prevent rocket attacks emplacement of ieds along routes observation figure 65 typical us combat outpost design security position

milita ry van containe rs milvans use milvans for bunkers portable housing and work units electrical 653 when initially developing combat outposts envision the proper wiring and layout of zone power grids consider using generators for backup consider hiring contract electricians and construc tion workers which can assist greatly in the development of this system plumbing field sanitation is paramount to the health nd safety of personnel on the combat outpost bulk water from locally drilled wells is typically the main source of water fuel fuel stands are required for storing and distributing bulk fuel assets counterinfiltration and early warning 654 the key to an effective combat outpost defense lies in identifying the threats among the most dangerous threats are infiltrators th best defense against these threat s is the population that surrounds the combat outpost as described in chapter 1 interna lly displaced people merchants or shopkeepers are potential sources of intelligence about insurgent attacks on bases sold iers from the combat outpost must talk to their neighbors base defense 655 this includes both normal and emergency military measures taken to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of enemy attacks or sabotage the base commander is responsible for the local defense of the base and provision of resources for other activities within the overall area of operations the base defense force commander executes base defense operations op erations are conducted to ensure the continued effectiveness of base facilities and units to fu lfill their missions the area commanders responsibilities include protecting the resources of his area from interruptions caused by enemy activities figure 66 shows possible organization of base command defensive

destroy the cap this would free the viet cong to resume regul ar operations on september 14 1965 the cap wa s conducting normal night patrols leaving fort page with onl 6 marines and 12 vietnamese soldiers forgetting that t he caps presence was responsible for the lull in viet cong activity the squad leader lowered americ an security from 2 marines to 1 marine per guard shift this left vietnamese soldiers almost completely in charge of fo rt page security viet cong sappers infiltrated that night and killed 6 vietnamese soldiers and 5 ma rines reserve squad from nearby marine company firebase arrived on scene after the n va battalion withdrew the viet cong thought they had won the next morning the marine division commander asked remaining marines if they wanted to stay to soldier they did at night the marines and viet namese soldiers doubled their security and viet cong operations came to complete stop in march 1967 the viet cong and the north vietnamese army pla nned another attack on fort page the cap had reliable intelligence about the attack and sent ut two patrols to provide early warning fearing repeat of the 1965 attack marine commanders ordered the cap to retire under threat of court martial the marine squad leader asked his squad what they thought one said theyre not getting this fort theyre not getting this ville im not leaving here matter what the marines stayed when one of the cap patrols killed the n va battalion scout the rest of the battalion withdrew fort page was never again threatened by the time the marines withdrew from binh nghia the vietnamese soldiers were patrolli ng in buddy teams on their own counter ambush 661 ambushes are basic tactic commonly used by gue rrilla forces as such counterinsurgent forces must continually operate under the understanding that they will encount er an ambush counterinsurgent forces must therefore develop specifi c local procedures to both react to and to counter ambushes typical complex insurgent ambushes involve ieds small arms fire mortars and sniper fire considerations during counterinsurgencies 662 the goal for tactical units is to identify and attack or disrupt the ambush force before it can initiate the ambush additionally if the insurgents kill zone can be identified before the insurgents are in position then the ambushers can be attacked as they move into position any counterinsurgency unit that is ambushed must immediately return fire and assa ult the ambushers specific considerations include avoid massing personnel or vehicles prepare reaction plan that in cludes assaulting the ambushers ensure only part of the element is in kill zone at the same time usually means dispersion maintain control of your immediat tactical space within 100 meters where insurgents are likely to establish ambushes establish counter ambushes emplace sniper teams or other forces to overwat ch likely insurgent rout to ambush sites chapter 6 618 fmi 3242 mounted procedures 663 the following procedures may be used when reacting to an ambush while mounted immediately return fire and assume covered position if possible if you are in the kill zone leave rapidly if you are not in the kill zone use fire and maneuver to destroy the enemy if possible scan your area and prepare for additional attacks especially an ied an enemy moving to flank an enemy moving to engage you with rpgs or antitank weapons report contact to higher hq follow directions of the vehicle or convoy commander countering ieds 664 an improvised explosive device ied is devi ce placed or fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive lethal noxious pyrotechnic or incendiary chemicals and designed to destroy incapacitate harass or distract it may incorporate military stores but it is normally made from nonmilitary components jp 3072 ieds are key components of insurgent ambushes see also fm 390119 considerations during counterinsurgency 665 between 2001 and 2007 us forces were attacked by over 81000 ieds ieds are the most dangerous and effective weapon system faced by coa lition forces in iraq they have inflicted more casualties than all other weapon systems combined techniques 666 wide usage destructive nature and the resulting overall impact on military operations makes the ied significant factor for tactical units for this reason leaders at all levels must consider ieds at tactical level unit has three major t echniques for defeating ieds they are attack the network defeat the device train the force attack the network 667 this method is used to defeat the complex network of ied makers financiers emplacers suppliers and others before the ied is emplaced it includes actions and activities against networks designed to interrupt the enemys chain of ied activities by identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities and enabling offensive operations this effort is accomplished th rough intelligence surveillance reconnaissance counter bomber targeting device technical and forensic exploitation disposal of unexploded and captured ordnance persistent surveillance directed toward defeat of the enemys capabilities and the execution of information tasks which includes command and control warfare military deception and especially informa tion engagements search operations and operations to kill or capture network members provide the final cr itical step in the process it is better to find 100 detonators in cache than to deal with 100 ieds on the battlefield 668 several analytical tools can be used by tacti cal units to detect members of an ied network and synchronize all information gained through various sources they are part of the targeting process which is discussed in chapter 4 by correctly synchronizing intelligence at all levels leaders can better apply combat power to attacking the ied network the three major tools are imagery and geospatial intelligence analysis pattern analysis and link analysis defensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 619 imagery and geospatial intelligence analysis 669 analysis of an ao where ieds are employed would be incomplete without the use of imagery and geospatial intelligence imagery products include both aerial photography and satellite imagery in many cases tasked aerial reconnaissance platforms including uass respond directly to the commander thus ensuring timely and focused data collection pattern analysis 670 units use pattern analysis to determine many of these patterns and predict potential hazards pattern analysis is the ability to observe selection of events or actions over period of time in defined location or area it is used to discover likely patterns or similarities that lead to logical conclusion that the action or event will occur again in the same location the two most common forms are coordinates register and patternanalysis plot sheet considerations 671 for ied analysis commanders and staffs us pattern analysis to determine the types of ieds locations where ied incidents have occurred characteristics of the ied sites sizes of the ieds distance from road mosque other natural or manmade objects type of terrain the threat prefers other obstacles used in conjunction with ieds routes to and from the ied sites worn paths other distance from the ied site to the possible cache types of munitions and whether one or more types were used whether the ieds used explosively formed penetrators efps whether the ieds used shape charges other ied main components such as main charge explosive casing materials around the explosives initiators methods of initiation such as command wired radio controlled victim operated timed coordinates register 672 coordinates register shows cumulative events that have occurred within the ao and focuses on the where of an event figure 69 which is an ex ample of coordinates register is also known as an incident map chapter 6 620 fmi 3242 figure 69 coordinates register patternanalysis plot sheet 673 patternanalysis plot sheet focuses on the time nd date of each serious incident that occurs within the ao the rings show days of the month the segments show the hours of the day as shown in the plot sheets legend the char t shows the actual events it identifies each by using an alphanumeric designation that directly corresponds to the legend us ed on the coordinates register the legend icons can be changed to show other types of incidents such as vehicleborne ieds vbieds commandwired ieds cwieds and radiocontrolled ieds rcieds figure 610 shows an example patternanalysis plot sheet note list daily entry number on calendar in j ournal crossreference each incident to the incident overlay defensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 621 figure 610 example patternanalysis plot sheet link analysis 674 link analysis is used to show contacts associ ations and relationships between persons events activities organizations the two most effective types of link analysis tools are the activities and association matrixes and the link diagram activities and association matrixes 675 using the activities and association matrixes the analyst can pinpoint the optimal targets for further intelligence collection identify key personalities within an organization and considerably increase the analysts understanding of an organization and its structure the ac tivities matrix is used to determine connectivity between individuals and any organization event address activity or any other nonpersonal entity the association matrix is used to determine existence of relationships between individuals figure 611 shows an example activities matrix and figure 612 shows an example association matrix chapter 6 622 fmi 3242 figure 611 example activities matrix link diagrams 676 often the link analysis is the most effective method to show the connections between people groups or activities an example of link diagram is shown in figure 613 the analyst can easily determine from the diagram that knows b and that b knows c and d b is suspected of knowing and c knows d b and although the same information could be shown on matrix it may be easier to understand when shown on link analysis diagram as situations or investigations become more complex the ease in understanding link analysis diagram becomes more apparent in almost all cases the available information is first shown and analyzed on both types of matrixes which are then used to construct link analysis diagram for further analysis defensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 623 figure 612 example association matrix figure 613 example link diagram chapter 6 624 fmi 3242 defeat the device 677 in order to enhance commanders freedom of ma neuver for safe operati ons actions taken to discover ieds and activities reduce the effects of ied detonation at the point of attack by defeating the device they include rapid identification development acquisition and delivery of capabilities for route clearance device neutralization explosive detection military explosive ordnance disposal and vehicle and personnel protection additional considerations should address new technologies to in clude electronic warfare capabilities two techniques for defeating the device are dismounted patr ols and route clearance dismounted patrols 678 dismounted patrols are especially useful in countering ieds use of dedicated counter ied patrols especially along main supply routes is an important technique to reduce the threat of ieds along those routes great way to counter ieds is to eliminate the popular support or acquiescence to the ied cell through regular engagements if th at is not possible then identif and neutralize the kill zones route clearance 679 route clearance teams rcts are us ed to thwart ambushes clear natural or manmade obstacles and detect ieds rcts are comprised of engineers eod personnel mechanical devices and specialized robotics to increase standoff from the ied threat the purpose of r oute clearance is to eliminate concealment for ieds and munitions caches and to conduct the systemic detec tion and deterrence sweeps along the cleared routes 680 route clearance missions consist of the followi ng two phases rightofway clearance and route maintenance and sweep operations right of way clearan ce is the removal of rubble debris berms holes trenches vegetation and trash from the medians and shoulders of routes rightofway clearance can be conducted with special equipment such as an uparmored bulldozer cleaning the right of way in this manner serves multiple purposes ieddetection devices become more effective it is more difficult for the enemy to emplace ieds and all count erinsurgent forces can more easily identify ieds should the enemy attempt to emplace them again another technique is to use by local national labor which employs the population units should then conduct deliberate rout reconnaissance identify and record the location of manmade objects buried pipes and cables and investigate suspicious areas route maintenance and sweep operations are when units conduct systemic random detection sweeps of the cleared areas and progress to detection and deterrence sweeps along th cleared route visual detection sweep should focus on changed conditions train the force 681 mitigating the effects of enemy ied employment through comprehensive training of our forces puts troops in the field who are situationally aware and who know their gear this includes but is not limited to multiechelon and multicomponent training training on new gear in formation management and dissemination strategic communications doctrinal and institutional training changes and unit m ission rehearsals at service combat traini ng centers all soldiers need to be trained in basic techniques actions while mounted and dismounted actions individual techniques 682 counteried operations at the soldier leve l revolve around several principles see gta 9010046 for information on combined arms impr ovised explosive device defeat operations units need to know control and identify when something is out of place in their area of operations insurgents adapt their techniques based off of counterinsurgent unit actions these principles are the following maintain an offensive mindset develop and maintain situational awareness stay observant avoid setting patterns maintain 360degree security defensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 625 maintain tactical dispersion use blast and fragmentation protection use technology such as elect ronic warfare capabilities thermals or other devices look for the triggerman mounted actions 683 mounted action includes actions before encount ering an ied and actions after encountering an ied precautionary actions while mounted 684 consider the following while conducting mounted operations alert all crewmembers of possible ied and its location never stop vehicle within 50 meters of suspected ieds the driver should speed up or back away to quickly move through the danger area minimum open area safe distance is 300 meters watch for approaching vehicle borne ieds vbieds all

follow the directions of the vehiclesquad leader countersniper or sniper defeat 690 the first step in countering snipers is for commanders leaders and soldiers at all levels to be aware of the sniper threat plans to counter the snip er threat and protect friendly forces from insurgent snipers must be integrated into all counterinsurgent operations during the early stages of planning enemy snipers in counterinsurgency environment vary from welltrained sniper teams to individuals taking shots of opportunity us counterinsurgency forces must be prepared for both 691 figure 614 shows the three types of snipers an insurgent can employ identifying the type that is on the battlefield can aid commander in deciding what countermeasure to use defensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 627 figure 614 types of snipers considerations during counterinsurgencies 692 sniper operations have the same effect in insurg encies as they do in conventional warfare but the purpose is different for example in conventional wa rfare sniper targets leaders in order to cause confusion on the battlefield and disrupt operations in an insurgency sniper will still target leaders but more for use in propaganda that can be used afte r successful attack add itionally he can create the attitude that the area of his operations is not secure and the host nation govern ment is powerless to stop him since the sniper has the in itiative leaders must enforce compliance with the countermeasures implementing countermeasures halfheartedly invite s casualties from snipers who can wait hours for the moment when units guard is down us forces have two categories of sniper countermeasures active countermeasures and passive countermeasures ach has its place depending on the metttc mission variables active countermeasures 693 active countermeasures seek to detect and destro the sniper before he can fire or engage and neutralize him after he fires observation posts and observers 694 observation posts should have access to powerful spotting telescopes medi um power binoculars night observation devices thermal if possible and remote control closed circuit cameras additionally laser countermeasure should be employ ed such as laser protective glasse s binoculars with laser filters and indirectview optics to protect observers additionally many electronic detection devices are available to aid in the detection of snipers such as acoustic devices once detected snipers can then be neutralized or forced to withdraw observers can maintain constant surveillance over potential sniper positions and detect snipers as they attempt to move into position for shot constantly scanning an area for the minute movements made by welltrained sniper is exhausting therefore personnel on static op duty should rotate frequently unmanned aerial systems uas and rotary wing aircraft should be integrated into an op plan to give it depth patrols 695 constant reconnaissance and s ecurity patrols around units pos ition hinder sniper from getting into firing position undetected small patrols are usually more effective than large ones moving sniper who has been discovered by patrol is at great disadvantage since he lacks the firepower to fight long engagement small night reconnaissance patrols us ing night vision devices can be very effective in disrupting and interdicting sn iper reconnaissance patrols should move by covered and concealed routes to good observation poi nts should stop and observe and then should move to another position the patrol routes and times must vary and reaction for ce or supporting weapons must be ready if the patrol makes contact variation of the ambush patrol is the staybehind ambush small ambush element moves as part of larger patrol and occupies its position without being observed it then observes its kill zone which may be very large if the element has snip er team with it and enga ges enemy snipers as they attempt to move into position currently skts scts or small observation teams sots conduct ambushes of likely sniper positions chapter 6 628 fmi 3242 united states sniper teams 696 us sniper teams can be very effective counter to enemy snipers not only do they have expert knowledge of sniping and likely enemy hiding pl aces they can normally engage enemy snipers or marksmen at greater range than the enemy sniper can engage us forces their precision fires are also much less likely to cause civilian casualties than dozens of rounds from other weapons return fire and maneuver 697 before unit encounters an enemy sniper the unit must not only understand the rules of engagement but also wargame the rules of engageme nt to ensure the authorized level of responses are sufficient although the roe and the tactical situation determine the response ideally authorization should include the ability to respond with fire from all the units light weapons if unit can determine the general location of sniper it should return suppressive fire while maneuvering to engage the sniper from close range this is not always successful because welltrai ned sniper often has route of withdrawal already chosen fire without maneuver will not be successful in defeating snipers obscurants 698 projected smoke that builds quickly is good re sponse to protect unit from further casualties if engaged by an enemy sniper it greatly limits his ab ility to acquire targets the closer the smoke is placed to the snipers location the more effective it is if the location of the sniper is unknown or cannot be reached by projected smoke smoke cloud establishe d near the unit can be ffective in reducing the snipers chances of hitting target and llowing unit to conduct first aid and casevac passive countermeasures 699 passive countermeasures prevent the sniper from acquiring clear target and prevent his fires from causing casualties passive countersniper measures are rarely successful by themselves if passive measure are the only measures enacted they may also create siege mentality and pass the initiative over to the sniper they include limiting sniper exposure 6100 if soldiers limit their sniper exposure they can marginalize snipers operations some examples include using covered and c oncealed routes avoiding li ghted areas at night movi ng tactically while using traveling or bounding overwatch and staying away from doors and windows wearing protective equipment 6101 other sniper protective measures include wear of the kevlar helmet protective eyewear and body armor systems these should be worn any time soldiers are exposed to potential sniper fire this decreases the snipers casualtyproducing target area which limits his effectiveness using armored vehicles 6102 whenever possible move around in the urban area in protected vehicle with as little exposure as possible avoid opensided cargo vehicles requisition or improvise vehicular armor against smallarms fire for all unarmored vehicles th is technique limits units ability to interact with the population and should be used as last resort erecting screens and shields 6103 use simple canvas or plastic screens to make dangerous alleyway or street crossing safer for foot traffic adapt screens on windows to allow vision out while hiding personnel inside use moveable concrete barriers to provide pr otection for personnel at static positions use common items such as rubblefilled 55gallon drums nd sandbags to provide cover defensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 629 denying enemy use of overwatching terrain 6104 either occupy overwatching terrain with friendly forces or modify it to make it less useful to an enemy sniper pull down likely hiding places clear bushe s and rubble board or brick up windows pile up earth and rubble in front of buildings to block lines of sight for snipers ensure all actions are in accordance with the laws of war technique considerations 6105 countersniper actions have two parts find and eliminate the sniper find the sniper 6106 once unit determines it has sniper or sniper team in its ao the unit should implement countersniper immediate action drills allowing the enemy sniper to fi ght another day is mission failure first the unit must find the sniper or the sniper team techniques for detecting sniper consist of identifying likely sniper locations focusing observation on sniper movement and seeking audible and visual signs backtracking which involves integrating the following techniques is used to find the sniper identify likely sniper locations 6107 sniper is lineofsight asset the larger the sniper kill zone the closer or the higher he must position himself to cover it smaller sniper kill zones create for narrow if not linear line of sight in such cases the sniper will always choose position that offers th at offers line of sight such as road or alley or maybe inside building shooting through window doorway or other opening focus observation on sniper movement 6108 snipers always plan infiltration and exfiltration routes after identifying possible sniper locations unit commander can focus observation on these routes and deny sniper the ability to reposition snipers operate slowly with calculated movements to avoid detection the movement the sniper makes may not be easily detected units should look for movement that does not fit the environment seek audiblevisible signs 6109 audiblevisual indicators help find snipers based on the snipers firing shot actually firing weapon is snipers greatest moment of risk it offers the best opportunity to locate him or his team the acoustic light and heat signatures associated with the projection of the bullet from his rifle are his greatest vulnerabilities the muzzle flash can be detected with infrared sensors out to kilometer often the muzzle flash and the blast can throw dust into the air ac oustic sensors can detect muzzle blast from several hundred meters to more than kilometer the bullet s shock wave is minisonic boom this noise caused by the bullet travelling faster than the speed of sound can sometimes be heard more than kilometer away backtrack sounds sights and angles 6110 in city the backtracking proce ss is complicated by buildings that obstruct the view of the snipers position backtracking is challenging but it is how you relate shot angles kill zones movement and audible and visible signs to help you find the sniper experience and training play major role in accurate backtracking chapter 6 630 fmi 3242 eliminate sniper 6111 once spotted the enemy sniper mu st be killed or forced to surre nder to be successful in this goal the unit must rapidly locate fix and finish an active enemy sniper to ultimately kill or capture him avoid the kill zone 6112 figure out his kill zone and stay out of it unit may also want to eliminate or at least reduce his targets if unit removes its targets the unit curtails mission success the sniper will need to move or at least adjust his position to remain effective maneuver rapidly 6113 when contact is made the onscene commander needs to rapidly calculate the disposition of his forces the quick reaction force qrf and adjacent friendly forces and factor in timespace considerations to determine how to neutralize the thr eat because of the fleeting nature of the sniper it is often preferable for the onscene commander to begin to maneuver against the hostile sniper with an unengaged portion of his own force rather than wait for qrf consider sniper hunting with another sniper 6114 throughout history many units engaged in urban combat often employed direct and indirect supporting arms close air support or large numbers of ground forces to counter urban snipers however the russian and german forces of world war ii found that the best solution to sniper threat was the employment of their own snipers in countersniper role advantages to using trained sniper to counter enemy snipers include the relative ease of movement over the urban battlefield of sniper team versus that of larger ground formation countersnipers who know the habits and modus operandi of their enemy counterparts the ability to deliver precision fire and the resulting reduction in collateral damage or civilian and friendly casualties confirm that enemy sniper is neutralized 6115 in this context neutralization means that the sniper is killed or captured dead or captured enemy sniper besides ending that threat can be valuable source of intelligence countering driveby shootings 6116 driveby shooting is the firing of small arms by an occupants of vehicle as the vehicle drives past an area followed by the vehicles imme diate departure of the area this is an effective technique for an insurgent because it allows rapid infiltration and ex filtration requires little logistical support has chance of success and has little chance of resulting in decisive engagement any structure or location near roadway is target for driveby shooting usual targets for driveby shootings are vulnerable easily escapable spots ttackers avoid welldefended locations considerations 6117 establishing static checkpoints or closing roads in the vicinity of high threat area often prevents further driveby attacks along specific avenue of pproach however the insurgents are not eliminated and they will then look for new or different ways to attack timely and accurate reporti ng by subordinate units can allow higher headquarters to integrate uas and rotary wing aircraft to track vehicles after driveby attack this will open insurgents up to targe ting counterinsurgent forces defensive considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 631 techniques 6118 one technique is to conduct m obile checkpoints if effective they can disrupt the ability of insurgents to transport weapons in vehicles random snap checkpoints may encourage driveby shooters to look elsewhere for targets section iiiother lines of effort in counterinsurgency defensive operations are conduc ted to prevent insurgents from attacking security forces attacking the population or disrupting actions along the seven coin lines of effort this section discusses special defensive operation considerati ons for the remaining five lines of effort support host nation security forces 6119 the success or failure of counterinsurgency falls heavily on the competence and capability of host nation security forces when insurgent forces are stronger than the host nation security forces insurgents focus on the destruction of weak host nation units to control terrain and consolidate gains through deliberate attacks on host nation base combined combat outpost combined patrol base or combined command post in this situation extra defensive efforts need to be applied to give time for the host nation security forces to develop when host nation forces are stronger than insurgent forces insurgents attempt to legitimize host nation security for ce operations through attacks focused on lessening security then defensive considerations n eed to be applied to enable host nation forces to increase the efficiency of their operations support to governance 6120 this line of effort relates to the host nation gove rnments ability to gather and distribute resources while providing direction nd control for society by disrupti ng the host nation governments ability to conduct these functions an insu rgency can delegitimize the govern ment an example is the local security of key judge who has been instrumental in issuing verdicts ag ainst criminal activities of insurgents in order to prevent his assassination defensive efforts may need to be applied so that government can conduct its basic functions which include controlling military and police activities establishing and enforcing the rule of law public administration justice judiciary system prosecutorde fense representation and corrections property records and control civil information historical cultural nd recreational services an electoral process disaster preparedness and response restore essential services 6121 common insurgent technique is to create dissatisfied population by preventing the host nation from meeting the populations basic needs an easy way for an insurgent to do this is to disrupt the population from receiving sewa ge water electrical power and dical services units should apply defensive considerations for any attempt by combined or host nation security forces to build or restore those services for example poorly planned generator drop allows an insurgent to attack and destroy the generator now instead of restoring an essential service and reinforcing the legitimacy of the host nation government as intended the insurgent has demonstrated the weakness of the host nation government instead us and host nation security forces need to secure protect and prevent insurgents from influencing projects that restore essential services chapter 6 632 fmi 3242 support to economic and infrastructure development 6122 poor and unemployed population is naturally dissatisfied the major pool of insurgent recruits are unemployed young adult males the primary motivation for young male to join an insurgency is often the wage that it provides sometimes insurgencies foster the conditions to keep an economy stagnant naturally the host na tion and combined forces will c onduct stability operations to create situations where businesses can thrive an example is conducting route security so that insurgents cannot interfere with the transportation of products to market economic infrastructure that might need defensive considerations include natural resources industries such as manufacturing and transportation agriculture and live stockcrops products and storage facilities local merchants and markets credit associations conduct information engagement 6123 information engagement is deliberately integrated into defensive operations to compliment and reinforce the success of operations exploiting insu rgent violent tactics behaving harshly towards the hn population and failing to achieve their goals are matters of precise timing and coordination some units have chosen to prepare an information engagement plan to provide an immediate response to insurgent attacks or propaganda such as sending fiel dgrade officer to the site of an insurgent attack to talk with the local media and get the correct story out these effo rts may go far to influence the populace to provide information either for reward or nonymously that may break apart insurgent networks specifically information supplied by the populace is critical in counteri ng ambushes ieds snipers and driveby shootings it does this by interrupting the insurgent decision cycle summary general clutterbuck in the malayan emergency said village police post was the only thing that could provide security against the th reat that really mattered in the villagesthe man with the knife who lived in the village and prowled the streets at night seeking out t hose people who had actively supported the government or betray ed the guerrillas during the day this chapter identified defensive operations as they apply specifically to est ablishing civil security and civil cont rol and the other loes defensive operations in coin must secure the population host nation secu rity forces and government and us forces from the actions of insurgents fmi 3242 71 chapter 7 stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency internal warfare within population partic ularly in cities generally involves an extensive police operation there is also an intensive propaganda effort destined primarily to make the steps that are taken understood by the population broad social program follows the objective of which is to give the people the material and moral assistance necessary to permit them to resume their normal activities quickly after operations are over trinquier roger modern warfare french view of counterinsurgency 1964 stability operations encompass various military missions tasks and activities conducted outside the united states in coordination with other instruments of national power to maintain or reestab lish safe and secure environment provide essential governmental services emergency infrastructure reconstruction and humanitarian relief jp 30 they verage the coercive and constructive capabilities of the military force to establish safe and secure environment facilitate reconciliation among local or regional adver saries establish political legal social and economic institutions and facilitate the transition of responsibility to legitimate civilian authority fm 307 in the absence of hn civil government military forces will have to fulfill this role until hn or other us government agencies assume these responsibilities fm 307 describes in detail the requirements that may fall upon the soldiers and leaders to perform section ioverview during an insurgency stability operations are executed simultaneously with offensive and defensive operations they compliment and reinforce offens ive and defensive operations because they begin to address the root causes that lead to the insurgency stability operations ar often the most critical for defeating an insurgency there are five primary tasks within stability operations establish civil security establish civil control support to governance restore essential services and support to economic and infrastru cture development two additional tasks support host nation security forces and conduct information engagement are added to produce the seven coin lines of effort hn security forces are discussed in chapter 8 while information engagements are in chapter 4 these seven coin loes are means for tactical units to manage stability operations numerous tasks achieve ity of effort and restore the leg itimacy of host nation government the stability tasks fall into three categories this chapter will focus on the first two tasks military forces retain primary responsibility civilian agenciesorganizations likely retain responsibility but military forces prepared to execute tasks for which civilian agencies or or ganizations retain primary responsibility nature of stability operations 71 the stability tasks and their interrelation with the coin loes are not sequential in nature they must be continually assessed and reevaluated this iterative pr ocess occurs because units do not have the manpower to apply the same effort along each stability task as in the rheostat discussed in chapter 3 success in the establish civil security loe may cause units to apply more pressure along the restore essential services loe figure 71 shows an example of brigade that incorporated the five primary stability tasks into the seven coin loes at the commanders discretion this brigade has chosen to combine the establish civil security and establish civil control loes chapter 7 72 fmi 3242 figure 71 example bct using loes clearholdbuild operations 72 in clearholdbuild operation stability operations are conducted in the clear phase hold phase and the build phase in the build phase which focuses on building hn capacity and capabilities stability operations are primary although offens ive operations and defe nsive operations occur simultaneously stability operations address multiple coin loes section iifive primary stability tasks all five primary stability tasks are used during count erinsurgency operations nor mally as individual lines of effort however since each count erinsurgency each insurg ency and even individual units and leaders are different how these five stability tasks are applied and managed as individual lines of efforts may vary considerably the five stability tasks follow establish civil security establish civil control support to governance restore essential services support to economic and infrastructure development establish civil security 73 counterinsurgent forces seek to create safe secure and stable environment for the local populace key to this is the development of security institutions or in their ab sence performing the duties normally associated with those institutions until those capabilities are developed or transitioned to hn or other us agencies ultimately the host nation mu st secure its own people civil security involves stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 73 protecting areas resources and the populace from both external and internal threats ideally army forces focus on the external threats while police and security elements addre ss internal security threats by criminals and small hostile groups however during an insurgency the army mu st now also address the internal security threats by criminals and small hostile groups notably the armed insurgents subordinate tasks 74 typical civil security subordinate tasks counterinsurgent unit may perform are as follows combatoriented techniques for establish civil security are covered in chapter 6 enforce cessation of hostilities enforce peace agreements and other arrangements conduct disarmament demobili zation and reintegration conduct border control boundary secur ity and freedom of movement support identification protect key personnel and facilities clear explosive and cbrn hazards enforce cessation of hostilities peace agreements and other arrangements 75 these tasks aid in providing security and stability after an armed conflict while at the same time setting the conditions needed to start disarming demobilization and reintegration these tasks are critical to providing effective security for the local populace by reducing their exposure to the threat of violent conflict the tasks help military fo rces establish sustained peace by focusing on processes and activities fundamental to conflict transformation in coin most efforts focus on identifying and neutralizing potential adversaries for instance in iraq from 2003 to 2005 us forces fought sunni insurgency comprised of many members of the former regimes security apparatus the list of essential tasks may include enforce cease fires supervise disengagement of belligerent forces identify and neutralize potential adversaries provide security for negotiations conduct disarmament demobilization and reintegration 76 these tasks are fundamental to establishing st ability and lasting peace it includes physically disbanding guerrillas and reintegrating them into soci ety other elements do not carry weapons however they support the guerrilla forces their communities and fa milies perceive them as part of the insurgency together the tasks of disarmament demobilization and reintegration reduce potential resurgence of insurgency these tasks provide means for these individuals and groups to reenter society as contributing members some of these tasks could also be used for the demobilization of hn paramilitary forces for more on hn paramilitary forces see chapter 8 essential tasks may include negotiate arrangements with insurgents establish and enforce weapons control programs including collection and destruction provide reassurances and incentives for disarmed groups establish monitoring program ensure adequate health food and security for former insurgents disarm former insurgents or hn paramilitary forces reduce availability of unauthorized weapons reintegrate former insurgents and hn paramilitary forces and dislocated civilians into society secure store and dispose of weapons develop hn arms control capacity chapter 7 74 fmi 3242 establish border control border s ecurity and freedom of movement 77 central component of civil secu rity is the ability of the hn to monitor and regulate its borders generally border and coast guard forces secure na tional boundaries while customs officials regulate the flow of people animals and goods across state borders these border c ontrols are necessary to regulate immigration control the movements of the local popul ace collect excise taxes or duties limit smuggling and control the spread of disease vectors through quara ntine in coin the ability for the counterinsurgent to control the borders reduces the effectiveness of th external support for the insurgency essential tasks may include establish border control and boundary security establish and disseminate rules relevant to movement dismantle roadblocks and establish checkpoints ensure freedom of movement support identification 78 this task complements efforts to vet host nation personnel encourage participation in representative government resolve property disputes and validate professional credentials although vital to other programs for rebuilding functioning civil society identification programs are equally important to civil security after the collapse of an authoritarian or hostile regime these programs ensure that potential adversaries do not inadvertently reintegrate into society thus they are deprived of the ability to sow the seeds of future in surgency it is key part of populace and resource control operations tactical units often do this by conducting census with biometric assets essential tasks may include secure documents relating to personal identifica tion property ownership court records voter registries professional certificates birth records and driving licenses establish identification program ensure individuals have personal forms of identification protect key personnel and facilities 79 in coin military forces may extend protection and support to the hn population to ensure their continued contribution to the overall stability operation in the interest of transparency military forces specifically request and carefully negotiate this pr otection similarly the longterm success of any counterinsurgency often relies on th ability of the secur ity force to protect and maintain critical infrastructure until the hn government can resume that responsibility essential tasks may include identifying securing protecting and coordinating disposition for stockpiles of munition s and cbrn materiel and precursors facilities and adversaries with technical expertise as well as the following protect governmentsponsored civilian recons truction and stabilization personnel contractor and civilian r econstruction and stabilizati on personnel and resources protect and secure places of religious worship and cultural sites critical infrastructure natural resources civ il registries and property ownership documents strategically important institutions such as government buildings medical and public health infrastructure the central bank national treasury and integral commercial banks museums and religious sites military depots equipment ammunition dumps and means of communications build host nation capacity to protect civilian reconstruction nd stabilization personnel infrastructure and public institutions military infrastructure clear explosive and cbrn hazards 710 to an hn combatting an insurgen cy the presence of explosive hazards includi ng minefields ieds and unexploded ordnance and cbrn hazards re sulting from intentional or accidental release stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 75 inflicts stress that the surviving institutions cannot bear these hazards restrict freedom of movement hinder international trade and detract from the ab ility of an hn government to secure its population and borders military forces may clear unexploded ordnance and other explosive hazards to facilitate capacitybuilding activities removing these hazards ensures the safety security and wellbeing of the local populace essential tasks may include establish an explosive hazards coordination cell conduct emergency clearing of mines ieds unexploded ordnance and other explosive hazards map survey and mark mined areas unexplode d ordnance and other explosive hazards remediate hazards remaining from the releas of cbrn hazards and radiological fallout as well as provide decontamination support create host nation capacity to conduct demining build host nation capability to export demining expertise establish civil control 711 this task regulates selected behavior and activitie s of individuals and groups this control reduces risk to individuals or groups nd promotes security civil contro l channels the populations activities to allow provision of security and essential servi ces while coexisting with military force conducting operations fm 30 top priority for military forces conducting stab ility operations during counterinsurgency will be the reestab lishment of legal and justice systems to help aid with security sector reform units may find themselves involved with corrections activities establishing public order and safety resolving prope rty disputes and supporting reconciliation efforts most military efforts focus on building temporary or interim capab ilities until more permanent capabilities are put in place by either the host nation or us and international agencies subordinate tasks 712 typical civil control subordinate tasks counterinsurgent unit may perform are establish public order and safety establish interim criminal justice system support law enforcement and police reform support judicial reform support property dispute resolution processes support corrections reform support public outreach and community rebuilding programs establish public order and safety 713 these tasks provide broad range of activities to protect the civilian populace provide interim policing and crowd control and secure critical infrastru cture these essential task s represent actions that must occur during and after an insurg ency to ensure the longterm sustainability of any reform efforts the speed and effectiveness in performing these tasks directly correlates with the length of time to defeat the insurgency executing these tasks as soon as practical after intervening reduces the time required for related efforts and allows the mission to be acco mplished far sooner however the militarys legal authorities for all activities in the ju stice sector particular ly involving enforcement and adjudication of the law must be clear essential tasks may include secure the population ensure humanitarian aid and security forces reach endangered populati ons and refugee camps perform civilian police functions including investigating crimes and making arrests locate and safeguard key witnesses documen ts and other evidence related to key ongoing or potential investigations and prosecutions control crowds prevent looting and manage civil disturbances chapter 7 76 fmi 3242 secure facilities records storage equipment and funds related to criminal justice and security institutions build host nation capacity to protect military infrastructure build host nation capacity to protect infrastructure and public institutions build host nation capacity for emergency response fostering sustainability where military forces identify modernization needs and the means to achieve them establish interim criminal justice system 714 often in coin establishing or reestablishing an interim justice system is prerequisite this restoration requires wide range of skilled professionals working under clearly defined legal authority judges prosecutors court administrators defense lawyers corrections personnel law enforcement and investigators these personneland the institutions they representprovide temporary respite that allows the host nation to restore its legal system ssential tasks may include an initial response in which military forces assess current laws and need fo r modifications or adoption of internationally accepted codes assess host nation capacity to combat crime deploy interim justice personnel to complement host nation criminal justice system establish mechanisms to review the legality of detentions and minor cases to minimize pretrial detention enact interim legal codes and procedures permitted by international law support law enforcement and police reform 715 us military forces provide support to law enfor cement and policing operations which is integral to establishing civil control hn police may provide this capability if the security environment permits usually in insurgencies the hn poli ce may have become corrupt or failed altogether in failed states especially during and immediately after conflict military police forces are the only organizations able to fill this void at times hn police augment milita ry forces rather than the other way around the preferred providers of civilian law enforcement services are hn police augmented as required by military and paramilitary police units with policing capabilities civilian agencies typically provide training and capacitybuilding support for law enforcement serv ices however us and hn military forces may be required to perform these services in the interim until the situation permits transition of this function to civilian agencies or organizations essential tasks may include the following identify secure and preserve evidence of war crimes crimes against humanity corruption transnational crime such as terrorism organized crime human trafficking and narcotics identify and detain perpetrators of these offenses support vetting checking credentials and accounting for hn police forces inventory and assess police facilities and systems train and advise hn police forces rehabilitate or construct necessary facilities establish police academies support judicial reform 716 the reform of judicial bodies is integral to rule of law and provides the necessary framework for broader security sector reform the support provided to judicial institu tions parallels efforts with police and security forces to enhance the states capability to maintain civil control and security under most circumstances other agencies organizations typically support the development of the judicial branch of government in failed state however military fo rces may initially perform these functions until they can be transitioned to an appropriate civilian agency or organization essential tasks may include identify host nation legal professionals stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 77 educate criminal justice personnel on interim legal codes and international human rights standards inventory and assess courts law schools legal libraries and bar associations deploy judicial advisors and liaisons rehabilitate or construct necessary facilities support vetting of host na tion legal professionals support property dispute resolution 717 vital service of the judiciary branch is to resolve property di sputes one of the causes of an insurgency might be old disputes over ownership and control of property author ities must implement dispute resolution mechanisms this prevents the escalation of violence that can occur in the absence of law order as people seek resolution on their own terms typically the militarys role in resolving disputes is limited to transitional military authority where these mechanisms are implemented in the absence of functioning host nati on government essential tasks may in clude an initial response in which military forces implement mechanisms to prevent unauthorized occupation or seizure of property publicize dispute resolution process coordinate dispute resolution process to deter violence and retribution support corrections reform 718 when the goal in coin is to criminalize the insurgency and prosecute insurgents in the hn court system corrections reform is an integral component of broader security sector reform corrections reform tasks focus on building hn capacity in the penal system restoring the institutional infrastructure and providing oversight of the incarceration process ta sks also include compre hensive assessment of the prisoner population to help reintegrate political prisoners and others unjus tly detained or held without due process essential tasks may include identify and register all detention correction or rehabilitative facilities preserve and secure penal administrative records and reports inventory and assess prison populations and conditions implement humanitarian standards in prisons provide emergency detention facilities vet corrections personnel deploy penal trainers and advisors refurbish prison facilities at key sites coordinate jurisdiction and handover facilitate international monitoring rebuild corrections institutions train and advise correcti ons personnel to internationally accepted standards develop reconciliation parole and reintegration mechanisms support public outreach and community rebuilding programs 719 these programs are central to the reconciliation pr ocess in counterinsurgency and to promoting public respect for the rule of law they provide th hn populace with means to form cohesive society while these programs generally do not involve substantial military invol vement some activities require the forces support to achieve success essential tasks may include an initial response in which military forces establish broad public information programs to promote reconciliation efforts assess needs of vulnerable populations chapter 7 78 fmi 3242 techniques 720 most combatoriented techniques for performing establish civil controltype tasks are covered in chapter 5 and chapter 6 checkpoint operations and vehicle searches help establish public order and safety by limiting the insurgents freedom of movement establish checkpoint control traffic 721 checkpoint is manned position usually at chokepoint on main thoroughfare which can control all vehicular and pedestrian traffic passing along that road checkpoint may stop and check all vehicles or only selected few checkpoint is not roadblock roadblock prevents all vehicular or pedestrian traffic along thoroughfare 722 checkpoints may be temporary semipermanent or permanent common discriminator between temporary and semipermanent checkpoint is its manning requirements temporary checkpoint has shift requirementsthe same individuals can estab lish operate and then break down the checkpoint semipermanent checkpoint requires at least one additional shift of pe rsonnel to operate it for the length of time required over time semipermanent checkpoint may turn into permanent checkpoint permanent checkpoint usually has set end time mo st nations have permanent checkpoints especially at international border crossings or at key access control points common reasons for establishing checkpoint during counterinsurgency operations include demonstrating the presence and authority of the host government checking vehicles for explosive devices maintaining control of vehicular and pedestrian traffic apprehending suspects preventing smuggling of controlled items preventing infiltration of unauthorized civilians into or through controlled area serving as an observation post considerations 723 checkpoints cause considerable inconvenience and sometimes fear to the population therefore it is important that the citizens understand that checkpoi nts are preventive and not punitive measure the use of tpt to broadcast instructions and explanations and disseminate handbills to civilians waitin g at checkpoint helps minimize negative reactions to th control measure and to ensure compliance 724 the rapid establishment of temporary checkpoint can support host of counterinsurgency operations the two types of checkpoints follow snap checkpoint 725 this is rapidly established temporary checkpoint if time allows designated mobile unit is trained and resourced for this mission then with little warning this unit can establish snap checkpoint almost anywhere enduring checkpoint 726 this is often established initially as snap ch eckpoint as the site is further developed an enduring checkpoint becomes semipermanent 727 insurgent forces often target traffic checkpoints with harassing sniper or indirect fire plan to quickly locate and react to thes threats often reaps great benefit additionally checkpoints are often targeted by insurgent snipers or by scripted traffic incident th insurgents goal is to induce the counterinsurgent to overact and then to exploit the overreaction in the media locations 728 the precise location and degree of visibility of checkpoint reflect its purpose highly visible checkpoint is often located where traffic can avoid it this works well for entrycontrol points and border stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 79 crossings concealed checkpoint is often located where traffic cannot avoid it by by passing turning around or getting off the road without being observed and if ordered detained figure 72 and figure 73 show possible setups for snap and enduring checkpoints conduct vehicle searches 729 any unit may be tasked to conduct the routine search of vehicles if there is high probability that vehicles may be wired with explosives then an od team should lead the search effort all vehicles should be screened before entering the search area us ually screening is done at the initial barrier and iaw local screening criteria vehicles are then directed ither through the search area or to one of the search sites normally passenger vehicles are segregated from commercial vehicles as part of the screening process plans 730 determine the specific purpose of the checkpoint the purpose influences the location degree of individual checks length of time resources and manpower required define the parameters of searchesthis include s whether to search all pedestrians and all vehicles for vehicles determ ine whether to search the ve hicle the occupants or combination determine the search method and level of search detail distribute be on the look out bolo list if available establish the screening criteria for searches nd the method of screening this can reduce time and manpower requirements determine the ineffect time checkpoints ting longer than 12 hours will require shifts consider placing rest areas for shifts near the sear ch area so they can be us ed as reserve force establish both near and far security near security protects the checkpoint force far security often concealed prevents the escape of any vehicle or person attempting to turn back upon sighting the checkpoint plans must include the actions taken when this happens establish and brief the roe and eof procedures including warning signs rehearse checkpoint operations especially eof procedures design the checkpoint layout and gather the needed materials before arrival determine the personnel requirements emplace in positions where traffic cannot easily bypass the checkpoint after it can operate on its own determine if the hn security force should man the checkpoint chapter 7 710 fmi 3242 figure 72 wellequipped snap checkpoint layout stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 711 figure 73 typical enduring checkpoint layout chapter 7 712 fmi 3242 material considerations 731 consider equipment for example equipment such as speed bumps or filled barrels to slow and canalize vehicles protection items which may include both lethal and nonlethal munitions concertina wire to control movement around the checkpoint sandbags and wood for defe nsive positions or bunkers binoculars night vision devices and flashlights longhandled mirrors for inspecting vehicle undercarriages logs and checklists for inspectors supervisors and so on caution flags and unit signs personnel considerations 732 consider each element command element security element search element linguists and host nation representation military police medical personnel communications personnel tactical psyop team hcts military working dog teams hn security force personnel establishment 733 position combat vehicle off the road but within sight to deter resistance keep this vehicle in hulldown position and protected by local security it must be able to engage vehicles attempting to break through or bypass the checkpoint place obstacles in the road to slow or canalize traffic into the search area establish reserve if applicable establish bypass lane for approved convoy traffic designate the vehicle search area establish parking area adj acent to the search area designate male and female search areas near th vehicle search area normally search women using metal detector searched by female soldier or searched by host nation female consider controlled bypass lane for hn civilians with medical emergencies hn civilian officials or other hn population concerns consider the effect on the local population to include market times sporting events holidays and collateral damage operation 734 screen all vehicles iaw with established pr eferably written criteria establish observation for vehicles or occupants attempting to avoid the checkpoint this includes exiting vehicle and walking away or around the checkpoint having lead vehicle signal following vehicle to avoid the area creating distraction to allow the vehicle or occupants to slip away stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 713 screening considerations 735 in addition to having basic published list of criteria note the number of occupants note the type or color of the vehicle devise method of managing important changes or alerts observe all vehicles and all occupants always maintain some element of randomness basic levels 736 the three basic levels of vehicle searches follow initial 737 this is cursory search that is the same for all stopped vehicles this relatively quick check should take more than two minutes it may be comb ined with initial vehicle screening basic vehicle initial search procedures include ensure at least two people conduct the search one guard driver and occupants one searcher vehicle stop the vehicle at the search site have all occupants exit the vehicle and move them to one location instruct the driver to turn off the engine and then open the hood trunk and all doors continue the search once the above is complete question or search of the driver and occupants is optional begin and end the exterior search at the front of the vehicle moving in clockwise direction visually search of the exteri or and top of the vehicle visually search of the underside of the vehicle search the interior starting at the front compartment then the right side then the rear compartment then the left side ending at the front complete the search instruct the driver and occupants to continue primary 738 this is full search of select vehicles vehicles may be selected randomly iaw screening guidelines or due to similarities to vehicles associ ated with previous events beonthelookout or bolo list this search usually entails checking the interior exterior engine and trunk compartments and mirror checks of the vehicle underside it should take two to five minutes primary search include those of those of the initial search and may add the following question or search the driver and occupants check the inside of the front hood check the rear compartment secondary 739 this is detailed search of suspect vehicle vehicle becomes suspect usually due to screening or discovery of items during primary search this thorough search is manpower and time intensive it may include disassembling panels checking interiors of wheels and so on at the basic level to conduct secondary search of vehicle ensure at least four people conduct the search two for the driver and occupants two more for the vehicle chapter 7 714 fmi 3242 assume that the driver and occupant s or the vehicle itself is suspect if possible have the vehicle stop in safe and secure location instruct the driver to turn off the engine open the hood open the trunk and open all doors obtain the keys from the driver move the driver and occupants to separate location detain and search driver and occ upants while searching the vehicle begin the vehicle search at th front and end at the rear one searcher searches the right front right side and right rear the other searcher searches the left front left side and left rear conduct visual search of the exterior and top conduct visual search of the underside of the vehicle without entering conduct visual search of the interior of the vehicle ensure the engine is off and then ensure the hood trunk and all doors are open check the inside of the front hood check the interior left and right sides check the rear compartment complete the search return keys to driver instruct driver and occupants to continue vehicle types 740 vehicles are generally categorized into four types automobiles cars motorcycles and bicycles buses and heavy goods vehicles trucks search cons iderations for the car are covered above as part of basic vehicle considerations search consider ations for the three additional vehicles follow motorcycles and bicycles 741 basic motorcycle and bicycle search procedures include ensure at least two people conduct the search one for the driver and passenger one for the vehicle have the driver or passenger turn off the engine and dismount visually inspect the vehicle and any compartments on the vehicle complete the search instruct driver and passenger to mount up and continue buses 742 basic bus search procedures include ensure at least four people conduct this search two for the driver and occupants two for the bus itself set aside an area to search buses due to their length potentially large number of occupants and lots of luggage instruct only the driver to turn off the engine and open all exterior compartments initially board the bus check all occupants identification note seating arrangements and check carryon baggage if full search is required have all occupants exit the bus with their baggage and then detain them while you search the bus and baggage complete the search instruct driver and occupants to reload and continue stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 715 heavy goods vehicles trucks 743 basic heavy goods truck vehicle search procedures include ensure at least three personnel conduct the search one for the driver and occupants two for the vehicle set aside an area to search these vehicles due to their length and amount of cargo instruct the driver to turn off the engine open the hood and open all doors check the drivers credentials and cargo manifests inspect to the degree required for the cargo complete the search instruct driver and occupants to secure load and continue support to governance 744 this helps build toward effec tive legitimate governance speci fically it focuses on restoring public administration and resuming public services while fostering longterm efforts to establish functional effective system of po litical governance in every case for the counterinsurgent to develop longterm solution unit actions mu st strengthen the host nation government and reinforce its legitimacy with the people figure 74 the formation of an effective local government is critical to the success of any counterinsurgency operation because they provide the foundati on for legitimate governance at the national level additionally effective local government s promote social stability when people have say in their own government they also increase financial transparency which helps fight corruption at the local level the formation of local neighborhood councils serves as an excellent starting point for supporting governance units may have to initiate these efforts without an external agency support neighborhood and district councils are effective because they empower the population on many levels they help the populace devise local solutions to local problems and he lp citizens and community leaders build skills in community decision making all involved parties learn to resolve conflicts peacefully and in transparent fashion local c ouncils also help leaders at the local level develop skills that can help them serve at higher levels of government subordinate tasks 745 typical tasks include support transitional administrations support development of local governance support anticorruption initiatives support elections chapter 7 716 fmi 3242 figure 74 legitimate governance the challenges of governance in iraq in 2003 perhaps the most volatile site for this ethnic conflict was the city of kirkuk located in northern iraq about 150 miles north of baghdad the city was locat ed in what was historically kurdish territory but its population had long been mix of kurds arabs assyrian christians and turkoman situated in the heart of iraqs oil fields kirkuk had strategic importance for much of the 20th century partly for that reason in t he 1970s and 1980s saddam attempted to arabize kirkuk by forcing kurds to leave and moving arab gr oups in the arrival of coalition troops in the city in may 2003 opened up the possibility for the kurd ish population to take control once again over an important cultural and economic center the 173d airborne brigade 173d abn t ook responsibility for the city soon after the toppling of the saddam regime in may 2003 soldiers of the brigade found themselves attempting to mediate between groups of armed arabs moving north to ensure the kurds did not overwhelm the city and the kurdish groups that had begun fl exing their muscles by forcibly evicting some arabs on 17 may 2003 this conflict became violent with fire fights erupting in the streets of kirkuk colonel william mayville the brigade commander recall ed that this event serv ed as the really big first lesson into or insight into what some of the social dynamics in this community at play were he added if you did not address these dynamics the consequences could be very very violent instead of finding citizens eager for democracy the soldiers of the 173d abn discovered multiethnic populace interested in removing all vest iges of baathist power and solving the problems of saddams arabization policies while also ensuring their ethnic group retained its social economic and political position in the city this pr esented complex problem to the soldiers of the brigade the large majority of whom had experience in politics of any type one of the first recommendations made by brigade officers was the establishment of multiethnic city council that could help redr ess the grievances of the vari ous groups and begin moving the city forward by the end of may 2003 less than 6 wee ks after the brigade arrived in kirkuk mayville and his governance team selected 300 delegates from the city w ho elected 30 seat council which included 6 representatives fr om each of the 4 ethnic groups stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 717 working with civilian contract consultants who had partnered with usaid brigade officers convinced the city council to establish new stru cture that included five di rectorates employment public safety public works budget office and resettl ement the employment directorate would play direct role in enforcing the debaathificati on process and us officers hoped the resettlement office could work with both arabs and kurds to defuse the tensions caus ed by land disputes rti consultants and ca officers also helped the new kirkuk budget office prepare the citys budget for 2004 and established citizens bureau to help handle complaints from the public adapted from on point ii transition to the new campaign the united states army in operation iraqi freedom may 2003january 2005 support transitional administrations 746 when the hn government has collapsed or been deposed counterinsurgency efforts focus on immediately filling the void in governan ce in either situation the relia bility and trustworthiness of local officials is suspect due care and prudence are necessa ry to avoid empowering officials whose interests and loyalties are inconsistent with those of the occupy ing force for example tactical unit may struggle with identifying and emplacing good neighborhood council leader tasks may include vet host nation officials reconstitute leadership at local levels of government establish interim legislative processes support development of local governance 747 establishing effective governance at the local vel is necessary befo re developing governance institutions and processes throughout the hn initially effective local governance almost depends entirely on the ability to provide essential civil services to the people most stability tasks require an integrated and synchronized effort across all sectors to achieve th desired end state tactical units have often had success when working with city district or tribal council or city manager essential tasks may include establish mechanisms for locallevel participation identify secure rehabilitate and maintain basic facilities for the local government restore essential local public services provide resources to maintain essential local public services support anticorruption initiatives 748 corruption of government official could be root cause that led to the insurgency providing legal guidance and assistance to the transitional government mitigates the nearterm effects of corruption longterm measures ensure lasting success corr uption and graft can hinder efforts to establish governance restore rule of law or institute economic recovery while some level of corruption is common to many cultures its existence can unhinge reform efforts and put the entire mission at risk essential tasks may include an initial response in which military for ces create mechanisms to curtail corruption across government institutions units must d ecide if there is an acceptable leve l of corruption in the hn society essential tasks may include an initial response to disseminate ethical standa rds for civil servants ensure transparency in the dispersal of government resources implement reporting procedures for corruption and intimidation support elections 749 the ability of the hn government and its local subdivi sions to stage fair and secure elections is significant milestone toward establishing legitimate effective governance while civilian agencies that maintain strict transparency guide the elections process military for ces provide the support that enables broad participation by the local populace essential tasks may include chapter 7 718 fmi 3242 provide security for polling places voters and ballots determine identification requirements for voter registration establish or verify voter registry techniques 750 two critical governance techniques are negotiating and mediating and leader and meeting security see fm 307 for additional technique considerations negotiations and mediations 751 in counterinsurgency situations may arise that require counterinsurgency personnel to negotiate mediate and perhaps arbitrate disputes these usually involve minor points of contention between the belligerents or disagreements about the daily routines of the counterin surgent force it leaders must remain aware of their limitations larger points of contention or issues bey ond their ability to resolve should be referred to higher authority if possible arbitration should be referred to the existing legal system negotiations are made from position of strength while mediation is made from position of impartiality in the joint combined and interagency environment negotiations and mediations can be complex nonetheless all negotiations and mediations require tact diplomacy honesty patience fairness effective communications crosscultural sensitivity and careful planning for the purposes of this manual the following definitions are used negotiation 752 this is discussion between at least two partie s with the intention to produce an agreement mediation 753 this is an attempt to bring about peaceful ttlement or compromise between disputants through the objective intervention of neutral party arbitration 754 this is the process by which disputants submit their differences to the judgment of an impartial person or group appointed by mutual consent usage in counterinsurgency 755 unit leaders must be prepared to conduct negotiations or mediations with the leaders or members of various groups these groups may be political ethni c religious tribal military or even family understanding the composition of groups in the ao is vital for effective negotiations and mediations analyzing civil considerations using ascope of vari ous groups can be extremely helpful in preparation for these discussions furthermor tensions or hostilities between groups may destabilize society and provide opportunities for insurg ents negotiations and mediations may be broken down into two categories situational and preplanned situational negotiations and mediations 756 these both allow immediate discussion and resolution of an issue or problem for example members of ground patrol might encounter two groups arguing at an intersection to negotiate resolution to this problem the patrol must thoroughly understand the roe and rules of interaction roi soldiers apply this working knowledge to the process of discussing and when possible resolving issues and problems between opposing parties which might include the unit itself the leader on the ground must know when he has exhausted his options under the roe and roi and turn over the discussion to higher authority stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 719 preplanned negotiations 757 these allow discussion and resolution of an upcoming specific issue or problem for example company commander may conduct work coordination meeting between leader s of the belligerents to determine mineclearing responsibilities as with situational negotiations preplanned negotiations require leaders to know and understand the roe and roi leaders must also know as much as possible about every aspect of the dispute or issue the negotiators goal is to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both sides and that reduces antagoni sm and the threat of renewe d hostilities considerations during counterinsurgencies 758 commanders should identify powerful groups both in side and outside their aos and obtain key information about them to better prepare for negotia ting and mediating analyzing civil considerations using ascope is useful tool this prior preparation can be especially beneficial for the daytoday situational negotiations and mediations that can easily arise during daily operations this key information includes formal relationships such as treaties or alliances between groups informal relationships such as tolerance or friction between groups divisions and cleavages between groups crosscutting relationships between groups such as religious beliefs political parties and business ventures guidelines for negotiations and mediations 759 credibility is key to success as rule only communicate necessary information and those actions that authorities and commanders intend to do or have the authority to do successful negotiating often involves communicating clear position on all issues this includes vi sualizing several possible end states while maintaining clear idea of the best end st ate and conveying willingness to bargain on negotiable points use tact to justify sta nding firm on nonnegotiable poi nts while still communicating respect for other participants and consider having points that are disposable to use for concessions steps 760 several steps are common to negotiations and diations especially preplanned negotiations determine the purpose 761 before contacting leaders of the belligerent parties to initiate the negotiation or mediation process participants must know what they are trying to do as well as the limits of their authority ensure that participants can recommend that thei r superiors ratify the agreement prepare 762 thorough preparation is needed to ensure the ccess of the negotiation or mediation process commanders must familiarize themselves with both the situation and the area in which their unit will operate they should consider selecting one person who understands conflict dynamics and crosscultural issues to observe negotiation or mediation and give advice this individual can watch for body language and other indicators of how the process is working in turn this person may be able to coach more effective techniques to the negotiators or mediators leader s should also develop an agenda for the meeting and consider the conduct customs and actions expected at the meeting communicate 763 participants must establish an effective means of communicating with all parties they should not assume that certain leader or element is opposed to their efforts without careful investigation instead they must ensure that facts are correct before forming any opinions the commander must earn the trust and confidence of any opposing party this includes establishing an atmosphere and physical setting that participants will judge to be both fair and safe chapter 7 720 fmi 3242 execute 764 always strive to maintain control of the session be firm yet evenhanded in leading the discussion at the same time be flexible with willingness to accept recommendations from the opposing parties and from assistants and advisors settle the easy issues first be prepared to precede issuebyissue in predetermined order actions can have different connotations to individuals of other cultures culture shapes how people reason what they accept as fact and what principles they apply to decision making also nonverbal behavior such as the symbolic rituals or protocols of the arrangement for meeting is important if participants cannot reach agreement they must keep the dialogue going at minimum they must seek agreement on when the parties will meet again leader and meeting security 765 key leaders and important meetings even in tablished nonviolent peaceful areas of the world need security this security allows leaders to focu s on the meetings purpose without distractions during counterinsurgency security becomes an absolute require ment as all key leaders and important meetings are potential targets for insurgents successful counterinsurgency operations require active interaction with the population this interaction varies from formal meeti ngs and negotiations to informal interactions with local citizens formal meetings and negotiations are significant mission events and should be thoroughly planned and properly resourced informal interactions happen with little or planning but must still b prepared for thorough training and sops in most situations unit leaders from team leaders up are the individuals who will be involved in regular interactions and meeti ngs these personnel are often placed in exposed positions as they execute their mission at th tactical level personal security detachment mp platoon or squad will typically secure leader vip or meeting leader s and units consider several things when preparing for meetings or negotiations individual soldier interactions 766 in counterinsurgency environment individual soldiers interact daily with the local population when doing so they must maintain s ituational awareness and be prepared to react immediately to range of situations while one soldier interacts another shoul d provide security for the other this is easy if the buddy system is used considerations for leader security 767 at least one person should be ready to provide closein direct physical protection for the leader however this should not interfere with the leaders mission accomplishment shoul d not irritate to other participants and should not include behavior that coul d be seen as threat planning must also determine any restrictions on people approaching the protected l eader and should restrict the circulation of people around the leader if armed at all the leader should ca rry sidearm this leaves the leaders hands free to react to closein threats s ecurity personnel should take positions where they can observe everything and everyone near the leader considerations for meeting security 768 before meeting crowdcontrol measures should be planned and prepared even if crowds are not expected evacuation routes and eof procedures shoul d be planned for key pers onnel planning for outer security should include coverage of inner and outer cordons the inner cordon protects the meeting participants controls access to the meeting and controls the immediate crowd the outer cordon isolates and controls access to the meeting this cordon may be close in and visible or out of sight of the actual meeting focusing on outside elements trying to gain access 769 if available use special units or weapons such as snipers and shotguns or nonlethal weapons use at least one interpreter two are preferred one ac tively interprets while the other observes body language and listens to side conversations in the audience all of these steps should be rehearsed before execution stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 721 770 typical technique for conducting meeting includes reconnoitering the meeting site and also conducting presite clearance before the meeting for ces also establish outer and inner cordons secure the meeting collapse both cordons and then conduct an orderly movement back to their base or combat outpost all of these actions should be rehearsed extensively prior to execution restore essential services 771 army forces establish or restore the most basic services and protect them until civil authority or the host nation can provide them here the counterinsurgent force works toward meeting the populations basic needs ideally the military is simply providing the security for the humanitarian assistance normally army forces support other government intergovernmental and host nation agencies when the host nation or other agency cannot perform its role army forces may provide the basics directly fm 30 tactical units focus primarily on addressing the immediate needs of population and fostering host nation efforts at restoring essential services however in the absence of host nation capability military forces may directly perform these tasks as the host nation develops the ability to do them on its own tactical units will generally provide for the ba sic needs of the population such as food water shelter and basic medical care s hould other agencies be present close coordination between military forces and those agencies will become paramount see fm 307 for techni considerations subordinate tasks 772 typical subordinate tasks to restore essential services follow provide essential civil services tasks related to civilian dislocation support famine prevention and emergency food relief programs support public health programs support education programs provide essential civil services 773 although closely related to establishing and supporting effective local governance efforts to provide essential civil services to the hn popul ation involve developing the capacity to operate maintain and improve those services this broader focus involves societal component that encompasses longrange education and training employment program s and economic investment and development at the tactical level activities of military forces to provide essential civil services are often defined in terms of the immediate humanitarian needs of the people providing the food water shelter and medical support necessary to sustain the population til local civil services are restor ed once their immediate needs are satisfied efforts to restore basic services and transition control to civil authorities typically progress using lines of effort based on the memory aid sweatms sewage water electricity academics trash medical safety and other considerations these lines of effort are vital to integrating efforts to reestablish local hn services with similar related actions to establish safe secure environment tactical units may support the effort to provide essential civil servi ces by conducting detailed infrastructure reconnaissance or security for those types of reconstruction projects essential tasks may include provide for immediate humanitarian needs food water shelter and medical support ensure proper sanitation purification and distribution of drinking water provide interim sanitation wastewater and waste disposal services tasks related to civilian dislocation 774 in the fluid and uncertain nature of an insurgency the population is often left homeless the presence and uncontrolled flow of disl ocated civilians can th reaten the success of any stability operation the treatment of displaced populations either fosters trust and confidencelaying the foundation for stabilization and reconstruction among traumati zed populationor creates resentment and further chaos local and international aid organizations are most often best equipped to deal with the needs of the local populace but require secure nvironment in which to operate th rough close cooperation tactical chapter 7 722 fmi 3242 units can enable the succe ss of these organizations by providing critical assist ance to the populace nearly 80 percent of all dislocated civilians are women or children most suffer from some form of posttraumatic stress disorder and all require food shelter and medical care following major disaster humanitarian crisis or conflict providing adequate support to dislocated civilians of ten presents challenge beyond the capability of available military forces therefore military forces offer vital supportcoordinated with the efforts of other agencies organizationsto provide humanitarian assistance to the general population the list of essential tasks includes assist dislocated civilians support assistance to dislocated civilians support security to dislocated civilian camps support famine prevention and emergency food relief programs 775 famine vulnerability may cause an insurgency an insurgency could certa inly lead to food scarcity the combination of weak institutions poor policies and nvironmental change often results in famine famine may result in food insecurity incr eased poverty morbidity ma lnutrition and mortality government agencies such as the us agency for international development usaid numerous nongovernmental organizations and the united nati ons are instrumental to response efforts in famineprone states they oversee the major relief programs that provide emergency food aid to suffering populations tac tical unit of these efforts is vital to the overall success of the operation essential tasks may include monitor and analyze food security and market prices predict the effects of conflict on access to food estimate total food needs assess the adequacy of local physical transport distribution and storage of food deliver emergency food aid to most vulnerable populations support public health programs 776 this enables the complementary efforts of local and international aid organizations the initial efforts of military forces aim to stabilize the public health situation within the operational area these efforts may include assessments of the civilian medical and public health system such as infrastructure medical staff training and education medical logistics and public health programs achieving measurable progress requires early coordination and constant dialog with other actors ultimately this also facilitates successful transition from militaryled efforts to civilian organizations or the host nation essential tasks may include assess public health hazards w ithin their ao including malnutr ition water sources and sewer and other sanitation services assess existing medical infrastructure including preventative and veterinary services health physical and psychologicalcare systems and medical logistics evaluate the need for additional medical capabilities repair existing civilian clinics and hospitals operate or augment the operations of existing civilian medical facilities prevent epidemics through immediate vaccinations support improvements to local waste and wastewater management capacity promote and enhance the hn medical infrastructure support education programs 777 military activ ities to support education programs generally focus on repairing or building physical infrastructure such as classrooms schools or uni versities in some cases trained personnel with appropriate civilian backgrounds provi additional services such as administrative or educational expertise stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 723 support to economic and infrastructure development 778 this helps host nation develop capability and capacity it includes bot h shortand longterm aspects the shortterm aspect concerns immedi ate problems such as largescale unemployment and reestablishing an economy at all levels the long term aspect involves stimulating indigenous robust and broad economic activity the stability nation enjoys is often related to its peoples economic situation and its adherence to the rule of law however na tions economic health also depends on its governments ability to continuously secure its population subordinate tasks 779 typical subordinate tasks for support to economic and infrastructure development include support economic generation and enterprise creation support public sector investment programs support private sector development protect natural resources and environment support agricultural development programs restore transportation infrastructure restore telecommunicati ons infrastructure support general infrastructure reconstruction programs use money as weapon support economic generation and enterprise creation 780 economic recovery begins with an actively engaged labor force insurgencies often gain recruits by offering the unemployed wage when tactical unit occupies its ao the demand for local goods services and labor creates employment opportunities for the local populace local projects such as restoring public services rebu ilding schools or clearing roads offer additional opportunities for the local labor pool drawing on local goods services and labor presents the force with the first opportunity to infuse cash into the local econom which in turn stimulates mark et activity however this initial economic infusion must be translated into consistent capital availability and stainable jobs programs thus shortterm actions are taken with an eye toward s enabling financial selfreliance and the creation of durable enterprise and job market 781 the local economy requires this stimulus to sust ain economic generation and enterprise creation it includes efforts to execute contracting duties identify prioritize and manage local projects and implement employment programs often such programs reinforce efforts to establish security and civil order by providing meani ngful employment and co mpensation for the local populace the assessment of the economic sector must include developing know ledge and understanding of local pay scales this is essential to establishing jobs programs with appropriate wages inflated pay scales may divert critical professionals from their chosen field in pursuit of shortterm financial gains from new jobs created by the force establishing appropriate pay scales is also significant when the environment includes illicit actors willing to pay for actions or services in direct conflict with the aims of the force adversaries can easily exploit relatively low pay scales and quickly underm ine efforts to build pos itive perceptions among the people 782 hn enterprise creation is an essential activity whereby the local peopl organize themselves to provide valuable goods and serv ices in doing so they create jobs for themselves their families and neighbors that are inherently sustainable after the departure of other actors host nation enterprises may provide various goods and services including essentia l services such as smallscale sewerage water electricity transportation health care and communi cations the availability of financing through banking or microfinance institutions is essential to enterprise creation essential tasks may include implement initiatives to provide immediate employment chapter 7 724 fmi 3242 create employment opportunities for all ages and genders assess the labor force for critical skills requirements and shortfalls assess market sector for manpower requirements and pay norms implement public works projects support establishment of business registry to register lawful business activity at the local or provincial level provide startup capital for small businesses through smallscale enterprise grants encourage the creation of small lending institutions enable the development of financial institutions support public sector investment programs 783 organizations such as the us agency for intern ational development usually manage public sector investment in fragile state however the military force can also influence success in these programs public sector investment ensures the longterm viability of public education health care and mass transit it also provides for development in industriessuch as mining oil and natural gasand hydroelectricity at the tactical level units may spur investment through grant programs or direct public investment projects essential tasks may include identify projects that require large amounts of labor prioritize public investment needs develop plans to allocate available resources support private sector development 784 developing the private sector typically begins with employing large portions of the labor force in addition to acquiring goods and services from the local economy the tasks that support private sector development infuse muchneeded cash into local markets and initia additional public investment and development essential tasks may include identify projects that require large amounts of labor assess the depth of the private s ector and enterprise creation identify obstacles to private sector development facilitate access to markets strengthen the private sector through contracting and outsourcing provide investors with protection and incentives support agricultural development programs 785 the agricultural sector is cornerstone of viable market economy providing crops and livestock vital to local markets and international trade the velopment of this sector may be hindered by property disputes difficulty accessing nearby markets poor irrigation anim disease minefi elds or unexploded ordnance therefore development ag encies prioritize and integrate projects with related tasks in other stability sectors to establish and institutionalize practical solutions to the longterm growth of the agricultural sector the military contribution to agricultural development parallels related efforts to spur economic growth in local communities together they draw on local labor pools to help reestablish basic services central to the agricultural sector essential tasks may include assess the state of agricultural sector secure and protect postharvest storage facilities rebuild smallscale irrigation systems establish work programs to support agricultural development protect water sources identify constraints to production assess health diversity and numbers of animals establish transportation and distribution networks encourage host nation enterprise creation to provide goods and services to the agricultural sector stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 725 ensure open transit and access to local markets restore transportation infrastructure 786 even at the local level this is central to economic recovery an underdeveloped or incapacitated transportation infrastructure limits freedom of movement trade social interaction and development goods must make it to the markets military for ces often initiate immediate improvement to the transportation and distribution networks of the host nation these networks enable freedom of maneuver logistic support and the movement of personnel and materiel to support ongoing operations they also may reduce the risk of ied attacks on security forces these improvements facilitate the vital assistance efforts of civilian agencies organizations that follow in the wake of military forces essential tasks may include an initial response in which military forces assess overall condition of local transportation infrastructure airports roads bridges railways coastal and inland ports harbors nd waterways including facilities and equipment determine and prioritize essential infrastructure programs and projects conduct expedient repairs or build new f acilities to facilitate commercial trade restore telecommunications infrastructure 787 this exists to support every element of society from the government to the financial sector and from the media to the hn populace the failure of this infrastructure accelerates the collapse of the hn isolates the hn government and populace from the outside world and hamper s development efforts the military contribution to reconstruction efforts in the telecommunications infrastructure is limited normally few essential tasks exist in this area essential tasks may include military forces assess overall condition of the national telecommunications infrastructure determine and prioritize essential infrastructure programs and projects support general infrastructure reconstruction programs 788 general infrastructure reconstruction programs focus on rehabilitating the states ability to produce and distribute fossil fuels generate elect rical power exercise engineering and construction support and provide municipal nd other services to the populace such capacity building spurs rehabilitation efforts that establis h the foundation for longterm devel opment as with the restoration of essential services support to general infrastru cture programs requires thorough understanding of the civil considerations using ascope civil affairs ca personnel support this information collection to help prioritize programs and proj ects essential tasks may include an initial response in which military forces assess overall condition of local energy infrastructure determine and prioritize essential infrastructure programs and projects assess condition of existing power generation and distribution facilities assess condition of existing natural resour ces conversion and di stribution facilities assess condition of existing facilities needed to effectively execute essential tasks in other sectors assess conditions of existing municipal facilities that provide essential services conduct expedient repairs or build ne w facilities to support the local populace use money as weapon system 789 recent experiences have shown the effectiv eness of using money to win popular support and further the interests and goals of units conduc ting counterinsurgency operations money should be used carefully in most cases higher authority w ill tightly control funds through strict accountability measures that ensure the money is used properly when used effectively and with an end state in mind money can be an effective means to mobilize public support for the counterinsurgents cause and further alienate the insurgents from the population counterinsurgency force can use money to fund civic cleanup and other sanitation projects and the equipment to complete those projects fund small scale infrastructure improvements chapter 7 726 fmi 3242 fund agricultural projects to improve farming practices and livestock health or help implement cooperative farming programs repair civic and cultural sites and facilities repair institutions and infrastructure critical to governance and rule of law such as prisons courthouses and police stations purchase education supplies or repair infrast ructure critical for educating the local populace pay rewards to citizens who provide information on enemy activities and locations support the creation training and operation of host nation security forces fund events and activities that build relationshi ps with host nation fficials and citizens repair damage resulting from combined and coalition operations provide condolence payments to civilians for casualties from combined and coalition operations techniques 790 two techniques include the usaid principles of reconstruction and development which can be used by tactical units for project selection and smallscale building projects see fm 307 for additional considerations principles of project selection 791 the following principals apply to project lection and the corresponding use of resources especially financial resources in s upport of counterinsurgency operations host nation ownership 792 this principle holds that units must ensure that there is counterinsurgent and host nation ownership of any project the local population and the government officials who serve them should view any project as their own and not one that has been im posed by outside agencies project that has been locally conceived funded and constructed legitim izes the government and contributes to stability capacity building 793 this principle involves the transfer of knowledge techniques and skills to the local people institutions and government so that th ey develop the requisite abilities to deliver essential services to the population ultimately the local officials and institutions that gain capacity are better prepared to lead their regions through political economic and securityrelated issues sustainability 794 this principle says that commande rs should design and lect projects and services that will have lasting effect on the local population in other words the impact of the projects under consideration must endure after the facility or service is handed off to cal authorities and the unit r contractors departure from the site sustainability also im plies that the local government has the necessary resources to staff and maintain the project there are examples where commanders have failed to conduct adequate analysis and built new schools or medical clinic s only to discover that too few t eachers or doctors were available to staff these facilities similarly some commanders have purchased large generator systems to address electricity shortfalls for neighborhoods within their aos however without addressing the fuel maintenance and service requirements of these system s the machines eventually failed and were unable to serve as sustainable solution for the local electrical deficit selectivity 795 the development community defines this principl as the allocation of resources based on need local commitment and foreign policy interests these strategic characteristics are equally important tactically commanders seldom receive all of the financial resources th ey need when implementing their stability operations considerations in counterinsurgency fmi 3242 727 essential service economic and governance lines of effort therefore they must mass available resources into select reconstruction projects that offer the following advantages the local government strongly supports them they will positively impact the most people they will achieve the commanders desired effects assessment 796 this principle advises the commander and his staff to carefully research nominations adopt best practices and design for local conditions in th eir proposed projects commanders should request or conduct an assessment of local conditions before i nvesting financial resources into any potential relief or reconstruction program money should not be invested in an intelligence vacuumall available information about local conditions s hould be considered such as the popul ations requirements animosities traditions capabilities economics and so on detailed assessment of local conditions will best advise the commander on the projects potential to deliver its desired effects results 797 this principle relates directly to the principle of assessment and advises commanders to direct resources to achieve clearly defined measurable and longterm focused objectives this development principle is analogous to the military principle of objectivedirect every military operation toward clearly defined decisive and attain able objective it is equally criti cal that the commander and his staff also assess potential unintended results from their use of money many second or third order effects from project may potentially outweigh the benefits from the original intent partnership 798 this principle encourages close collaborati on with local governments communities donors nonprofit organizations the private sect or international organizations nd universities part nership plays central role in any relief reconstruction or developm ent program as it supports each of the other principles of reconstruction and development in the context of money as weapon system effective partnership will ensure the units financial resources are well invest ed and deconflicted with other programs from other agencies flexibility 799 this principle states that units must adapt to changing conditions take advantage of opportunities and maximize effectiveness as part of their reconstr uction and development program just as the conditions for offensive and defensive operations are of ten changing and uncertain so are the relief and reconstruction tasks associat ed with stability operations thes conditions will often require commanders to change tactics to achieve desired objectives accountability 7100 enforcing accountability building tr ansparency into systems and emplacing effective checks and balances to guard against corruption are important components to any relief reconstruction or development program accountability in all actions including the units use of money reinforces the legitimacy of the commander and his operations as well as the legitimacy of the local government in the eyes of the population smallscale building projects 7101 smallscale building projects encompass almost all construction both permanent and temporary that is limited in scale examples include schoolhouses clinics simple irrigation works farmtomarket roads or small police stations these projects also try to provide immediate shortterm economic stimuli and long term benefits to local area the hn should have the highest possible profile and participation in all phases of these projects before construction begins leaders should unde rstand the second and third chapter 7 728 fmi 3242 order effects of the project such as which groups will profit from the project or use the project and any conflicts of interest that arise from it they should also consider the following the local population should need or want the project the project should support the host nations plan the project should support the units coin mission and longrange plans the project should support host nation civilian authority the counterinsurgent unit should velop sustainability plan basic technique considerations 7102 the following outlines basic process to conduct smallscale building project concept development 7103 identify needs and potential projects to fill those needs soldiers and leaders at every level of responsibility should help in identifying potential projects that will further the units and the host nations interests in an ao leaders identify potential projects through meetings with local officials and through interaction with the local populace ong with their own observations of their area of operations concurrently possible locations are identified surveyed and discussed with the local population and leaders to ensure suitability project planning 7104 once the site has been selected and the project is ready to move forward plan for security is developed and implemented whenever possible host nation police forces should be used the counterinsurgent unit should also continually assess the security situation and adjust the security plan accordingly based on the changing thr eat consideration should also be given to sustaining the security forces for the duration

counterinsurgency lines of effort loes establish civil security establish civil control support host nation security forces support to governance restore essential services and support to economic and infrastructure development are critical to t he success of any stability consideration during counterinsurgency operati on ultimate success in any count erinsurgency operation requires combination of military and nonmilit ary efforts as president bu sh stated in 2007 in reference to operations in iraq successful strategy for iraq goes beyond military operations ordinary iraqi citizens must see that military operations are accompanied by visible im provements in their neighborhoods and communities stability operations during count erinsurgency seek to bring about those community improvements and create safe secure and productive environment for the po pulace fmi 3242 81 chapter 8 support to host nation security forces do not try to do too much with your own hands better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly it is their war and you are to help them not to win it for them actually also under the very odd conditions of arabia your practical work will not be as good as perhaps you think it is lawrence 27 articles this chapter addresses the working relations hip between us forces and host nation security forces it begins with discussi on of the benefits and challenges involved and resources required it provides framework for successful us and host nation operations that accomplish both hn and us objectives section ibenefits challenges and goals success in counterinsurgency opera tions requires establishing leg itimate government supported by the people and able to address the root causes that insurg ents use to gain support achieving these goals requires the host nation to secure the populace defeat the insurgents uphold the rule of law and provide basic level of essential services and security for the populace key to all these tasks is developing an effective host nation security force goal in any count erinsurgency operation is the eventu transition of the responsibility for security to the host nation security forces many factors influence the amount and type of assistance required in developing host nation security forces these factors include existing hn security force capabilities character of the insurgency population and culture level of commitment and sovereignty of the host nation level of commitment from the united states and other nations impact of us forces on the local infrastructure and hn legitimacy benefits 81 host nation is nation that receives the forces or supplies of allied nations coalition partners or nato organizations to be located on to operate in or to transit through its territory jp 102 host nation naturally needs security forces therefore primary goal of partnering is to get the best that both sides have to offer figure 81 shows typical flow of these benefits us army assets 82 these bring numerous assets to the counterinsurg ency fight they bring professional military with its training leadership targeting technology assets resources and expertise hn assets 83 these also bring many assets to the fight if properly measured organized rebuilt trained equipped advised and mentored an hn security force unit is uniquely able to protect the hn population because they understand the opera tional environment far better th an us forces their cultural and situational awareness is significant force multiplier during any counterinsurgency operation especially in humint information engagement nego tiations and targeting in terms of specific coin operations hn security forces can aid or even take the lead on clearholdbuild operations they should be chapter 8 82 fmi 3242 completely integrated in the planning process instru mental in the decision of what areas need to be cleared included in the site selection process for the hold phase and leveraged in the decisions on what stability operations need to be conducted during the build phase thus host nation unit potentially brings to counterinsurgency fight the abilities shown in figure 82 figure 81 partnership benefits understand the operational environment the ao is their home and their cult ure they know the language the different groups the political sit uation educational levels economic considerations historical bad acto rs and unofficial community leaders provide human intelligence the hn security force is better able to gather information that leads to humint for host of reasons to include speaking the same language understanding the im portant players in the area and so on put the pieces together they can often better integrate the different fragments of intelligence into the context of t he operational environment determine credibility of intelligence assets sources walkins callins they possess vastly superior s ense of cultural and situational awareness vital to managing and assigning credibility to source s validate and check interpreters they can confirm not only the inte rpreters ability but also the interpreters loyalty identify and root out infiltrators they can pick out minute differences between normal and abno rmal behavior gain information superiority they can write ssages that resonate wi th the local populace figure 82 host nation contributions challenges 84 most nations have at least some cultural obstacles to developing professional military that is responsive and accountable to the hn population pa rt of the challenge is to design professional support to host nation security forces fmi 3242 83 military that minimizes these culture obstacles most challenges arise from the differing perspectives of the us and the host nation examples 85 common cultural challenges include the following nepotism such as rank or positions based on who you know denial of negative results or errors in the interest of saving face corruption such as unofficial or under the table entitlements influence from competing loyalties ethnic religious tribal and political allegiances categories 86 these challenges fall under one of four broad cate gories of resources leadership abusing power organizational structures resources 87 governments must properly balance national resour ces to meet the peoples expectations funding for services education and health care can limit re sources available for security forces hn spending priorities may result in s ecurity force capable of protecting only the capital and key government facilities leaving the rest of the country uns ecured hn security forces will typically not have the same resources equipment money or salaries as us units us units may not have the means to partially sustain the hn security forces to maximize their effectiveness conducting effective coin ope rations requires allocating resources to ensure integration of efforts to develop all aspects of the security force leadership 88 counterinsurgents may need to influence the ex isting hn approach to leadership hn leaders may be appointed and promoted based on family ties or mbership in party or faction rather than on demonstrated competence or performance leaders may not seek to develop their subordinates or feel the need to ensure the welfare of subordinates in some cases leaders enforce the subordinates obedience by fear and use their leadership position to exploit them positions of power can lead to corruption which can also be affected by local culture ethical climate nd decision making in the hn s ecurity force leadership is often reflected in the hn security force organizations treatment of detainees this is proven barometer of the commanders ability to guide his unit and provide lasting security for the hn population 89 us forces tasked to develop hn security forces should take special interest in how the host nation appoints promotes and develops leaders the be st way us advisors and pa rtner units can influence leaders is to provide positive leadership examples abuse of power 810 the behavior of hn security force personnel is often primary cause of public dissatisfaction corrupting influences of power must be guarded against cultural and ethnic differences within population may lead to significant discrimination within the security forces and by security forces against minority groups in more ideological struggles discrimination may be against members of other political parties whether in minority cultural group or not s ecurity forces that abuse civilians do not win the populaces trust and confidence they may even be c ontributing factor of the insurgency us partners and advisors must identify and address biases as well as improper or corrupt practices 811 abuse of power such as hoarding property extortion or reprisal attacks on specific group could be root cause that lead to the insurgency or could worsen the insurgency units need to understand issues in the oe and define the problem before attempting to fix problems current example is how various groups may have long cyclical history of c onflict with other population groups ethnic historical political racial religious social and territorial turmo il may contribute to cycles of violence in the host chapter 8 84 fmi 3242 nation so intractable that it will ta ke establishing discipline code of honor patriotic nationalism and merit based promotion system inherent in professional military to break this societal norm even then these efforts may not be sufficient to stop the abuse of power organizational structures 812 perhaps the biggest hurdle for us forces is accep ting that the host nati on can ensure security using organizational and operational structures that di ffer from us practices the goal is not to make the hn unit us unit nor even to make it operate like us unit hn security force commanders must be given leeway in resolving their own security problems mirror imaging hn security force structure is often impractical and does not approach the problem from the pe rspective root causes that lead to the insurgency the population and subsequently thei r military will have cultural aspect s that will differ with us norms 813 commanders must recognize that the american way is best bias is counterproductive with respect to most host nation security forces while relationships among us poli ce customs and military organizations and individual unit structure work for the united states those relationships may not exist in other nations that have deve loped differently units and adviso rs should develop innovative ways to maximize the effectiveness of the host nations organization units and bureaucracy goals 814 training hn security forces is slow and painstaking process it does not lend itself to quick fix to ensure longterm success commanders clarif their desired end state for training programs early these goals consist of set of military characteristics common to all militaries those characteristics have nuances in different countries figure 83 shows how welltrained hn security forces should be characterized section iithe framework developing hn security forces is complex and challenging mission the united states and multinational partners can only succeed if they pproach the mission with the same deliberate planning and preparation energetic execution and appropriate resourcing as the combat aspects of the coin operation accordingly coin force commanders and staffs need to consider th task of developing hn security forces during their initial mission analysis they must make that task an integral part of all assessments planning coordination and preparation this section discusses developing plan and developing host nation security forces developing plan 815 to defeat the insurgency and be able to sustain success the host nation should develop plan with us assistance when necessary to improve the units organization training material leadership personnel and facilities however these elements ar tightly linked simultane ously pursued and difficult to prioritize commanders monitor progress in all domains the hn security force plan must be appropriate to hn capabilities and requirements at the tactical level the us advisors or partner units will outline goals allocate resources and schedule events as part of the plan under the coin line of effort support host nation security forces considerations 816 competently trained and led host nation security forces are vital to winning counterinsurgency and to sustaining stable secure and just state if local communities do not perceive us and hn forces as legitimate or that they cannot provide for security then the population will not risk providing the timely intelligence necessary to def eat the insurgency in ddition if the populace does not see at least gradual transition to host nation responsibility they may begin to view the hn s ecurity forces as an instrument or puppet of us forces finally these failures will result in hn security for ces that are ill equipped to persevere in protracted struggl after uscoalition forces withdraw support to host nation security forces fmi 3242 85 proficient security forces can work well in close coor dination to suppress lawlessness and insurgency military units are tactically and technically proficient able to perform their nati onal security responsibilities able to integrate their operations wi th those of multi national partners nonmilitary security forces can maintain

capable nco and jun ior officer corps flexible security forces can accomplish the broad missions required by the host na tionnot only to defeat insurgents or defend against outside aggre ssion but also to increase securi ty in all areas this requires an effective command organizational structure t hat makes sense for the host nation integrated into society security forces represent the host nations major et hnic groups they are not seen as instruments of just one faction cultural sensit ivities toward the incorporation of wo men must be observed but efforts should also be made to include women in police and military organi zations selfsustained security forces must be able to manage their own equi pment throughout its life cycle they must also be able to provide their own administrative and l ogistics support especially fuel water food and ammunition figure 83 characteristics of welltrained hn security forces 817 us leaders must gain trust and form bonds with hn security force units and personnel as part of the partnership mission working towards cultura l understanding improves the us forces relationship with the partner units commanders must treat the individuals in partner units as they treat their soldiers by living eating sleeping socializing planning and fighting side by side the host national security force must know that us forces care for them both individually and professionally it is this bond not the chapter 8 86 fmi 3242 materials or support that commanders provide that inspires that level of commitment and loyalty to successfully train and support hn security forces the us partner unit or advisor must ensure security forces understand that they support the hn government and the people maintain relevancy of security forces for their culture their population and their laws understand and define the security problem ensure credibility and legitimacy to all counterinsurgency operations provide model for society by using military units of mixed ethnicity religion political affiliation for example who can work together to secure and protect all the people conduct combined operations with each newly trained security force promote mutual respect between us and hn forces and between the military police and paramilitary train the trainers first and then train the hn cadre support the hn cadre in training the whole force separate hn military and police forces especially during their training place the hn cadre in charge as soon as possible recognize achievement especially excellence train all security forces not to tolerate abuses or illegal activity outside of culturally acceptable levels develop methods to report violations enable hn to assume the lead in counterinsurgency operations to alleviate effects of large us presence create as needed special elem ents in each force such as swat waterway border or sof establish and use mobile training teams ensure infrastructure and pay is appropriate and managed by the host nation government promote professionalism that does not tolerate internal incompetence develop methods to redress organizing us forces 818 as planning unfolds ssion requirements should drive the initial organization for the unit charged with developing security forces to achieve unity of effort single organization should receive this responsibility typically these duties are undert aken by some form of an advisor team due to manpower constraints some functions are best undertaken by partner units partner units 819 this is unit that shares all or portion of an area of operation with an hn security force unit us forces operating as partner units to hn security forces need to be prepared to make some organizational changes us forces should consider establishing comb ined staff cells for inte lligence operations planning and logistics these staff cells support transparent ope rations and unity of effort enhance the relationship between the bct and the hn force by demonstrating degree of trust and develop hn capacity in key staff areas by having hn personnel get intimately fam iliar with various staff pr ocedures by performing them alongside their cf partners 820 additionally before deploying us forces should tr ain in partnering with hn security forces this will ease the transition to combined operations at minimum th is should include cultural awareness training basic language training nd basic soldier skills training such as marksmanship and first aid advisor units 821 an advisor is military member who conducts opera tions that train host nation military individuals and units in tactical employment sustainment and integration of land air and maritime skills provide advice and assistance to military leaders and provide training on tactics techniques and procedures required to protect the hn from subve rsion lawlessness and insurgency and develop indigenous individual leader organizational skills advisor units can be internally or externally resourced support to host nation security forces fmi 3242 87 internally resourced advisor teams are created from the partner unit when they are required to establish them on their own externally resourced teams are usually da resourced for the duration of the advisor team mission one way of organizing for this role is to have an eleven person team with clearly divided responsibilities each persons duties should reflect his responsibilities to the internal team and to advising their hn security force counterpart in certain situa tions the partner unit commander might need to provide security element to support an advisor team this security element might need to be large enough to guard compound on an hn security force base and to crew several vehicles

seven tasks measure assess organize rebuildbuild facilities train equip advise and mentor the memory aid morteam can help partner units and advisors thes tasks incorporate all doctrine organization training material leadership and education personnel and facilities dotmlpf requirements for developing the hn security forces although described sequentially these tasks are normally performed concurrently for example training and quipping operations must be integrated and as the operation progresses assessments will lead to changes if us forces are direc tly involved in operations against insurgents the development program requires transition period during which major coin operations are handed over to hn security forces figure 85 shows the six framework tasks as an iterative and cyclical process in which both advisor teams and partner units measure and mentor hn security force units at each step chapter 8 88 fmi 3242 figure 85 seven framework tasks measure assess host nation security forces 823 commanders of advisor units and partner units mu st measure and assess the hn security forces as part of the comprehensive program of analyzing the oe and the insurgency the partner unit and advisor team must work closely in assessing the quality of hn security forces from the assessment planners develop short mid nd longrange goals and programs as circumstances change so do the goals and programs in measuring the state of the host nations security forces it may be determined that some existing security forces are so dysfunctional or corrupt that the organizations must be disbanded rather than rehabilitated in some cases commanders will need to replace some hn leaders before their units will become functional while every situation is different leader s of the development program should assess and measure the following hn security force factors throughout planning preparation and execution of the operation social structure organization demographi cs interrelationships and education levels of security force elements extent of acceptance of ethnic and religious minorities laws and regulations governing the security for ces and their relationship to national leaders corruption abuse of power and nepotism equipment and facilities with priority placed on maintenance logistic and support structure and its ab ility to meet the forces requirements the units methods and proficiency at conducting coin operations state of training at all levels and the specialties and education of leaders support to host nation security forces fmi 3242 89 assessment techniques 824 hn security forces must be trained and tactica lly proficient for some time before they are considered as ready to conduct operations on their own us partner units are responsible for the mentoring training and welfare of their hn counterparts advisors assigned to the unit provide the daytoday connection but are not sufficiently equipped to do ev erything required to build well trained well led sustainable and professional force nations armed force that behaves unprofessionally can quickly lose legitimacy which is needed to c onduct counterinsurgency operations nd draw quality recruits when the us military mission fails to prepare hn security forces to take the leada key political objectiveunity of effort suffers at many levels the results are often corruption nepotism and bureaucracy which generate obstacles to units who must rapidly adapt to the insurgent strategies and tactics due to these factors the hn will eventually lose the ability to persevere against steadfast insurgent fighting protracted war 825 us forces often choose to use readiness asse ssment of an hn security force unit figure 86 shows an example format fo r readiness assessment figure 86 example format for readiness assessment assessment periods 826 assessing host nation security forces should be done for three distinct periods of timeshort mid and long consider ations for each include short 827 the advisor and partner unit are involved in the training of the host nation security force unit an example of short term goal for an advisor unit would be ensuring that the hn operations officer is tracking all of his units conducting missions an example for partner unit would be training the hn soldiers on marksmanship and room clearing chapter 8 810 fmi 3242 mid 828 the hn unit is more selfsufficient but still not fully capable and the advisor acts in supervisory role an example of midrange goal for an advisor unit would be ensuring that the hn staff plans for logistical support during missions an example of mid range goal for partner unit would be training platoon size units to move tactically during patrols long 829 the hn unit can conduct training pl anning logistics and operati ons with little guidance and the advisor provides oversight and mentorship an example of advisor unit longrange goal would be to ensure that the hn intelligence officer gathers analyzes and disseminates intelligence and is fully integrated into the planning process an example of partner l ongrange goal would be to migrate to providing only the additional forces and quickreaction force qrf capabilities to the host nation security force unit assessing methods and proficiency 830 the training leadership equipment logistics and operations of host nation security forces must be assessed if us advisors are not on the objective with the host nation forces us forces may not know their capabilities assessment of hn security forces may include their ability to plan and brief an operation perform correct actions on contact properly clear and mark rooms halls and stairwells perform other small unit tasks appropriate to the hn oe use ncos employ fire control measures and maintain fire control call for air reserves or quick reaction force sustain themselves with class i iii and v supplies and provide medical support maintain vehicles and equipment maintain professionalism organize 831 organizing hn forces depends on the host nati ons social and economic conditions cultural and historical factors and security threat the development programs aim is to create an efficient organization with command intelligence logistic and operations structure that makes sense for the host nation conventional forces with limited specialpurpose teams such as explosive ordnance disposal and special weapons and tactics swat are preferred elite units tend to divert large share of the best leadership and remove critical talent from the regular forces doctrine should be standard across the force as should unit structures the orga nization must facilitate the collec tion processing and dissemination of intelligence across and thr oughout all security forces 832 in many situations simple personnel accountability is one of the greatest impediments to effective organizations the advisor team should mentor and dvise the host nation security forces on keeping better accountability formations timelines and uniform standards can be slow to be accepted which can stem from lack of supplies also it is important that the unit can manage its leave and pass system once achieved this will further the capabilities of the host nation unit and allow them to focus on operations and training not troops to task organizational structure 833 as much as possible the host nation should determine the security force organizations structure the host nation may be open to proposals from us fo rces but should approve ll organizational designs as the hn government strengthens us leaders and trainers should expect increasingly independent organizational decisions these may include changing th numbers of forces types of units and internal organizational designs culture and c onditions might result in security forces being given what may be support to host nation security forces fmi 3242 811 considered nontraditional roles and missions hn po lice may be more paramilitary than their us counterparts and the military may have role in in ternal security eventually police and military roles should clearly differ poli ce should counter crime while the milita ry should address external threats however the exact nature of these missions depends on the hn situation in any event police and military roles should be clearly delineated organizational types 834 the daytoday troopstotask requi rements and priorities of effort requires wide assortment of host nation security forces to conduct counterinsu rgency operations although the police force should be the frontline of coin security forces other units are required to assist the police on temporary basis until the police can conduct operations on their own police forces are not equipped or trained in operating in high intensity situations military 835 military forces might have to perform police duties at the start of an insurgency however it is best to establish police forces to assume these duties as soon as po ssible few military units can match good police unit in developing an accurate human inte lligence picture of their ao because of their frequent contact with populace police often are the best force for countering small insurgent bands supported by the local populace 836 although the long term objectives in training host nation militaries need to focus on foreign defense realities of counterinsurgenci often dictate that the military establish civil security and civil control commanders must ensure that military units coordinate with local police with respect to intelligence gathering interacting with civilians and civil affairs 837 host nation security force unit will be tasko rganized into elements that can accomplish one of three functionsconducting offensive operations conducting defensive operations and implementing civil control these organizations sizes vary base d on the operational environment the components the elements and dynamics of the insurgency and the phase of the counterinsurgency host nation security force must also have c2 reserve and some form of logistics support offensive force 838 hn unit needs the capability to conduct ffensive operations as well as specific counterinsurgency operations such as search and att acks raids cordon and searches ambushes and site exploitation due to the elusive nature of the insurgent this force may be the smallest organization in the unit defensive force 839 hn unit needs to have the ability to conduct defensive opera tions typically hn counterinsurgency units focus on executing area defens at the tactical level that includes securing important events critical infrastructure and bases depending on the phase of the counterinsurgency and insurgent capabilities this force may be quite large civil control or constabulary force 840 hn unit needs to have force that contributes to national security as well as performs police duties and civil functions typically this type of force conducts tasks associated with the civil control loe such as manning checkpoints gathering intelligence c onducting investigations into crimes and attacks and performing reconnaissance often the largest for ce it has constant interaction with the population which increases security of both the unit and the population historical and current examples include the philippine constabulary the italian carabinieri the iraqi national police and haitian constabulary chapter 8 812 fmi 3242 police 841 the primary frontline coin force is often the policenot the military however the police are only part of the rule of law common roles of the po lice forces are to investigate crimes provide traffic control preserve the peace by reso lving simple disputes and civil di sturbance control police require support from code of law judicial courts and penal system such support provides coherent and transparent system that imparts justice upholding the rule of law so requires other civil institutions and an hn ability to support the legal system if parts of the rule of law do not work then commanders must be prepared to meet detention requirements 842 countering an insurgency requires police force that is visible day and night the host nation will not gain legitimacy if the populace believes that insurgents and crimin als control the streets wellsited and protected police stations can establish presence in communities which secures communities and builds support for the hn government daily contact with locals gives police chance to collect information for counterinsurgents 843 police might be organized on national or local basis whatever police organization is established soldiers must understand it and help the host nation effectively organize and use it this often means dealing with several police organizations and developing plans for training and advising each one formal link or liaison channel must exist between the hn police hn military forces and us forces this channel for coordination deconfliction and in formation sharing enables successful coin operations police often consist of several independent but mutually supporting forces these may include criminal and traffic police border police transport police for security of rail lines and public transport specialized police forces internal affairs paramilitary 844 success in counterinsurgency depends on isolating the insurgent from the population insurgents intimidate the population into passive support and prevent the population from providing information to counterinsurgent units techni to combat this is to establish paramilitary organization paramilitary forces are designed to support the rule of law and stabilize the operating environment particularly for when the hn police forces and military forces are standingup organizing temporary in nature the paramilitary units mandate should be twofold it needs to provide the population with means of securing themselves it should have the means to gather and report intelligence about the insurgency it can sometimes be used covertly to target insurgents within higher headquarters guidance organization 845 once citizen leaders are identified units can work with locals in organizing the paramilitary units the units need to have recognizable uniforms standard light weapons and salary the salaries will take away from the insurgen t recruitment base limitations 846 paramilitary organizations s hould be prevented from conducti ng offensive operations they should also be monitored closely for insu rgent infiltration or abuse of power demobilization 847 eventually the best way to demobilize paramilitary force might be to integrate part of it into the hn military or police force support to host nation security forces fmi 3242 813 corrections 848 if counterinsurgents seek to dele gitimize an insurgency by criminalizing it then the host nation must establish robust corrections system counterinsurgency with this goal should be provided with more robust armament than in stable governments the situations in iraq and afghanistan are not the first time us forces have created host nation security forces fr om scratch and allowed them to win in counterinsurgency the philippineamerican war began in 18 98 and ended officially in 1902 but hostilit ies remained until 1913 the war was not popular one in the united states but resu lted in stable and free philippine republic the philippine constabulary pc was established on august 8 1901 to assist the united states military in combati ng the remaining filipino revolutionaries the pc was entrusted into the hands of captain henry t allen named as the chief of the forc and later dubbed as the father of the philippine constabulary with the help of four other army officers captain allen organized the force trained equipped and armed the men as best as could be done under difficult conditions general henry adler said it best when he said for some time to come the number of troops to be kept here shoul d be direct function of the number of guns put into the hands of the nativesit is unw ise to ignore the great moral effect of strong armed force above suspicion the constabulary was instrumental in defeating the insurgency originally officered by americans the filipinos sl owly over took ll operations of the unit at tactical level they were initially used to augment us forces and moved into having their own area of operations in july of 1901 the us army garrisoned 491 positions and by december it only garrisoned 372 positions although poorly armed wi th shotguns and revolvers the constabulary soon maintained owner ship of entire provinces rebuild or build facilities 849 hn security forces need infrastructure support so ldiers and police need buildings for storage training and shelter often requirements include barracks ranges motor pools and other military facilities construction takes time the host nation needs to invest early in such facilities if they are to be available when needed protection must be considered in any infrastructure design including headquarters facilities since infrastructure is an attractive target fo r insurgents see fm 5104 for information on hardening measures to increase infrastructure survivability and improve protection 850 during an insurgency hn military and police forces often operate from local bases building training centers and unit garrisons requires longte rm forcebasing plan if possible garrisons should include housing for the commissioned officers ncos and families gove rnmentprovided medical care for the families and other benefits that make national service attractive 851 the easiest way for partner unit to do this is to build combined f acility to house both itself and the hn unit as the situation improves the host nation security forces can occupy the entire compound once the partner unit leaves 852 advisor units can use funding that they have to build showers tents toilets dining facility equipment barriers and minor bu ilding renovations improving the milita ry facilities can result in an increase in the morale and performance of the hn unit chapter 8 814 fmi 3242 train 853 us and multinational training assi stance should address shortfalls at every level with the purpose of establishing selfsustaining training systems us trainers 854 soldiers assigned to training missions should receive training on the specific requirements of developing hn forces the course should emphasize the host nations cultural background introduce its language and provide cultural tips for developing good rapport with hn personnel the course should also include protection trai ning for troops working with hn forces us trainees must become familiar with the hn organization and equipment especially weapons not in the us inventory this training must emphasize the following sustaining training and reinforcing individual and team skills using the smallest possible studenttoinstructor ratio developing hn trainers training to standardsnot to time providing immediate feedback and using afteraction reviews respecting the hn culture but learning to distinguish between cultural practices and excuses learning the hn language working with interpreters establish standards 855 the host nation unit and trainers must estab lish clear measures for evaluating the training of individuals leaders and units insurgent strate gies and their corresponding responses from targeted governments vary widely co in operations require many of the same individual and collective skills performed in conventional military operations but also include additi onal requirements for coin small units execute most coin operations therefore effective coin forces require strong junior leaders soldiers and marines know how to evaluate military training metrics for eval uating units should include subjective measures such as loyalty to the hn gove rnment as well as competence in military tasks however the acceptance of values such as ethnic equa lity or the rejection of corruption is far more difficult than evaluating task performance soldiers and police 856 security force members must be developed through systematic training program the program first builds their basic skills then teaches them to work together as team and finally allows them to function as unit basic milita ry training should focus first on so ldier skills such as first aid marksmanship and fire discipline l eaders must be trained in planning tactics including patrolling urban operations or other skills necessary everyone must master the rules of engagement and the law of armed conflict required skills include the following conduct basic intelligence functions manage their security coordinate indirect fires conduct logistic planning maintenance sustainment and movement operations provide for effective medical support provide effective personnel management advisor teams 857 advisor teams are generally responsible for initial host nation unit training and then provide oversight as the host nation units implement their own training plan leader and ethics training should be integrated into all aspects of training support to host nation security forces fmi 3242 815 partner units 858 partner units play an important role in advising advisors cannot go out with every host nation operation but as almost all operations in coin are co mbined partner unit can effectively advise host nation unit partner units can be most effective at advising host nation units in the planning process especially mdmp the mdmp model may need to be modified to it the hn security force staff sections should work closely with their hn peers as part of the planning process 859 partner units might have to provide limited support or supplies to their host nation unit for example unit might provide its hn unit jp8 or cla ss viii or it might help recover disabled tank it should never create reliance on partner unit support the commander allocates partner support considering the realities of the situation 860 hn security force staffs when fully capable should be able to achieve the following operations 861 plans are synchronized with consideration given to all warfighting functions they are disseminated to appropriate personnel in timely manne r and operate within short mid and longterm framework intelligence 862 intelligence is shared with other units and agencies it is fully integrated into the planning process is bottom fed and uses multiple sensors sustainment 863 units have synchronized methods for requesti ng supplies and sustainment assets planners account for logistical capabilities during the planning process command and control 864 the command structure is unified leaders empower subordinate leaders within the commanders intent commanders visualize describe and direct their units soldiers 865 training can be divided into individual unit and staff training individual 866 individual skills training covers marksmanship first aid land navigation and individual movement techniques host nation security forces do not always have the institutional military instruction that us forces have so much of the individual skills training occurs at the unit marksmanship will be of particular concern due to the need for precise fires in coin unit 867 unit training is focused on getting host nation ba ttalions companies platoons and squads ready to conduct operations this typically means training focused on three key tasks checkpoint operations combat patrols mounted and dismounted and cordon and search operations staff 868 staff training involves training staffs to use and implement systems focused on planning logistical support intelligence integration and command and control chapter 8 816 fmi 3242 police 869 police training is best conducted as an interage ncy and multinational operation ideally leaders for police training are civilian police officers from the departments of jus tice and state along with senior police officers from multinational partners civilian poli ce forces have personnel with extensive experience in large city operations and in operating against or ganized crime groups experience countering organized crime is especially relevant to coin many insurgent groups are more similar to organized crime in their organizational structure nd relations with the populace than they ar to military units us military police units serve best when operating as support force fo r the professional civilian police trainers however military police units may be assigned the primary re sponsibility for police traini ng and they must be prepared to assume that role if required 870 higher level police skills such as civilian criminal investigation procedures antiorganized crime operations and police intelligence operationsa re best taught by civilian experts 871 effective policing also requires an effective justi ce system that can process arrests detentions warrants and other judicial records such system includes trained judges prosecutors defense counsels prison officials and court personnel these people are important to establishing the rule of law 872 military police or corrections personnel can also provide training for detention and corrections operations hn personnel should be tr ained to handle and interrogate detainees and prisoners according to internationally recognized human rights norms by the appropriate us personnel prisoner and detainee management procedures should provide for the secur ity and the fair and efficient processing of those detained 873 police forces just like military forces need quality support pers onnel to be effective this requires training teams to ensure that training in support functions is established specially trained personnel required by police forces include the following armorers supply specialists communications personnel administrative personnel vehicle mechanics leaders 874 the effectiveness of the hn security forces directly relates to the quality of their leadership building effective leaders requires comprehensive progr am of officer staff and specialized training the ultimate success of any us involvement in coin effort depends on creating viable hn leaders able to carry on the fight at all levels and build their nation on their own one of the major challenges that partner units and advisor teams may face is the perceived low quality of leader especially the junior leader ranks 875 the leader training methodology must reinforce the different levels of authority within the hn security force the roles and responsibilities of each commissioned officer and nc rank must be firmly established so recruits understand what is expected of them their subordinate relationship to civilian authorities must also be reinforced to ensure civilian control in add ition training should establish team dynamics in some cultures security forces may need training to understand the vital role of members not in primary leadership positions commissioned officers 876 officer candidate standards should be high ca ndidates should be in good health and pass an academic test with higher standards than the test for enlisted troops officer candidates 877 these should be carefully vetted to ensure that they do not have close ties to any radical or insurgent organizations support to host nation security forces fmi 3242 817 basic officer training 878 various models for basic officer training exist oneyear military college twoyear military college fouryear military college officer candidate school military training at civilian universities additional training 879 in addition to tactical skills commissioned officers should be trained in accountability decisionmaking delegation authority values and ethics special coin training should address intelligence collection and legal considerations day and night patrolling site security cordon and search operations operations with other us forces other hn governmental agencies intergovernmental organizations nongovernmental organizations treatment of detainees and prisoners psychological operations civil military operations negotiations ethnic and religious sensitivity noncommissioned officers 880 professional and effective security forces all ve professional nco corps ncos need training in tactical skills accountability values and ethics relations and responsibilities between the officer and nco corps should be clearly defined and should empower the nco corps units often create special nco academies to train ncos fro m partner host national units civilian leaders 881 additionally host nation civilian leaders may need specific training to improve their skills and performance these key representatives might include city mayor officials from public works utilities transportation and communication local police chief firefighting officials superintendent of schools religious leaders health and medical fficials and leaders judicial representatives editors of local news media business and commercial leaders augmenting 882 this is an arrangement where the host nation provides either individuals or elements to us units or vice versa augmentation can occur at number of levels and in many different forms for example us squad can be augmented with hn individuals us company can be augmented with an hn platoon chapter 8 818 fmi 3242 and us battalion can be augmented with an hn company the benefit of this type of training strategy is that host nation security forces can emulate us forces in actual combat operations in addition us forces can gain valuable cultural language and intelligencegathering skills typically chain of command will be agreed upon prior to execution howev er command may be executed as partnership figure 87 shows an example of how augmenting unit can be implemented figure 87 augmentation of an example unit equip 883 the requirement to provide equipment may be as simple as assisting with maintenance of existing formations or as extensive as providing everything from shoes and clothing to vehicles communications and investigation kits if insurgents use heavy mach ine guns and rocketpropelled grenades hn security forces need comparable or better equipment this especially applie s to police forces which are often lightly armed and vulnerable to wellarmed insurgents 884 primary considerations should include main tainability ease of operation and longterm sustainment costs few developing nations can suppor t highly complex equipment in coin operations having many versatile vehicles that require simple maintenance is often better than having few highly capable armored vehicles or combat systems that re quire extensive maintenance developing an effective hn maintenance system may begins with major maintenance performed by contractors the program then progresses to partnership arrangements with us for ces as hn personnel are trained to perform the support mission advise 885 advisors are the most prominent group of us personnel that serve with hn units advisors live work and fight with their hn units segregation is kept to an absolute minimum the relationship between advisors and hn forces is vital us partner unit commanders must remember that advisors are not liaison officers nor do they command hn units additionally partner units regularly advise their hn security force counterparts support to host nation security forces fmi 3242 819 886 effective advisors are an enormous force enhancer the importance of the j ob means that the most capable individuals should fill thes positions advisors should be soldiers known to take the initiative and set the standards for others 887 professional knowledge and competence win the resp ect of hn troops effective advisors develop healthy rapport with hn personnel but avoid the mptation to adopt hn positi ons contrary to us or multinational values or policy 888 advisors who understand the hn military culture understand that local politics have national effects effective advisors recognize and use cultural factors that support hn commitment and teamwork good advisor uses the cultures positive aspects to get the best performance from each security force member and leader guidelines 889 important guidelines for advisors include remain patient be subtle in guiding host nation counterparts explain the benefits of an action and convince them to accept the idea as their own respect the rank and positions of host nation counterparts exercise diplomacy in correcti ng host nation security forces praise each success and work to instill pride in the unit work to continually train and improve the unit even in the combat zone help the commander develop unit sops know light infantry tactics and unit security procedures use confidence missions to validate training understand that an advisor is not the unit commander but an enabler the host nation commander makes decisions and commands the unit advisors help with this task train host nation units to standard and fight alongside them consider host nation limitations and adjust flexibility is key it is impossible to plan completely for everything in this type of operation constantly look forward to the next issue and be ready to develop solutions to problems that cannot be answered with doctrinal solution remember that most actions have longterm strategic implications try to learn enough of the language for simple conversation at minimum greetings keep host nation counterparts informed try not to hide agendas remain prepared to act as lia ison to multinational assets especi ally air support and logistics maintain liaison with civil affairs and humanitarian teams in the area of operations remain ready to advise on the maintenance of equipment and supplies stay integrated with the unit eat their food do not become isolated from them remain aware of the operations in the immediate area to prevent fratricide insist on host nation adherence to the recognized human rights standards concerning treatment of civilians detainees and captured insurgents report any violation to the chain of command remain objective in reports on host nation unit and leader proficiency report gross corruption or incompetence maintain proper military bearing and professional manner advisor teams 890 advisor teams link host nation its and us partner units to fill the gaps of the hns supply system they have the ability to bring attention to shortfalls in equipment both to their higher us chain of command and through their chain of command the host nation higher headquarters the advisor should ensure that the host nation l ogistical system is bei ng used properly first in addition the advisor team may assist by hand walking his hn counterpart through the hn system chapter 8 820 fmi 3242 891 advisor teams often have authority to provide tactical equipment such as radios through their appropriated funds the advisor team must use this money since it is one of the few forms of leverage they posses 892 it is important to note that advisors should not use bribery or coercion since results achieved from these actions are only temporary as soon as the pay ment is made or the force is removed the host nation counterpart has reason to comply in practice these techniques are not efficient and will not achieve the longterm goal of deve loping proficiency competence and initiative in the counterpart advisor art and science 893 the most important mission of an advisor is to enhance the military professionalism of his counterpart rapport credibility and legitimacy can only be established through time proximity and interaction advisors mentor hn leadership at every opportunity partner units are engaged in every aspect of the hns development 894 advisors sleep and eat daily with hn security for ce units they must leave the wire the closer they operate with the hn security force the faster the unit will improve the social and cultural aspects of the mission are just as or more important than patrolling with the unit 895 just as the credibility of us advisors is critical for influencing the leadership and men of the hn security force the actions of these advisor teams are equally vital to winning the populations confidence advisors build their credibility by contact visibility technical and tactical proficiency the ability to provide resources success in battle and respectful interaction with civilians 896 often to be successful advisors partner with their hn equivalents for instance us leaders partner with hn leaders us sta ffs partner with hn staffs us so ldiers partner with hn soldiers 897 combat advisors go on patrol and operations in order to lead and advise by example share the risk improve legitimacy and unity of effort bond with the counterparts coordinate assets cas qrf eod prevent fratricide provide accurate and specific aars prevent report remedy human rights violations gather information for intelligence ensure site exploitation is thorough ensure evidence is correctly gathered and processed improve situational awareness challenges 898 us advisors and units share the same challenge s and often develop the same practices some of these practices are negative while others are positive some challenges are common to all us advisors and units they include aspects often referred to as the american military culture 899 just as in counterinsurgency operations advising is an iterative process the advisor team and the hn unit will not get it right the first time however both the hn unit and the advisor team must learn and adapt faster than insurgents 8100 some typical advisor challenges include adjusting to native cuisine can pose problem for the advisor refusal to accept food and beverages when offered might be considered an insult the advisor does not become discouraged t all advice will be accepted some will be implemented later support to host nation security forces fmi 3242 821 the advisor cannot forget that careless word or action can cost the united states dearly in good will and cooperation that may have been established with great effort and at considerable cost the advisor does not criticize hn policy in front of hn personnel it is the advisors obligation to support the incumbent government just as he does his own this obligation is us national policy the advisor studies his counter part to determine his persona lity and background he makes every effort to establish and maintain friendl relationships he learns something about his counterparts personal life and demonstrates an interest in his likes and dislikes the advisor recognizes and observes military cour tesy and local customs and courtesies he recognizes that in many cultures observance of formal courtesies must take place before other business can be conducted when in doubt he leans toward the polite the advisor does not get caught up in personality clashes be tween hn officerspersonnel the advisor keeps in mind that hn partners may consider persontoperson relationships more important than organizational frameworks the advisor may have to deal with the hn norms regarding time and timeliness advising principles 8101 advising principles can best be described as shown in figure 88 by with and through not counting immediate action battle drill responses the mark of an effective advisory effort is the amount of stake the host nation secu rity forces take in their own operations empathy leads to cultural competence truly understanding other human beings and where they come from allows honest relationships to develop these relationships are critical factors of success success is built on personal relationships this relationship is likely to be tested on numerous occasions nd challenges only one built on solid relationship of mutual trust can survive and ensure mission success advisors are not them increasing the advisors level of frustrati on is the rapid realiz ation that when the dealing with partner units advisors are not one of them the advisors are often alone navigating between two military sy stems and two cultures never quite fitting in with either of them you will never winnor should you the advisor attaining tactical objec tive does not achieve success success is achieved by the host nation forces achieving the objective advisors are not commanders advisors are not intended to lead host nati on security forces in combat they are ultimately responsible for command and control only of their wn small team of us combat advisors advisors are honest brokers advisors are advocates for the host nati on security forces with partner units living with shades of gray advisors will likely find themselves isol ated with great autonomy often with supervision and will encounter moral and ethical dilemmas on daily basis talent is everything but understand rank the paradox lies in that in some host na tion forces recognized talent can take back seat to rank advisors must understand that rank on the uniform is important to many armies but it is skin deep the ways around rank are the relationship and talent make do advisors will never have everything t hat they feel they need to succeed scrounging bartering and horsetrading ar daily activities of the combat advisor an enormous amount of energy must be devoted to these ctivities these efforts will not only help the adv isor achieve mission success but also endear him to his counterpart figure 88 principles of advising chapter 8 822 fmi 3242 advisor relationship with host nation peers 8102 the advisor spends maximum time with the unit so the troops get to know and trust him the advisor talks to and gets to know the troops not just the unit leaders so he r eceives excellent feedback through the common soldiers candid comments such comments often reflect troop morale and operational effectiveness he stays abreast of what is going on in the unit by staying in close contact with the commander and staff the advisor encourages frequent command inspections by the commander in some cultures this action is new concept or not comm on practice many hn commanders are reluctant to inspect they rely solely on correspondence and reports to evaluate unit effectiveness the advisor continually stre sses the obvious advantages of good militarycivilian relations to avoid the idea of military arrogance which irritates the civilian populace the development of proper soldiercivilian relationship is cr itical factor in counterinsurgency improper behavior by soldiers toward civilians must be immediately corrected the advisor keeps training standards high so that the unit is prepared fo r combat at all times the advisor stresses human rights and the consequences of mistreating suspects and prisoners the advisor constantly promotes unit espritdecorps to sustain the unit in the face of difficulties the advisor persuades the hn personnel to pass information up down and laterally mentor 8103 effective mentorship is based on mutual respect building relationships and trust maintaining patience is the key in developing positive situations for mentorship all of which will go into the building of an effective team both advisor teams and partner units have equal ability to mentor if the conditions have been set respect 8104 in order to get respect mentors need to give it relationship 8105 mentors need to have good working relationship with host nation forces trust 8106 the best way to gain trust is through shared dange r and hardship nothing builds trust faster than facing the enemy together team 8107 the end state should be unity of effort for the advisor team the hn unit and the partner unit if recommendation is made to the host nation unit mentors should move on if every recommendation becomes point of contention the mutual respect and relationship that has been carefully cultivated will be damaged figure 89 shows the process that is needed to build relationship that ultimately develop s into an effective team giving respect sets the conditions for trust and finally good team where mentoring can occur afteraction reviews 8108 central element in improving performance is the afteraction review aar in order for the hn forces to sustain and improve their capabilities an aar should be conducted by the hn unit commander and facilitated by the advisor team all key personnel should be pres ent both hn and us 8109 while not all cultures are open to criticism this is not an acceptable excuse for not identifying weaknesses do not let hn security forces avoid their own shortfalls however the critical aspect of an support to host nation security forces fmi 3242 823 aar must be approached very carefully one outlook is to remain focused on the desired end state the end state of the aar is not to assign blame but to identify plan to sustain strengths and improve the weaknesses 8110 the whole point of aars is to improve if an issue is unit wide or reoccurring talk to the leadership and come up with solution then let them announce the issue and solution for practical purposes there are usually three subsets of aars with host nation units the hn aar commanders oneonone aar and an internal advisor aar figure 89 teambuilding process host nation aar 8111 first an advisor should never take credit for an idea instead they should empower their counterpart discuss the issue and come up with the solution together even if he has the answer the point is that advisors are mentoring them to come up with solutions of their own in the future second by giving them the credit and making them look good the leader w ill more readily come to the advisors for advice and take advice more readily in the future 8112 advisors should cover all activities and salient points sustainment nd improvement for each phase of the operation including information enga gements the aar should conclude with plan to followup and make improvements as necessary just as with us forces an aar with the hn security forces is not only potentially of great value but it is also potentially full of pitfalls to evaluate the hn security forces the advisors should assess at minimum leadership level of training demonstrated on operations use and effectiveness of administ rativelogistics as applicable professionalism to include human rights and dealing with civilians 8113 advisors need to bring up general positive points with the groups but they should refrain from singling out leader staff soldier or unit to provide criticism in front of others the us military culture of group aars to discuss all mistakes is techni we find valuable because our culture accepts it as important for improvement most other culture s do not accept pointing out criticisms of one person or group to another the advisor should take that member or unit aside and discuss the issue let them talk about how to improve this point in productive way figure 810 shows an example aar for host nation security force after and operation commanders oneonone 8114 remember some aar points are best kept between the advisor and the host nation commander internal advisor aar 8115 in order to effectively advise hn security for ces the us advisor team should also conduct an internal aar focusing on what the t eam must sustain and improve an internal aar is for the advisors only and should cover three primary topics chapter 8 824 fmi 3242 conduct of advisors and us partner conduct of the hn security force review roeeof for effectivene ss and compliancetraining level employment of newly trained forces in coin 8116 building the morale and confidence of hn security forces should be long term objective committing poorly trained and badly led forces results in high casualties and invites tactical defeats while defeat in small operation may have little effect on the outcome of conventional war even small tactical defeat of hn security forces can have serious strategic consequences since coin is largely about perceptions effective insurgent leaders can quickly turn minor wins into major propaganda victories in short the hn security forces must be prepared for operations so that they have every possible advantage the decision to commit units to their first actions and their employment method requires careful consideration as much as possible hn security forces should begin with simpler missions as their confidence and competence grows these for ces can assume more complex assignments figure 810 example host nation security force aaroperation summary 8117 newly trained

col c callwell small wars 1896 the complexity of an insurgency and increased number of variables and their infinite combinations increases the difficulty of providing timely relevant and effective intelligence support to counterinsurgency coin operations conducted effectively however the intelligence preparation of the battlefield ipb allows commanders to develop the situa tional understanding necessary to visualize describe and direct subordinates in successfully accomplishing the mission overview a1 ipb is the systematic process of analyzing the threat and environment in specific geographic areathe area of operations ao and its associated ar ea of interest figure a1 it provides the basis for intelligence support to current and future operati ons drives the military decisionmaking process and supports targeting and battle damage assessment the procedure as well as each of its four steps is performed continuously throughout the planning preparation and execution of coin operation figure a1 the steps of ipb increased complexity a2 uncovering intricate relationships takes time careful analysis and constant refinement to determine actual effects on friendly and threat courses of action coas these relationships exist among population groups the infrastructure appendix a2 fmi 3242 the historical cultural political or economic significance of the area in relation to surrounding urban and rural areas or the nation as whole the physical effects of the natural and manmade terrain a3 primary goal of any ipb is to accurately predict the threats likely coa step fourwhich may include political social religious informational economic and military actions commanders can then develop their own coas that maximize and apply combat power at decisive points understanding the decisive points in counterinsurgency operations allows commanders to select objectives that are clearly defined decisive and attainable reduced uncertainty and its effects a4 commanders and their staffs may be unfamiliar w ith the intricacies of counterinsurgency and more adept at thinking and planning in other nvironments therefore without detailed situational understanding commanders may assign missions that their subordinate forces may not be able to achieve as importantly commanders and their staffs ma miss critical opportunities because they appear overwhelming or impossible and concede the initiative to the threat they also may fail to anticipate potential threat coas afforded by the distinctive operational environment commanders may fail to recognize that the least likely thr eat coa may be the one adopted precise ly because it is least likely and therefore may be intended to maximize surprise misunderstanding the aos effect on potential friendly and threat coas may rapidly lead to mission failure and the unnecessary loss of soldiers lives and other resources thorough ipb of the ao can greatly redu ce uncertainty and contribute to mission success amplified importance of civil considerations a5 in coin operations the terrain and enemy are still essential considerations but the societal component of the coin environment is considered more closely and throughout the operational process moreover the human or civil considerations gain importance in coin or stability operations as discussed in chapter one key tool for the counterinsurgent unit is analyzing civil considerations using ascope overall population effects are significant in how they impact the threat army forces and overall accomplishment of strategic and operational goals a6 describing the battlefields effectsstep two in ipbascribes meaning to the characteristics analyzed it helps commanders understand how the environment enhances or degrades friendly and insurgent forces and capabilities it also helps commanders unders tand how the environment supports the population it also explains how changes in th normal environment intentional or unintentional and because of insurgent or friendl activities may affect the population included in this assessment are matters of perception at each step of the ipb process commanders must try to determine the hn populations perceptions of ongoing activities to ensu re army operations are viewed as intended throughout this process commanders staffs and analysts cannot allow their biasescultural organizational personal or cognitiveto markedly influence or alter their assessment see fm 343 this particularly applies when they anal yze the societal aspect of the opera tional environment with so many potential groups and varied interests in such limited area misperception is always risk signifigant characteristics in coin a7 coin intelligence analysis must include consideration of the aos distinguishing attributes terrain society infrastructure and the threat because the coin envir onment is so complex it is often useful to break it into categories then commanders can understand the in tricacies of the environment that may affect their operations and assimilate this information into clear mental images commanders can then synthesize these images of the ao w ith the current status of friendly and threat forces and develop desired end state then they can determine the most decisive sequence of activities that will move their forces from the current state to the end state identifying and understanding the environments characteristics from counterinsurgent insurgent and hn populations perspective allows commanders intelligence preparation of the battlefield fmi 3242 a3 to establish and maintain situational understanding then they can develop appropriate coas and rules of engagement that will lead to decisive mission accomplishment a8 figures a2 and a3 are not allencompassing lists of coin characteristics instead they provide starting point or outline useful for conducting coinfocused ipb and analysis that can be modified to fit the specific operational environment and meet the commanders requirements commanders and staffs can compare the categories presented with those in the civil affairs area study and assessment format found in fm 30540 and the ipb considera tions for stability operati ons found in st 2911 interconnected systems a9 since the coin environment comp rises an interconnected system of systems considerations among the key elements of the environment will overlap during coin intelligence analysis for example boundaries regions or areas relate to physical location on the ground hence they have terrain implications these boundaries regions or areas ofte n stem from some histor ical religious political administrative or social aspect that could also be considered character istic of the society overlaps can also occur in specific category ch as infrastructure for instance dams are consideration for their potential effects on transportation and distribution mobility administration and human services water supply and energy hydroelectric a10 this overlap recognition is critical concern for commanders and their sta ffs in taking apart the coin environment and analyzing the pieces comma nders and staffs cannot perspective of how each piece interacts with any other and as part of the whole otherwise their vi sion will be shortsighted and they will fail to recognize the secondand thirdor der effects of their proposed coas the actual end state differing dramatically from the one envisioned by the commander the increased density of combatants and noncombatants in frastructure and complex terrain m eans that given action will likely have unintended consequencespositive or negative those consequences will be more widely felt and their impact will spread in less time than in other environments these unintended results may have important strategic and operational consequences the multiple ways these dynamic coin elements and characteristics combine make it necessary to appr oach each coin environment as unique challenge for intelligence analysis terrain and weather a11 earlier admonitions that civil considerations are more closely considered in coin do not necessarily mean that considerations for terrain and weather are deemphasized terrain a12 in every coin operation terrain and its effects on both threat and friendly forces must be assessed and understood then commanders can quickly choose and exploit the terrain and weather conditions that best supports their missions effective terrain analysis thoroughly assesses structures as well as the ground on which they stand figure a2 an analysis of terrain first considers broader characteristics and effects and then progr esses to more detailed examination natural terrain a13 natural terrain features significantly influence unit operations they dictate where buildings can be constructed the slopes and patterns of streets and even the broad patterns that develop over longer periods all of which influence units scheme of maneuver the military aspects of terrainobservation and fields of fire avenues of approach key terrain obstacles and cover and c oncealment oakoc remain critical to the

be analyzed using oakoc weather a15 weather and its effects are often considered when examining the military aspects of terrain military aspects of weather include temperature h eat and cold light cond itions precipitation cloud cover rain snow fog and smog and wind their military effects during coin are similar to any operational environment see fm 3481 and fm 34811 extremes of heat and cold affect weapon systems and the soldiers that operate them precipitation affects mobility and visibility a16 commanders also analyze weather for its potential effect on civilians and civilian infrastructure as well as soldiers and military equipment rain might create sewage overflow problems in areas with collapsed sewage infrastructure increasing disease and even creating panic rain and flooding may also make some subsurface areas impassable or extremely hazardous to civilian and military forces alike other weather effects on coin can include heavy snowfall may paralyze area transportation and distribution infrastructure hindering the governments ability to provide vital human rvices police fire fighting medical and rescue heavy rains and flooding may have similar effects especially on poorly designed and constructed roads or roads that have been damaged by tracked vehicles extreme hot and cold weather climates which increase the dependence and military significance of

tropical areas rain can occur at the same time each day during the wet season threat forces may attack during these periods knowing aircraft will have difficulty responding bad weather also reduces the effectiveness of surveillance direct and indir ect fire and logistic support inclement weather may preclude demonstrations or rallies by threats good weather may mean maximum turnout of civilians

and severe dust storms may disr upt leaflet drops construction projects food and water distribution and medical and veterinary assistance programs society a17 this manual shows that societal considerations take on added importance in coin critical to operational success is knowing and understanding which groups live in an area what relationships exist among them and how each population group will res pond to friendly and threat activities often determining any of this is very difficult cultural acuity is also essential in helping commanders and their staffs to view the area as the residents view it th demographics presented show what conditions exist while the other categories help to explain the root causes or why conditions exist figure a3 other categories besides basic

opportunity to competeand possibly winthe competition the australian army officer graciously agreed and pulled the essay from the contest the article is reprin ted in this appendix with permission from the mayjune 2006 issue of military review and formatted to fit this publication introduction c1 your company has just been warned about possible deployment for counterinsurgency operations in iraq or afghanistan you have read david galula lawrence and robert thompson you have studied fm 324 and now understand the history philosophy and theory of counterinsurgency you have also watched black hawk down and the battle of algiers and you know this will be the most difficult challenge of your life c2 but what does all that theory m ean at the company level how do the principles translate into action at night with the gps down the media criticizing you the locals compla ining in language you dont understand and an unseen enemy killing your people by ones and twos how does counterinsurgency actually happen c3 there are universal answers and insurgen ts are among the most adaptive opponents you will ever face countering them will demand every ounce of your intellect but be comforted you are not the first to feel this way there are tactical fundamentals you can apply to link the theory with the techniques and procedures you already know what is counterinsurgency c4 if you have not studied c ounterinsurgency theory here it is in nutshell counterinsurgency is competition with the insurg ent for the right to win the hearts minds and acquiescence of the population you are being sent in because the in surgents at their strongest can def eat anything with less strength than you but you have more combat power than you can or should use in most situations injudicious use of firepower creates blood feuds homeless people and societal disruption that fuel and perpetuate the insurgency the most beneficial actions are often local politics civic action and beatcop behaviors for your side to win the people dont have to like you but they must re spect you accept that your actions benefit them and trust your integrity and ability to deliver on promises particularly regarding their security in this battlefield popular perceptions and rumor are more in fluential than the facts and more powerful than hundred tanks c5 within this context what follows are observations from collective experience the distilled essence of what those who went before you learned they are expressed as commandments for clarity but are really more like folklore apply them judiciously and skeptically appendix c c2 fmi 3242 preparation c6 time is short during predeployment but you will never have more time to think than you ve now this is your chance to prepare yourself and your command 1 know your turf know the people the topography economy history religion and culture know every village road field population group tribal leader and anci ent grievance your task is to become the world expert on your district if you dont know precisely where you will be operating study the general area r ead the map like book study it every night before sleep and redraw it from memory ev ery morning until you understand its patterns intuitively develop mental model of your area framework in which to fit every new piece of knowledge you acquire study handover notes from predecessors better still get in touch with the unit in theater and pick their leaders brains in an ideal world intelligence officers and area experts would brief you however this rarely happens and even if it does there is substitute for personal mastery understand the broader area of influence which can be wide area particularly when insurgents draw on global grievances share out aspects of the operational area among platoon leader s and noncommissioned officers have each individual develop personal specialization nd brief the others neglect this knowledge and it will kill you 2 diagnose the problem once you know your area and its people you can begin to diagnose the problem who are the insurgents what dr ives them what makes local leaders tick counterinsurgency is fundamentally comp etition between each side to mobilize the population in support of its agenda so you must understand what motivates the people and how to mobilize them you need to know why and how the insurgents are getting followers this means you need to know your real enemy not cardboard cutout the enemy is adaptive resourceful and probably grew up in the region where you will be operating the locals have known him since he was boy how long have they known you your worst opponent is not the psychopathic terrorist of hollywood it is the charismatic followme warrior who would make your best platoon leader his followers are not misled or naïve much of his success may be due to bad government policies or security forces that alienate the population work this problem collectively with your platoon and squad leaders discuss ideas explore the problem understand what you are facing and seek consensus if this sounds unmilitary get over it once you are in theater situations will arise too quickly for orders or even commanders intent corporals and privates will have to make snap judgments with strategic impact the only way to help them is to give them shared understanding then trust them to think for themselves on the day 3 organize for intelligence in counterinsurgency killing th enemy is easy finding him is often nearly impossible intelligence and operations are complementary your operations will be intelligencedriven but intelligence will come mostly from your own operations not as product prepared and served up by higher headquarters so you must organize for intelligence you will need company s2 and an intelligence section including analysts you might need platoon s2s and s3s and you will need r econnaissance and surveillance rs element you will not have enough lingui stsyou never dobut carefully consider where best to use them linguists are ba ttlewinning asset but like any other scarce resource you must have prioritized bump plan in case you lose them often during predeployment the best use of linguists is to train your command in basic language you will probably not get augmentation for all this but you must still do it put the smartest soldiers in the s2 section and the rs squad you will have one less rifle squad but the intelligence section will pay for itself in lives and effort saved 4 organize for interagency operations almost everything in counterinsurgency is interagency and everything important from policing to intelligence to civilmilitary operations to trash collection will involve your company working with civilian actors and local indigenous part ners you cannot control but whose success is essential for yours train the company in interagency operations get briefing from the us department twentyeight articles fundamentals of companylevel counterinsurgency fmi 3242 c3 of state aid agencies and the local police or fire brigade train pointmen in each squad to deal with the interagency pe ople realize that civilians find rifles helmets and body armor intimidating learn how not to scare them ask others who come from that country or culture about your ideas see it through the eyes of civilian who knows nothing about the military how would you react if foreigners came to your neighborhood and c onducted the operations you planned what if somebody came to your mothers house and did that most importantly know that your operations will cr eate temporary breathing space but longterm development and stabilization by civilian agencies will ultimately win the war 5 travel light and harden your co mbat service support css you will be weighed down with body armor rations extra ammunition communications gear and thousand other things the enemy will carry rifle or rocketpropelled grenade launcher shemagh head scarf and water bottle if he is lucky unle ss you ruthlessly lighten our load and enforce culture of speed and mobility the insurgents will consistently outrun and outmaneuver you but in lightening your load ma ke sure you can always reach back to call for firepower or heavy support if needed also remember to harden your c ss the enemy will attack your weakest points most attacks on coalition for ces in iraq in 2004 and 2005 outside preplanned combat actions like the two battles of falluja or operation iron horse were against css installations and convoys you do the math sure your css assets are hardened have communications and are trained in combat operations they may do more fighting than your rifle squads 6 find politicalcultural adviser in force optimized for counterinsurgency you might receive politicalcultural adviser at company level diplomat or military foreign area officer able to speak the language and navigate the intricacies of local politics back on planet earth the corps and division commander will get political advisor you will not so you must improvise find polad politicalc ultural adviser from among your people perhaps an officer perhaps not see article 8 someone with people skills and feel for the environment will do better than politicalscience graduate dont try to be your own cultural adviser you must be fully aware of the political and cultural dimension but this is different task also dont give one of your intelligence pe ople this role they can help but their task is to understand the environment the polads job is to help shape it 7 train the squad leadersthen trust them counterinsurgency is squad and platoon leaders war and often private soldiers war battles are won or lost in moments whoever can bring combat power to bear in seconds on street corner will win the commander on the spot controls the fight you must train the squad leaders to act intelligently and independently without orders if your squad leaders are competent you can get away with average company or platoon staffs the reverse is not the case training should focus on basic skills marksmanship patrolling security on the move and at the halt and basic drills when in doubt spend less time on company and platoon training and more time on squads ruthlessly replace leaders who do not make the grade but once people are trained and you have shared operational diagnosis you must trust them we talk about this but few company or platoon leaders really trust their people in counterinsurgency you have choice 8 rank is nothing talent is everything not everyone is good at counterinsurgency many people dont understand the concept and some cant execute it it is difficult and in conventional force only few people will master it anyone can learn the basics but few naturals do exist learn how to spot these people and put them into positions where they can make difference rank matters far less than talenta few good men led by smart junior noncommissioned officer can succeed in counter insurgency where hundreds of wellarmed soldiers under mediocre senior officer will fail 9 have game plan the final preparation task is to develop game plan mental picture of how you see the operation developing you will be tempted to try and do this too early but wait as your knowledge improves you will get better idea of what needs to be done appendix c c4 fmi 3242 and fuller understanding of your own limitations like any plan this plan will change once you hit the ground and it may need to be scrapped if there is major shift in the environment but you still need plan and the process of planning will give you simple robust idea of what to achieve even if the methods change this is sometimes called operational design one approach is to id entify basic stages in your ope ration for example establish dominance build local networks marginali ze the enemy make sure you can easily transition between phases forward and backward in case of setbacks ju st as the insurgent can adapt his activity to yours so you must have simple enough plan to survive setbacks without collapsing this plan is the solution that matches the shared diagnosis you developed earlier it must be simple and known to everyone golden hour c7 you have deployed completed reception and staging and if you are lucky attended the incountry counterinsurgency school now it is time to enter your sector and start your tour this is the golden hour mistakes made now will unt you for the rest of your tour while early successes will set the tone for victory you will look back on your early actions and cringe at your clumsine ss so be it but you must act 10 be there the most fundamental rule of counterinsurgency is to be there you can almost never outrun the enemy if you are not present when an incident happens there is usually little you can do about it so your first order of business is to establish presence if you cant do this throughout your sector then do it wherever you can this demands residential approach living in your sector in close proximity to the population rather than raiding into the area from remote secure bases movement on foot sleeping in local villages night patrollingall these seem more dangerous than th ey are they establish links with the locals who see you as real people they can trust nd do business with not as aliens who descend from an armored box driving around in an armored convoy daytripping like tourist in hell degrades situational awareness makes you target and is ultimately more dangerous 11 avoid kneejerk responses to first impressions dont act rashly get the facts first the violence you see may be part of the insurgent strategy it may be various interest groups fighting it out with each other or settling personal vendettas norm ality in kandahar is not the same as in seattleyou need time to lear n what normality looks like the insurgent commander wants to goad you into lashing out at the population or making mistake unless you happen to be on the spot when an inci dent occurs you will have only secondhand reports and may misunderstand the local context or interpretation this fragmentation and disaggregation of the battlefield particularly in urban areas means that first impressions are often highly misleading of course you cant avoid making judgments but if possible check them with an older or trusted local if you can keep one or two officers from your predecessor unit for the first part of the tour try to avoid rush to judgment 12 prepare for handover from day one believe it or not you will not resolve the insurgency on your watch your tour will end and your successors will need your corporate knowledge start handover folders in every platoon and specialist squad from day one ideally you would have inherited these from your predecessors but if not you must start them the folders should include lessons learned details about the population villa ge and patrol reports updated maps and photographsanyth ing that will help newcomers master the environment computerized databases are fine but keep good backups and ensure you have hard copy of key artifacts and documents this is and tedi ous but essential over time you will create corporate memory that keeps your people alive 13 build trusted networks once you have settled into your sector your key task is to build trusted networks this is the true meaning of the phrase hearts and minds which comprises two separate components hearts means persuadi ng people their best interests are served by your success minds means convincing them that you can protect them and that resisting you is pointless note that neither concept has anything to do with whether people like you twentyeight articles fundamentals of companylevel counterinsurgency fmi 3242 c5 calculated selfinterest not emotion is what counts over time if you successfully build networks of trust these will grow like root s into the population displacing the enemys networks bringing him out into the open to fight you and letting you seize the initiative these networks include local allies community leaders local security forces nongovernmental organizations ngos and other fri endly or neutral nonstate actors in your area and the media conduct village and ne ighborhood surveys to id entify needs in the community then follow through to meet them build common interests and mobilize popular support this is your true main effort everyt hing else is secondary actions that help build trusted networks serve your cause actionse ven killing highprofile targets that undermine trust or disrupt your networkshelp the enemy 14 start easy if you were trained in ma neuver warfare you know about surfaces and gaps this applies to counterinsurgency as much as any other form of maneuver dont try to crack the hardest nut firstdont go straight for the main insurgent stronghold try to provoke decisive showdown or focus efforts on village s that support the insu rgents instead start from secure areas and work gradually outwards do this by extending your influence through the locals own networks go with not against the grain of local society first win the confidence of few villages and see who they trade intermarry or do business with now win these people over soon enough the showdown with the insurgents will come but now you have local allies mobilized population nd trusted network at your back do it the other way around and one will mourn your failure 15 seek early victories in this early phase your aim is to stamp your dominance in your sector do this by seeking an early victory this will probably not translate into combat victory over the enemy looking for such victory can be overly aggressive and create collateral damageespecially since you really do not yet understand your sector also such combat victory depends on the enemy being stupid enough to present you with clearcut target which is rare windfall in counterinsurgency instead you may achieve victory by resolving longstandi ng issues your predecessors have failed to address or by coopting key local leader who has resisted cooperation with our forces like any other form of armed propaganda achieving even small victory early in the tour sets the tone for what comes later and helps seize the initiative which you have probably lost due to the inevitable hiatus entailed by the handovertakeove r with your predecessor 16 practice deterrent patrolling establish patrolling methods that deter the enemy from attacking you often our patrolling approach seems designed to provoke then defeat enemy attacks this is counterproductive it leads to raiding daytripping mindset or worse bunker mentality instead practice deterrent patrolling there are many methods for this including multiple patrolling in which you flood an area with num erous small patrols working together each is too small to be worthwhile target and the insurgents never know where all the patrols aremaking an attack on any one patrol extremely risky other methods include socalled bluegreen patrolling where you mount daylight overt humanitarian patrols which go covert at night and hunt specific targets again the aim is to keep the enemy off balance and the population reassured through constant and unpredictable activity which over time deters attacks and creates more permissive environment reasonable rule of thumb is that oneto twothirds of your force should be on patrol at any time day or night 17 be prepared for setbacks setbacks are normal in counterinsurgency as in every other form of war you will make mistakes lose people or occasionally kill or detain the wrong person you may fail in building or expanding networks if this happens dont lose heart simply drop back to the previous phase of your game plan and recover your balance it is normal in company counterinsurgency operations for so platoons to be doing well while others do badly this is not necessarily evidence of failure give local commanders the freedom to adjust their posture to local conditions this creates elasticity that helps you survive setbacks appendix c c6 fmi 3242 18 remember the global audience one of the biggest differences between the counterinsurgencies our fathers fought and those we face today is the omnipresence of globalized media most hous in iraq have one or more satellite dishes web bloggers print radio and television reporters and ot hers are monitoring and reporting your every move when the insurgents ambush your patrols or set off car bomb they do so not to destroy one more track but because they want graphic images of burning vehicle and dead bodies for the evening news beware of the scripted enemy who plays to global audience and seeks to defeat you in the court of global public opinion you counter this by training people to always bear in mind the global audience to assume that everything they say or do will be publicized and to befriend th media get the press onsidehelp them get their story and trade information with them good relationships with nonembedded media especially indigenous media dramatically incr ease your situational awareness and help get your message across to the global and local audience 19 engage the women beware of the children most insurgent fight ers are men but in traditional societies women are hugely influential in forming the social networks that insurgents use for support coopting neutral or friendly women through targeted social and economic programs builds networks of enlightened selfinterest that eventually undermine the insurgents you need your own female counterinsurgents including interagency people to do this effectively win the women and you own the family unit own the family and you take big step forward in mobilizing the populati on conversely though stop your people from fraternizing with the local children your troops are homesick they want to drop their guard with the kids but children are sharpeyed lacking in empathy and willing to commit atrocities their elders would shrink from the insurgents are watching they will notice growing friendship between one of your people and local child and either harm the child as punishment or use them against you similarly stop people from throwing candies or presents to children it ttracts them to our vehicles creates crowds the enemy can exploit and leads to children being run over harden your heart and keep the children at arms length 20 take stock regularly you probably already know that body count tells you little because you usually cant know how many insurgents there were to start with how many moved into the area how many transferred from supporter to combatant status or how many new fighters the conflict has created but you still need to develop metrics early in the tour and refine them as the operation progresses th ey should cover range of so cial informational military and economic issues use metrics intelligently to form an overall impression of progressnot in mechanistic trafficlight fashion typical metrics include percentage of engagements initiated by our forces versus those initiated by insurgents longevity of friendly local leaders in positions of authority number and quality of tipoffs on insurgent activity that originate spontaneously from the population and economic activity at markets and shops these mean virtually nothing as snapshot it is trends over time that help you track progress in your sector groundhog day c8 now you are in steady state you are established in your sector and people are settling into that groundhog day mentality that hits every unit at some stage during ev ery tour it will probably take you at least the first third of your tour to become effective in your new environment if not longer then in the last period you will struggle against the shorttimer mentality so this middle part of the tour is the most productivebut keeping the flame alive and bringing the local population along with you takes immense leadership 21 exploit single narrative since counterinsurgency is competition to mobilize popular support it pays to know how people are mob ilized in most societies there are opinion makerslocal leaders pillars of the community religious figures media personalities and others who set trends and influence public perceptions this influence including the twentyeight articles fundamentals of companylevel counterinsurgency fmi 3242 c7 pernicious influence of the insurgents often takes the form of single narrative simple unifying easily expressed story or explan ation that organizes peoples experience and provides framework for understanding events nationalist and ethnic historical myths or sectarian creeds provide such narrative the iraqi insurgents have one as do alqaeda and the taliban to undercut their influence you must exploit an alternative narrative or better yet tap into an existing narrative that excludes the insurgents this narrative is often worked out for you by higher headquartersbut only you have the detailed knowledge to tailor the narrative to local conditions and generate leverage from it for example you might use nationalist narrative to marginalize foreign fighters in your area or narrative of national redemption to undermine former regime elements that have been terrorizing the population at the company level you do this in baby steps by getting to know local opinionmakers winning their trust learning what motivates them and building on this to find single narrative that emphasizes the inevitability and rightness of your ultimate success this is art not science 22 local forces should mirror the enemy not the americans by this stage you will be working closely with local forces training or supporting them and building indigenous capability the natural tendency is to build forces in the us image with the aim of eventually handing our role over to them this is mistake instead local indigenous forces need to mirror the enemys capabilities and seek to supplant the insu rgents role this does not mean they should be irregular in the sense of being brutal or outside proper control rather they should move equip organize like the insu rgents but have access to your support and be under the firm control of their parent soci eties combined with mobilized population and trusted networks this allows local forces to hardwire the enemy out of the environment under topcover from you at the company level this means that raising training and employing local indi genous auxiliary forces police nd military are valid tasks this requires highlevel clearance of course but if support is given you should establish company training cell platoons should aim to train one local squad then use that squad as nucleus for partner platoon company headquarters should train an indigenous leadership team this mirrors the growth process of other trusted networks and tends to emerge naturally as you win local allies who want to take up arms in their own defense 23 practice armed civil affairs counterinsurgency is armed social work an attempt to redress basic social and political problems while being shot at this makes civil affairs central counterinsurgency activity not an afterthought it is how you restructure the environment to displace the enemy from it in your company sector civil affairs must focus on meeting basic needs first then progress up maslows hi erarchy as each successive need is met you need intimate cooperation with interagency partne rs herenational international and local you will not be able to control these partne rsmany ngos for example do not want to be too closely associated with ou because they need to preser ve their perceived neutrality instead you need to work on shared diagnosis of the problem building consensus that helps you selfsynchronize your role is to pr ovide protection identify needs facilitate civil affairs and use improvements in social conditions as leverage to build networks and mobilize the population thus there is such thing as impartial humanitarian assistance or civil affairs in counterinsurgency every time you help someone you hurt someone elsenot least the insurgentsso civil and humanitarian assi stance personnel will be targeted protecting them is matter not only of closein defense but also of creating permissive operating environment by coopting the beneficiaries of aid local communities and leaders to help you help them 24 small is beautiful another natural tendency is to go for largescale mass programs in particular we have tendency to template ideas that succeed in one area and transplant them into another and we tend to take small programs that work and try to replicate them on larger scale again this is usually stake often programs cceed because of specific local conditions of which we are unaware or b ecause their very smallness kept them below the enemys radar and helped them flourish unmolested at the company level programs that appendix c c8 fmi 3242 succeed in one district often also succeed in another because the overall company sector is small but smallscale projects rarely proceed smoothly into large programs keep programs small this makes them cheap sustainable lowkey and importantly recoverable if they fail you can add new programsalso small cheap and tailored to local conditions as the situation allows 25 fight the enemys strategy not his forces at this stage if things are proceeding well the insurgents will go over to the offensive yes the offensive because you have created situation so dangerous to the insurgents by threatening to di splace them from the environment that they have to attack you and the population to get back into the game thus it is normal even in the most successful operations to have spikes of offensive insurgent activity late in the campaign this does not necessarily mean you have done something wrong though it may it depends on whet her you have successfully m obilized the population at this point the tendency is to go for the jugular and seek to destroy the enemys forces in open battle this is rarely the best choice at company level because provoking major combat usually plays into the enemys hands by undermining the populations confidence instead attack the enemys strategy if he is seeking to recapture the allegian ce of segment of the local population then coopt them against him if he is trying to provoke sectarian conflict go over to peaceenforcement mode the permutati ons are endless but the principle is the same fight the enemys strategy not his forces 26 build your own solutiononly attack the enemy when he gets in the way try not to be distracted or forced into series of reactive moves by desire to kill or capture the insurgents your aim should be to implement your own solution the game plan you developed early in the campaign and then refi ned through interaction with local partners your approach must be environmentcentric based on dominating the whole district and implementing solution to its systemic problems rather than enemycentric this means that particularly late in the campaign you may need to learn to negotiate with the enemy members of the population that supports you also know the enemys leaders they may have grown up together in the small district that is now your company sector and valid negotiating partners sometimes emerge as the campaign progresses again you need close interagency relationships to exploit opportun ities to coopt segments of th enemy this helps you wind down the insurgency without alie nating potential local allies who ve relatives or friends in the insurgent movement at this stage defection is better than surrender surrender is better than capture and capture is better than kill getting short c9 time is short and the tour is drawing to close the key problem now is keeping your people focused maintaining the rage on all the multifarious programs projects and operations that you have started and preventing your people from dropping their guard in this fina l phase the previous articles still stand but there is an important new one 27 keep your extraction plan secret the temptation to talk about home becomes almost unbearable toward the end of tour the locals know you are leaving and probably have better idea than you of the generic extraction plan remember they have seen units come and go but you must protect the specific details of the extraction plan or the enemy will use this as an opportunity to score highprofile hit recapture the populations allegiance by scare tactics that convince them they will not be protected once you leave or persuade them that your successor unit will be oppressive or in competent keep the tails secret within tightly controlled compartment in your headquarters four what ifs c10 the articles above describe what should happen but we all know that things go wrong here are some what ifs to consider twentyeight articles fundamentals of companylevel counterinsurgency fmi 3242 c9 what if you get moved to different area you prepared for arramadi and studied dulaim tribal structures and sunni beliefs now ou are going to najaf and will be surrounded by alhassani tribes and shia communities but that work was not wasted in mastering your first area you learned techniques you can apply how to case an operational area and how to decide what matters in the local societal structure do th same again and this time the process is easier and faster since you have an existing mental structur and can focus on what is different the same applies if you get moved frequently within battalion or brigade area what if higher headquarters doe snt get counterinsurgency higher headquarters is telling you the mission is to kill terrorists or pushing for highspeed armored patrols and basecamp mentality they just dont seem to understand counterinsurgency this is not uncommon since companygrade officers today often have more combat experience than senior officers in this case just do what ou can try not to create xpectations that higher headquarters will not let you meet apply the ad age first do harm over time you will find ways to do what you have to do but never lie to higher headquarters about your locations or activitiesthey own the indirect fires what if you have resources you have linguists the aid agencies have money for projects in your area and you have low priority for civil affairs you can still get things done but you need to focus on selfreliance keep things small and sustainable and ruthlessly prioritize effort the local popula tion are your allies in this th ey know what matters to them more than you do be honest with them discuss possible projects and options with community leaders get them to choose what their prior ities are often they will find the translators building supplies or expertise that you need and will only expect your support and protection in making their projects work and the process of negotiation and consultation will help mobilize their support and strengthen their social cohesion if you set your sights on what is achievable the situation can still work what if the theater situation shifts under your feet it is your worst nightmareeverything has gone well in your sector but the whole theater situation has changed and invalidates your efforts think of the first battle of falluja the askariya shrine bombing or the sadr uprising what do you do here is where having flexible adaptive game plan co mes in just as the insurgents drop down to lower posture when things go wrong now is the time for you to drop back stage consolidate rega in your balance and prepare to expand again when the situation allows but see article 28 if you cede the initiative you must rega in it as soon as the situation allows or you will eventually lose c11 this then is the tribal wisdom the folklore that those who went before you have learned like any folklore it needs interpretation and contains seem ingly contradictory advice over time as you apply unremitting intellectual effort to study your sector you will learn to apply these ideas in your own way and will add to this store of wisdom from your own observations and experience so only one article remains and if you remember nothing else remember this 28 whatever else you do keep the initiative in counterinsurgency the initiative is everything if the enemy is reacting to you you control the environment provided you mobilize the population you will win if you ar reacting to the enemy even if you are killing or capturing him in large numbers then he is controlling the environment and you will eventually lose in counterinsurgency the emy initiates most attacks targets you unexpectedly and withdraws too fast for ou to react do not be drawn into purely reactive operations focus on the population build your own solution further your game plan and fight the enemy only when he gets in the way this gains and keeps the initiative fmi 3242 d1 appendix d twentyseven articles of t lawrence t lawrence wrote that he expressed these notes published in the arab bulletin 20 august 1917 in commandment form for clarity and brevity they are however only my personal conclusions arrived at gradually while i worked in the hejaz and now put on paper as stalking horses for beginners in the arab armies they are meant to apply only to bedu townspeople or syrians require totally different treatment they are of course not suitable to any other persons need or applicable unchanged in any particular s ituation handling hejaz arabs is an art not science with exceptions and obvious rules at the same time we have great chance there the sharif trusts us and has given us the position towards his government which the germans wanted to wi n in turkey if we are tactful we can at once retain his goodwill and carry out our job but to succeed we have got to put into it all the interest and skill we possess 1 go easy for the first few weeks bad start is difficult to atone for and the arabs form their judgments on externals that we ignore when you ve reached the inner circle in tribe you can do as you please with yourself and them 2 learn all you can about your as hraf and bedu get to know their families clans and tribes friends and enemies wells hills and roads do all this by listening and by indirect inqui ry do not ask questions get to speak their dialect of arabic not yours until you can understand their allusions avoid getting deep into conversation or you will drop bric ks be little stiff at first 3 in matters of business deal only with the commander of the army column or party in which you serve never give orders to anyone at all nd reserve your directions or advice for the co however great the temptation for efficiencys sa ke of dealing with his underlings your place is advisory and your advice is due to the commander alone let him see that this is your conception of your duty and that his is to be the sole executive of your joint plans 4 win and keep the confidence of your leader strengt hen his prestige at your expense before others when you can never refuse or quash schemes he may put forward but ensure that they are put forward in the first inst ance privately to you always approve them and after praise modify them insensibly causing the suggestions to come from him until they are in accord with your own opinion when you attain this point hold him to it keep tight grip of his ideas and push them forward as firmly as possibly but secretly so that one but himself and he not too clearly is aware of your pressure 5 remain in touch with your leader as constantly and unobtrusively as you can live with him that at meal times and at audiences you may be naturally with him in his tent formal visits to give advice are not so good as the constant dropping of ideas in casual talk when stranger sheikhs come in for the first time to swear allegiance and offer service clear out of the tent if their first impression is of foreigners in the confidence of the sharif it will do the arab cause much harm 6 be shy of too close relations with the subordinate s of the expedition continual intercourse with them will make it impossible for you to avoid goi ng behind or beyond the in structions that the arab co has given them on your advice and in so disclosing the weakness of his position you altogether destroy your own appendix d d2 fmi 3242 7 treat the subchiefs of your force quite easily and lightly in this way you hold yourself above their level treat the leader if sharif with respect he will return your manner and you and he will then be alike and above the rest preceden ce is serious matter among the arabs and you must attain it 8 your ideal position is when you are present and not noticed do not be too intimate too prominent or too earnest avoid being identified too long or too often with any tribal sheikh even if co of the expedition to do your work you must be above jealousies and you lose prestige if you are associated with tribe or clan and its inevitable feuds sharifs are above all bloodfeuds and local rivalries and form the only principle of unity among the arabs let your name therefore be coupled always with sharifs and share his attitude towards the tribes when the moment comes for action put yourself publicly under his orders the bedu will then follow suit 9 magnify and develop the growing conception of the sharifs as the natural aristocracy of the arabs intertribal jealousies make it impossible for any sheikh to attain commanding position and the only hope of union in nomad arabs is that the ashraf be universally acknowledged as the ruling class sharifs are halftownsmen halfnomad in manner and life and have the instinct of command mere merit and money would be insufficient to obtain such recognition but the arab reverence for pedigree and the prophet give s hope for the ultimate success of the ashraf 10 call your sharif sidi in public and in private call other people by their ordinary names without title in intimate conversation call sheikh abu nnad akhu alia or some similar byname 11 the foreigner and christian is not popular pers on in arabia however friendly and informal the treatment of yourself may be remember always that your foundations are very sandy ones wave sharif in front of you like banner and hide your own mind and person if you succeed you will have hundreds of miles of country and thousands of men under your orders and for this it is worth bartering the outward show 12 cling tight to your sense of humor you will need it every day dry irony is the most useful type and repartee of personal and not too broad character will double your influence with the chiefs reproof if wrapped up in some smiling fo rm will carry further and last longer than the most violent speech the power of mimicry or par ody is valuable but use it sparingly for wit is more dignified than humor do not cause laugh at sharif except among sharifs 13 never lay hands on an arab you degrade yourself you may think the resultant obvious increase of outward respect gain to you but what you have really done is to build wall between you and their inner selves it is difficult to keep quiet when everything is being done wrong but the less you lose your temper the greater your advantage also then you will not go mad yourself 14 while very difficult to drive the bedu are easy to lead if have the patience to bear with them the less apparent your interferences the more your influence they are willing to follow your advice and do what you wish but they do not mean you or anyone else to be aware of that it is only after the end of all annoyances that you find at bottom their real fund of goodwill 15 do not try to do too much with your own hands better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly it is their war and you are to help them not to win it for them actually also under the very odd conditions of arabia your practical work will not be as good as perhaps you think it is 16 if you can without being t oo lavish forestall presents to yourse lf wellplaced gift is often most effective in winning over suspic ious sheikh never receive pr esent without giving liberal return but you may delay this return while letti ng its ultimate certainty be known if you require particular service from the giver do not let them ask you for things since their greed will then make them look upon you only as cow to milk 17 wear an arab head cloth when with tribe bedu have malignant prejudice against the hat and believe that our persistence in wearing it due probably to british obstinacy of dictation twentyseven articles of t lawrence fmi 3242 d3 is founded on some immoral or irreligious principle thick head cloth forms good protection against the sun and if you wear hat your best arab friends will be ashamed of you in public 18 disguise is not advisable except in special ar eas let it be clearly known that you are british officer and christian at the same time if you can wear arab kit when with the tribes you will acquire their trust and intimacy to degree impossible in uniform it is however dangerous and difficult they make special allowances for you when you dress like them breaches of etiquette not charged against foreigner are not condoned to you in arab clothes you will be like an actor in foreign theatre playing part day and night for months without rest and for an anxious stake complete success which is when the arabs forget your strangeness and speak naturally before you counting you as one of them selves is perhaps only ttainable in character while halfsuccess all that most of us will strive for the other costs too much is easier to win in british things and you yourself will last longer physically and mentally in the comfort that they mean also then the turks w ill not hang you when you are caught 19 if you wear arab things wear the best clothes are significant among the tribes and you must wear the appropriate and appear at ease in th em dress like sherif if they agree to it 20 if you wear arab things at all go the whole way leave your english friends and customs on the coast and fall back on arab habits entirely it is possible starting thus level with them for the european to beat the arabs at their own game for we have stronger motives for our action and put more heart into it than they if you can surpass them you have taken an immense stride toward complete success but the strain of liv ing and thinking in foreign and halfunderstood language the savage food strange clothes and st ranger ways with the complete loss of privacy and quiet and the impossibility of ever relaxing your watchful imitation of the others for months on end provide such an added stress to the ordinary difficulties of dealing with the bedu the climate and the turks that this road should not be chosen without serious thought 21 religious discussions will be frequent say what you like about your own side and avoid criticism of theirs unless you know that the point is external when you may score heavily by proving it so with the bedu islam is so allpervading an element that there is little religiosity little fervor and regard for externals do not think from their conduct that they are careless their conviction of the truth of their faith and its share in every act and thought and principle of their daily life is so intimate and intense as to be unconscious unless rous ed by opposition their religion is as much part of nature to them as is sleep or food 22 do not try to trade on what you know of fighting the hejaz confounds ordinary tactics learn the bedu principles of war as t horoughly and as quickly as you can for till you know them your advice will be good to the sharif unnumbered ge nerations of tribal raids have taught them more about some parts of the business than we will ever know in familiar conditions they fight well but strange events cause panic keep your unit small their raiding parties are usually from one hundred to two hundred men and if you take crowd they only get confused also their sheikhs while admirable company commanders are too set to learn to handle the equivalents of battalions or regiments dont attempt unusual th ings unless they appeal to the sporting instinct bedu have so strongly unless success is obvious if the objective is good one booty they will attack like fiends they are splendid scouts their mobility gives you the advantage that will win this local war they make proper use of their knowledge of the country dont take tribesmen to places they do not know and the gazellehunter s who form proportion of the better men are great shots at visible targets sheikh from one tribe cannot give orders to men from another sharif is necessary to command mixed tribal force if there is plunder in prospect and the odds are at all equal you will win do not waste bedu attacking trenches they will not stand casualties or in trying to defend position for they cannot sit still without slacking the more unorthodox and arab your proceedings the more likel you are to have the turks cold for they lack initiative and expect you to dont play for safety 23 the open reason that bedu give you for action or inaction may be true but always there will be better reasons left for you to divine you must find these inner reasons they will be denied but are none the less in operation before shaping your arguments for one course or other allusion appendix d d4 fmi 3242 is more effective than logical exposition they di slike concise expression their minds work just as ours do but on different premises there is nothing unreasonable incomprehensible or inscrutable in the arab expe rience of them and knowledge of their prejudices will enable you to foresee their attitude and possible course of action in nearly every case 24 do not mix bedu and syrians or trained men and tribesmen you will get work out of neither for they hate each other i have never seen successful combined operation but many failures in particular exofficers of the turkish army however arab in feelings and blood and language are hopeless with bedu they are narrow minded in tactics unable to adjust themselves to irregular warfare clumsy in arab etiquette swollenheaded to the extent of being incapable of politeness to tribesman for more than few minutes impatient and usually helpless without their troops on the road and in action your orde rs if you were unwise enough to give any would be more readily obeyed by bedouins than those of any mohammedan syrian officer arab townsmen and arab tribesmen regard each other mu tually as poor relations and poor relations are much more objectionable than poor strangers 25 in spite of ordinary arab example avoid too free talk about women it is as difficult subject as religion and their standards are so unlike our own that remark harmless in english may appear as unrestrained to them as some of their statements would look to us if translated literally 26 be as careful of your servants as of yourself if you want sophisticat ed one you will probably have to take an egyptian or sudani and unl ess you are very lucky he will undo on trek much of the good you so laboriously effect arabs will cook rice and make coffee for you and leave you if required to do unmanly work like cleaning boots or washing they are only really possible if you are in arab kit slave brought up in the hejaz is the best servant but there are rules against british subjects owning them so they have to be lent to you in any case take with you an ageyli or two when you go up country they are the most efficient couriers in arabia and understand camels 27 the beginning and ending of the secret of handling arabs is unremitting study of them keep always on your guard never say an unnecessary th ing watch yourself and your companions all the time hear all that passes search out wh at is going on beneath the surface read their characters discover their tastes and their weaknesses and keep everything you find out to yourself bury yourself in arab circles have interests and ideas except the work in hand so that your brain is saturated with one thing only and you realize your part deeply enough to avoid the little slips that would counteract th painful work of week s your success will be proportioned to the amount of mental effort you devote to it fmi 3242 glossary1 glossary section iacronyms and abbreviations 3c crosscultural
