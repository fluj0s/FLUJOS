of the boumediene decision is that detainees at guantanamo may petition federal district court for habeas review of the circumst ances of their detention background following the terrorist attacks of

terrorist attacks against the united states3 as part of the subsequent war on terror many persons captured during military operations in afghanistan and elsewhere were transferred to the us naval station in guantanamo bay cuba for detention and possible prosecution for war crimes in the 2004 case of hamdi v rumsfeld majority of the supreme court recognized that as necessary incident to the aumf the president was authorized to detain persons captured while fighting us forces in afghanistan for the duration of the conflict4 the department of defense thereafter established combatant status review tribunals csrts to assess whether persons detained at guantanamo constituted enemy combatants who could be detained for the duration of the war on terror and prosecuted in military commissions

opinion in the case of rasul v bush 5 holding that the federal habeas statute 28 usc 2241 extended statutory habeas jurisdiction with respect to persons held in guantanamo immediately thereafter dozens of habeas petitions were filed on behalf of guantanamo detainees in the us district court for the district of columbia district court where judges reached conflicting conclusions as to whether the detainees had any enforceable rights to challenge their trea tment and detention shortly after the supreme court granted certiorari to hear challenge by one of the detainees to his trial by military tribunal congress passed the detainee treatment act of 2005 dta6 the dta divested the courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges by guantanamo detainees based on thei r treatment or living conditions and eliminated federal courts jurisdiction under 28 usc 2241 to consider habeas claims by aliens challenging their deten tion at guantanamo the dta provided the us court of appeals for the dc circuit dc circuit with exclusive jurisdiction to review detainee status determinations made by csrts or military commissions in the 2006 case of hamdan v rumsfeld 7 the court interpreted these provisions as being inapplicable to habeas cases pending at the time the dta was enacted in response congress passed the mc which amended the federal habeas statute to expressly eliminate court jurisdiction over all pending and future causes of action other than pursuant to the limite d review permitted under the dta the petitioners in boumediene are aliens detained at guantanamo who sought habeas review of their continued detention and designation as enemy combatants by csrts in district court on appeal the dc circuit held that the mca stripped it and all other federal courts of jurisdiction to consider petitioners habeas applications relying upon its earlier opinion in odah v united states and the 1950 supreme court case johnson v eisentrager 8 in which the supreme court found that the constitutional writ of habeas did not apply to enemy aliens detained in postwwii germany the dc circuit held that the mcas courtstripping9 provision did not operate as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ because aliens held by the us in foreign territory do not have constitutional right to habeas 10 although the supreme court initially deni ed the petitioners request for review it subsequently reversed itself and grante d certiorari in june 2007 to consider the consolidated cases of boumediene and odah in an opinion by justice kennedy that was joined by

joined by the other and justices alito and thomas justice souter also wrote brief concurring opinion joined by justices br eyer and ginsburg briefly disputing the dissenting opinions purported characteriz ation of the majoritys decision application of mca to pending habeas actions before assessing petitioners constitutional claims the court briefly addressed petitioners argument that mca 7 did not deny federal courts jurisdiction to consider habeas actions like those of petitioners which were pending at the time that the mca was enacted the court rejected this argument finding that the structure of mca 7 and the acts legislative hi story demonstrated that the mca was intended to deprive federal courts of jurisdiction to consider habeas cases pending at the time of enactment constitutional privilege to habeas the court next turned to the question of whether petitioners possess constitutional privilege to seek the writ of habeas corpus petitioners argued that they possess constitutional right to habeas and that the mca deprived them of this right in contravention of the suspension clause which prohibits the suspension of the writ of habeas except when in cases of rebe llion or invasion the public safety may require it the mca did not expressly purport to be formal suspension of the writ of habeas and the government did not make ch claim to the court instead the government argued that aliens designated as enemy combatants and detained outside the jure territory of the united states have constitutional rights including the constitutional privilege to habeas and that therefore stripping the courts of jurisdiction to hear petitioners habeas claims did not violate the suspension clause the court began its analysis by surveyin g the history and origins of the writ of habeas emphasizing the importance placed on the writ for the framers the court noted that protection of the habeas privilege was one of the few safeguards to individual liberty contained in the constitution prior to the addition of the bill of rights and the suspension clause permits suspension of the writ only in the rare instance where public safety may require it as result of invasion or rebellion the court characterized the suspension clause as not only vital instrument for protecting individual liberty but also means to ensure that the judiciary branch would have except in cases of formal spension timetested device the writ to maintain the delicate balance of govern ance between the branches and prevent cyclical abuses of the writ by the executive and legislative branches12 the court stated that the separationo fpowers doctrine and the histor shaping the design of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34536crs4 13 id at 2248 citing ins v st cyr 533 u s 289 300 3012001

interpretation of the reach and purpose of the clause and the constitutional writ of habeas while the court considered the history nd function of the writ to be central to its analysis of the writs application it also sought guidance from foundingera authorities as to whether the constitutional writ of habeas was understood to cover foreign nationals apprehended and detained abroad during time of serious threat to the countrys security while the court cautioned that its jurisprudence had been careful not to foreclose the possibility that the protections of the suspension clause have expanded along with pos t1789 developments that fine the present scope of the writ13 at minimum the clause would be deemed to protect the writ as it was recognized at the time the constitution was drafted and ratified the court found the historical record to be inconclusive in resolving the issue before it and suggested that given the unique status of guantanamo ba and the particular dangers of terrorism in the modern age commonlaw courts s imply may not have confronted cases with close parallels to this one14 nonetheless the court interpreted the suspension clause as having full effect at guantanamo rejecting the governments position that the clause did not cover petitioners because the united states did not assert legal sovereignty over the territory where they were detained while the court did not question the governments position that cuba maintains legal sovereignty over guantanamo under the terms of the 1903 lease giving the u s plenary control over the territory it disagreed with the governments position th at at least when applied to noncitizens the constitution necessarily stops where jure sovereignty ends15 instead the court characterized its prior jurisprudence as recognizing that the constitutions extraterritorial applicati on turns on objective factors and practical concerns16 here the court emphasized the f unctional approach taken in the insular cases where it had assessed the availability of constitutional rights in incorporated and unincorporated territories unde r the control of united states17 although the government argued that the c ourts subsequent decision in eisentrager stood for the proposition that the constitutional writ of habeas does not extend to enemy aliens captured and detained abroad the court f ound this reading to be overly constrained according to the court interpreting the eisentrager ruling in this formalistic manner would be inconsistent with the functional approach taken by the court in other cases concerning the constitutions extraterritorial application18 and would disregard thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34536crs5 18 continued u s 1 1957 in his concurring opinion in reid justice harlan argued that whether constitutional provision has extraterrito rial effect depends upon the particular circumstances the practical necessities and the possible alternatives which congress had before it and in particular whether judi cial enforcement of the provision would be impracticable and anomalous reid 354 us at 7475 harlan j concurring in result 19 boumediene 128 sct at 2259 inter nal quotations omitted 20 id at 2260practical considerations that informed the eisentrager courts decision that the petitioners were precluded from seeking habeas the court also found that accepting th governments sovereigntybased approach to the constitutions applicability would raise significant separationof powers concerns as the political branches would be free to govern without legal constraint in territory like guantanamo where the us disclaimed legal sovereignty but exercised plenary control the constitution grants congress and the president the power to acquire dispose of and govern territory not the power to decide when and where its terms may apply even when the united states ac ts outside its borders its powers are not absolute and unlimited but are subject to ch restrictions as are expressed in the constitution to hold that the political branches may switch the constitution on and off at will would lead to regime where they not this court say what the law is these concerns have particul ar bearing upon the suspension clause for the writ is itself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers the test for determining the scope of this provision must not be subject to manipulation by those whos power it is designed to restrain19 based on the language found in the eisentrager decision and other cases concerning the extraterrito rial application of the c onstitution the court deemed at least three factors to be relevant in assessing the extraterritorial scope of the suspension clause 1 the citizenship and status of the detainee and the adequacy of the status determination process 2 the nature of the site where the person is seized and detained and 3 practical obstacles inherent in resolving the prisoners entitlement to the writ applying this framework the court characterized petitioners circumstances in the instant case as being significantly different from those of the detainees at issue in eisentrager among other things the court noted that unlike the detainees in eisentrager the petitioners denied that they were enemy combatants and the governments control of the postwwii occupied german territory in which the eisentrager detainees were held was not nearly as significant nor secure as its control over the territory where the petitioners are located the court also found that the procedural protections afforded to guanta namo detainees in csrt hearings are far more limited than those afforded to the eisentrager detainees tried by military commission and we conclude fall well short of the pr ocedures and adversarial mechanisms that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review20 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34536crs6 21 id at 2262 22 boumediene 128 sct at 2294 scalia j dissenting 23 boumediene 128 sct at 2278 souter j concurringciting rasul 542 us at 481while acknowledging that it had never before held th at noncitizens detained in another countrys territory have any ri ghts under the us constitution the court concluded that the case before it lacked any precise historical parallel21 i n particular the court noted that the guantanamo detainees have been held for the duration of conflict that is already one of the longest in us history in territory that while not technically part of the united states is subject to complete us control based on these factors the cour t concluded that the suspension clause has full effect at guantanamo in dissenting opinion joined by chief justice roberts and justices alito and thomas justice scalia argued that the constitutional writ of habeas does not and never has run in favor of aliens abroad the suspension clause thus has application and the courts interventio n in this military matter is entirely ultra vires 22 justice scalia further argued that the judiciary is illequipped to address the national security concerns raised by the detention of enemy combatants according to the dissent the procedural and evidentia ry rules likely to be employed by the judiciary in reviewing tainees status would increas the likelihood that enemy combatants would mistakenly be released back into hostilities in concurring opinion joined by justi ces breyer and ginsburg justice souter claimed that the courts interpretation of the extraterritorial scope of the constitutional writ of habeas was not nearly as surprising as justice scalias dissent suggested given court dictum in rasul v bush stating that application of the habeas statute to persons detained at gua ntanamo is consistent with the historical reach of the writ of habeas corpus23 adequacy of habeas corpus substitute having decided that petitioners possessed constitutional privilege to habeas corpus the court next assessed whether the c ourtstripping measure of mca 7 was impermissible under the suspension clause because the mca did not purport to be formal suspension of the writ th question before the court was whether congress had provided an adequate substitute for habeas corpus the government argued that the mca complied with the suspension clause because it applied the dtas review process to petitioners which the government claimed was constitutionally adequate habeas substitute because the dc circuit had f ound that the constitutional writ of habeas did not run to petitioners it did not consider whether an adequate substitute was provided while the court noted that it generally remands cases back to the lower court for consideration of issues not addressed in the first instance it found that the exceptional circumstances of the present case including the separationof powers issues it raised and the fact that petitioners had been denied meaningfulhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34536crs7 24 501 f3d 178 dc cir 2007 bismullah i

case of bismullah v gates24 provided it with guidance as to the appellate courts construction of key dta provisions the court found its prior rulings addressing the adequacy of habeas substitutes enacted by congress provided little guidance in assessing the adequacy of the jurisdictionstripping provisions of th mca and dta prior congressional enactments typically attempted to streamline rather than circumscribe habeas review in contrast the intent of the mca and dta was to establish more limited review procedure than habeas as evidenced by inter alia the mcas unequivocal jurisdictionstripping language the legi slative history of both enactments comparison of the review permitted by the dta and the unamended federal habeas statute and the lack of savings provi sion under either the dta or mca preserving habeas review as an avenue of last resort though the court declined to offer co mprehensive summary of the requisites for an adequate substitute for habeas corpus it nonetheless deemed the habeas privilege at minimum as entitling prisoner to meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pur suant to the erroneous application or interpretation of relevant law and em powering court to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully deta ined though release need not be the exclusive remedy or appropriate in every instance where the writ is granted25 additionally the necessary scope of habeas review may be br oader depending upon the rigor of any earlier proceedings26 the court noted that petitioners identified numerous alleged deficiencies in the csrt process which limited detainees ability to present evidence rebutting the governments claim that he is an enemy combatant among other things cited deficiencies include cons traints upon the detainees ab ility to find and present evidence at the csrt stage to challenge the governments case the failure to provide detainee with assistance of counsel limiting the detainees access to government records other than those that are unclassified potentially resulting in detainee being unaware of critical allegati ons relied upon by the governme nt to order his detention and the fact that the detainees ability to confront witnesses may be more theoretical than real27 given the minimal limitations placed upon the admission of hearsay evidencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34536crs8 28 id at 2270 29 id at 2266 30 id at 2276while the court did not determine whether the csrts as presently constituted satisfy due process standards it agreed with petitioners that there was considerable risk of error in the tribunals findings of fact28 given that the consequence of error may be detention for the duration of hostilities that may last generation or more this is risk too serious to ignore29 the court held that for either the writ of habeas or an adequate substitute to function as an effective remedy for petitioners court conducting collateral proceeding must have the ability to 1 correct errors in the csrt process 2 assess the sufficiency of the evidence against the detainee and 3 admit and consider relevant exculp atory evidence that was not introduced in the prior proceeding the court held that the dta review process is facially inadequate substitute for habeas review it listed number of potential constitutional infirmities in the review process including the absence of provisions 1 empowering the dc circuit to order release from detention 2 permitting petitioners to challenge the presidents authority to detain them indefinitely 3 enabling the appellate court to review or correct the csrts findings of fact nd 4 permitting the detainee to present exculpatory evidence discovered after the conclusion of csrt proceedings the court declined to read into the dta each of the necessary procedures identified as result the court deemed mca 7s app lication of the dta review process to petitioners as failing to provide an adequate substitute for habeas therefore effecting an unconstitutional suspension of the writ in light of this conclusion the court held that petitioners could immediately pursue habeas review in federal district court w ithout first obtaining review of their csrt designations from the dc circuit as would otherwise be required under the dta review process while prior jurisp rudence recognized that prisoners are generally required to exhaust alternative remedies before seeking federal habeas relief the court found that petitioners in the instant case were entitled to prompt habeas hearing given the fact that they d been detained for years without access to judicial oversight to which they were constitutionally privileged the court stressed however that except in cases of undue delay fe deral courts should generally refrain from considering habeas petitions of detainees being held as enemy combatants until after the csrt had an opportunity to review their status acknowledging that the government possesse s legitimate interest in protecting sources and methods of intelligence gather ing the court announced that it expected courts reviewing guantanamo detainees habeas claims to use discretion to accommodate this interest to the greatest extent possible so as to avoid widespread dissemination of classified information30 in dissenting opinion chief justice roberts joined by justices alito thomas and scalia argued that the dta review process adequately protects any constitutional rights that aliens detained abroad as enemy combatants may enjoy and criticized the majority for replacing the dta review system with set of shapelesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34536crs9 31 boumediene 128 sct at 2279 roberts cj dissenting 32 see boumediene 128 sct at

resolution of the executive session july 1 2008 available at httpwwwdcduscourtsg ovpublicdocssystemfilesguantanamo resolution070108pdfprocedures to be defined by fede ral courts at some future date31 chief justice roberts argued that the court should not have granted certiorari to review petitioners claims until the dc circuit had the opportunity to assess whether the remedies available under the dta review pr ocess vindicated whatever constitutional and statutory rights petitione rs may possess in conc urring opinion justice souter argued that the dissenting justices criticism of the majoritys decision to permit detainees to immediate petition for habeas failed to sufficiently consider the duration that petitioners had been denied meaningful judicial review of their claims implications of boumediene as result of the boumediene decision detainees currently held at guantanamo may petition federal district court for habeas review of status determinations made by csrt however the full consequences of the boumediene decision are likely to be significantly broader while the petitioners in boumediene sought habeas review of their designation as enemy combatants the courts ruling that the constitutional writ of habeas extends to guantanamo suggests that detainees may also seek judicial review of claims c oncerning unlawful conditions of treatment or confinement or to protest planned tran sfer to the custody of another country32 some 250 habeas petitions have been filed on behalf of guantanamo detainees in the us district court for the district of columbia in the aftermath of the boumediene ruling the district court adopted resolution for the coordination and management of guantanamo cases the resolution calls for all current and future guantanamo cases to be transferred by th judge to whom they have been assigned to senior judge thomas f hogan who s been designated to coordinate and manage all guantanamo cases so that they could be addressed as expeditiously as possible as required by the supreme court in boumediene v bush 33 judge hogan is responsible for identifying and ruling on procedural issues common to the cases the transferring judge will retain the cas for all other purposes though judge hogan is to confer with those judges whose cas raise common substantive issues and he may address those issues with the consent of the transferring judge district court judges richard j leon and emmet g sullivan have declined to transfer their cases for coordination and it is possible that th three judges may r each differing opinions regarding issues common to their respective cases the conduct of trials befo re military commissions at guantanamo may also be affected by boumediene as enemy combatants may now potentially raise constitutional arguments agains t their trial and conviction aliens convicted of war crimes before military commissions may also potentially seek habeas review of

subsequent prosecution before military commission although the boumediene court held that dta review procedures were an inadequate substitute for habeas it expressly declined to assess the content of the law that governs the detention of aliens at guantanamo34 the majority opinion noted that it made judgment as to whether the csrts as currently constituted satisfy due process standards and empha sized that both the dta and the csrt process remain intact35 whether these procedures vi olate due process standards facially or as applied in given case and whether particular detainee is being unlawfully held are issues to be addressed by the distri ct court when reviewing the habeas claims of guantanamo detainees prior to the dta and mcas elimination of statutory jurisdiction over guantanamo detainees habeas claims district court judges reached inconsistent conclusions regarding the degree to which detainees could challenge their treatment nd detention in the aftermath of boumediene it is possible that continued disagreement betw een lower court judges concerning the scope of rights and remedies owed to guantanamo detainees will eventually lead to more definitive pronouncemen t by the supreme court another question left unresolved in the c ourts discussion of the extraterritorial application of the constitution is the degree to which the writ of habeas and other constitutional protections apply to aliens detained in foreign locations other than guantanamo eg at military facilities in afghanistan and elsewhere or at any undisclosed us detenti on sites overseas the boumediene court indicated that it would take functional approach in re solving such issues taking into account objective factors and practical concerns in deciding whether the writ extended to aliens detained outside us territory practical concerns mentioned in the majoritys opinion as relevant to an assessment of the writs extraterritorial application include the degree and likely duration of us c ontrol over the location where the alien is held the costs of holding the suspension clause applicable in given situation including the expenditure of funds to permit habeas proceedings and the likelihood that the proceedings would compromise or divert attention from military mission and the possibility that adjudicating habeas petition would cause friction with the host government36 interestingly the boumediene did not overrule the courts prior decision in eisentrager in which it found that enemy detainees held in postwwii germany were precluded from seeking habeas relief whether enemy aliens are held in conditions that more closely resemble those of the detainees at issue in eisentrager or boumediene may influence reviewing courts assessment of whether they are owed the constitutional writ of habeas as well as its assessment of the merits of any habeas claim deemed cognizable although boumediene deemed the limitations on judicial review imposed by the dta and mca to be an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas the court did not foreclose all legislation altering the scope of review available in caseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34536crs11 37 id at 2276 indeed the court suggested that legislation that amended the federal habeas statute might not be necessary to effectuate this measure if detainee files habeas petition in another judicial district th government can move for change of venue to the us district court for dc id 38 id 39 see boumediene 128 sct at 2260 22692271 involving guantanamo detainees for exam ple the court suggested that it would be legitimate objective to channel all futu re cases involving guantanamo detainees to one district court so as to reduce the administrative burdens upon the government37 the court further acknowledged the government as having legitimate interest in limiting the dissemination of classified intelligencegathering information during the course of judicial hearings involving guantanamo detainees while the court urged reviewing courts to use their discretion to protect this interest to the greatest extent possible38 some in congress may want to consider legislation to provide statutory framework for the dissemination of classified information in cases involving guantanamo detainees the courts ruling in boumediene did not necessarily bar all legislation that would limit judicial review of guantanamo detainees claims such legislation limiting judicial review similar degree as the dta or mca might be deemed permissible if congress also fo rmally suspended the writ of habeas from being applied to guantanamo detainees it is far from certain however that reviewing court would deem such legislation as compatible with suspension clause requirements assuming that the requirements of the suspension clause constituted justiciable question reviewing cour ts assessment of th constitutionality of habeassuspending legislation would likel turn on whether qaedas terrorist attacks upon the united states qualified as rebellion or invasi on and whether the court found that the public safety was therefore deemed to require the suspension of the writ in guantanamo where number of suspected qaeda members and supporters are being detained congress may still be able to impose some limitations upon judicial review of csrt determinations if it strengthens the procedural protections afforded to detainees in csrt status hearings the supreme court identified number of potential deficiencies in the status review process that necessitated habeas review of csrt determinations includi ng the detainees lack of counsel during the hearings the presumption of validity accorded to th governments evidence procedural and practical limitations upon the deta inees ability to present evidence rebutting the governments charges against him and to confront witnesses potential limitations on the detainees ability to introduce excu lpatory evidence and limitations on the detainees ability to learn about the nature of the governments case against him to the extent that it is ba sed upon classified evidence39 legislation addressing some or all of these potential procedural inadequacies in the csrt process might permit judicial review of csrt determinations to be further streamlined for discussion of litigation challenging detention policy see crs report
