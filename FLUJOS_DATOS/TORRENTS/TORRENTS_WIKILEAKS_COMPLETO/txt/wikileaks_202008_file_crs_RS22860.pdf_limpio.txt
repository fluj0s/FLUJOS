martin analyst in asian trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the economies of east asia have adopted variety of foreign exchange rate policies ranging from hong kongs curre ncy board system which links the hong kong dollar to the us dollar to the inde pendently floating exchange rates of japan the philippines and south korea most of the ec onomies of asia have adopted managed floats that allow their local currency to fluctuate within limited range over time as part of rger economic policy over the last few years the value of the us dollar has declined against most major currencies the various econo mies of east asia have responded differe ntly to the fall in the value of the dollar some have allowed their local currency to appreciate against the us dollars others have held the value of their currency against the us dollar relatively unchanged while there is some evidence of competitive adjustments among some of the exchange rates it is unclear if these adjustments have had much impact on exports to the united states while us policy has gene rally supported the adoption of free float exchange rate policies most of the economies of east asia consider managed float exchange rate policy more conducive to their economic goals and obj ectives in addition it is uncertain if the adoption of free float ex change rate policies acr oss east asia would necessarily lead to major decline in the us trade deficit with asia it is possible that us complaints of currency manipulation and pressure on one ea st asian government to alter its exchange rate policy may fost er counter arguments from other east asia governments that have adopt ed similar exchange rate po licies this report will be updated as events warrant the exchange rate policies of some east asian nations in pa rticular china japan and south korea have been source of trad tension with the united states for several years some analysts and members of congress maintain that these countries are intentionally keeping their domestic currencie s undervalued in order to keep their exports price competitive in global markets some argue that these exchange rate policies constitute currency manipulation and violate article iv section 1iii of the articles of agreement the international monetary fund that stipulate that each member

2007 the us treasury concluded th at neither china nor any other major trading partner of the united states met th requirements for desi gnation under section 3004 of the act during the periodie none

markets access act of 2007 s 1677 the economies of asia have facto adopted variety of foreign exchange rate policies3 at one extreme hong kong has maintained linked exchange rate with the us dollar since 1983 under which the h ong kong monetary authority hkma intervenes to keep the exchange rate between 775 and 785 hong kong dollars hkd to the us dollar4 such an arrangement is often referred to as fixed or pegged exchange rate at the other extreme ja pan the philippines and south korea up until midmarch have allowed their currencies to float freely in foreign exchange forex markets over the last few years an exchange rate arrangement often referred to as free float however all three nations mu ch like the united states have intervened in international currency markets if fluctuations in the exchange rate are considered too volatile and pose risk to th nations econo mic wellbeing5 most of the asian economies have adopted variety of exchange rate policies commonly referred to as man aged floats cambodia china indonesia malaysia singapore taiwan tha iland and vietnam allow their currenc to adjust in value in forex markets so long as the fluctuations in va lue do not violate some other economic policy goal such as inflation limits or money supply constraints in add ition some nations such as china and vietnam have adopted type of managed float known as crawling peg that

government sold about 1 billion for won on march 18 2008 to stop disorderly decline in the value of koreas currency7 there are also reports that korea sold more dollars for won in early april8 some forex analysts claim that the new south korean government has adopted goal of holding the exchange rate between the won and the us dollar at 975 1000 to 19 however according to south koreas central bank the bank of korea the nations exchange rate policy has been free floating system since december 199710 based on koreas past pattern it is uncertain at this time if the recent actions are temporary interventions to stabilize markets or indications of categorical shift in koreas exchange rate policy11table 1 facto exchange rates policies of east asia economy exchange rate policy

takatoshi ito the influence of the rmb on exchange rate policy of other economies paper presented at peterson institute for international economics conference october 19 2007 13 ibidin addition there are indications that some of the economies of east asia monitor the regions exchange rates and attempt to keep the relative value of their currencies in line with the value of selected regional currencies these competitive adjustments in exchange rates are allegedly made so as to maintain the competitiveness of their exports on global commodity markets for example one scholar maintains countries that trade with china and compete with china in exports to the third market are keen not to allow too much appreciation of their own currenc ies visàvis the chinese rmb renminbi12 ito also speculates china most likely is more willing to accept rmb appreciation if neighboring countries in addition sout h korea and thailand allow faster appreciation13 source crs calculations based on publicly available daily exchange rate data an examination of east asian exchange ra tes over the last couple of years appears to confirm both the general categorization of exchange rate policies as well as the supposition that some nations are engaged in competitive exchange rate management see figure 1 the two currencies that appreciated the most the freefloating philippino peso and the managed

period under consideration although it has appreciated significantly since july 200714 the remaining currencies which followed managed float or crawling peg exchange rate either exhibited fairly smooth rise in value or comparatively limited intertemporal variations two possible exceptions are the indonesian rupiah and the thai bhat source crs calculation based on usitc data and publicly available exchange rates in general for the last two years there has been little apparent correlation between the growth of us trade with east asia and changes in the relative value of east asian

rise for short period of time following the depreciation of its currency because the increase in the pri ce of imports may outweigh the decline in the quantity of imports 16 these other forces may

economics september 2006 18 in his abstract of his recent study the effect of exchange rate changes on trade in east asia willem thorbecke concluded the results i ndicate that exchange rate elasticities for trade between asia and the us are not large enough to lend confidence that depreciation of the dollar would improve the us trade balance with asia complete text of paper available at httpwwwrietigojpenpublicationssummary06030003htmlof this short paper15 however official us trade data appear to indicate that economic forces in addition to relative exchange rates are influencing us trade with these three nations see figure 2 16 although their currencies appreci ated against the us dollar in 2006 and 2007 by roughly similar amounts us trade with china malaysia and singapore grew or fell at different rates us trade with malaysia showed the anticipated rise in exports and slowdown or decline in im ports with the appreciation of the ringgit in 2006 and 2007 however both china and singa pore showed strong and differing increases in both exports and imports desp ite the strengthening of their currencies implications for us trade policy in east asia while us policy has genera lly supported the adoption of free float exchange rate policies most of the economies of east asia consider managed float exchange rate policy more conducive to their overall economic goals and objectives in part east asian governments may be resistant to free float policy because of the commonly held view in asia that the economies with more liberal exchange rate policies suffered more during the 19971998 asian financial crisis than the economies with pegged or managed exchange rates17 as result there may be skep ticism about us recommendations for adoption of free float exchange rate policies it is uncertain if the adoption of fr ee float exchange rate policies by more economies in east asia would significantly re duce the us trade deficits with countries in the region18 among economists there is consensus that the resulting appreciation of east asian currencies against the us dollar would either significantly increase overall us exports or reduce us imports howeve r for some pricesensitive industries where us companies remain competitive the appreciation of competing nations currency may stimulate us export growth andor decline in us imports
