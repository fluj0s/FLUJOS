fully with the united states in counternarcotics efforts in order to avoid the suspension of us foreign assistance sections 489490 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended required the presid

vote against loans for the country in the multilateral development banks and 3 certain trade sanctions including increased tariffs and denial of pr eferential trade benef its could be applied at the presidents discretion the imposed sa nctions were to remain in force until the country was subse quently certified the sanctions would also apply if cong ress within 30 calendar days passed joint resolution of disappr oval to overturn the presid ential certification thereby decertifying country however any such congressional resolution would be subject to presidential veto and would require twothirds vote of both houses to override moreover section 614 of the foreign assi stance act of 1961 as amended gives the president the authority to provide assist ance to country notwithstanding other provisions in the act if he determines and notifies congress that to do so is important to the security interests of the united states presidential certifications acting under the

and that were trading and diplomatic partners in smaller portion of cases wh ere there were serious doubts about the counternarcotics efforts of trad and diplomatic part ners these countries were given national intere st waivers that freed them from sanctions on the grounds that continued aid would f acilitate better rela tions and encourag greater counter narcotics efforts2 in general the remaining countri that were denied certification or decertified were pariah states or st ates with which the united states had little or contact presidents ronald reagan and george hw bush decertified

were given waivers colombia paraguay and paki stan were given waivers in 1995 and colombia was decertified in 1996 and 1997 on grounds that colombias president had received campaign contributions from

with the united states in counternarcotics areas the senate foreign relations committee held hear ing in which several of the proposed modifications to the drug certification requi rements were discusse d then assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement affairs rand beers testified that the certification process had been an effective if blunt policy instrument but he recognized growing sense in congress that there may be more effective approaches he added any regime that might modify or replace certification should have an enforcement mechanism to ensure continued in ternational counter narcotics cooperation if ther were efforts to suspend th certification procedure we believe the president must retain in the interim the power to decertify or sanction
