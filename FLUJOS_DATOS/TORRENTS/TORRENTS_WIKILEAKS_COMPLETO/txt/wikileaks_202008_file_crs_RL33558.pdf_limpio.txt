production tax credit epact05 provides 18centskilowatt hour tax credit for up to 6000 megawatts of new nuclear capacity for the first eight years of operation up to 125 milli on annually per 1000 megawatts the treasury department published interim guidance for the nuclear tax credit on may 1 20068 under the guidance the 6000 mega watts of eligible capacity will be allocated among reactors that file license applications by the end of 2008 or after that date until enough applica tions are filed to fulfill the eligible capacity if license applications for more than 6000 megawatts of nuclear capacity are submitted before the end of 2008 then the tax credit will be allocated proportionally among any of the qualifying reactors that begin operating before 2021 as of august 2008 license applications had been submitted to nrc for more than 22000 megawatts of nuclear capacity9 so if all those reactors were built before 2021 they would receive less than onethird of the maximum tax credit however the energy information administrati on estimates that 8000 megawatts of new nuclear capacity will ultimately qualify for the credit10 in this case the credit amount drops to 135 cents per kilowatthour once all the qualifying plants are on line standby support because the nuclear industr has often blamed licensing delays for past nuclear reactor construc tion cost overruns epact05 authorizes the secretary of energy to provide standby pport or regulatory risk insurance to help pay the cost of regulatory delays at up to six new commercial nuclear reactors subject to funding availability for the fi rst two reactors that begin construction the doe payments could cover all the eligible delayrelated costs such as additional interest up to 500 million each for the next f our

to provide an engineeringscale demonstration of afci technologies accord ing to the budget justification the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act rej ected funding for development of afcf as did the house appropriations committee for fy2009 removing uranium from spent fuel w ould eliminate about 95 of the mass of spent nuclear fuel that would otherwis require disposal in deep geologic repository which doe is developing at yucca mountain nevada the urex process also could reduce the heat generated by nuclear waste the major limit on the repositorys capacity by removing ces ium and strontium for separate storage and decay over several hundred years pl utonium and other longlived elements would be fissioned in accelerators or fast reactors to reduce the longterm hazard of nuclear waste even if technically feasible however the economic viability of such waste processing has yet to be determined and it still faces significant opposition on nuclear nonproliferation grounds nevertheless proponent s believe the process is proliferationresistant because further purification would be required to make the plutonium useable for weapons and because the high radioactivity of the plutonium mixtures would make the material di fficult to divert or work with under the administrations gnep initiative plutonium partially separated from the highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear reactors would be recycled into new fuel to expand the future supply of nucl ear fuel and potentially reduce the amount of radioactive waste to be disposed of in permanent repository under the initial concept for gnep the united states and ot her advanced nuclear nations would lease new fuel to other nations that agreed to forgo uranium enrichment spent fuel recycling also called reprocessing and other fuel cycle facilities that could be used to produce nuclear weapons materials the leased fuel would then be returned to supplier nations for reprocessing solidifie d highlevel reprocessing waste would be sent back to the nation that had used th leased fuel along with supplies of fresh nuclear fuel the nuclear nonproliferati on treaty guarantees the right of all participants to develop fuel cycle

although some groups contend that routine emi ssions are unacceptably risky there is substantial scientific uncertainty about the level of risk posed by low levels of radiation exposure as with many carcinog ens and other hazardous substances health effects can be clearly measured only at relatively high exposure levels in the case of radiation the assumed risk of lowle vel exposure has been

designed to keep the pr obability of accidental core damage fuel melting below one in 10000 pe r year for each reactor the regulations also are intended to ensure that reactor containments would be successful at least 90 of the time in preventing major radioactive releases during coredamage accident therefore the probability of major release at any given reactor is intended to be below one in 100000 per year28 for the current us fleet of about 100 reactors that rate would yield an av erage of one coredamage accident every 100 years and major release every 1000 years on the other hand some

accident liability liability for damages to the general public from nuclear incide nts is addressed by the priceanderson act primarily sec tion 170 of the atomic energy act of 1954 42 usc 2210 the energy policy act of 2005 extended pri ceanderson coverage for new reactors and new doe nuclear contracts through the end of 2025 under priceanderson the owners of commercial reactors must assume all liability for nuclear damages awarded to the public by the court system and they must waive most of their legal defenses following severe radioactive release extraordinary nuclear occurrence to pay any such dama ges each licensed reactor must carry financial protecti on in the amount of the maximum liability insurance available currently 300 million any damages exceeding that amount are to be assessed equally ag ainst all covered commercial reactors up to 958 million per reactor those assessments called retrospective premiums would be paid at an annual rate of more than 15 million per reactor to limit the potential financial burden on reactor owners following major accident according to nrchttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33558crs18 104 commercial reactors are cu rrently covered by the pr iceanderson retrospective premium requirement for each nuclear incident the pricea nderson liability system currently would provide up to 108 billion in public comp ensation that total includes the 300 million in insurance coverage carried by th reactor that suffered the incident plus the 958 million in retrospective premiums from each of the 104 currently covered reactors totaling 103 billion on top of those payments 5 surcharge may also be imposed raising the total perreactor retrospective premium to 1006 million and the total available compensation to bout 108 billion under priceanderson the nuclear industrys liability for an incident is capped at that amount which varies depending on the number of c overed reactors the amount of available insurance and an inflation adjustment that is made ever five years payment of any damages above that liability limit would requi re congressional pproval under special procedures in the act the energy policy act of 2005 raised the limit on perreactor annual payments to 15 million from the previous 10 milli on and required the annual limit to be adjusted for inflation every fi ve years as under previous law the total retrospective premium limit of 958 million is to be adjusted every five years as well for the purposes of those payment limits nuclear plant consisting of multiple small reactors 100300 megawatts up to total of 1300 megawatts would be considered single reactor therefore power plant with six 120 megawatt pebblebed modular reactors would be liable for re trospective premiums of up to 958 million rather than 5748 million excl uding the 5 surcharge the priceanderson act also covers contractors who operate hazardous doe nuclear facilities the energy policy act of 2005 set the liability limit on doe contractors at 10 billion per accident to be adjusted for inflation every five years the liability limit for doe contractors previously had been the same as for commercial reactors excluding the 5 surcharge except when the limit for commercial reactors dropped because of d ecline in the number of covered reactors priceanderson authorizes doe to indemnify its contractors for the entire amount of their liability so that damage payments for nuclear incident s at doe facilities would ultimately come from the treasury however the law also allows doe to fine its contractors for safety vi olations and contractor empl oyees and directors can face criminal penalties for knowin gly and willfully violatin g nuclear safety rules the energy policy act of 2005 limits the civil penalties against nonprofit contractor to the amount of management f ees paid under that contract previously atomic energy act 234a specifically ex empted seven nonprofit doe contractors and their subcontractors from
