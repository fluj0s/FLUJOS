from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to tom wigley wigleycgducaredu subject re question date mon sep 6 111047 2004 cc professor david taplin coliemorehotmailcom ben santer santer1llnlgov tom ben should have seen the era40 report 18 you can forward the jgr paper wrt 1 it is difficult to say as it depends whos produced the values for hadcrut2v i think ive convinced the hc that the globe is nhsh2 if peter thorne did the calculations then this will be the case there is another issue sometimes the trends over jan79dec03 are calculated from the 300 months rather than the 25 years christy does this i think ncdcs globe is probably the one domain ive been doing some work with russ vose at ncdc which hes still to write up most of the differences were due to how the globe was calculated it is more informative to also include nh and sh as well as globe in such tables ill forward plot tom peterson produced week or two ago era40 2 comparisons are discussed in the era40 report 18 and the jgr submitted paper this also has comparisons by continent which again are more informative there is plot in that work from the full globe vs the cru coverage i wouldnt believe their tropics also antarctica is way off as well at least where the surface data are located so i wouldnt have much faith in their values for the unmonitored parts on 3 i did some comparisons ages ago with jim angells surface data from sondes jims data was just noisier and i suspect lks would be also ive not done anything like this for ages the closest would be the era40 comparisons which is much more extensive than the lks network i might have chance to do an lks comparison if dian sends the coordinates comparisons over 19582003 will be much more realistic but the era40ncep degrade prior to the 1960s lks would be better here all sonde data look odd in the late 1950s to the early 1960s the jump around 197677 has always intrigued it is bigger in some regions than others i think it gets more credence because it is large over western north america kevin had paper on this in bams in the late 1980s cheers phil at 1557 04092004 tom wigley wrote phil on sept 1317 i will be at meeting at the met office to do with report we are writing on trends in vert temp profiles as part of the us climate change science program ccsp it involves all the usual suspects seven chapters the last of which is equivalent to summary for policymakers for which i am the lead author various people are updating data sets and doing calculations of trends etc some of the surface numbers i found to be bit disturbing so i am asking for your opinion these are trends per decade for jan 1979 thru dec 2003 source globe 30s30n hadcrut2v 0169 0127 ncdc 0151 0146 era40 0113 0032 lks 0074 0056 1 cru and ncdc are consistent within the noise but i have one question how do both calculate globe 2 era40 is marginally ok relative to cru in globe but the tropics is alarmingly different the diff here accounts for the globe difference why is this which is better is this discussed in your paper with adrian 3 lks is the surface data from the corrected lks radiosonde data set the difference here must be partly due to coverage issues but i recall that years ago we saw difference between surface sonde and cru data have you done like with like comparison ie selecting the lks sonde sites and extracting the corresp cru and ncdc and era40 and if possible ncep data this seems to be pretty basic sanity check on the sonde data so if you have not done this already could you do it for please i think there is nice little grl paper here for the ccsp we are also giving trends etc over 19582003 so the real need is for full time series comparison over this period ie not just trends in other words what i would like you to produce is the monthly time series for the various data sets for the lks coverage if you dont know the lks site locations i can get these for you re going back to 1958 the sonde trop data have well known but not well explained problem over roughly 1958 to 19645 i am curious as to whether this shows up in the lks surface record i am also curious about the apparent 1976 jump some people have made lot of noise about this but i dont see it as major item in the global surface data so the q here is is is apparent in the restricted coverage of the sonde data i hope you can help i am leaving here on sept 7 to spend few days with friend of mine in plymouth you could contact thru him i am copying this to him so you can see his email thanx tom prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk
