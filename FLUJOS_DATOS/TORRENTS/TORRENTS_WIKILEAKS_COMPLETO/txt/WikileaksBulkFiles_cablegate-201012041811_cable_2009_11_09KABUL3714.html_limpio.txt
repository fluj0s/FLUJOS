director for development and economic affairs ambassador anthony wayne for reasons 14 b and d 1 cnf summary reformminded afghan commerce minister shahrani who hopes for us support to keep ministerial job argued on november 15 that president karzai is under heavy pressure from afghan politicians to accept less than ideal ministers and urged that the us and other donors talk not only to karzai but also to those politicians to stress the importance of approving good slate sharani also shared his view of reforms needed in the new government insights into fighting corruption views on the importance of getting subnational governance right and the need for the government and donors to agree on specific performance benchmarks tied to aid delivery end summary 2 cnf afghan commerce minister shahrani told coordinating director for development and economic affairs wayne on november 15 that president karzai is under great pressure from political leaders to accept number of ministerial candidates whose technical skills are lacking he specifically cited pressure from exwarlord general dostum from exjihadist professor sayyaf and hazara leader mohaqqeq shahrani who wants us support to stay on in the cabinet expressed concern that karzai would not resist the pressure for political payback on his own and urged the us and other donors to communicate directly with these political groupings to indicate that if weak or corrupt set of ministers was put in place then the us and others would be forced to withdraw their support he argued that these political leaders are only thinking of dividing up the spoils rather than the quality of government needed to tackle afghanistans problems shahrani repeatedly argued that the next five years are essential for afghanistan and the first months of the new karzai administration are key to getting the right reforms in place to really bring about positive change in the years ahead afghanistan needs the us and other donors to have chance for real progress he said he urged that the us speak frankly in private to karzai as well as key afghan political leaders 3 sbu shahrani argued that it is essential that the us and other international donors get as many specific commitments as possible from karzai in the inaugural speech if possible and subsequently then in some sort of joint document between donors and afghanistan key step is to press for the president to be clear on basic commitments in his inaugural speech especially about good governance and fighting corruption shahrani said he hoped the president would approve up to ten key areas for reform in the first year of his administration he and finance minister zakhilwal agree according to sharani that the reform areas should be in areas where the population will see difference in delivery of services 4 cnf shahrani underscored the need for very good ministerial and gubernatorial appointments and the concomitant reform of government organizations he said that he and other reformminded ministers still believe they have karzais support to name lead ministers for five key clusters 1 finance economy and commerce 2 agriculture and rural development 3 human development education and health 4 security and 5 justicerule of law cleaning up the last sector will be essential he argued especially given the degree of corruption currently in the attorney generals ministry and the judicial system if this does not happen it will be very hard to address corruption in the rest of the government similarly the executive office of the president needs serious reorganization so the president gets good and balanced flow of information and advice and so that ministerial coordination and cabinet decisionmaking can be significantly enhanced sharani said note this is complaint we have heard from wide variety of sources from donor nations to palace insiders end note 5 cnf turning to corruption more broadly shahrani argued that stateowned enterprises need to be turned into independent commercial entities rapidly on the way to privatization as they are great sources of corruption shahrani also singled out the transportation ministry as hot bed of corruption especially its airport operations and its private enterprise group finance minister zakhilwal had recently broken up corruption ring at kabul airport but the private sector group is an even bigger problem this unit includes people who collect fees on trucks traveling in afghanistan estimates are that about 200 million are collected yearly but only 30 million are turned over to the government he said individuals pay up to 250000 for the post heading this office in herat for example and end up owning beautiful mansions as well as making lucrative political donations this ministry should be top target for cleaning up in the new regime 6 sbu in his november 15 conversation with ambassador wayne shahrani said 14 of afghanistans governors have been identified by local governance minister popal as bad performers andor corrupt these 14 should be fired and the new government should implement procedures for selecting governors based on merit and for reviewing performance on yearly basis such performance review process should be put in place for all top officials there must also be greater focus on improving service delivery at the provincial level he argued governors should be given more substantial operational budgets as well as placed under more rigorous auditing controls the big municipalities also need careful attention first in good mayoral appointments and then in greatly improved management tax collection and service delivery 7 cnf turning to international assistance shahrani argued that donors should tie additional aid to clear benchmarks and timelines this should be publically announced as part of broader agreement and donors should be tough in demanding agreed performance benchmarks before distributing additional assistance such an agreement should call for some overarching commitments with each ministry receiving aid committed to achieving its own set of benchmarks in consultations with donors there should be focus on improving delivery of services to the population and mechanisms should be put in place to measure success shahrani suggested that the action plans for ministries should have three to four year time horizons 8 cnf comment minister shahrani is working closely with the ministers of finance agriculture education and local government to encourage bold reform moves by the new karzai administration while some of the specific ideas he shared may be his own they are consistent with what other reformminded ministers have been saying and urging shahrani clearly hopes for us support in keeping cabinet position he has been good partner on range of commercial and economic issues and an energetic proponent of reaching trade agreement with pakistan he has also gone out of his way to help on bilateral issues such as finalizing arrangements for us consulate leases eikenberry
