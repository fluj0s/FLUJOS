state lands due to the impacts of katrinathe impact of hurricane katrina on biological resources introduction hurricanes generate four forces which can cause damage to the biological resources of region strong winds torn adoes storm surges and rain hurricane katrina hit the gulf coast region with ll of these forces on august 29 2005 and has caused considerable alterations to gulf coast ecosystems and their biological resources see figure 1 for the area of reported forces katrina went through several areas of shallowshelf estuarine waters including extensive oyster reefs large marine and estuarine submer ged aquatic vegeta tion beds and wetlands katrina also affected inland forests and wildlife refuges by downing trees and scattering debris further storm surges from katrina led to the breaching of levees in new orleans and flooding throughout the city the return fl ow of contaminated floodwaters back into lake pontchartrain has the potential to affect the lake and associated ecosystems surveys of the damage to biological resources have started according to several sources and quantitative evaluations of the losses to biological resources caused by katrina is just starting to be reported there are regional estimates of wetland loss and estimates of impacts on fisheries forests and aquatic areas congressional interest in the biological resources of the region affected by hurricane katrina is widespread impacts to fisheries timberland agricultural and recreational sites contain not only environmental costs but significant economic cost as well further alterations to wildlife refuges and forest lands can stress populations of endangered and threatened species as well as reduce recreational activities such as hunting1 this report will discuss the reported and

hereafter cited as fws hurricane impact of land into new water areas within 9742 square mile area in affected region3 in barrier islands of mississippi and alabam storm surges reportedly eroded large areas of sand and submer ged wildlife habitat storm surges associated with hurricanes shift sediments moving them from wetlands beaches and coastal barrier islands to other land areas for this reason some scientists contend that some wetland areas lost to the storm may be temporary and other areas previously inundated may have emerged due to sediment deposition sediment deposition along large areas of the gulf coastline was recorded after the landfall of hurricane andrew in 1992 diment deposition caused by katrina has not been quantified further the permanen cy of land converting to water is uncertain and may not be known until af ter several growing seasons some shallow inundated areas may be revegetated with grasses and other vegetation whereas others may remain as open ponds aerial surveys of the region as well as satellite imagery are continuously be used to analyze the land loss caused by katrina4 about 15000 acres of coastal wetlands we re being converted to open water each year in louisiana before katrina the land loss due to hurricane katrina and rita in all of coastal louisiana east of the mississippi river from 2004 to 2005 was 729 square miles 129 square mile s above the projected 60 s quare mile loss projected to occur between 2000 and 2050 many believe th at the restoration and reclamation of these wetlands will provide buffer against the impacts of future hurricanes and will prevent further loss of land activities aimed at restoring coastal wetlands in louisiana have been ongoing for several years the 109th congress is considering proposals that would authorize the us army corps of engineers to implement set of restoration projects that would slow th rate of coastal wetland loss in louisiana over the next decade according to some the proposed projects may not be sufficient to completely restore wetlands to state where they would be an effective buffer against storm surges created from fu ture hurricanes for more information on the issues

the mississippi flyway to wintering spots in central and south america some believe that the habitat alterations in the refuges will cause waterfowl and other avian species to search for other nesting sites according to preliminary findings by the fish and wildlife service fws damage to habitat within refuges is widespread including the loss of wetlands large areas of tree blowdowns and defoliation and saltwater intrusion among other things7 secondary effects of habitat loss are being noted by some scientists high concentrations of wildlife are occupying remaining habitat in some areas which according to some scientists will ad to increased competition for f ood and resources and stress on species populations the habitats of several ndangered species were altered by katrina the endangered alabama beach mouse has lost several acres of primary and secondary dunes that serve as habitat and has lost scrub forest bitat where it finds prey to saline ocean waters along the alabama coas t some nesting sites for the endangered kemps ridley sea turtle have been dest royed and forested areas have been blown down in the noxubee national wildlife refuge in mississippi where the listed red

in the affected region 90 of which occurred on nonfederal lands12 eighty percent of the damage occurred in mississippi the mississippi forestry commission issued news release estimating that 13 million acres of forested land in the state had been damaged with commercial timber valued at about 13 b illion urban tree damage in mississippi was estimated at 11 billion13 in addition to the damages to wildlife habitat and other environmental services from the loss of forest cover the dead nd damaged trees can become hazardous fuels for wildfires as well as haven for fore st insects and diseases in southern mississippi for example the amount of tree debris available for fueling wildfire is an estimated 2030 times the normal levels14 efforts to remove fallen timber and salvage usable timber are underway alt hough some contend that the period for salvaging timber is declining due to warm and moist conditions that promote wood decomposition15 fallen timber can promote insect infestations as well as provide favorable conditions for the establishmen t of invasive species some damaging insect species such as the southern pine beetle and black turpentine beetle can thrive on fallen trees and then harm living trees forested land exposed to increased levels of sunlight caused by fallen trees is ceptible to invasive nonnative species such as chinese tallow tree triadica

projects17 flood waters being pumped into lake p ontchartrain after katrina contain mix of raw sewage bacteria heav metals pesticides and toxic chemicals among other things according to several sources specifically estimates reported that releases from hurricane katrina included 65 million gall ons of oil released from seven major incidences18 releases from major sewage treatment centers and many smaller ones as well as runoff from fuel storage ta nks and household and industrial chemical stores the lake was also affected by the storm surge which brought saltwater into the lake ecosystem19 the impacts of this water on the lake ecosystem and its aquatic species have yet to be determined by scientists some have predicted that toxic waters will lead to large fish kills and severe impacts on riparian and aquatic habitat further they contend that some toxins will settle into lake sediments and be prevalent for years to come others contend that water flows out of lake p ontchartrain should carry most toxic substances into the gulf of mexico thus flushing out the lake because of the lakes geography and location this scenar io may allow toxic substances to reach coastal islands and wetlands scientists reported in recently published study that the toxicity of floodwaters in new orlean s immediately after katrina was typical of stormwater runoff in the region and floodwaters caused by katrina were distinguished by their large volume and increased human exposure to pollutants20 further the corps has reported that there have been reports of oily sheens on

and tupelo swamps the longterm ecosystem effects of saltwater in trusion and pumping toxic water into lake pontchartrain may not be fully known for years gulf of mexico some scientists believe that the risk of longterm damage of toxic floodwaters entering the gulf of mexi co is not high they contend that tidal flows and flushing of gulf waters will dilute substances to nonharmful levels specifically scientists contend that bacterial contaminants will die off quickly and that other organic material will degrade with natural processes other scientists offer different perspective on the impacts of toxi c waters in the gulf of mexico they contend that toxic chemicals and excess nutrients will severely deplete fisheries by killing fish and will contaminat sediments recent toxicology survey of the gulf of mexico states that elevated bacterial toxins due to hurricanes do not exist in sampled water marine species and sediments23 the impact of katrina on the annual dead zone in the gulf of mexico is uncertain24 some scientists contend that excess nutrients sent into gulf waters from katrina will not increase the intensity of th dead zone because of the timing of the influx25 when katrina reached the gulf of mexico the dead zone had started to break down and the conditions became unfavorable for the dead zone to regenerate other scientists however c ontend that deposition of toxic substances and excess nutrients in sediments may contribute to th intensity of the dead zone next season and in years to come fisheries the gulf coast where hurricane katrina struck is an especially important center of commerc ial and recreational fishin g producing 10 of the shrimp and 40 of the oysters consumed in the united states further commercial shrimpers fishing out of or delivering to alabama mississippi and louisiana ports account for almost half of all us sh rimp produc tion katrina has destroyed or severely damaged fishing boa ts and processing and stor age facilities throughout this area26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33117crs8 27 noaa surveythe impact of katrina on fish populations habitat and their viability for consumption may not be as significant as originally thought for oysters the louisiana department of fish and wildlife used studies of resource mortality caused by hurricanes ivan and andrew to estimate mortality of existing resources caused by katrina the initial estimate was 99 loss of oyster resources in louisiana waters filter feeding organisms such as oysters readily uptake toxins and excess nutrients making them very susceptible to contamina tion further habitat can be destroyed by sediment deposition and toxins many areas have been administratively closed to fishing because of pollutionrelated contamination concerns for example the presence of ecoli bacteria in water surrounding oyster beds automatically triggers their administrative closure to harvesting recent surveys however indicate that the hurricane katrina did not cause reduction in fish and shrimp populations or decline in fish quality as was expected27 the longterm effects of katrina on fisheries is uncertain quantification of habitat loss is underway and timates from sa tellite imagery and aerial reconnaissance reveal large losses of wetland ecosystems which support spawning areas and prey populations noaa is undertaking sampling study to determine levels of toxicity and contamination in fish and marine waters there is concern over the longterm contamination of fisheries through the food chain toxins released to the environment through flooding may accumu late through the food chain into the tissues of fish bioaccumulative toxins such as lead and mercury have been detected in floodwaters that are now being pumped in lake pontchartrain the timeline for bioaccumulation is uncertain and depends on the amount of toxins released where they were released and whether the release was in specific areas or diffuse questions for consideration several questions regarding the impact of hurricane katrina on regional biological resources remain some stions being raised about the impact of katrina on regional ecosystems include what is the extent of coastal we tland loss in the region is this loss permanent or temporary and how will this loss alter the buffering capacity of coastal wetlands against future hurricanes can coastal wetlands be restored and if so can restoration be done through the proposed us army corps of engineers project the louisiana coastal area ec osystem restoration study what has been the impact of katrina on endangered and threatened species populations and their habitat what are the longterm ecological and economic consequences forcoastal fisheries and can the fisheries be restored how much is wildfire risk increased by the dead and damaged trees how much time can elapse before this risk and the threat of insect or disease infestation become severe will coastal and inland ecosystems be more susceptible to invasivespecieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33117crs9 will toxic substances released through flooding leach into the groundwater where and how much leaching may occur and how long will it take to re mediate water supplies will there be bioaccumulation of toxic substances through the food chain how long will it take for substances to accumulate in aquatic and terrestrial wildlife conclusion the impacts of hurricane katrina may not be readily absorbed by the coastal ecosystem several shortterm and longterm ecosystem impacts are anticipated shortterm impacts may include the effect of toxic waters on wildlife and aquatic organisms the fate of i nundated vegetation and the habitat and economic loss of forest blowdowns among others longterm impacts may include the settling of contaminated sediments in filtration of toxic substan ces into groundwater wetland loss and decline of populations of thr eatened and endangered organisms when considering what ecosystem restoration objectives to pursue after katrina congress may be faced with several choices and may have to prioritize resources some stakeholders contend th at the primary restoration objective should be restoring and increasing the area of coastal wetlands because of their role in providing buffer against future hurricanes and storm surges others suggest that monitoring the cleanup and deposition of wast and debris away from nsitive environmental areas should be priority restor ative actions that have been suggested include increasing oyster habitat and supplementing oyster populations clearing forest debris and salvaging fallen timber to lower the chance of forest fires rehabilitating wildlife refuges and reserves to increase wildlif populations and recreational options and creating new sanctuaries for migrating birds and turtles to replace lost areas
