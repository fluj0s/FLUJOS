6309c18 shspec308 saint hill service fac handling it is adventurous to go in to handle something like the mind without knowing what you are doing every case and every practitioner in the field of the mind has been concentrated on one aspect of existence and dedicated to observing existence only through that aspect so wonder little has been discovered and less applied knowledge about the mind means freedom for life and beings in this universe therefore anyone who is after enslavement is also in favor of ignorance about the mind there are two ways to make people ignorant 1 deny any information at all 2 substitute false data this is an easier and more effective way add to this the fact that 3 everyone is mired in his own favorite data and youve got good trap the way to overcome ignorance is to find the precise mechanics that apply to all minds because this will be broader truth that overrides all the minor data on which people are fixated false relay of the basic truth dropping out bits could again make slavery because it would deviate enough from the generally recognized broad truth and degenerate into opinion and fixed data this is the difficulty that scientology has had to deal with over the years the solution is results because once the technology is producing results you get arguments so the whole contest has not been for the achievement of certain truths we have had these for years rather the contest has been for workability so that we can get an application of those truths so that we can get rapid release of attention from favorite data and so that there is demonstration that by using the truth greater freedom is attained the one reason why you cant get pc to see that he can get release of attention by virtue of applying general truths is because of his favorite data his fixed idea he considers that any other truths have to agree with this favorite idea in order to be true he is sure that all horses sleep in beds this is not only his fixed data it is his total data any data that doesnt contribute to it he will discard to person with service fac his idea of truth is whether something fits his idee fixe person may have his attention fixed to varying extent so person whose attention is not totally fixed may obtain fringe benefits from studying scientology to the degree that persons attention is fixed he is not able to explore the perimeter of his ideas and therefore cannot see greater truth so he is more entrapped than someone who is less fixed the greater the fixation the closer to psychosis psychosis is the state in which the individual has only the idee fixe the degree of enslavement is the degree to which the individual is fixated on the fixed idea if you try to communicate datum to someone with very fixed idea the datum will be received as false unless you indicate the fixed idea if you communicate some idea that fits with the fixed idea it will be accepted as true it could be that any other datum you then communicate will be taken as true but these data will not be inspected false data is worse than none as far as entrapment is concerned it is like putting up sign pointing over cliff and saying this way lies freedom one can only get fixated on falsehood never on truth truth is an allfreeing mechanism if freedom is not obtained the truth in question must be to some degree limited either in conception reception or application therefore anything you are worried about must have falsehood connected with it there is always lie connected to anything that you are having trouble with session goes well if and only if you get ta action the discovery that pcs case gain can be measured directly by ta action seems simple but it is an advance in technology beyond anything in the past fifty thousand years since it takes judgement of improvement out of the realm of opinion and possible inability to observe on the part of the auditor or the pc all confusions and masses must be there because they are held in abeyance so far as observation is concerned and will not asis because of stable datum stable datum prevents observation of the environment or these masses and therefore accumulates masses what is wrong with mind is that stable datum is substitute for observation person 1 ceased to inspect 2 fell back from living 3 let everything go to pieces 4 chose stable datum instead of inspecting 5 got an accumulation of mass and confusion when you shake up the stable datum by taking apart some of its ramifications confusion can start to flow off the amount of ta determines whether or not the pc had good session matter what the pc says there is opinion about it at all good ta means that the pc will feel better bad ta means almost invariably that the pc wont feel good stable datum is held in place by the confusion its supposed to confront and doesnt instead of remedying the confusion as it was supposed to do and as inspection would have done it collects more confusion like dam the more confusion it is supposed to hold in place the more confusion batters at it so the more confusion accumulates around it like twisting fork in bowl of taffy modern science and other mental technologies have taken stable datum that man is an animal and that the mind is brain the idea that man is mass is stable datum in confusion that is persistently dramatized try to tell the modern scientist about stuck flows and he will think that you are giving him lecture on blood and the causes of coronary thrombosis they cant be taught until you get them to inspect some thoughts that they have had about brains modern science has man equals the brain as stable datum what can you do for someone who is totally bound in and fixated to the point where he is being stable datum you could take datum of enormous magnitude and hold gun on this person and say believe it or we shoot you that substitutes forcedatum for inspection ultimately it fails because it is just another stable datum with an associated confusion that is why iq usually deteriorates with years of schooling since modern education is usually just laying in more and more uninspected stable data you would have whole new area of education if you said look over this data and sort out what is true in it you should have the student inspect data and find what is right or wrong about it this is of limited usefulness as long as everyone has his own fixed idea by which to tell rightness from wrongness another way to go about it would be to free up peoples ideas so that their perimeter of inspection increases so that they can inspect the data that lies before them you lead them up with disciplined action that leads them to their fixed idea when they have spotted and disposed of that they are free to inspect and move up to higher levels of truth therefore it is important to find the pcs central fixed idea as soon as possible thus freeing him to inspect more broadly you free being by freeing him not by making him wiser exteriorization and even the state of ot depends on getting greater freedom not more wisdom because with the freedom wisdom will be attainable and will take place anyway by concentrating on the wisdom you are all too likely to fall into the idea of the implanted stable datum freeing attention leads to freeing the being since all that can trap being is his attention thetan can only trap himself by 1 being unwilling to confront things that are not interesting to him 2 being unwilling to back out of situations in which he has lost interest 3 being unwilling to move off and go his way but still somehow be responsible for where he was various combinations of the above lead to the individual trapping himself by leaving some inanimate postulate in his place to confront confusions for him eg i have an unconscious mind that does all that the unconscious mind is that totality of stable data that is holding back that totality of confusion that the individual is longer aware of but is still doing so when you are looking for the pcs service fac you will be looking for that on which his attention is most fixated in pt fetish objects are just things associated in some way with persons service fac any cousin to the service fac that you find will give you ta as the confusion can flow the service fac is the last pair of ris formed at the top of the last truncated gpm postulated it has lot of locks and cousins which you will be able to pick up first it is actually impossible to find the exact pair of items as the service fac the pc has to know that they are part of that gpm before he will recognize them they must be seen as part of the bank before they are recognizable to the pc they have to be related to the last goal and to the last two ris you need these three data in addition you wont find the service fac but try anyway because that is where you will find the last actual gpm it is those two top ris that have the pc so restimulated that pt is restimulative and his ta wont move so you have choice but to find the pt goal of the pc having found the goal find the top oppterm of its gpm by asking who or what would be the latest idea formed concerning this goal to catch catfish make reasonablesized list list it to clean needle and null to reading item prepcheck it after the pc has cognited for awhile then you might see it rocket read the difficulty in finding pcs goals has always been in getting them to rocket read you can do this whole operation with only ticks and rr until you have prepchecked the top oppterm here is how to do it 1 find what you hope is his service fac this gives you enough ta so some charge is off hunt and punch around until you know youve got something that will get good ta action either on rightwrong prepcheck or something dont do anything with it it is not the real service fac this keeps the pcs tone and morale up by virtue of getting some ta off it or by having the promise of getting ta off it 2 start looking for the gpm if things bog down while looking for his goal you can still run the item from 1 for awhile and give him some ta 3 this could go on for couple of sessions until you get goal that ticks and that keeps going tick which reads as an actual goal probably from the past track it is not likely to be the pt goal so 4 use goaloppose to get up to pt so you oppose the goal do the same check on it then oppose that goal and get another one check each new goal found as being for sure an actual goal check if it is the pt goal the pc will be very interested in what you find since they are his actual goals keep doing this until eventually you will reach his pt goal 5 when you reach his pt goal and you oppose it the list goes nowhere it keeps developing more and more ta the pc wont arc break because you are listing towards his future postulates and unburdening the pt goal by the above phenomena you know that you have the pt goal 6 you check this make sure it is the pt goal 7 list for the top oppterm which may or may not be opposed yet you could find out where the pc is on the gpm by asking him if he has started to oppose the goal yet list to clean needle null it dont have two rrs on the list etc dont be too concerned with whether or not it is really the top oppterm the top oppterm will most likely give lots of needle action when you hit the top oppterm the needle goes mad 8 after you have given the pc his item you sit still and let him cognite 9 put in bigmidruds on the item as far as you can 10 call the item you will probably see it rocket read that is fast slippy way to get into the pcs current actual gpm starting with r3sc when you are on the goals finding step check over any goals that the pc may have mentioned earlier that were seen to fire then having found the pt goal you are ready to take the bank apart that first ri accounts for all pt restimulation the reason why we havent been able to find goals on pcs is the overburden of the top terminal and oppterm accumulating all the debris of pt and masking the top gpm or any gpm for that matter because of this masking action we used to have to find goals with ticks instead of rocket reads when the top ris and their accumulated mass are gone you are ready to roll right down the bank and back up again the pc gets ta ta ta now hes got new problem we are in new gpm and can go get it in the same way
