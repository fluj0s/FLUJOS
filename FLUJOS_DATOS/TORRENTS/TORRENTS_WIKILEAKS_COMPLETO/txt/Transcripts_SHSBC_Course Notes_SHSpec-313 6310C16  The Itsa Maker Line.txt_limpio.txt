6310c16 shspec313 the itsa maker line the itsamaker line is the line you are guiding as an auditor which sorts out the things in the case and gets the material that is reported to the auditor as itsa the itsa occurs at the end of this line the line from the pc to the auditor is the itsa communication line itsa is the identification of isness or wasness it is simple commodity until an itsa is recognized it is only potential itsa auditors can make mistake by thinking that there is potential itsa where there is only nothingness this is the commonest method by which an auditor refutes itsa the meter version of it is cleaning clean this is demanding more than the pcs got if you repeat the question this makes the pc feel as though you havent accepted his itsa when you do this in effect you deny the itsa that you have received you have cut the itsa comm line by refuting the itsa that was offered you may think that the arc break was caused by your cutting the comm line but it was really the invalidation of the pcs itsa that did it the auditor is likely to try to cure this situation by asking whether he has interrupted the pc that is also cleaning clean so the arc break intensifies you havent interrupted the communication you have enforced it you have to keep in mind what you are trying to do which is to get ta action all the significance on the case will have to be handled at level iv anyway so at levels i ii and iii what counts is ta action for description of these levels see p 462 above see also recent tape on level iv pp 524526 above everything wrong with the pc except how and why he started to make time track in the first place comes out of his gpms anyway level iv is the scientologists level the preceding levels mainly set the pc up for level iv i dont think that anyone will make ot except trained auditor trained auditors confront is up he knows what he is dealing with etc probably the basic barrier on the track in mental sciences has been specializing in results without also trying to make everyone into pro causer pcs have been audited on level iv in hgcs they have understanding of what is occurring they arc break easily they dont have the confront mainly they arent educated enough to understand what is going on so they get upset by reason of unknownnesses there is only one way that gpms can be run you must find and run the pt gpm first then keep going on down the track to prime postulate then repair you cant do it as you have been previously told to because you will get items out of other gpms you cant repair gpm until you have gone through the whole thing but you cant afford to make single mistake because you will spend amazing amounts of time correcting it youve got tremendous processes at levels i ii and iii so you should be able to sit down with raw public pc and turn out 35 divisions of ta in your first 2 12 hours on any pc anyplace if you cant do this it is because of lack of understanding of one of the basic points of auditing like the itsamaker line you might have some wild idea about something basic it might even be scientology datum magnified out of all proportion to its true importance for instance you may think pcs never answer the auditing command so you always get the itsa from the meter and leave the pc out thus destroying the itsamaker line you and the meter can act as substitute thetan perceiving things in the bank that the pc isnt perceiving at level iv the material is subitsa you have to depend on the meter at level iv because the pc cant itsa what is in the gpm without some assistance the auditor can undercut this with the meter and find out what the goal is because it rocketreads but if we rely too much on the meter we cut the pcs itsamaker line you still have to stay in comm with the pc and avoid invalidating his itsa and cutting his itsamaker line this doesnt mean that you should be very careful it just means that you should know what you are handling and how to handle it get observant so that you can tell when the pc is introverted when he has said all he wants to say etc in session means not only 1 interested in own case but also 2 with the itsamaker line in on his case not on the auditor but under the auditors control the top of the gpm is hard to run it is resistant to processing since the itsamaker line is invisible to the auditor the auditor has to synthesize what is going on the itsaline is not unit area thinkthinkthinking it is an actual line between the thetan and real thing the bank an auditor who attracts or rapidly shifts the pcs attention to himself has moved the itsamaker line to himself and it has become whatsit whats wrong with the auditor etc the itsamaker is what makes ta occur it is the pcs attention line an arc break is caused by sudden shift of attention you should be aware that perfection in the control of the pcs attention and perfect handling of the itsamaker line is impossible you will make couple of mistakes in this per session even if you are an expert what counts is how adroitly you can wriggle out of whatever you get into not how careful you are to stay out of trouble it helps to spot the birth of an arc break well in advance of its overt appearance an arc break is much easier to handle early on and you wont have audited over the outrud if even implicitly you give the pc an order to shut up and let you write the pc will do it and keep doing it pcs and the bank generally do what the auditor apparently wants nonverbal behavior may communicate an auditors desire to the pc auditors main goofs consist of giving apparent orders that they arent aware of and dont intend like stop inspecting your bank and put your attention on the emeter this may occur when the auditor fiddles with the meter lot fumbling takes away the auditors control of the itsamaker line by shifting the pcs attention to the auditor and the goof the bank always does what the auditor orders it takes combination of the auditors orders and the pcs inspection to get the bank handled randomity will occur the auditor who is allergic to unforeseen circumstances would do better to go to an old ladies home to get bank inspected 1 the auditor must direct the itsamaker line 2 the pc must put in the itsamaker line how does an auditor straighten these things out for one thing he can audit smoothly getting good ta so that he has cushion to use in working with the pc dont fix something when the pc is running well something that upsets you does not need to be handled if the pc wasnt concerned as long as the itsamaker line isnt affected in other words dont repair nonexistent situation if you try to repair something that didnt upset the pc you are cleaning clean and you will get an arc break sometimes the auditor gets consciencestricken this should not be remember that when you ask pc about something you put his attention on it you can also put pc on whatsit by being so conscientious that you are always looking for what is wrong you should only repair auditing when auditing isnt occurring case repair is otherwise an interruption of auditing
