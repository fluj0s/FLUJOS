g343g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the child support enforcement cse program was enacted in 1975 as federalstate program title ivd of the social security act to help strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on consistent and continuing basis and by helping some families to remain selfsufficient and off public assistance by providing the requisite cse services the cse program provides seven major services on behalf of children 1 parent location 2 paternity establishment 3 establishment of child support orders 4 review and modification of child support orders 5 collection of child support payments 6 distribution of child support payments and 7 establishment and enforcement of medical child support collection methods used by state cse agencies include income withholding intercept of federal and state income tax refunds intercept of unemployment compensation liens against property reporting child support obligations to credit bureaus intercept of lottery winnings sending insurance settlement information to cse agencies authority to withhold or suspend drivers licenses professional licenses and recreational and sporting license s of persons who owe pastdue support and authority to seize assets of debtor parents held by public or private retirement funds and financial institutions all 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands operate cse programs and are entitled to federal matching funds the federal government and the states share cse program costs at the rate of 66 and 34 respectively the cse program serves both welfare and nonwelfare families 1 families receiving temporary assistance to needy families tanf assistance title iva foster care payments title ive medicaid coverage title xix or food stamp recipients who at state opti on are required by law to cooperate with the cse agency automatically qualify for cse services free of charge other families must apply for cse services and states must charge an application fee that cannot exceed 252 1 in fy2007 of the nearly 158 million cse cases 136 21 million were in the tanf program 457 72 million had formerly been in the tanf program and 408 64 million had never been in the tanf program 2 the cse program enacted in 1975 pl 93647 at first permitted and then in 1984 pl 98378 required the cse agency to charge onetime application fee for families not on welfare in 1975 the law required that the application fee be reasonable as determined by federal regulations in 1984 the law specified that the fee could not exceed 25 the cse agency may charge this fee to the applicant ie the custodial parent or the noncustodial parent or pay the fee out of state funds in addition state may at its option recover costs in excess of the application fee such recovery of costs may be either from the custodial parent or the noncustodial parent although the application fee is mandatory federal law allows the state to charge an amount that can range from 1 cent to 25 many of the states that charge 1 or less application fee do so to maximize nontanf clients access to cse services many state cse officials view application fees as barrier to clients who do not have the financial means to apply for services they also claim that fees and other charges may discourage clients from seeking services because the fee is paid regardless of whether any child support is collected on behalf of the family others view application fees for nontanf families as way to reduce cse program costs the legislative history of pl 98378 srept 98387 p 3031 april 9 1984 says the committee believes that this minimal fee requirement represents reasonable way to help defray some of the costs incurred in processing the applicatio n and in providing support enforcement services this fee would still be significantly less costly to the nonafdc applicant nethan the cost of pursuing support enforcement through private attorney

have never been on the tanf program to pay 25 annual user fee when the child support enforcement cse program coll ects at least 500 in child support annually from the noncustodial parent on their behalf3 pl 109171 provides the state with four options on how to collect the fee the 25 user fee may be 1 retained by the state from child support collected on behalf of the family but the 25 cannot be part of the first 500 collected in any given federal fiscal year 2 paid by the custodial parent 3 recoveredrecouped from the noncustodial parent or 4 paid by the state out of state funds4 the intent of the 25 user fee is to recoup in part the costs of the cse program to the federal and state governments by decreasing cse program expenditures5 the 25 user fee from custodial and noncustodial parents is considered income to the cse program the federal and state governments share income to the cse program sometimes referred to as cost recovery at the same rate that they share program costs ie 66 federal and 34 state the congressional budget office cbo estimated that the 25 cs annual user fee provision would save the federal government 172 million and the state governments 93 million over the fouryear period fy2007fy2010 after the 25 user fee was enacted there was lot of interest in how it would be implemented most of the arguments about the user fee for and against concerned the option that permitted states to charge the custodial parent persons in favor of the mandatory 25 annual user fee maintain that it will to limited extent compensate the federal government and the states for operating cse program they claim that even on top of the cse application fee the cse program is still bargain for custodial parents they argue that there is comparison between the nominal fees that the cse program charges and the much higher fees that private attorney or collection agency would charge for obtaining child support payments they say that unlike the cse application fee it only applies to those who have received certain amount of child support payments they also point out that 75 of custodial parents had income above the poverty level 2005 census data and that on the basis of earlier data significant percentage of families 16 had income above 300 of poverty level 6 3 provision of mandatory 25 annual user fee for nonwelfare cse families has been discussed for many years such proposal was included in the george h w bush administrations fy1992 budget proposals and in the george w bush administrations fy2003 budget prop osals for additional information see states

negatively affecting their standard of living in addition they assert that it is normal practice to charge fee or user charge for services rendered persons opposed to the mandatory 25 annual user fee that is imposed on the custodial parent contend that it treats similarly situated families in an unequal manner they argue that low income custodial parent who has not had to go on welfare needs child support just as much as custodial parent who formerly was on welfare ie the tanf program they contend that the 25 annual fee would impose new surcharge on working poor families who were previously successful in remaining selfsufficient they cont end that fees generally take away funds that otherwise could be available to the child and the family they also point out that because the 25 user fee is considered cse program income the state gets 34 of the 25 fee 850 and the federal government gets the remaining 66 1650 they claim that the administrative cost of reprogramming states automated computer system to account for the fee would outweigh the financial benefit of the fees increased income to the state they also say that the financial benefit if any to the federal government would be negligible 7 according to the lewin groupeconorthwest report entitled anticipated effects of the deficit reduction act provisions on child support pr ogram financing and performance summary of data analysis and ivd director calls july 20 2007 many directors noted potential benefits of the fee including program revenue and instilling sense of ownership in ones child support case directors tho ugh identified more drawbacks to the fee all directors exp ected the cost of programming the statewide automated system would exceed the revenue generated from the fee at least in the shortterm this occurs at time when they are already facing budget cuts or foregoing other project enhancements some expressed concern that it will take money from lowincome fam ilies others fear it will drive customerslargely consistent payersfrom the program hurting not only child support program performance but families as well onefourth of the surveyed directors stated that their programs would not charge the fee and would pay the federal share out of program resources 8 g11g150g153g149g142g150g142g151g157g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g5g21g7g561g23g156g142g155g561g8g142g142g561 the
