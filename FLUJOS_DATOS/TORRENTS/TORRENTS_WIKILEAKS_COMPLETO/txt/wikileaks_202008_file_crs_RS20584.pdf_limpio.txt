violence is not commercial activity and is not substantially connected to interstate commerce rendering the statute invalid under the commerce clause the court further determined that since it targeted private actors 13981 was outside the scope of the fourteenth amendment determining that widespread and pervasive acts of gendermotivated violence have deleterious effect on the national economy and interstate commerce by removing women from the workplace discouraging interstate travel and reducing productivity congress enacted the violence against women act vawa in 1994 pursuant to its authority to regulate commerceamong the several states as well as section 5 of the fourteenth amendment1 among the various criminal and civil provisions of the act was 42 usc 13981 which established substantive right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by gender and created private cause of action against anyone who commits such crime allowing an injured party to obtain damages and other compensatory relief2 in united states v morrison the plaintiff brought suit under 13981 against two men who allegedly assaulted and raped her asserting that her right to be free from gender motivated violence had been violated3 considering the statute pursuant to the strictures of united states v lopez the supreme court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals for the fourth circuit holding that the statute violated both the commerce clausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20584crs2 4 morrison 2000 wl 574361 at 1 see also brzonkala v virginia polytechnic institute and state

settles the conflict among the lower courts regarding the validity of the act more importantly though the holding serves as much needed clarification of lopez where the supreme court determined for the first time in sixty years that federal statute exceeded the scope of congressional power under the commerce clause5 in lopez the supreme court adjusted the judiciarys traditional approach to commerce clause analysis maintaining that while the history of commerce clause jurisprudence represented an expansive interpretation of federal commerce clause power the judiciary maintained the ability to enforce limits on that power6 specifically at issue was whether 18 usc 922q federal statute prohibiting the possession of firearm on school grounds exceeded congressional authority arguing that the statute was valid exercise of commerce clause power the government contended that the possession of guns in school zones had serious impact on interstate commerce by leading to violent crime and plethora of other social ills addressing these arguments chief justice rehnquist discussed the judicially enforceable limits of the commerce clause delineating three categories of activity which come within its ambit first congress possesses the authority to regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce second congress may regulate the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or persons or things in interstate commerce finally congress may also regulate activities which have substantial relation to and effect on interstate commerce7 in applying these standards to the case before it the supreme court determined that 922q was neither regulation of the instrumentalities or channels of interstate commerce making the determination of the case hinge on the substantial effects test8 in conducting its analysis under this category the court identified four major problems with the regulation at issue first it was determined that 922q was criminal statute which by its terms had connectio n with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise and did not play an essential role in larger regulatory scheme secondly the supreme court also found it significant that there was jurisdictional element in the statute which would ensure that firearm possession affected interstate commerce in particular case third the court stated that the lack of congressional findings regarding the impact of the offense on the national economy detracted from any substantial relation it might have to interstate commerce finally the court held that if regulation based on such expansive reasoning was upheld it would convert congressional authority under the commerce clause to general police power of the sort retained by the states9 determining that the substantial effects doctrine delineated in lopez was controlling the supreme court in morrison first noted that 13981 could not be classified as regulation of economic activity in particular the court explained that gendermotivated crimes are not in any sense of the phrase economic activity10 furthermore the court stressed that while it was not adopting categorical rule against aggregating the effects of anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20584crs3 11 id at 9 12 id at 10 13 id at 10 14 id at 10 15 id at 10 16 id at 10 17 id at 10noneconomic activity its prior precedent has upheld commerce clause regulation of interstate activity only where that activity is economic in nature11 turning to the second prong of the lopez analysis the court noted that like the gunfree school zones act 13981 lacked jurisdictional element establishing that the federal cause of action is in pursuance of congress power to regulate interstate commerce12 stating that the presence of such jurisdictional element would support the argument that sufficient link existed between gendermotivated violence and interstate commerce the court noted that congress elected to cast 13981s remedy over wider and more purely intrastate body of violent crime13 the court then discussed the importance of congressional findings regarding the effects of gendermotivated violence on the national economy and interstate commerce while noting that 13981 was indeed support ed by numerous findings the court stressed its declaration in lopez that simply because congress may conclude that particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily make it so rather according to the court legislative findings serve to clarify the relationship between the regulation at issue and interstate commerce with the constitutionality of the law ultimately hinging on the legal aspects of the substantial effects doctrine14 applying this maxim the court held that the congressional findings made in support of 13981 were constitutionally insufficient in particular the court explained that while voluminous findings were made regarding the deleterious economic effects of violence against women they were weakened by the fact that they were predicated on line of reasoning the court had already rejected as unworkable if we are to maintain the constitutions enumeration of powers15 in reaching this conclusion the court addressed the argument that 13981 was justified in light of the fact that gendermotivated violence leads to higher medical costs and discourages economic interaction in areas and fields seen as susceptible to such violence thereby inhibiting productivity and reducing the demand for interstate products16 the court rejected these justifications declaring that they were identical to the reasoning deemed unacceptable in lopez and if accepted would imbue congress with the power to regulate any crime as long as the nationwid aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on employment production transit or consumption further the court noted that if 13981 were upheld congress would necessarily have the power to regulate all types of violence given that gendermotivated violence as subset of all violent crime would have smaller economic impact than the larger class of which it is part17 expanding upon this observation the court noted that to allow such regulation of noneconomic activity would enable federal regulation of almost any activity including family law and other areas of traditional state regulation since the aggregate effect of marriage divorce and childbearing on the national economy is undoubtedly significant the court also noted that congress itself recognized this possibility leading it to expresslyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20584crs4 18 id at

application of 13981 in the family law context the court was unpersuaded by this self imposed limitation stating that the limitation of congressional authority is not matter of legislative grace18 in light of these factors the court rejected the argument that congress may regulate noneconomic violent criminal conduct based solely on that conducts aggregate effect on interstate commerce further declaring that the constitution requires distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local19 the court stressed that this maxim preserves one of the few principles that has been consistent since the clause was adopted namely that the regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities channels or goods involved in interstate commerce has always been the province of the states20 having rejected the validity of 13981 on commerce clause grounds the court next addressed the question of whether the provision could be upheld pursuant to congress remedial power under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment the court began by stating that section 5 establishes that congress may enforce the constitutional guarantee that state may not deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny any person equal protection of the laws21 in asserting section 5 authority for enacting the civil remedy provision of the act congress relied on voluminous congressional record in determining that there is pervasive bias in various state justice systems against victims of gendermotivated violence the court noted that supporters of 13981 maintain that this bias results in insufficient investigation and prosecution denying victims of such violence equal protection of the laws enabling congress to enact private civil remedy against perpetrators of gendermotivated violence to both remedy the states bias and deter future instances of discrimination in the state courts22 reaffirming prior cases establishing that statesponsored gender discrimination is violative of the fourteenth amendment the court stressed that the language and purpose of the amendment place certain limitations on the manner in which congress may attack discriminatory conduct that are necessary to prevent the fourteenth amendment from obliterating the framers carefully crafted balance of power between the states and national government23 the most important of these limitations according to the court is the maxim that the amendment extends only to state action and cannot be used to target merely private conduct however discriminatory or wrongful24 rejecting the argument that recent cases have in effect overruled this longstanding limitation on congress 5 authority the court again declared that governmental action

unconstitutional state action25 the court also dismissed the argument that genderbased disparate treatment by state authorities justified 13981 specifically the court declared that the remedy was not correctiv in nature and did not directly target the perceived state discrimination clarifying this point the court explained that 13981 visits consequence whatever on anypublic official involved in investigating or prosecuting an allegation of gender motivated violence placing the provision outside the scope of any section 5 remedy previously upheld by the court26 further the court found it significant that 13981 applied uniformly throughout the nation irrespective of the fact that the congressional findings supporting the provision indicated that the problem of discrimination against the victims of gendermotivated crimes does not exist in all states or even most states27 because of these characteristics the court held that congress power under 5 does not extend to the enactment of 1398128 having rejected the validity of 13981 on both commerce clause and fourteenth amendment grounds the court concluded its disposition of the case by stating that civilized system of justice could fail to provide victims of gendermotivated violence with remedy the court stressed though that under our federal system that remedy must be provided by the states as opposed to the federal government29 the dissent written by justice souter and joined by justices stevens ginsburg and breyer disagreed with the majoritys application of the substantial effects test pursuant to lopez30 specifically justice souter maintained that congress has the power to regulate any activity that in the aggregate has substantial effect on interstate commerce and further that the existence of such substantial effects is not question for the courts31 distinguishing 13981 from lopez justice souter stated that the large body of congressional findings regarding the effects of violence against women on interstate commerce established an explicit predicate for governmental regulation32 in particular the dissent maintained that the sufficiency of the evidence before congress to provide rational basis for the finding cannot seriously be questioned33 the dissent went on to argue that regulation was justified given that such violence would have detrimentalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20584crs6 34

power under the commerce clauseextended to all activity thathas substantial effect on interstate commerce35 justice souter opined that the fact that 13981 was not upheld indicated that the majority was adhering to the substantial effects test only nominally suggesting that theanalysis is not factual enquiry for congress in the first instance with subsequent judicial review looking only to the rationality of the congressional conclusion but one of rather different sort dependent upon uniquely judicial competence36 building on this interpretation justice souter surmised that whereas early commerce clause jurisprudence maintained formalistic distinction between commercial and noncommercial activities to further laissezfaire economics the courts rejection of 13981 employed categorical formalism to further conception of federalism37 criticizing this approach the dissent argued that prior law repudiated the notion that the traditional state concern theory could support limit on the congress commerce clause power the dissent also argued that in addition to improperly relying on state spheres of action in commerce analysis the court mistakenly rejected the precept that politics not judicial review should mediate between state and national interests38 in support of this point justice souter maintained that the court erred in not giving weight to the fact that majority of states expressly supported the civil remedy thus forcing them to enjoy the new federalism whether they want it or not39 the dissent also asserted that the courts decision blurred the substantial effects test to such degree that ensuing cases would have to be reviewed ad hoc40 in closing the dissent stated that the court was ignoring the facts of integrated national commerce and political relationship between states and nation much affected by their respective treasuries and constitutional modifications adopted by the people the federalism of some earlier time is more adequate to account for those facts today than the theory of laissezfaire was able to govern the national economy 70 years ago41
