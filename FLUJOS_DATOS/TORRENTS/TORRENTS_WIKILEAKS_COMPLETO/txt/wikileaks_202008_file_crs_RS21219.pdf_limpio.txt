were included in the 109th congress in longterm welfare reauthorization bills approved by house ways and means subcommittee and the house education and the workforce committee hr 240 the senate finance committee s 667 and in the house version of budget reconciliation hr 4241 scaleddown ve rsion of welfare reauthorization was included in the final agreement on budget reconciliation the ficit

report will be updated to track any further legislative activity for broader disc ussion of the issue see crs report rl32859 the superwaiver proposal and rvice integration hist ory of federal initiatives by cheryl vincent bush administration proposal the 109th congress continued debate that began in 2002 over reauthorizing the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant and related programs see crs issue brief ib10140 for the outcome of this debate in february 2002 the bush administration released an outline of its welfare package entitled working toward independence which included proposal to allow st ates to request waivers from federal requirements in order to integrate activities across wide spectrum of programs according to that document programs to be covered by the new waiver authority would include but not be limited to tanf food stamps the workforce investment act wia the wagnerpeyser act which authorizes th employment service federal housing and homeless assistance programs and ged nd postsecondary education programs the administration justified its proposal by noting the ccess of tanf in transforming statelevel public assistance programs into innovative and comprehensive workforce assistance programs the adminis tration said other fe deral programs providehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21219crs2 1 in addition to these two committees hr 240 was referred to the house committees on agriculture energy and commerce and financ ial services which have taken action 2 because hr 4241 was reconciliation bill it was organized according to committee thus superwaiver provisions appeared both in title ii education and the workforce committee and in title v iii ways and means comm ittee most of the provisions were identical however the title ii provisions only covered programs under education and the workforce jurisdiction and title v iii only covered programs under ways and means jurisdictionsimilar assistance to lowincome families but the potential combined effectiveness of these programs is compromised by differences in administrative practices and rules the waiver authority would allow states to build stronger more integrated and effective service systems and coherent and comprehe nsive strategies on behalf of lowincome individuals and families and deliver more seamless services tied to stated program goals and selfsufficiency and empl oyment outcomes the document said the proposal would give states flexibility to establish or change eligibility criteria and program rules as long as they serve the same general populations targeted by the individual programs to be included programs opera ting under waiver authority would be considered demonstrations subject to evaluation states would submit their waiver request to each affected federa l agency explaining how they would achieve individual progra m goals and how the waiver would improve achievement of these goals cabinet secretaries would approve requests that appeared likely to improve the quality or effectiveness of the affected programs the demonstrations would be costneutral in ot her words they could result in additional federal spending and would be suspended or terminated if they exceeded specified spending levels each partment would re port annually on the number and scope of waivers approved and make r ecommendations for modifications in current programs if warranted by evaluation findings fina lly an informal document circulated by administration officials indicated that federal interagency waiver board would be established through executive order to facilitate the processing of waiver requests house action welfare reauthorization provisions incl uding the superwaiver were approved by the house ways and means subcommittee on human resources and the house education and the workforce committee hr 2401 and were included in the house version of the 2005 budget reconciliation bill hr 42412 for the most part the waiver provisions in these bills were the same as those in the housepassed hr 4 of the 108th congress which in turn was modeled on the housepassed hr 4737 of the 107th congress as included in hr 4241 the wa iver provisions would have covered more narrow range of programs than the other proposals housesenate conferees on the budget reconc iliation b ill which was considered under its senate number s 1932 agreed to maintain scaledback version of welfare reauthorization extending tanf and rela ted programs through fy2010 see crs report rs22369 however the superwaiver provisi ons were dropped from the final agreement the conference agreement was signed into law on february 8 pl 109171 and it is unclear whether hr 240 or its senate count erpart s 667 discussed below will see anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21219crs3 3 as introduced in the 107th congress hr 4090hr 4092 included all programs administered by the departments of education ed health and human services hhs and labor as reported the bills included only specified ed hhs and labor programs additional programs housing homelessness food stamps were added in the clean bill hr 4737 sent to the floorfurther action in this congress or whether further action will be taken separately on the superwaiver provisions the waiver authority would allow demonstr ations that coordi nate multiple public assistance workforce development and ot her programs for the purpose of supporting working individuals and families helping families escape welfare dependency promoting child wellbeing or helping build stronger families using innovative approaches to strengthen service systems and provide more coordinated and effec tive service delivery states or substate entities that administer tw or more covered programs could propose demonstration by submitting an application to each appropriate federal agency the proposal would describe progra ms to be included in the project and how the purposes of each program would be achieved plus how the project would improve achievement of these purposes in terms of quality or costeff ectiveness the proposal would identify the population to be served designate eligib ility criteria to be used and establish performance objectives the proposal would specify stat utory and regulatory requirements to be waived and justify the need for waivers the house superwaiver provisions would re quire that projects be costneutral as determined by the office of management nd budget omb meaning that they could not result in any increased federal payments compared to what would have been paid without the demonstration costneutrality could be determined on an annual basis or over fiveyear period however unlike the original administration proposal the house provisions do not specify consequence or pena lty eg suspension or termination of the demonstration repayment to th federal government of ex cess spending if the project exceeded ombs estimate of costneutral spending the secretary of each affected federal department would have to approve the proposal and could approve pr oposals and waive any requireme nts necessary if project had reasonable likelihood of achieving the objectives of the programs to be included could reasonably be expected to meet costneutrality rules and coordinated two or more programs the secretaries w ould have 90 days to approve requests action by the end of 90 days would be deemed an approval however requests for additional information from the applicant would extend the time available for decision by the secretary demonstrations could be approved for up to five years and renewed for an additional five years under th administration proposal pplicants would be required to conduct evaluations of their projects the secretaries would be required to notify appropriate congressional committees of their decision to approve or disapprove waiver applications and to report nnually on approved projects num ber of waivers granted and specific provisions waived the extent to wh ich projects were achieving program goals through improved quality or costeffectiveness and meeting performance objectives and costneutrality requirements and any recommendations for program changes covered programs during the 2002 debate the lis t of programs covered by the waiver authority changed3 under hr 240 and as passed by the house in the previous two congresses the waiver woul d cover the following programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21219crs4 4 hr 240 also includes separate provision to llow up to five states

homelessness and food stamps limitations on waivers hr 240 specifies certain provisions that federal agencies could not waive provision could be waiv ed if it relates to the following civil rights or prohibition of discrimination the purposes or goals of any program maintenanceofeffort requi rements ie provisions that require states or other entities to maintain certain level of spending health or safety labor standards under the fair labor standards act of 1938 or environmental protection additional provisions that could not be waived are as follows section 241a of the adult educati on and family literacy act which requires that federal funds be used to supplement and not supplant existing state or local spending provisions under section 5a of the united states housing act of 1937 which require and govern the devel opment and content of public housing agency plans and require the establis hment of resident advisory boards this is not included in the reconc iliation bill since housing would not be covered program in the case of any waivers involving wia requirement s related to wage and labor standards including nondisplacement protections workerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21219crs5 5 this list of wia provisions that could not be waived is also the list of provisions that cannot be waived under wias current waiver aut hority section 189i4ai of the act 6 despite these restrictions provisions that c ould be waived under the proposal are broader than the list that can be waived under the food stamp programs current waiver authorityrights participation and protection of workers and partic ipants grievance procedures and judicial review nondi scrimination alloca tion of funds to local areas eligibility of providers or participants the establishment and functions of local areas and local boa rds and procedures for review and approval of plans5 in the case of waivers involving th food stamp program provisions that deny benefits to certain classes of individuals if waiver of such provisions would expand eligibility for the program the prohibition against cashing out food stamp bene fits quality control provisions and noncitizen eligibility rules6 these are not included in the reconciliation bill since food stamps would not be covered program and any provision that requires state to pass through funds received by the state to substate entity two additional restrictions would effectively narrow the waiver authoritys scope specifically under the 109th congress proposals and as previously passed by the house the legislation would prohibit the following waivers of any funding restricti on or limitation included either in an appropriations act or an other legislation or transfer of funds from one cove red program to another either appropriated funds or direct spending however the bills specify that funding restrictions or limita tions which could not be waived do not include such program requireme nts as application procedures performance standards reporting requirements or eligibility standards in other words such provisions eg food stamp eligibility rules in the case of hr 240 could potentially be waived moreover it is unclear how the administration would interpret funding restric tion or limitation finally hr 240 specifies that any project that includes housing must certify that the annual public housing agency pha plan includes information about the project and that any relevant resident advisory board recommendations are included in the pha plan the bill also makes necessary conforming ame ndments to section 5a of the housing act senate action the senate finance committee approved dr aft welfare bill on march 9 that was subsequently introduced by chairman grassl ey on march 17 as s 667 this bill would authorize program coordination demonstration projects that are identical to the superwaiver provisions in hr 240 and the house reconciliation bill with two critical differences s 667 would only include programs under title iva of the social security act ie tanf welfare towork grants and mandatory child care grants under section 418 and ssbg andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21219crs6 s 667 would limit the number of states that could participate to 10 s 667 further specifies that provisions in section 418 of the social security act requiring mandatory child care grants to be used only for child care assistance could not be waived s 667 also would require pr oject evaluations to be conducted by an independent contractor and to use random assignment methodology to the maximum extent feasible hr 240 and the house r econciliation bill would re quire evaluations but would not mandate an inde pendent contractor or particular methodology discussion of waiver proposal congress has previously included author ity to waive statutory and regulatory provisions in numerous programs and in fact the challenge of integrating and coordinating programs that assist the same general population has been debated for decades see crs report rl32859 typically waivers are advocated by recipients of grant funds most often states as way to provide flexibility and encourage innovation within federal parame ters concerns raised about waivers usually focus on accountability and the extent to which congress can ensure th at federal funds are used to meet nationally established goals some waivers have been justified as way to test the impact of new policies with mandatory evaluations to help inform future decisions other waivers have been enacted to address specific concerns within specific states or localities currently programs with waiver authority include some social security act programs eg tanf child support enforcem ent medicaid child welfare food stamps the employment service wag nerpeyser act and wia at first blush the proposed superwaiver appears broader than existing waiver authorities however in the case of wia for example the same limitations on waivers in current law would apply to the proposed new waiver authority on the ot her hand the superwaiver would be broader than current food stamp law allows and also than currently allowed under wagnerpeyser and some programs included in hr 240 housing homeless and adult education now allow statutory waivers at all thus the impact of this proposal could vary by program some programs are already very broad with few mandatory rules to waive most notably ssbg other programs have more targeted purposes and specific rules such as housing and homeless programs further some covered programs are stateadministered while local governments or entities play significant or in some cases primary role in others such as wia welfaretowork and hous ing finally the waiver included in hr 240 would cover major programs such as t anf and food stamps which provide billions of dollars and operate nationwide but also would include job opportunities for low income individuals joli very small demonstration 55 milli on annually in which hhs gives competitive grants to about dozen nonprofits each year the administration has proposed to terminate the joli program in its fy2007 budget since the superwaiver contains few limitations on what could not be waived for most of the covered programs and also becau its stated purpose is very general this new authority would give great discretion to the executive branch in combination with state andor local applicants however restrictions in the bills prohibiting transfer of funds among programs or waiver of cong ressional funding limitati ons within programs could also limit the scope of potential waiver demonstrations
