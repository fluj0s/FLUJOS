substantially different set of decisions to make than if they were few years younger while all qualified unemployed workers may receive unemployment compensation older workers may replace lost earnings conditional on age with retirement savings and pension pr ograms for example workers who are at least 59½ years old may begin to take funds out of their ira based savings without incurring the 10 early withdrawal penalty at age 60 qualified widows and widowers may begin to receive their widowers social security benefits at age 62 all workers may receive reduced or early social security benefit finally at some age between 65 and 67 depending on their birth year workers can receive their full or nonreduced social security benefit thus depending on the age of the older unemployed workers new options are incorporated into their labor force participation decisions and uc benefits for unemployed workers become relatively less important in income replacement previously these workers were motivated to stay in the labor market and use uc benefits to give themselves adequate time to engage in an effective job search as they age the older workers job searches change in order

unexpectedly early retirement is not new development rather it is the scale of the phenomenon relative to the overall size of the workforce that is new the shifting demographics of the workforce have made what was once fairly small policy issue grow in importance over the next 25 years the age profile of the us population and the us workforce will change dramatically members of the baby boom generation those who were born between 1946 and 1964 are currently between 40 and 59 years old this boom creates peak in the us population chart presented in figure 1 as the baby boom ages the demographic profile of the united states substantially alters as the share of the population aged 3555 decreases and the share of older american increases the shift in the age profile has particular implications for older americans and in the 55 to 69 year old demographic group in 2000 this group comprised 120 of the total population predictions for 2030 increase its proportion to 180 this 6 percentage point increase is equivalent to just under 50 growth in the demographic groups share of the population in 2050 the proportion of the 55 to 69 year olds relative to the total population is expected to fall to 158 however this is still more than 30 increase from 2000

affect all occupations equally research suggests that the educational and health services industries will be disproportionately affected when workers in those industries begin to retire since they currently have an age distribution which is older than that of other industries2 federal policy has recognized the problems that this demographic trend may create by encouraging workers to extend their labor force participation through increasing the full retirement age for social security benefits while decreasing the rate at which earnings offset benefits3 and through abolishing mandatory retirement ages for most jobs4 2 arlene dohm gauging the labor force effects of retiring babyboomers monthly labor review july 2000 3 for example pl 106182 the senior citizens freedom to work act effective january 1 2000 eliminated the retirement earnings test for those at or above fullretirement age and under age 70 those over age 70 were already exempt the stated intent of the act was to reduce the labor force participation and earnings disincentives that recent retirees faced the previous rules for workers ages from ages 65 up to 75 had an exemption of the first 15500 earned and onethird reduction in benefits thereafter 4 pl 90202 the age discrimination in employment act of 1967 amended in 1986 by pl 99592 removed the upper age limitation of age 70 of the act this amendment

workers to work longer have not been mirrored by supports to keep older unemployed workers in the workforce5 with few exceptions the uc system generally does not treat common older worker employment patterns favorably depending on the particular state desire for parttime work or selfemployment may disqualify worker from receiving uc benefits at the same time retirement income may lower uc benefits which are especially important for those workers who are bridging into retirement this retirement income offset in the uc program will decrease the amount of income connected with an older workers job search and may cause unemployed older workers to completely exit the labor market as the ratio of older workers to younger workers increases the impact on the economy of older worker responses to spells of unemployment increases g14g138g139g152g155g561g8g152g155g140g142g561g18g138g155g157g146g140g146g153g138g157g146g152g151g561 labor force participation rates measure the ratio of the civilian noninstitutionalized civilian population that 1 has job or 2 has searched for job in the previous four weeks labor force participation rates climb rapidly in the population aged 2024 as formal schooling is finished and students enter the labor market between the ages of 25 and 54 labor force participation is fairly consistent and high with approximately 83 being actively engaged in the labor market rates begin substantial decline as workers reach age 55 just under 62 of those between the ages of 55 and 64 and just over 13 of those 65 and older are actively working or searching for work the unemployment rate is the ratio of those workers who did not have job but had searched for job in the previous four weeks to all workers active in the labor market either searching or employed typically unemployment is large social concern for the youngest and least skilled of workers as workers age and gain skills and tenure the likelihood that they are unemployed decreases in fact one study found that the aging labor force accounted for half of the decrease in unemployment in the 1990s 6 in 2003 48 of primeage 3554 years of age workers were unemployed on average older workers continued to have lower rates of unemployment 39 for those aged 5564 and 36 for those 65 and older however between 2000 and 2002 older workers experienced rising unemployment rates that were greater in relative magnitude than those for younger workers during the same period7 table 1 lists the participation and unemployment rates for workers aged 35 and older in 2003 notice that labor force participation rates are heavily influenced by the age at which older americans become eligible for programs such as early retirement for social security age 62 the unemployment rates do not vary substantially for older americans this may be in part due to older unemployed workers choosing to declare themselves out of the labor force for example it is unlikely that all of the 562 of the american s aged 6264 who are out of the labor force would prefer not to have job some may choose to declare themselves retired rather than admit to being unemployed there is weak evidence that th is may be true from the otherwise unexplained 10 decrease in the reported unemployment rate from 44 for americans aged 6061 to 40 for those aged 6264 5 for example the uc program does not allow extra time for older workers job searches nor does the uc program allow for easy fulfillment of uc program requirements by creating selfemployment 6 abbigail chioto and michael owyang low unemployment old

ulation sur vey 20 05 table 1 demonstrates that workers aged 3554 primeage workers have the highest labor force participation rates with more than 80 of the noninstitutionalized civilian population active in the labor market there is rapid decline of labor force activity as workers reach their late 50s 5559the approximate age when many buyout s and some private pension plans allow for early retirement this is reflected in pronounced drop in labor force participation of 84 percentage points from 794 to 714 from what was reported for workers in their early 50s this drop is followed by subsequent 198 percentage point drop as workers enter their early 60s when widowers social security benefits age 60 and early retirement age 62 become available in the span from the 5054 age group to the 6064 age group the labor force participation rate falls to just under twothirds of what it had been this is not perhaps surprising given that at age 62 reduced social security benefit becomes available this reduction in social security benefits has been constructed to be actuarially fair on average that is it does not set penalty for early participation but rather reduces the social security benefit so that the discounted value of the benefit is equal to that of the full retirement benefit for an average worker

for the purposes of this report the term worker refers to all participants in the labor market individuals who are not employed or not actively searching for job and are at least 55 years old are labeled as being retired regardless of pension or social security benefit income this is substantially different from the definition often used in retirement analyses generally retirement is defined with reference to two characteristics nonparticipation in the labor force and receipt of income from pensions social security or other retirement savings vehicles an individual who does not work for compensation and who receives income only from these retirementbased income replacements would meet this definition of retirement between these two extremes however are those wh might be considered to have retired based on one part of the definition but not the other fo r example of recipients of employer pensions

female recipients were employed8 sometimes these workers are employed in bridge jobs that help to transition them from full labor force participation into retirement other workers may be fully employed in another career while enjoying the retirement benefits from previous job9 in such cases retirement from particular job does not necessarily signal that the worker has withdrawn from the workforce and moved into the strict definition of retirement on the other hand some of those who retire from fulltime employment continue to work part time to supplement their retirementbased income but receive the majority of their income through social security pensions and savings these workers would typically be classified as retired even though they continue to engage in paid employment as these examples suggest not everyone who receives pension income is retired and some people who work for pay may be considered retired

planned process for many workers their retirement plans may involve an abrupt move from being full time workers to enjoying full retirement without any further labor force participation other workers may have retirement plans for gradual transition into retirement 10 these transitional steps may include creating alternative work arrangements moving from fulltime to parttime status or switching to

for some workers however an unexpected loss of employment may disrupt their retirement plans and push the workers into an earliera nd unexpectedly abruptretirement as their uc benefits are exhausted or if they choose not to receive uc benefits as they decide to stop working earlier than they had originally intended these unplanned retirements result in permanent decreases in retirement benefits as the workers begin drawing benefits earlier and in the case of social security early retirement penalties occur while discontinuing the accumulation of retirement assets possibly leading to lower total retirement assets 8 see crs report rl30629 older workers employment and retirement trends by patrick purcell 9 for example individuals who have retired from careers in lawenforcement or the

impact on older workers than on younger workers empirically research suggests that older workers have an increased difficulty in obtaining similar position at the same level of compensation because their higher wages often are difficult to fully replace through reemployment workers lose their wage premium attributed to longevity tenure or employment contract12 older workers also may lose the wage premium for skills specific to their previous firm if workers find new jobs in different industries they lose the premium for that industrylevel knowledge as well13

wage replacement to active job seekers who ar involuntarily out of work older workers generally have longterm stable work histories and are less likely to be unemployed than other workers as result older workers who lose their jobs are more likely to receive uc benefits and have higher expected benefits because of their stronger work histories and greater understanding of the uc system14 older workers are also more likely to exhaust their benefits15 g6g146g156g149g152g140g138g157g142g141g561g17g149g141g142g155g561g25g152g155g148g142g155g156g561 studies suggest that older unemployed workers take longer to find new jobs are less likely to find job and their new jobs replace smaller frac tion of previous earnings older workers are much more likely to be dislocated from their jobs that is they are more likely to have lost job where they had long tenure and the separation from the employer is permanent16 dislocated workers have lower chance of finding new employmen t in addition those who do find employment typically earn substantially less than they did in their previous job17 for older workers job dislocation has more of an impact on earnings th an for younger workers significant proportion of their previous high salaries may be attributed to job tenure thus wages from new jobs may be substantially lower likewise facing lower levels of replaced earnings older workers are also less 12 roger gordon and alan blinder market wages reservation wages and retirement decisions nber working paper w0513 1981 advancing age may pull wages downward as productivity for many workers

strictly determined by the new employment activity however workers who are bridging to retirement through parttime work or selfemployment are sometimes excluded from receiving uc benefits and workers

the month the worker achieves full retirement age at which point there is reduction in benefits24 the social security amendments of 1983 pl 9821 gradually increased fullretirement age for those born after 1937 from 65 to 67 for those born after 1959 as result workers born after 1937 effectively face lower social security benefit levels than workers born before 1938 thus worker would also find it more expensive to choose early retirement at age 62 forgoing greater percentage of his or her fullretirement benefit an expected result of this degradation of benefit level would be that workers would work longer and save more to replace their reduced benefits the changes in the earnings test and the increase in the fullretirement age are fairly new and have only recently been analyzed before the elimination of the earnings test for individuals at or above the full retirement age most studies ch as that by produced by gruber and orzag 2000 suggested that eliminating the test would have modest effect on labor supply one study friedberg 2000 predicted that eliminating the earnings test would increase the hours worked by 6569 year old men by about 5 25 the first study to investigate the preliminary effects of removing the test song 2003 concludes that while the removal increased hours worked for those with higher earnings the effect on lower earners is not statistically significant and there is clear evidence of the effect of the removal on the labor force participation rate but others have found evidence of change in labor supply 26

searching for parttime work if an olde r worker was already in bridge job working fewer hours the worker may longer have enough recorded earnings to be sufficient for the purpose of receiving uc benefits this inflexibility also is seen in the treatment of searching exclusively for parttime work it is only in 29 states and the district of columbia that worker need not be explicitly available for fulltime work two states michigan and west virginia summarily exclude workers from benefits if they search for only parttime positions as workers age selfemployment increases in 2003 69 of all nonfarm workers were self employed in comparison 105 of those aged 55 64 and 153 of those 65 and older were self employed 29 after spell of unemployment the probability that workers begin their own business or are otherwise selfemployed increases30 however while these workers may be actively creating job they generally do not qualify for uc benefits since they are not seeking nonself employed

compulsory retirement on account of age there are few occupations that have bona fide reasons for agebased compulsory retirement31 most states allow workers to collect uc benefits if they longer have position due to compulsory retirement treating the situation as spell of unemployment however eight states consider compulsory retirement to be voluntary quit and either exclude the workers from collecting uc or limit or reduce benefits understanding the impact of unemployment on older workers is complicated by the way that non work income in particular social security and pension income may reduce unemployment compensation the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of 1980 pl 96364 requires that all retirement income from an employer when the earnings from that employer are used to calculate the uc benefit base period employer32 be offset against the uc benefit this is to ensure that worker who retires does not also collect uc benefits from the job from which they retired states are permitted to reduce uc benefits on less than dollarfordollar basis by taking into account the contributions made by the worker to finance the plan this requirement applies only to those payments on periodic not lumpsum basis as listed in table 3 columns 4 and 5 states can impose broader offsets than federal law requires for pension income the district of columbia and virginia offset all pension income as well as excluding lumpsum payments the remaining states restrict the offset to pension income paid by baseyear employers only some states offset this income only if the amount were increased by the baseperiod employment thirteen states do not disregard the em ployee contribution portion of pensions uc benefits may be offset by social security pa yments currently nine states and the district of columbia at least partially reduce uc benefits if the worker is also receiving social security payments g7g150g153g149g152g162g150g142g151g157g561g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g561 few

training and partnershi p act of 1982 pl 97300 for adult training needs furthermore wia performance measures may give individual programs incentives to avoid enrolling older workers34 research

determine uc benefits typically this period begins five quarters before the quarter of unemployment and ends one quarter before the quarter of unemployment 33 the worker profiling and reemployment

born in 1942 may keep all of their social security benefits with earnings tests workers younger than the fullretirement age for the entire year have an earnings limit for every 2 earned above 12960 in 2007 there is 1 deduction in the benefit the earnings test is altered if worker will achieve full retirement age during the year in this case for every 3 earned above 34440 there is 1 reduction in

transitions from workbased income security to retirementbased income security the workers incentives to remain in the labor force change this changing incentive structure is result of the worker moving from participating in program designed to aid an effective job search and quick return to the labor force towards series of programs that are primarily intended to ensure retirement income adequacy while it is difficult to measure the exact effect that the incentives and disincentives have on older americans participation in the labor force an examination of the changing patterns of income sources as americans age may capture the end result the effect of these potential earnings substitutes table 2 and the changes in tax rates shown table 3 may be seen in table 4 where the changing distribution of income sources for older americans is shown table 4 describes the sources of income for americans 35 years and older in 2005 by age category from ages 35 to 44 appr oximately

alternative working arrangements and eligibility for and receipt of various types of retirement income including social security benefits currently each states uc system treats these typical older worker employment and income patterns in different manner some states allow flexibility in the job search allowing those workers who are only willing to work parttime to collect uc benefits some states treat retirement and pension income and social security benefits as earnings that offset the uc benefit other states offset only the portion of the increase in pension income that is attributable to the time period that also qualifies the unemployed worker for uc benefits ideally there should exist balance where the uc system will be able to recognize the need for older workers to bridge into retirement and supplement their earnings with variety of nonwork income sources while still maintaining the programs work emphasis another policy issue is how federal programs might better balance providing income support for older americans with providing appropriate wo rk incentives for those who would prefer to remain engaged in some type of work the abrupt changes in income support

extreme disincentives to remain engaged or reengage in the labor market for certain groups of older unemployed workers for example from age 62 until the year before full retirement age early social security benefits are offset by rates of up to 50 as well as being subject to the employment taxes this provides disincentive for fulltime workers to take early social security benefits as they would see fairly small change in their total income while subjectin g themselves to permanent reduction in social security benefits however viewing these same offset rules from the vantage point of an early retiree these offsets also erode the incentives for those early retirees to reengage themselves in the labor market
