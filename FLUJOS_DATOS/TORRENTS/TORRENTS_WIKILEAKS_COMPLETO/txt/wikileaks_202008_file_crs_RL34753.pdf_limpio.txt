and suspension of government contractors an overview of the law including recently enacted and proposed amendments summary the amount spent on government contr acts coupled with widely reported contractor misconduct has generated congressional in terest in debarment and suspension debarment or suspension of c ontractors is one means agencies use to ensure that they deal only with contractor s who are responsible in fulfilling their legal and contractual obligations debarment removes contractors eligibility for government contracts for fixed period of time while suspension temporarily debars contractor for the duration of an ag ency investigation or litigation like government procurement w generally the law of suspension and debarment has multiple sources and contractors can curren tly be debarred or spended either under statutory provisions or under the fe deral acquisition regulation far some statutes require or allow agency officials to exclude contractors that have engaged in conduct prohibited under the stat ute such statutory debarments and suspensions are also known as inducement debarments and suspensions because they further induce contractor compliance with statutes statutory debarments and suspensions are federalgovernmentwide they are often mandatory or at least beyond agency heads discretion and they are punishments statutes prescribe the debarments duration and agency heads gene rally cannot waive statutory debarments the far also authorizes debarment nd suspension of contractors such administrative debarments and suspensions are also known as procurement debarments and suspensions because they protect government interests in the procurement process admin istrative debarments can result when contractors are convicted of found civilly liable for or found by agency officials to have committed certain offenses or when other cau ses affect contr actor responsibility administrative suspensions can similarly result when contractors are suspected of or indicted for certain offe nses or when other causes ffect contractor responsibility debarred or suspended contractors are excluded from contracts with executive branch agencies administrative exclusions are discretionary and can be imposed only to protect government interests agencies can use administrative agreements instead of debarment and can continue current contracts of debarre d contractors the seriousness of debarment s cause determines its ngth which generally cannot exceed three years but agency heads can waive debarments for compelling reasons the 110th

statutory debarment and suspension some federal statutes include provisions specifying that contractors who engage in certain conduct prohibited under the statute shall or may be debarred or suspended from future contracts with the federal government4 because they are designed to provide additional inducement for contractors compliance with the statutes such statutory debarments and suspensions are also known as inducement debarments and suspensions the terms statutory debarment and statutory spension are also used in reference to exclusions that result under executive orders5 even though executive orders are not statutes as way of grouping exclusions that result from executive orders with other inducementbased exclusions and contrasting them with administrative or procurement exclusions statutes providing for debarment and spension often require that the excluded party be convicted of wrongdoing under the statute but at other times findings of wrongdoing by agency heads suffice for exclusion6 sometimes the exclusion applies only to certain types of contractors or dealings with specified agencies eg institutions of higher education who contract with the government contracts with the department of defense7 most of the time however the exclusion applies more broadly to all types of contractors dealing with all federal agencies8 persons identified by statute often

activities by dealing only with re sponsible contractors13 debarment and suspension promote this policy by precludi ng agencies from entering into new contractual dealings with c ontractors whose prior violati ons of federal or state law or failure to perform under contr act suggest they are nonresponsible14 because exclusions under the far are designed to protect the governments interests they may not be imposed solely to punish prior contractor misconduct15 federal courts will overrule challenged agency decisions to debar contractors when agency officials seek to punish the contractor rather than protect the government in making their exclusion determinations16 debarment the far allows agency officials to debar contractors from future executive branch contracts under thr ee

governments interests 48 cfr 94071a this is broadly similar but not identical to the public interest which is why the focus of this paragraph is limited to debarments 37 see eg commercial drapery contractors inc v united states 133 f3d 1 1415 dc cir 1998 suspending contractor is seri ous matter disqualification from contracting directs the power and prestige of government at single entity and may cause economic injury 38 48 cfr 94061a see eg roemer v hoffman 419 f pp 1 30 132 ddc 1976 stating that the proper focus in barment determinations is upon whether the contractor is presently responsible notwithstanding the past misconduct exceed 18 months unless legal proceedings have been initiated within that period30 suspensionworthy conduct can be impute d just like debarmentworthy conduct31 and similar dueprocess protections apply32 agency discretion administrative agreements continuation of current contracts and waivers not all contractors who engage in conduct that could lead to debarment or susp ension under the far are actually excluded permanently or temporarily from contractin g with executive branch agencies nor does the debarment or suspension of contractor guarantee that executive branch agencies do not presently have contracts w ith that contractor or will not contract with that contractor before the exclus ion period ends several aspects of the exclusion process under the far explain why this is so first under the far debarment or susp ension of contractors is discretionary33 the far says that agencies may debar or may suspend contractor when grounds for exclusion exist34 but it does not require them to do so35 rather the far advises contracting officers to focus upon the public interest in making debarment determinations36 the public interest enco mpasses both 1 safeguarding public funds by excluding contractors w ho may be nonresponsible from contracting with the government and 2 avoiding economic injury to contractors who might technically be excludable but are fundame ntally responsible and safe for the government to contract with37 because of this focus on the public interest agency officials can find that cont ractors who engaged in exclusionworthy conduct should not be excluded because they appear unlik ely to engage in similar conduct in the future38 any circumstance suggesting that contractor is unlikely to repeat past misconduct such as changes in personnel or procedures restitution or cooperation in government investigation can potentially incline an agencys decision againsthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34753crs9

bills that would have strengthened the existing barment and suspension regime some of these bills have been enacted including the sudan accountab ility and divestment act pl 110174 supplemental ppropriations act pl 110252 6101 0366 and the duncan hunter national fense authorization act pl 110417 8717367 many other bills were not enacted but sought to make debarment and suspension more effective means of excl uding nonresponsible contractors by 1 creating new statutory debarments 2 supplementing the far provisions on contractor responsibility debarment nd suspension and 3 increasing the information about contractors responsib ility available to contracting officers similar legislation may be put forward in the 111th congress amendments enacted in the 110th congress the 110th congress enacted several amendments to the preexisting debarment and suspension laws these amendments are briefly summarized below with analysis of the approach to strengthening debarment and suspension represented by each enacted amendment saved for the following section first the sudan accountability and dive stment act created new statutory debarment it required the heads of executive agencies to ensure that all agency contracts for the procurement of goods and services include clause requiring the contractor to certify that it does not conduct business opera tions as defined under the act in sudan68 agency heads may debar or suspe nd for up to three years contractors who are found to have falsel certified that they do not conduct business in

76 id 77 id at 872f 78 id at 872e1 second the supplemental appropriati ons act of 2008 augmented the far provisions on contractor responsibility deba rment and suspension it amended the far to require that contractors provide timely notification of violations of federal criminal law or overpayments in connecti on with the award or performance of covered contract or subcontract70 covered contracts or subcontracts are those that are greater than 5 million in amount and mo re than 120 days in duration regardless of whether they are performed outside the united states or include commercial items71 the act did not specify whom cont ractors are to notify but regulations implementing the act require notification of both the contracting agencys inspector general and the contracting officer72 third the duncan hunter national defe nse authorization act for fiscal year 2009 increased the information about c ontractors responsibility available to contracting officers it required the crea tion of database w ith information beyond that in the epls for use by agency officials73 the database cove rs all contractors that have at least one governme nt contract worth 500000 or more74 for these contractors the database includes brief description of all civil criminal or administrative proceedings i nvolving contracts with the federal government that resulted in conviction or finding of fault within the past five years75 it also includes all terminations for default administrative agreements and nonresponsibility determinations relating to federal contr acts within the past five years76 entities with contracts worth more than 10 million in total are required to submit this information as part of the award process and update the information semiannually77 access to the database is limited to acquisition officials of federal agencies other government officials as appropriate and the chairman and ranking member of the congressional committees with jurisdiction78 the act also called for the interagency committee on debarment and suspension to resolve which of multiple agencies wishing to exclude c ontractor should be the lead agency in bringing exclusion proceedings and to coordinate exclusion actions amonghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34753crs15 79 id at 873a12 80 48 cfr 9402c when more than one agency has an interest in the debarment or suspension of contractor cons

bill enacted as pl 11028 86 see eg s 680 as introduced 128 allowing the head of an executive agency to debar contractor after finding the contractor to be serious threat to national security 87 see eg hr 4881 3 debarment of ctors with delinquent tax debt agencies79 the involvement of the interage ncy committee is potentially significant because although the far previously enc ouraged agencies to coordinate their exclusion efforts it provided requireme nt or mechanism for them to do so80 amendments proposed in the 110th congress in addition to these enacted amendments to the preexisting debarment and suspension laws the 110th congress considered numerous other bills addressing c ontractor exclusion the proposals in these bills can be broadly categ orized as involving one or more of the following three approaches to making debarment and suspension more effective means of excluding nonresponsible contractor s these approaches are 1 creating new statutory debarments covering dditional misconduct 2 supplementing the far provisions on contractor responsibility debarment and suspension and 3 increasing the information about contractor s responsibility availa ble to contracting officers in their decision making becau similar proposals are likely in the 111th congress the approaches which these pr oposals exemplified are analyzed in the following paragraphs new statutory debarments members of the 110th congress introduced several bills that would have created new statutory debarments for various types of perceived misconduct by contractors some proposed debarments would have addressed typical procurement concerns such as those for contr actors who violate the foreign corrupt practices act or similar applicable laws in foreign countries81 misrepresent themselves as qualifying small businesses under the small business act82 procure sweatshop goods for the government83 or knowingly fail to report violations of federal criminal law or receipt of significant overpayments in connection with government contract to the inspector general of the contracting agency84 other proposed statutory debarments would have promot ed broader policy goals such as compliance with immigration law85 protection of national security86 and payment of income taxes87 some of the proposed statutory debarments would also have added to or changed the execu tive branch personnel involved in exclusionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34753crs16 88 see eg hr 1684 301 89 see eg hr 1591 as engrossed by the senate 569 waiver possible only when the administrator of gsa the secretary of home land security and the attorney general agree that it is necessary to national defense or in the interest of national security hr 6782 7 waiver in cases involving convictions fo r violation of immigra tion laws only possible with the consent of the administrator of gsa secretary of homeland security and attorney general 90 compare hr 1591 as engrossed by the senate 569 requiring debarment of contractors who hire illegal aliens with s 680 as introduced 128 granting agency heads discretion to debar on the basis of national security and hr 1585 804 stating that the secretary of defense shall consider debarring or suspending contractors who engage in certain conduct 91 see eg hr 1591 as engrossed by the senate 569 an employer who holds federal contract grant or cooperative agreement and is determined to have violated this section shall be debarred from the receipt of new federal contracts for 10 years 92 congress could theoretically legislate chan ges to the far to allow punitive debarments or suspensions under the far 93 48 cfr 94061a 94 see eg kenneth p doyle excia official foggo pleads guilty to one count of honestservices fraud 90 fed cont rep 271 oct 7 2008 describing how contracting continuedor waiver determinations requiring an agencys inspector general to review all contracts worth more than specified amount and report any improper conduct or wrongdoing to the agency head for possi ble exclusion was one approach proposed in the 110th congress88 another approach proposed in the 110th congress required the agreement of multiple executive branch agency heads to waive an exclusion89 such statutory debarments have some advantages as strategy for checking contractor misconduct their use could llow congress to remove agency discretion in excluding contractors by substituting mandatory debarments under statute for discretionary ones under the far however to be sure that exclusion necessarily follows specified conduct statutes would proba bly need to state th at agency officials shall debar contractors for engaging in that c onduct rather than th at agency officials may debar contractors or shall consider debarring contractors for engaging in that conduct90 statutory debarments can also be punishments for past misconduct unlike administrative debarments statutory debarment can explicitly link contractors prior actions eg hiring illegal immigrants to its future ability to contract with the federal government91 administrative debarments in contrast are currently not for purposes of punishment92 and must be based on the pub lic interest in protecting public funds from nonresponsible contractors93 further statutes mandating or allowing debarment can require the invol vement of agency personnel who are not involved in exclusion decisi ons under the far or impose more stringent conditions on waivers than the far imposes agency inspectors general for example are not routinely involved in agency contracting ac tivities under the far they are thus less prone than agency contracting officials who deal with contractors on regular basis to become too close to specific contractors to make effective exclusion determinations about them94 and their involvement in agency exclusion processeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34753crs17 94 continued official at the central intelligence agency stee red agency contracts to

made by the agency head or his or her designee see 48 cfr 9403 however these determinations are based upon the recommendations of contracting officers w ho work closely with the contractors see grayson supra note 45 at 23 95 see eg hr 1684 301 96 see eg id hr 6782 7 97 see eg hr 1581 301 allowing the president to waive debarment upon determination that the waiver is in the nati onal security interest of the united states 98 48 cfr 9405a allowing waivers when agency heads find compelling reasons 99 see eg s 3182 507 debarment from funds appropriated to the departments of commerce and justice and related agencies see also hr 2638 8038 hr 3867 206 and hr 6426 11 for other agencyspecific debarments 100 compare 33 usc 1368 waiver by the president with 48 cfr 9405a waiver by agency heads could provide check on agency decision making95 allowing waivers only when two executive branch agency heads agree96 or with the presidents consent97 likewise imposes more stringent conditions on waiv ers than does the far the far allows the head of each federal agency to make an independent waiver determination for his or her agency98 the proliferation of statutory debarmen ts could pose other problems however drafters of statutes requiring or allowing debarment woul d have to ensure that the legislative vehicles used to introduced statutory debarments do not inadvertently limit the debarments scope debarments introduced in appropriations bills for example could be limited to contractors dealing with particular agencies if the bill specified that the debarment was from funds appropriated under the legislation99 in this example similar provisions would need to be introduced into the appropriations for all agencies to ensure that the statutory debarment has governmentwide effect statutory debarments when mandatory could also limit agency flexibility in dealing with contractors and meeting agency needs statute specifying that contractors shall be debarred would not allow agency officials the discretion not to debar contractor that made changes in its personne l or policies or the flexibility to enter an administrative agreement in lieu of debarment further such statute would probably substitute waivers only by the president or the head of the agency administering the statute for waivers by individual agency heads100 changes to the far in addition to proposals creating further statutory exclusions the 110th congress considered several proposals to supplement the far provisions on contractor res ponsibility debarment and suspension proposed changes to the far included the following httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34753crs18 101 see eg hr 3383 2 not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this act the secretary of defense shall prescribe in regulations requirement that contracting officer of the department of defense may not determine contractor to be responsible for purposes of the award of covered contract unless the entity to be awarded the contract has in place an internal ethics compliance program see also s 606 102 precluding contractor from being found responsible if it has exhibited pattern of overcharging the government or failing to comply with the law s 2394 3 establishing that contractor that has tax debt cannot be responsible hr 4779 2105 stating the certain misconduct effects present responsibility 102 see eg hr 3854 4 the imposition of li quidated damages on contractor or subcontractor for failure to comply with the procedures for the substitution of subcontractors on 2 contracts within 3year period shall be deemed to be adequate evidence of the commission of an offense indicating lack of business integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the present re sponsibility of government contractor within the meaning of part 94 of the far 103 see eg s 2394 8 adding 1 knowingly making false statements regarding federal tax information and 2 convictions or civil j udgments of liability for tax evasion or other tax offenses to the list of causes of debarment and suspension in the far 104 see eg hr 4881 3 addressing knowingly making false statements regarding federal tax information 105 see eg id covering tax debt 106 see eg s 2394 8 knowingly making false statements regarding federal tax information such proposed requirements differ from the preexisting requirement that agencies document their decisions not to bar whenever notice of proposed debarment has been issued 48 cfr 9404 under th proposed requirements agencies would have to justify the nonexclusion of all contractors w ho engage in certain conduct not just those contractors whom agency officials determ ine should be considered for exclusionspecifying that contractor cannot be found responsible unless it engages in certain desirable conduct or if it engages in certain undesirable conduct101 specifying that certain conduct indi cates lack of business integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the present responsibility of gove rnment contractor102 adding conduct to the grounds upon wh ich an excluding official may propose contractor for debarmen t or may suspend contractor103 requiring that agency officials propose contractors who engage in certain conduct for debarment104 requiring contractors to supply dditional information to the agency in its bid or offer for use in agency decision making105 and requiring excluding officials to justify in writing their decision not to debar or suspend contractor who engaged in certain conduct106 such amendments to the far could in crease the likelihood of governmentwide administrative debarment nd nonaward of contracts to nonresponsible contractors without creating numerous statutory debarm ent provisions scattered throughout the united states code for example langua ge specifying that contractors cannot behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34753crs19 107 see eg s 2394 3 108 48 cfr 9103b purchase or award shall be made unless the contracting officials make an affirmative determination of responsibility 109 see eg hr 4881 3 110 see eg s 2394 3 contractors with delinquent tax debt cannot be found responsible hr 3383 2 contractors without ethics compliance programs cannot be found responsible 111 48 cfr 94062a 94071a 112 see eg hr 3854 4 113 see eg s 2394 8 114 see eg s 2904 8 found responsible if they have engaged in certain conduct107 would ensure that contracts are awarded to these contract ors because contractor must be found responsible to be awarded contract108 similarly language specifying that contractors who engage in certain c onduct must be proposed for debarment109 would ensure that agencies at least consider debarring these contractors even if they ultimately decide against debarment however statutes that stop short of requiring findings of nonresponsibility or exclusion in certain situations110 would continue agency officials existing di scretion to find contractors responsible for awards and make exclusion determinations111 thus changing the far to specify only that certain conduct indicates lack of bus iness integrity or business honesty112 or to create additional grounds for debarment or suspension113 might only minimally increase the likelihood of exclusion or non award under the far similarly requiring agency officials to justify nonexclusi on or award determin ations in writing114 might not decrease the frequency of nonexclusion or nonaward determinations even though written justifications c ould be subjected to increased public scrutiny increasing information available about contractors responsibility third approach found in legislative proposals in the 110th congress to better ensure that the government does not contract with nonresponsible contractors involved increasing the information about contract ors responsibility available to agency officials in the hopes that nonresponsible cont ractors can be more easily detected and avoided the duncan hunter national fense authorization act for fiscal year 2009 implemented some of these proposed changes but the full range of proposed changes was broader than the provisions enacted in the duncan hunter act creation of centralized database with information beyond that currently available in the epls was one comm only proposed method of increasing the information available about contractors responsibility proposed legislation called for this expanded database to include some or all of th following information about contractors state or federal civil criminal or administrative proceedings federal contracts terminated for default administrative agreements between the contractor and federal or state governments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34753crs20 115 see eg hr 5658 4502 calling for information on civil criminal or administrative proceedings terminations for default administrative agreements and findings of nonresponsibility hr 3033 2 same s 3139 201 same hr 6411 7 adding assessments of the quality of work on federal contracts audit disputes and showcause orders to the elements of hr 5658 and requiri ng inclusion of government reports s 3139 201 requiring inclusion of evid ence of violations of law 116 see eg hr 3033 5 requiring contractors to disclose information about criminal civil and administrative proceedings etc in writing when bidding hr 4881 3 requiring contractors to submit form certifyi ng that they do not have seriously delinquent tax debt and authorizing the secretary of the tr easury to disclose information describing any seriously delinquent tax debts to the agency head 117 see eg s 2394 8 118 see eg s 3139 201 119 see eg hr 2033 5 120 see eg hr 3383 3 121 48 cfr 9404c6final findings of nonresponsibility by federal or state procurement officials assessments of the quality of work on federal or state awards findings of federal or state audit disputes orders from federal or state agencies asking the contractor to showcause why it should not be excluded publicly available government re ports such as those from the gao congressional budget office and agency inspectors general concerning contractor performance or specific instances of waste fraud and abuse and evidence of repeated pervasive or significant violations of law by contractors115 requiring contractors to supply this informa tion or other information as part of the contract award process was another proposed method for increasing the information available about contr actors responsibility116 related strategy sought to increase the information available to congress and the public about agencies contracting activ ities so that problematic agency actions could be detected more readily such proposals often required agency officials to justify in writing their decisions not to exclude contractors who engaged in specified conduct117 or to find contractor who had engaged in specified conduct responsible118 reporting to congress on the num ber of annual exclusions imposed by agencies119 or the number of waivers granted for compelling reasons120 were other proposals because the epls currently lists only those contractors who are presently excluded have previously been excluded or have been proposed for debarment121 an expanded database with in formation about civil cr iminal or administrative proceedings involving contractors assessmen ts of the quality of contractors work onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34753crs21 122 see eg hr 3033 2 hr 5658 4502 hr 6411 7 s 3139 201 123 48 cfr 9402b the serious nature of debarment and suspension requires that these sanctions be imposed only in the public interest for the governments protection and not for purposes of punishment 124 see eg hr 6411 7 requiring information on all proceedings involving contractors s 3139 201 requiring all complaints indictments and legal actions regardless of their outcome 125 see eg hr 3033 2 calling for the database of contractor information to be available to the public on the web 126 see eg stan soloway fine line be tween transparency and chaos washington tech july 14 2008 available at httpwwwwashingtontechnologycomprint23_12 331171htmlfederal or state contracts and similar information122 would significantly increase the information available to agency officials in their decision making in principle more extensive information should lead to better decision making by gi ving agency officials more thorough picture of contractors responsibility in practice however more extensive information about past conduct might not n ecessitate different contracting decisions given the far s current focus upon present and future responsibility rather than past misconduct per 123 moreover increased quantities of information to be scrutinized by agency officials carry their own costs especially when some of the information could concer n situations in which the contractor was ultimately found not to be at fault124 agency employees could have to spend additional time in reviewing the broader range of information in any expanded database and they would not be able to rely on mere listings of civil criminal or administrative proceedings to make decisions if all proceedings and not just those that ended with findings of contractor fa ult were listed re quiring contractors to supply information as part of the award pro cess would ensure that agency officials do not have to spend time gathering this in formation alt hough they still might have to verify the information and enter it into the database reports to congress on agency exclusi ons are not currently required under the far or under most statutes prescribing barments so this change could potentially increase the quality of agency decision making by subjecting it to increased scrutiny the epls is curren tly accessible to the public at httpswwweplsgov thus any gains in the quality of decision making to result from public access to information about contractors would proba bly require information beyond that already in the epls contractors are however likel to resist widespread publication125 of much of this information on privacy grounds126 conclusion debarments and suspensions of contr actors whether under statutory provisions or under the far ensure that contractors w ho have failed to fulfill legal or contractual obligations have limited opportunities for fu ture contractual dealings with the government statutory debarments are often mandatory leaving discretion to contracting officers are punish ments and last for period prescribed by statute with limited opportunities for agencies to waive th em statutory suspensions otherwisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34753crs22 resemble statutory debarments but last only until designated agency official finds that the contractor has ceased the conduct violating the statute administrative debarments by contrast are within the di scretion of agency contracting officials cannot be punitive may generally last longer than three years and can be waived by agency heads administrative suspensions are temporary administrative debarments lasting only as long as any ag ency investigation of contractor misconduct or ensuing legal proceedings congress has recently explored several approaches to making debarment and suspension more effective means of ensuring that federal contracts are not repeatedly awarded to contractors that are publicly know n for not paying taxes bribing foreign officials falsifying records or similar misconduct the 110th congress enacted legislation 1 creating an additional statut ory debarment encouraging divestment from sudan 2 amending the far to require that contractors report vi olations of federal criminal law or receipt of overpayments during the award or performance of certain contracts 3 creating an expanded data base of informati on about contractors responsibility for use by agency official s and 4 involving the interagency committee on debarment and suspension more integrally in coordinating agency exclusion actions congress so considered several other bills that would have 1 created new statutory deba rments covering additiona l misconduct 2 supplemented the far provisions on contractor responsib ility debarment and suspension and 3 increased the information about contractors responsibility available to contracting officers in their decision making simila r proposals may be put forward in the 111th congress
