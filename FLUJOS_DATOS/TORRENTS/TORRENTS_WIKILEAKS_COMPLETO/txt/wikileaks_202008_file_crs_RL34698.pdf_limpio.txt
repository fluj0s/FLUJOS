roles of the three federal agencies with responsibility over the selection licensing and health and safety of the first us high level radioactive waste disposal site the environmental protection agencys epas role is to establish the public health and safety standards for highlevel waste disposal the nuclear regulatory commission nrc licenses and regulates the repository using epas standards as the compliance measure the department of ergy doe construc ts and operates the repository the energy policy act epact of 1992 pl 102486 maintained these roles but established new requirements specific to the yucca mountain nevada site epa was directed to issue new environmental standards specifically for the yucca mountain repository site gene ral epa repository standards previously issued and subsequently revised l onger could be applied to yucca mountain doe and nrc had raised concerns that some of ep as general standard s might have been impossible or impractical to meet at yucca mountain1 epact also required epa to contract with the national academy of sciences nas for technical study of reasonable standards that might apply to the yucca mountain site and required that any st andard set by epa be based upon and consistent with the national academy s findings and recommendations the resulting study was issued august 1 19952 the nas study recommended that the yucca mountain environmental standards blish limit on risk to individuals near the repository rather than setting specific limits for the releases of radioactive material or on radioactive doses as unde r previous epa sta ndards the nas study also examined the potential for human intrusion into the repository and found scientific basis for predicting human behavior thousa nds of years into the future on june 13

would peak after bout 400000 years despite does opposition to the epa standards the departments site suitability evaluation determined that the yucca mountain site would be able to meet them nrc revised its repository regulations on september 7 2001 to conform to the epa standards the court ruling various aspects of the 2001 regulation were challenged in lawsuits filed with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia in july 2001 the state of nevada the natural resour ces defense council nrdc and the nuclear energy institute nei each challenged different as pects of the rule nevada and the nrdc challenged the rule on the grounds that it was not sufficiently protective and had not been adequately justified focusing on the 10000year time period nei challenged the groundwater protections as unnecessary contrary to recommendations of the nas and outside the agencys authority under the epact on july 9 2004 the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia dismissed the nei groundwater challenge and all but one of the challenges by nevada and nrdc on the issue of th 10000year compliance standard the court upheld the challenge and v acated the 2001 standard ruling that the 10000year compliance time frame was not based upon and consistent with the nas finding that there is scientific basis fo r limiting the time period to 10000 years or any other value and their recommendation that compliance asse ssment be conducted for the time when the greatest risk occurs within the limits imposed by longterm stability of the geologic

decision ep proposed new version of the yucca mountain standard on august 22 2005 the pr oposal retained the dose limits of the 2001 standard for the first 10000 years but proposed higher annual dose of 350 mremyr for the period of 10000 years th rough 1 million years epa based the standard on variations in natural b ackground radiation between colorado and amargosa valley nevada arguing that it was reasonable to use natural background as benchmark for exposure when the compliance point was up to 1 million years in the future the agency also argued that it was reasonable to consider protective exposures greater than residents of colorado experience today from natural background radiation alone6 epa also proposed basing the post10000year standard on the median dose rather than the mean an approach that some argued would make it easier for doe to meet the standard nevada state officials called epas proposed standard far too lenient and charged that it was unlawful and arbitrary7 comments submitted to the public docket both praised and attacked epas proposal those in favor of th proposal focused on the unprecedented time frames and the reasonableness of drawing comparisons with natural levels of radioactivity opponents claimed that the pr oposal violated epa s basic principles of public health protection and was designed specifically to allow the facility to be built 2008 final rule what standard has epa chosen in its final standard8 epa has established dual compliance standard 15 mremyr with separate groundwater protection standard for the first 10000 year s and 100 mremyr for the period from 10000 up to 1 million years the concept of dual standard was introduced in epas august 2005 proposal and has remained controversial epa maintains that the dual approach provides reasonabl measure of the disposal systems performance that appropriately combines protectiveness with recognition of the limitations of modeling in pr edicting the evolution of the system over hundreds of thousands of years critics argue that th dual standard exp licitly condones lesser level of protection for future generations and is designed to make it easier for the department of energy to ultimately meet the standard epa also specified that the mean of the distribution of results should be used to demonstrate compliance with the standard at all times this is departure from the proposal in which epa specified th mean during the pre10000year period but chose the median for the post10000year pe riod at the time epa stated its belief that the median better represented the

citing public comments that pointed to recommendation in the nas report that the mean be used as the basis for any standard9 what is the basis for epas 2008 standard in choosing 100 mremyr as the final standard for the 10000 to 1 millionyear time period epa abandoned the controversial variations in natural background approach it proposed in 2005 that approach would have set the standard based on comp arisons of background levels between amargosa valley the closest popul ated area to the proposed facility and another geographical location in the ited states for the proposal epa chose colorado their concept was that so long as the hypothetical future residents of amargosa valley did not receive more radiation exposure in the far future than residents of colorado receive from natura l background radiation today the exposure could be considered protective epa cited the unprecedented time period as one justification for its approach and referen ced international precedent for using natural background levels as reasonabl and logical reference point10 in the final standard epa changed its approach epa states that it was not possible to reliably estimate levels of background exposure in way that was relevant to making the kinds of comparisons betw een locations it envisioned in the proposal epa concluded that comparing back ground radiation estimates from specific locations does not provide clear or fficient basis for regulatory standard applicable to the yucca m ountain disposal system11 the agency did not abandon comparisons to background completely the final rule notes that the 100 mremyr level reasonably comports with back ground estimates in amargosa valley but relies more heavily on arguments that 100 mremyr is directly protective of public health epa cites both nationa l and international standards in support of its decision and points to existing domestic regulations12 which each use 100 mremyr as well as the national council on radiological protection ncrp endor sement of the 100 mremyr level incorporated in the international system of radiation protection13 epa went on to state that it acknowledges and concurs with the broa d consensus in the protectiveness of the 100 mr emyr level and furthermor considers it especially suitable for application to the extreme far future when planning for and protecting public exposures is much less

stringent allowing continuedand the reasonableness of drawing comparis ons with natural levels of radioactivity at such long time frames supporters of the repository see epas regulation as the last tool nrc needs to complete its tec hnical review opponents raised issues with the 2005 proposal in three key areas 1 they claimed that the proposal was not protective of public health 2 that it was legally indefensible and 3 it was designed specifically to allow the facility to be built nevada state officials called epas proposed standard far too lenient and char ged that it was unlawful and arbitrary14 in the final regulation epa argues that it has addressed thes issues it lowered the numerical standard significantly fro m the 350 mremyr in the proposal to 100 mremyr explaining that the original assumptions it used to justify comparing background levels in geographically similar areas were called into question by new data submitted during the pub lic comment period acknowle dging that it was unable to arrive at defensible estimates of natural background15 epa opted to use different approach for the final standard some ma argue that even adopting the 100 mremyr level as epa did in the final standard is not protective of public health and that the final standard is further flawed by prom ulgating dual standard that adopts lesser level of protection for futu re generations than applies for the first 10000 years protecting public health there has been much debate over the years about what is protective of public health when it comes to radiation epa has repeatedly held that an increased risk over lif etime of 1 in 10000 to 1 in 1 million excess cancer deaths is protective the or iginal 2001 yucca mountain regulation adopted 15 mremyr standard for 10000 years whic h at the time the agency calculated was equivalent to 7 to 85 in 1 million annual cancer risk16 the final 2008 regulation maintains this level for the firs t 10000 years in c onsidering the unpr ecedented challenge of carrying the compliance st andard beyond 10000 years out to 1 million years epa argues that different framework should pply epa estimates that the nominal annual risk associated with 100 mremyr is 575 x 105 or 575 in 100000 which the it describes as fully consistent with the nas report epa considers the standard both protective given the ex tremely long time frames involved and reasonable because it effectively addresses the uncertainty in projecting doses for up to million years the agency also emphasizes what it considers broad consensus regarding 100 mremyr as protective public dose limit some disagree with this assessment arguing that 100 mremyr exposure results in 4 x 103 or 4 in 1000 risk over 70year lifetime17 level of risk that would be unacceptable in regulation today18 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34698crs6 18 continued individual exposure of up to 5 rems 5000 millir ems per year whereas the most stringent standard is epas drinking water standard of 4 millirems per year the substantially greater stringency of the drinking water standard is attributed to the potential for internal human exposure through consumption 19 httpreidsenategovnewsroom 20 httpwwwocrwmdoegovym_re positoryseisdocs002_summarypdf 21 allen bensen doe spokesperson quoted in the vegas review journal october 1 2008 http wwwlvrjc omnews29991329htmlin the 2008 regulation epa argues that the increasing uncertainty in dose projections over very long time periods reduces the ability of performance assessment modeling to meaningfully distinguish among alternative and equally likely futures represented by individual model simula tions epa also explained that it was attempting to balance the principles of in tergenerational equity with the need to create compliance standard that did not demand more than can be provided by scientific analysis epa argues that the dual nature of the regulation acheives this balance legal uncertainty critics believe epas standard will be legally vulnerable because they maintain that it does not fully address the district courts direction to be based upon and consis tent with the nas report they have also argued that any standard that accepts greater individual risk in the far future than what we would consent to today is both not protec tive and not consistent with the nas recommendation there are many opinions on which parts of the standard may be vulnerable to legal challeng and many more opinions about whether the regulation would survive challenge some senate leaders have predicted further litigation arguing that the standard is weak and puts people unnecessarily at risk19 meeting the standard there are several aspects to consider related to the potential for any facility to establish compliance with regulatory standard when likely exposures occur so far in the future first can doe adequately demonstrate using probabalistic models that the design of the facility is sufficient to meet epas and nrcs regulatory standards modeling the performance of an engineering design is not unusual what makes the yucca mountain repository or any other deep geologic repository unusual is the time span over which the model must be extended many assumptions must be built into the model to account for both natural and man made variables all of which carry their own uncertainties these uncertainties are magnified when the projection is extended over tens of thousands or in this case over 1 million years in its revised fina l supplementary environmental impact statement for the yucca m ountain repository doe estimates the maximum mean annual individual dose at 2 mremyr20 level that appears to meet epas 100 mremyr standard doe however has cauti oned that should the assumptions it used to develop the probabilistic model be successfully challenged during nrcs licensing process their estimates of maximum nnual individual dose could change doe spokesperson has stated that doe be lieves it can meet epas standard21 but many critics including the state of nevada are skeptical that any facility will be able tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34698crs7 demonstrate through engineering design and probabilistic modeling that it can protect the public from exposure for 1 million years conclusion now that epa has issued the final health and safety standard attention will shift to the licensing process and the many tec hnical and policy issues to be addressed in that context nrcs technical review and licensing process will take several years and may proceed regardless of additional legal challenges to epas standard as congress continues to oversee the yucca m ountain repository program it will face issues related to whether does technical work is sufficient to demonstrate compliance with epas standard and othe r safety issues surrounding storage and transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste to the facility should it be licensed annual appropriations will be key venue in this debate some have argued that it would be better public policy choice to continue to store nuclear waste onsite at the power plants where it is produced while continuing to search for as safer more costeffective solution to permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and highlevel nuclear waste larger issue is how will the continuing controversy over the yucca mountain project affect the us nuclear power industry and its role in broader national energy policy
