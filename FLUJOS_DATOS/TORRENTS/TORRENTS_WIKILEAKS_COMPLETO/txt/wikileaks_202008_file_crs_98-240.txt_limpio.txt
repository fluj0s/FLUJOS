katzman analyst in middle eastern affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary process to compensate the victims of iraqs invasion and occupation of kuwait is proceeding aided by revenues generated by the oilforfood program in iraq however the amount of money available relative to outstanding claims suggests that the compensation process will not be completed in the foreseeable future on related issue progress to decide the disposition of frozen iraq assets held by us banks has been hampered by differences over which claimants should have priority1 bill that gives priority to members or veterans of the us armed forces was incorporated into the house version of the fy2000 state department authorization bill hr 2415 passed by the house july 21 1999 this report will be updated to reflect legislative developments on this issue for further information on iraq see crs issue brief 92117 iraq compliance with ceasefire agreements the compensation process security council resolution 674 october 29 1990 reminded iraq that under international law it is liable for any loss damage or injury arising in regard to kuwait and third states and their nationals and corporations as result of the invasion and illegal occupation of kuwait by iraq security council resolution 687 april 3 1991 reaffirmed iraqi liability for compensation to the victims of its invasion and authorized creation of unique mechanism to adjudicate and pay invasionrelated claims may 2 1991 report by the secretary general accepted by the security council in resolution 692 may 20 1991 established compensation fund in which monies for compensation would be deposited and held the plan also set up compensation commission uncc run by 15member governing council composed of the representatives of the current members of the security council at any given time security council resolution 705 august 15 1991 determined that the compensation effort would 1 this report mentions

invasion of kuwait iraq grudgingly accepted these conditions decisions of the unccs governing council are taken by majority vote of its members with veto permitted the council is assisted by an undetermined number of commissioners experts in finance law accounting insurance and environmental damage assessment and by secretariat to do administrative work these experts evaluate the claims submitted verify their validity and recommend final judgments the expenses of the uncc are paid out of the compensation fund claims processing and payment the secretary general and the uncc deemed it unworkable to process all claims individually governments file claims and distribute payments on their own behalf and on behalf of their nationals and corporations claims are categorized as those of individuals category abc and d claims corporations category and governments category f there is further specialization of individual claims fixed amounts for losses arising from departure from iraq or kuwait during august 2 1990 march 2 19912 category fixed amounts for losses resulting from personal injury or death of relative category b and damages of any type individual damage claims are separated into those up to and those exceeding 100000 category c and d respectively iraq is allowed to make legal and factual comments on uncc policy but it is not permitted to dispute individual claims restriction iraq has repeatedly protested the compensation process does not preclude parallel claims made through the domestic legal systems of member governments but claimants must inform the uncc of any amounts received and these amounts will be deducted from any awards members of the armed forces of countries that fought iraq in the gulf war may not file claims through the process unless they were taken prisoner and mistreated by iraq in addition the costs of allied military operations against iraq cannot be claimed under the compensation process claims filed and paid the deadlines for the filing of new claims have expired and the uncc has received about 26 million claims from all categories totaling about 230 billion kuwaiti claims constitute about 75 of the total the uncc has thus far issued 13 million awards worth about 10 billion giving priority in processing and payment to individual claims until december 1996 when iraq began exporting significant quantities of oil again under the oilforfood resolution 986 only 134 million had actually been paid to claimants about 4000 category b injury or death of relative claimants were paid up to that time funds for these payments were derived from frozen iraqi oil assets transferred to escrow account under resolution 778 october 1992 since the start of the oilforfood program 32 billion has been transferred to the uncc as of march 31 1999 of that amount 27 billion has gone to pay claims 125 million has covered uncc administrative expenses and the remainder is available for payment and expenses 2 many of the mostly south asian and arab expatriate workers forced to leave iraq and kuwait after the invasion and occupation would be covered under this category crs3 the uncc has acknowledged that the compensation process has been slow and might take many years to finally resolve uncc officials have set goal of processing all claims by 2003 in late 1996 corporate claimants about 82 billion in total claims began to receive awards in december 1996 kuwait petroleum corporation was awarded 610 million to settle 950 million claim for extinguishing 800 oil well fires set by retreating iraqi troops in 1991 in april 1999 israeli firms and individuals were awarded total of 31 million for damages caused by iraqi scudvariant missile attacks 39 fired on israel during the gulf war in june 1999 kpc received another 22 billion in awards and another stateowned kuwaiti oil company received an award of 115 million governmental claims constitute about 120 billion of the total claims filed and the uncc says it will soon begin awarding claims in this category us companies appear to have significant stake in the compensation process over 150 us firms have made claims through the uncc process with an asserted value of over 15 billion3 total us claims about 3200 in all categories have an asserted value of about 17 billion among us corporate claims the bechtel corp of san francisco has filed claim for losses incurred when the gulf crisis despoiled the bekhme dam project in northeastern iraq that it was managing in late june 1999 several us firms received awards including saudi arabian texaco 506 million and oilservice firm halliburton 18 million the us government seeks 88 million in compensation for the eight us departments that contributed scientific or technical help to the gulf environmental cleanup4 funding for compensation the large number of unresolved claims and the limited funds available for compensation have raised questions about the future of the uncc process as noted above compensation and the unccs operating budget are funded by iraqi oil revenues at current oil export capabilities of about 10 billion per year5 iraq can generate only about 3 billion annually for compensation even if only fraction of claims filed result in awards or if sanctions on iraq were completely lifted it might take several decades for iraq to generate sufficient revenues to pay the awards the compensation mathematics have led some observers to speculate that the uncc process will terminate short of completion if iraqs leadership changes before the compensation process is completed and at some point iraq rejoins the international community iraqs reintegration will almost certainly spur calls in the international community to terminate the process and ask claimants to abrogate their claims on the other hand some countries such as germany continued to make compensation payments even though they had rejoined the international community some observers believe the united states should offer an end to the reparations process as an incentive to iraqis who are willing to overthrow saddam husayn and comply with all applicable gulf war related resolutions opposition by some security council members to continued sanctions 3 much of the information in this paragraph is derived from king neil firms worldwide seek billions to cover their gulf war losses wall street journal august 18 1997 4 nebehay stephanie billions in environmental claims filed against iraq reuters february 4 1997 5 resolution 1153 february 20 1998 allows an increase in iraqi oil sales to 525 billion every six months and thus an increase in compensation funds generated crs4 on iraq apparently has led britain and the netherlands to include in their draft security council resolution now under discussion provision to temporarily suspend compensation deductions with the proceeds to go toward increased humanitarian relief iraq also has succeeded in persuading some international firms to drop claims before the uncc in exchange for contracts with iraq under the oilforfood program6 claims against iraqi frozen assets some us claims against iraq arose before the iraqi invasion of kuwait and are ineligible for consideration under the uncc process to try to resolve these claims the bush and clinton administrations have proposed plan to seize and distribute to us claimants the approximately 22 billion7 in iraqi assets blocked in us financial institutions and their foreign branches in cases such as this us claims usually are settled in the context of reconciliation with the country at issue bush and clinton administration officials have determined that in the case of iraq the prospects for reconciliation are so limited that the united states should resolve the claims disputes unilaterally the iraqi assets in question were blocked pursuant to president bushs executive orders 12722 and 12724 of august 2 and august 9 1990 respectively since the gulf war some licenses have been issued to use some of the frozen assets to pay us companies who exported goods to iraq prior to the iraqi invasion under confirmed letters of credit these funds were judged by the office of foreign assets control ofac department of treasury to be the property of the us exporter and not iraqi funds about 3 billion more remain frozen in foreign banks around the world and remain blocked by their host countries under resolution 661 august 6 1990 some governments including that of saudi arabia have released some frozen iraqi assets possibly in an effort to improve relations with iraq8 the us claims on blocked iraqi assets exceeds the amount of those assets the claims which include those from the us government corporations and individuals are estimated to total up to 5 billion major us government claims include about 2 billion from the commodity credit corporation and 50 million from the exportimport bank for defaulted iraqi loan guarantees mostly for the purchase of agricultural exports unsettled us claims from the may 17 1987 iraqi attack on the uss stark include 23 million in compensation to the 62 crewmen injured9 and about 120 million exact amount 6 nebehay stephanie kuwait accuses iraq of extortion at gulf war fund reuters june 22 1999 7 this figure includes about 211 million in frozen assets already transferred to escrow account under resolution 778 those monies are being refunded to us financial institutions from the proceeds of iraqi oil sales under the oilforfood program 8 saudi arabia frees 1 million of iraqs frozen assets reuters august 5 1999 9 the united states and iraq were close to settling this claim at the time of the iraqi invasion of kuwait the two sides had agreed to settle on an amount of 15 million but iraqs transfer of the monies was not completed when the invasion occurred the us government now stands by the original claim of 23 million on april 14 1989 iraq paid 2735 million in compensation to continued crs5 undetermined for damages to the ship itself us corporate claimants include those such as att citicorp eastman kodak exxon continental airlines and others that had contractual obligations iraq did not fulfill10 other us firms including tobacco companies and agricultural exporters want to recoup their losses from exports shipped to iraq under advised unsecured letters of credit that were not able to be paid before us iraq business transactions ended in addition 3300 us individuals have registered claims almost exclusively gulf war veterans with claims for gulf war syndrome health damage the us foreign claims settlement commission is maintaining registry of us claimants in anticipation that an iraq claims process will be enacted by congress congressional debate the limited assets available relative to total claims has created debate in congress over claimant priorities congress has thus far been unable to resolve that debate and bush and clinton administration claims proposals have not been enacted in october 1992 the bush administration submitted to congress draft bill entitled the iraq claims act of 1992 that would have seized iraqi assets and established claims adjudication process under the foreign claims settlement commission the draft bill suggested that priority be given to noncommercial claims from members of the armed forces including crewmen of the uss stark and other claims arising from iraqs invasion of kuwait the house and senate introduced versions hr 3221 s1401 of the iraq claims legislation in mid1993 despite substantial debate over which categories of claimants to assign priority to the house passed the legislation in much the same form as the administration draft bill on april 28 1994 however s1401 did not reach the senate floor because of opposition from some senators who wanted to give priority to corporate claimants exporting to iraq under advised letters of credit version of the legislation that gave priority to all categories of corporate claimants was contained in the conference report on the fy1996 foreign aid authorization bill hr 1561 that bill was vetoed because of other issues in the first session of the 105th congress iraq claims legislation was incorporated into the senate version of hr 1757 the foreign relations authorization act for fy199899 the provision drew opposition from veterans groups because it excluded gulf war veterans from the claimant pool on october 1 1997 the house passed motion to instruct its conferees on the bill to strike the senate provision because of that exclusion supporters of the provision maintained that gulf war veterans had other recourse such as veterans affairs programs to be treated for injuries related to the gulf war and that there is tradition of us servicemen and their families suing us adversary for war losses the legislation containing this provision was not enacted in the 106th congress rep lloyd doggett introduced hr 618 the gulf war veterans claims protection act of 1999 the bill which was incorporated into the house version of hr 2415 the fy2000 state department authorization bill gives priority to claims by members or veterans of the us armed forces hr 2415 was passed by the house on july 21 1999 similar provision is in the senate version of the bill 9 continued families of the 37 crewmen killed in the attack on the stark 10 price david whos at the head of the line investors business daily february 28 1997 crs6 other proposals the 1997 crisis over weapons inspections in iraq has generated new proposals for using iraqi assets frozen by us banks iraqi opponents of saddam husayn with support from some members of congress have proposed releasing the frozen assets for their use in renewed push to overthrow saddam husayn others suggest using the assets to provide additional humanitarian aid to the iraqi people as an additional means of addressing the suffering of the iraqi people if written into legislation these proposals are likely to draw opposition from us claimants on the assets for further information on iraq see crs issue brief 92117 iraqi compliance with ceasefire agreements updated regularly and crs report 98179f iraqs opposition movements for
