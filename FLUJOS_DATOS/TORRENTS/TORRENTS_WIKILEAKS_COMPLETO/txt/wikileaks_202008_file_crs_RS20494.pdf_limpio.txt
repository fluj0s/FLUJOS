congressreceived through the crs weborder code rs20494 updated february 8 2001 ecuador international narcotics control issues raphael f perl specialist in international affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary colombian drug traffickers and narcolinked insurgents have taken advantage of easy access to ecuadors border areas for number of years primarily for rest and recre ation and purchase of supplies concern has been voiced that us supported military operations against narcotraffickingguerilla groups in colombia could accelerate guerilla encroachment into ecuador increased presence of colombian drug traffickers and narcolinked insurgents could limit the effectiveness of us antidrug support to colombia and threaten the territorial integrity and stability of ecuador however another viewpoint gaining increasing acceptance is that the insurgents do not want to start new front of military activity in ecuador anytime soon in light of these developments and strong administration and congressional interest in broader andean oriented approach it is likely there will be 1 enhanced policy focus on ecuador in regional context 2 enhanced intelligence focus on narco traffickerinsurgent activity there and 3 ongoing review of us narcoticsrelated assistance for the quito government this report will be updated only if major important events warrant background strategically situated between the major drug producing nations of colombia and peru ecuador is increasingly becoming an important transhipment area for colombian cocaine and heroin fragile economy lack of strong government controls and lengthy maritime and land borders provide an attractive relatively open and unregulated envir onment for drug trafficking street crime corruption and growing presence of colombian narcolinked insurgents in the north in ecuadors northern border regions poverty and lack of government presence and services in the region make inhabitants there more willing to accept the income traffickers or insurgents may provide another factor impacting stability in ecuador is an ongoing national indian uprising which resulted in the government declaring state of emergency on february 2 2001 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20494crs2 1 note that in 1999 law enforcement officials on the galapagos who express strong concern over rising cocaine use on the islands reportedly seized 32 kilograms of cocaine hcl cocaine smuggling coupled with an escalating and highly lucrative trade in endangered species items such as shark fins and sea cucumbers if not curbed could undermine the islands delicate ecological balance given the importance the international environmental community attaches to the islands reports of use of the islands as drug transhipment area and of rising use and small scale cultivation of coca there could prompt further investigation and policy focus on november 12 1999 the united states concl uded 10year lease with the government of ecuador for narcotics monitoring forward operating location fol based in manta move likely to increase us presence and strategic interest in this economically fragile andean nation of special concern to the proenvironmental community are reports of the use of the galapagos islands an ecological preserve as drug transhipment area and of rising use and possible small scale cultivation of coca there drug trafficker activity the state departments fy2001 international narcotics congressional budget presentation estimates that narcotics kingpins appear to be trafficking approximately 30 to 50 metric tons of cocaine per year through ecuadors loosely monitored ports and road networks cocaine is smuggled from colombia on the pan american highway which bisects ecuador from north to south and then west to the major seaports of guayaquil esmeraldas and manta where it is comingled with commercial cargo and shipped to the united states often via mexico and to europe cocaine is also shipped by low profile fastmoving boats from colombian ports to the port of esmeraldas in northern ecuador law enforcement officials in the galapagos islands suggest that such go fast boats increasingly penetrate the territorial waters of the galapagos where mother ships lie in wait1 small quantities of heroin from colombia are also smuggled by couriers through ecuadors international airports of quito and guayaquil from ecuador precursor drug processing chemicals are smuggled north into colombia as are small arms dynamite medicine and other logis tical items for use by narcotraffickersinsurgen ts from peru cocaine base is smuggled overland through ecuador via the pan american highway to colombia for processing and eventual reshipment to ecuador for storage consolidation and transit to us and european markets drug cultivation ecuador is not major drug growing area although limited cultivation of coca occurs in the northeast near the putumayo river region along the border with colombia according to ecuadorian military sources the presence of colombi an guerrillas in the region however makes it difficult to verify the extent of such cultivation cultivation of marijuana in ecuador does not reach comme rcial levels and opium poppy cultivation is small scale in response to relatively recent phenomenon members of ecuadors environmental community and ecuadorian navy personnel based in the galapagos islandshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20494crs3 private ly express concern over reports of small scale coca cultivation on the island of santa cruz although such reports are unconfirmed to date drug processing according to the department of states fiscal year 2001 international narcotics budget congressional presentation document illicit drugs are increasingly processed in ecuador data is incomplete but dea and ecuadorian sources suspect that some cocaine hcl processing takes place in sucumbios province near the colombian border cocaine base laboratory was recently seized in northeastern ecuador supporting the theory that proximity of the area to colombian coca fields and to central smuggling route for precursor chemicals make the area attractive for cocaine processing laboratories colombian insurgent activity revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc guerrillas are increasingly present in ecuadors northeastern border region ecuadorian sources interviewed in december 1999 indicate regions exist near the putumayo river border where farc guerrillas demand payment for safe transit on september 11 1999 eleven foreign and one us oil worker were kidnaped reportedly by farc insurgents in northeastern ecuador later to be released as recently as february 6 2001 hostage situation was ongoing in the region with one us oil worker killed moreover many ecuadorians in this region reportedly have strong ethnic and family ties to colombia with estimates of those of colombian descent ranging from 40 to as high as 75 in this milieu sympathy with the farc is considered to be high from the farc perspective ecuadors new counterdrug alliance which allows us base on its territory could well change ecuadors perceived status from that of the neutral neighbor and laissez faire trading partner of major parties to the colombian civil war to that of menacing enemy two unresolved issues are 1 the degree to which the us presen ce at manta coupled with more aggressive us support for the colombian militarys counterdrug initiative may event ually lead to farc confrontation with ecuadorian military or civilian personnel or even us personnel or facilities and 2 the degree to which farc attacks against ecuadorian or us interests could erode existing levels of public support in ecuador for the presence of the us based facility in manta in fact some have questioned whether future developments in ecuador could become an achilles heel of hemispheric region support for the administrations colombia counterdrug initiative to assist in curbing what appears to be rising presence of farc narcoinsurgents in ecuadors northern border region ecuadorian officials have requested an additional 400 million in narcotics related military assistance over four years

border is accessible only by sea or river traffic counterdrug responsibility disproportionate to force size falls to the navy drug interdiction is also secondary responsibility of customs personnel these agencies rarely cooperate on drug issueseach accusing others of corruption and ineffectiveness according to one view levels of corruption are generally highest in the customs service and enp with the exception of the enps national drug unit which is considered to be untainted the navy is generally well respected outside rival governmental hierarchies critics of the army point out that military operations against narcotraffickersinsurgents near the northeast border region are regularly compromised by what appears to be advanced notic received by the traffickers aside from raising potential issues of corruption such pattern of events brings into question the willingness of army units to actually engage traffickersinsurgents both the army and the navy suffer from chronic shortages in fuel and ammunition communic ations and airground transportation equipment as well as reconnaissance aircraft and patrol craft for riverine operations and coastal interdiction are in short supply as well us counterdrug policy and programs in ecuador focus on seizing contraband drugs with cocaine hcl base and paste seizures down 67 in 2000 marijuana seizures up 503 and heroin seizures up 35 over 1999 levels some 40 of all drug seizures occurred at road checkpoints scarce resources reluctance to get embroiled in non narcotics related issues ie threats to ecuadorian national security or regional stability and lingering concern over us congressional reaction to legitimizing military organizations supportive of january 21 2000 coup events in ecuador are factors affecting

administrations reluctance to place greater emphasis on plan colombia regionally focused response2 drug traffickinginsurgent activity in colombia is often viewed by neighboring states as regional problem that can be easily transformed into threat to regional security comments to this effect stressing the gravity of the threat to neighboring nations and the need for regional security response were presented by former ecuadorian president jamil mahaud and peruvian president alberto fujimori during visit to the interamerican defense college in washington dc on february 3 and 5 1999 similar viewpoint was aired by mexican foreign minister jorge castaneda in meeting with us secretary of state colin powell january 31 2001 in washingtonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20494crs6 3 see crs report rl30541 colombia us assistance and current legislation 4 note that accurate timely and relevant intelligence is generally deemed essential to successful operations but in general nations spend far less on intelligence programs than operations for example ordinarily dods intelligence budget is less than 10 of its overall budgetthis perceived threat to regional stability goes beyond ecuador and peru analysts increasingly express concern over the potential for accelerated spillover of colombian narcotraffickinginsurgent activity into brazil panama and venezuela 3rd largest oil supplier to the us as well moreover according to informed sources at the office of national drug control policy ondcp in february 2001 incursions by the farc and colombian paramilitary groups into remote border areas of ecuador panama and venezuela have been common occurrence for several years on january 19 2001 ecuadorian armed forces personnel reportedly killed six members of the farc at what was characterized as an illegal drug making lab near the colombian border another area of concern yet to materialize as major problem is the spillover of refugees from the conflict in colombia into neighboring countries estimates of the number of colombian refugees entering ecuador in the year 2000 vary from 5000 to 1600 the latter figure being the more widely accepted us support for plan colombia is formalized in pl 106246 signed into law on july 13 2000 which includes 13 billion in emerge ncy supplemental aid funding for regional counternarcotics support primarily for peru bolivia and ecuador is earmarked at 180 million3 us support for plan colombia gives regional intelligence collection high priority with such efforts funded at the 622 million level for the fy2000 and fy2001 twoyear period regional interdiction is funded at 55 million during the same time frame4 prospects colombian drug traffickers and narcolinked insurgents have taken advantage of easy access to ecuadors border areas for number of years primarily for rest and recreation and purchase of supplies ussupported military operations against narco traffickingguerilla groups in colombia could accelerate such trend increased presence of colombian and narcolinked insurgents could limit the effectiveness of us antidrug support to colombia and threaten the territorial integrity and stability of ecuador steppedup levels of farc activity and violence in ecuador to the extent perceived to be result of growing us pressure on narcoinsurgen ts could well diminish levels of ecuadorian public support for the presence of the us based monitoring facility at manta and erode hemispheric regional support for the administrations colombia counterdrug initiative however one viewpoint gaining increasing acceptance is that the insurgents do not want to start new front of military activity in ecuador anytime soon
