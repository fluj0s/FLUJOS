policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31755family caregiving to the elderly by employed persons the effects on working caregivers employers and federal policy summary many trends have combined to prom pt concern about whether the supply of family caregivers to the elderly will be fficient to meet demand one trend the increased commitment of women to the bor force has proved worrisome because of their major role in unpaid caregiving caregiver to frail elder is quite often married woman who is middleaged daught er if her mother is deceased although studies tend to confirm that paid work ssens the likelihood of daughter becoming an informal caregiver many employed women nonetheless assi st older relatives friends and neighbors some analyses find that fulltime work in particular decreases the time spent caregiving the reduction in caregiving hours could be mitigated if care users have multiple unpaid helpers however the comp aratively low fertility rate of the baby boom generation suggests that there will be fewer potential caregivers per recipient in the coming decades elders could hire home care workers to compensate for needs longer being met by unpaid caregivers but this might strain their budgets and cause them to enter nursing homes wh ich could raise government spending coverage of home care services could be expanded to offset reduction in family caregiving but this too would affect the governments budget despite their multiple responsibilities employed caregivers spend many hours assisting elders in order to do so they often make workplace adjustments eg arrive lateleave early and take leave just as accommodation of employees informal caregiving to paid work may affect the budgets of elders and of government so too might the adjustment of work to caregiving affect various parties the productivity of caregivers could be reduced by their concern over frail parents living alone for example caregiving could also increase employers costs if they must replace employees who take leave or quit the earnings and retirement income of caregivers who choose to sharply cutback th eir supply of labor could be reduced as well this might not only diminish their own standard of living but also lead to increased government dependency slower growing labor force also could curb the rate of economic growth and hence of the nati ons standard of living congress passed legislation to encourag caregivers to continue working by making it easier for them to fulfill th eir many commitments the family and medical leave act fmla provides j obprotected unpaid leave to eligible employees at covered employers so that they might among other things care for parents and spouses with serious health conditions in addition congress turned to the tax code to offer employees incentives to start or continue caregiving the dependent care tax cred it and the dependent ca re assistance program caregivers to the elderly regardless of employment status also may receive assistance through the national family caregiver support pr ogram and through home and communitybased waivers under medicaid eg respite care this report will not be

employed persons the effects on working caregivers employers and federal policy family members most often fulfill the nonmedical needs of frail older adults who live in their own homes or those of rela tives in the first half of the 1990s for example family members accounted for 72 of unpaid and paid caregivers to functionally impaired persons over age 70 living in the community1 in particular women often wives daught ers and other female re latives comprised 58 of informal unpaid caregivers to the noni nstitutionalized population age 65 or older who required longterm care2 yet over the last several decades women have become more attached to the paid labor force as result the rate of fulltime employment rose from 230 in 1984 to 275 in 1994 among female primary caregivers to chronically ill or disabled elderly parents and spouses living in the community the share of female secondary caregivers employed fulltime rose from 492 to 5603 the reallocation of womens time among family and household obligations paid employment and leisure could affect the availability and intensity of informal caregiving to elderly relatives friends and neighbors indeed between 1984 and 1994 the share of potential spouse and adu lt child caregivers who actively provided longterm care to chronically ill or disabled elders declined4 some analysts have argued that given womens greater labor

sandwich ge neration copes with elder care benefit quarterly second quarter 1999aging babyboom generation we can longer expect to rely on informal caregivers to bear the burden of longt erm care without support structures and incentives in place eg respite care services and preferential tax treatment5 observers often focus their attention specifically on the sandwich generation of caregivers which is term applied to those trying to meet the demands of their children and older relatives the babyboom generation now in its late 30s through mid50s is the group most likely to be voting time and financia l resources to care for older and younger family members while also holding jobs some babyboomers delayed childbirth and conse quently are raising children while their aging parents are still alive for example 44 of babyboomers between 45 and 54 years old reported in 2001 that they had at least one child under age 21 and living parent6 in contrast the cohort that preceded the babyboomers is less likely to have many working members given their ages and fo r the same reason to have both dependent children and living elderly relatives lthough generation x parents also are less likely to have functionally impaired older family members more of them could well become caregivers as their babyboom relatives age7 thus informal caregiving to the elderly often has been characterized as an intergenerational issue rather than as womens issue per nonetheless the trend toward greater employment among women has spread the impact of elder care beyond caregivers nd care recipients to include employer organizations from the employer perspective elder care will be to the 21st century what child care was to the last few decades8 some companies have modified their human resources programs to reflect employees family responsibilities and thereby to maintain productive workforce among other things family friendly employers have made such adjustments as initiating flexible work schedules providing elder care resource and referral services and offering longterm care insurance9 the effects of employees assisting olde r relatives friends and neighbors extend beyond the workplace if for example informal caregivers sharply reduce their hours of employment in order to strike better balance be tween work and family responsibilities the supply of labor woul d be reduced as would the employed caregivers earnings the former could limit the rate of us economic growth and hence of improvement in national living standards the latter could diminish caregivers

abovementioned implications of unpaid caregiving for the employees pr oviding assistance their employing organizations and society it closes with an overview of the approaches that employers and the federal gove rnment have taken to help employed elder caregivers the size and characteristics of the informal elder caregiving population in order to determine the number and characteristics of informal caregivers to older adults living in the community one first must have definition of caregiving the choice of definition greatly influences estimates of the number of family caregivers the magnitude of burden on i ndividuals families employers and the society and the costs of different policy options10 consensus on the definition of informal elder caregiving is lacking however caregivers have been defined by their re lationship to care users eg exclude friends and neighbors caregivers so have been defined base d on the amount of assistance provided eg limit helpers to those who provide the most assistance namely primary caregivers in addition the characteristics of care users have served as criteria eg setting minimum age for care users definitions have been framed as well in terms of the timing of the help eg when the survey is being administered or at some point during the pr eceding year further the definition of care has ranged from broad to narrow an example of the latter is specifying that the older adult cannot perform without pers onal assistance one or more basic or instrumental activities of daily living adlsiadls adls include eating dressing bathing and toileting iadls include doi ng housework and laundry preparing meals shopping taking medications and managing finances how many are there due in part to the absence of commonly shared definition of elder care estimates of the size of the elder ca regiving population range from between 59httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31755crs4 11 spector et the characteristics of longterm care users and us

respects some of which are identified below the lower figures were derive d from the governmentfunded 1994 national longterm care survey nltcs the nltcs is nationally representative household survey of medicare beneficiaries age 65 or older who live in the community and who must have assistance in order to perform one or more adls or iadls because of illnesses or disabilities that have lasted or are expected to last at least 3 months ie chronic conditions 13 members of the nltcs sample are asked to identify th primary and secondary informal caregivers currently assisting them who then are queried14 informal help means providing ndson assistance to the disabled elder eg performing light housework15 and supervising their performance of adls or iadls eg reminding them of the order in which clothes should be put on the higher figure was develope d from nationally representative telephone survey of englishspeak ing households that was sponsored by the national association of caregivers nac and aarp it asked in 1996 whether there was so meone in the household who was currently assisting or who had within the past 12 months assisted persons age 50 or older who needed help caring for themselves minimum duration of impairment is required therefore the higher estimate includes caregivers to individuals with acute but shortterm conditions eg the flu16 the survey has broad definition of help as well eg respondent could iden tify herself as caregiver if she visited an elderly person to check on themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31755crs5 17 crs discussions with the reports authors dete rmined this to be the likely explanation for much of the discrepancy between the two nltcsbased estimates 18 marc cohen maurice weinrobe and jessica miller informal caregivers of disabled

ders in 1994 all lived with their mates according to spector et the characteristics of longterm care users in contrast 151 of all caregivers were adult children living with the care recipient and 106 more distant relatives coresiding with care usersthe difference of approximately one million between the two lower estimates of caregivers illustrates the importance of definitions in estimating the size of the family caregiver population one of the iadls asked about in the nltcs is transportation ie the ability to go pl aces beyond walking distance the estimate of 59 million caregivers excludes older ca re users who only had difficulty with transportation and henc excludes their caregivers the estimate of more than 7 million caregivers includes them17 what are their characteristics number of elements affects who becomes an informal elder caregiver and particularly who becomes the primary helper these elements include whether an individual has time available to provide care whether he or she is willing to do so on an uncompensated basis how much the pot ential helper is concerned for the well being of the person in need and how clos he or she lives to the care recipient18 not surprisingly then the marital status of care users is an important indicator of who will be their primary family caregiver when available spouse provides the majority of care in the absence of spouse daughter is most likely to assume the role in the absence of daughter will assume the role although there is considerable evidence that sons transfer many care tasks to their spouses in the absence of offspring more distant family members become responsible the person designated to be the primary caregiver also tends to be the person with the fewest competing family or work obligations19 marital status affects other characteristics of the informal caregiving population if spouses provide assistance they mo re often live with the care users 20 typically spend longer hours 4060 week on aver age providing care and more often perform such tasks as meal preparation and personal care eg bathing and toileting in contrast adult children genera lly spend fewer hours 1530 week on average and their

disabled elders 25 caregivers in the nacaarp survey tend to be younger than those in the nltcs due to their different definitions of care users as result the share of caregivers with jobs is likely to be higher in the former survey the average age of caregivers in the nacaarp survey was 46 years old the age distribution of elder caregivers in the nltcs is shown in table 2 26 cohen et informal caregivers of disabled elders 27 for example if relatively more marriedcoupl in the longterm care insurance claimant sample were younger more spouses in the insured group than in the noninsured group might have been capable of assisting their mates thus age could have affected the kinship relationship between care user and caregiver regardless of insurance statustransportation21 although not as often living with their care users they tend to reside nearby22 nonspousal caregivers also are more likely to be working perhaps 24 times more likely according to one estimate23 spousal caregivers typically gave retirement as their reason for longer working t hus their withdrawal from the labor force probably was more related to age than to their caregiving obligations24 typically the share of elder caregivers with paid jobs decreases with age according to the nacaarp survey slightly more than threefourths of caregivers between 18 and 49 years old worked compar ed to 60 of those between 50 and 64 years old and to 12 of those age 65 or older25 the kinship relationship between primary caregivers and elderly care users may be affected by the availability of private longterm care insurance as shown in table 1 private insurance claimants more often had spouses as their primary caregivers compared to uninsured frail elde rs 53 and 38 respectively because spouses can supplement their caregiving efforts with thos of home care workers the authors suggest that these spouses could be better able than the uninsured to avoid shifting to others eg daughters th major role in informal care provision26 however while both sample s included similar proportions of married couples there might have been other differences between the two groups that influenced the kinship relationship between

changing workforce one discrepancy between surveys in caregiver characteristics is the prevalence of the sandwich generation which is probably most related to the varying minimum ages used to define care users caregivers identified by surveys with higher age cut offs are older themselves the older the providers in turn the less likely they are to have competing child care responsibilities for example 41 of caregivers to persons age 50 or older had children under age 18 living at home31 alternatively only 6 of primary caregivers to private longterm care insurance claimants age 65 or older had children under age 25 living with them32 similarly 79 of primary caregivers to chronically ill or disabled pa rents or spouses age 65 or older also had children under age 1533 studies of workers found relatively fe w members of the sandwich generation among them according to families and work institute survey the minority of working parents 20 who provided care to children and to someone age 65 or older were estimated to account for 9 of empl oyed us wage and salary workers34 another analysis similarly concluded that 9 of the workers at 33 employers who were surveyed belonged to the sandwich generation35 employed informal caregivers to the frail elderly the implications of individuals having work and family commitments could intensify if the share of workers with der care

time in 199636 work and elder caregiving empirical analyses of employed caregivers to the elderly typically study women given their predominance in the general caregiver population the focus of

interviews researchers who examined 17 studies from the 1980s that measured the prevalence of informal elder caregivers in the us workforce concluded that the wide range of estimates from 19 to 460 was associated with bias due to nonresponse and with differences in definiti ons of caregiving tentative reestimate of the studies findings narrowed the vari ance in the proportion of employees who are elder caregivers to between 74 and 11839 unlike in the overall caregiving population and unlike the findings of some other studies of employed caregivers the families and work institutes survey showed women and men comprising fairly equal shares of employed elder caregivers 52 and 48 respectively hours of caregiving and of employment despite the claims on their time made by paid work nd

45 spillman and pezzin potential and active family caregivers of the caregiver characteristics of the care recipient and characteristics of the caregiving situation40 there has been particular interest in elder caregivers with fulltime jobs because they could have more difficulty reconciling their multiple roles the nacaarp survey found that small majority of all caregivers work fulltime 52 when the sample is confined to primary caregiver s to frail parents and spouses however the rate of fulltime employment was estimated to be much lower 27241 t h i s disparity is perhaps due to primary elde r caregivers often being spouses who are themselves elderly and thus likely to be retired42 indeed fulltime jobholding was estimated to be more than twice as prevalent among secondary caregivers 589 who often are middleaged children43 although fulltime employment also appears to be more common among longdistance caregivers than among all caregivers on average over 60 and over 50 respectiv ely most employed longdistance caregivers say they have family members or friends living within an hour of the care recipient who help them with caregiving44 if individuals can s hare elder caregiving responsibilities then fulltime workers might more easily balance their family and work responsibilities however th comparatively low fertility of baby boomers suggests that the pool of potential family ca regivers per recipient will shrink in the next 2030 years 45 for this reason some believe the unmet needs of elders could grow in future years all else remaining the same one means of employees reconciling their work and caregiving obligations would be to cut back the amount of inform help given to elders some empirical studies found little difference in the time devot ed to care regardless of the caregivers employment status or hours worked but others came to the opposite conclusion based on data from the 1989 nltcs informal caregiver survey for example employed female primary caregivers to elders unable to perform adls and iadls provided 18 hours per week of assistance on average 16 hours by fulltimers and 21 hours by parttimers female primary caregivers who were

particularly those employed fulltime we re found in this analysis to provide significantly fewer hours of care however the care recipients of employed female primary caregivers were able to complete

mostly female caregivers to very disabled elde rs reduced caregiving time by 25 hours per week in 1982 and by 22 hours per week in 1989 the 3hour difference was not statistically significant nor was the increase in the share of primary caregivers employed fulltime from 158 in 1982 to 193 in 1989 at least during the 1980s then the adverse effect of fulltime employment on caregiving hours appears not to have intensified these findings suggest that fu lltime employment of primary caregivers has not worsened unmet need for assistance47 the researcher noted two factors on the demand ie need side that might compensate for decreases in the future availability of family caregivers namely rise in the use of assistive equipment and decline in the disability rate of the elderly48 the effects of

retirement income one recent analysis based on data from the health and retirement study nationally representative longitudinal survey looked at women and men who ranged from 53 to 65 years old in the mid1990s and who were caring for parent51 it estimated that daughter who assisted her parents either with adls or iadls for at leas t 100 hours in 12month period significantly curtailed her supply of labor by 459 hours year the cutback by who similarly helped parent was virtually the same at 462 hours year given the gender difference in total hours worked th figures represented 28 reduction in paid work hours for men and 43 reducti on for women fairly few people nearing retirement in the mid1990s spent 100 or mo re hours providing care to parents during the course of year however the oppor tunity cost was high for those who did the researchers estimated that the reduced hours of working women who devoted great deal of time to parental care late in their worklives produced an average loss in pretax wages of about 7800 year in 1994 dollars the opportunity cost of providing info rmal assistance could extend beyond caregivers working years social security benefits might be pressed due to lower lifetime earnings and fewer total years of employment52 private pension benefits might be reduced for similar reasons these costs have rarely been quantified the nac and national center on women and aging at brandeis university attempted an estimate utilizing information gathered from indepth interviews of small subset of participants in the nacaarp survey specifically 55 caregivers age 45 or older 1 who made work adjustments because of the caregiving they had provided for 6 months or longer and 2 who assisted with at least two tasks for minimum of 8 hours per week ie at least

current expenses55 although caregiving seems to be less of financial hardship for working than for nonworking caregivers56 the results of study of female elder caregivers at 37 workplaces suggest that such economic consequences may significantly affect whether employees feel carerelated strain57 gender appears to be an important m oderator of elder caregivings potentially adverse impact on the wellbeing of unpaid helpers for example an empirical analysis of elder caregiving among universitys workers determined that women feel significantly more role strain family work and personal and more

telephone calls 38 billion and workday interruptions prompted by crises eg parents having to move into an assisted living facility 11 billion and of supervising employed caregivers eg providing them with emotional support arranging coverage for their absences and advising them about available benefits 805 million63 some believe this to be conservative estimate because it does not consider such things as leaves of absence and the increased utilization of health services by employees due to their caregiving duties the estimate also excludes caregivers employed parttime longdistance caregivers and those who provide less intensive assistance to older adults if all these additional employed caregivers were included in the calculations the total costs to us business of employees having elder

government could ex pand coverage of home care services but replacing the free assistan ce that families provide to older adults would not be without considerable expense there are differing estimates of the economic value of informal caregiving the variability stems from among other th ings the care recipient population under consideration some analyses look at all dults or only older adults with particular disease eg cancer or alzheimers68 among studies that developed an economic value for broader group of care users eg all adults regard less of the condition giving rise to their need for assistance results differ because the researchers used varying estimates of for example the numb er of hours of informal caregiving and of the hourly wage rate applied to careg ivers time eg th federal minimum wage or the average wage of home health workers according to one analysis the economic value of informal caregiving to adults in 2000 was 140 billion 257 billion or 389 billion depending upon the number of caregivers 254292 million caregiving hours 2427 billion and the proxy for their hourly wage rate 515124669 other researchers put the market value of informal assistance to adults who need help with adls or iadls at approximately 166 billion they estimated the number of caregiving hours to be 187 billion and used 9 as the hourly wage rate which was between the fe deral minimum wage of 515 per hour and the average wage of home health workers 11 per hour in 199670 thus the economic value of informal care provided to adults is estimated to greatly exceed the cost of

federal government began to offer longterm care insurance as benefit effective in 2003 employees and eligible family member s who opt to enroll must pay the entire insurance premium according to us bureau of labor statistics national compensation survey data for 2000 7 of employees had access th rough their private sector employers to longterm care insurance employees of firms with at least 100 workers who worked fulltime in professionaltechnicalrelated occupations were more likely to have access to the insurance access differs from enrollment however more than two thirds of nonenrolled employees at nine fi rms of varying size and type that offer longterm care insurance stated they would be more interested in enrolling if their employer contributed to the policy pre mium and almost three out of five non enrollees said if the government allowed them deduction from income tax for premium costs it also would increase their participation74 just as cost influences the inclination of employees to elect longterm care insurance coverage it also affects the willingness and ability of employers to offer direct services to elder caregivers making such professionals as geriatric case managers and lawyers available to assist caregivers could prove expensive if their services are paid entirely by employers the differing needs of working caregivers also may make it difficult for firms to determine the services that are worthwhile investments eg relatively few caregivers in given workforce might want to enroll care users in onsite adult day

the predominant reason for taking leave under the act in the late 1990s 378 with caring for parent involved in only 106 of fmla leaves this nonetheless represents an increase from an earlier survey when there were too few instances to report accurate figures76 some states have enacted familymedical leave laws and some employers offer familymedical leave benefits that are more expansive than those provided through the fmla eg cover smaller firms and additional reasons for leave employees in those jurisdictions and at those employers are entitled to the more generous benefits tax policy

taxpayers who have dependents living in their homes or spendi ng at least 8 hours day in their homes and who are physically or ment ally unable to care for themselves these restrictions represent

employees to pay care expenditures with pretax dollars as in the case of the dctc it has been said that dcaps are of limited usefulness for employees caring for disabled adult because irs regulations require that the dependent must spend at least eight hours day in the employees home be unable to care for himself or herself nd must be financia lly dependent on the employee78 the care must be performed by person who is not dependent of the taxpayer eg someone other than nonworking s pouse the amount of the exclusion cannot exceed the earned income of the taxpayer or the earned income of
