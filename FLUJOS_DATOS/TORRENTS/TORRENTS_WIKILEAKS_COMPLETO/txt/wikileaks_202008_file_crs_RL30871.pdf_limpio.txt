additionally the law strengthened existing penalties for repeat sexual offenders and required restitution to victims in federal sex offense cases vawa called for pretrial detention in federal sex ffense or child pornography fe lonies and allowed evidence of prior sex offenses to be used in some subsequent trials regarding federal sex crimes the law also set new rules of evidence specifying that victims past sexual behavior generally was not admissible in federal civil or criminal cases regarding sexual misconduct provisions of the original vawa allowe d rape victims to demand that their alleged assailants be tested for hiv the virus that is generally believed to cause aids federal judge can order such procedure after determining that risk to the victim existed as in the original act
