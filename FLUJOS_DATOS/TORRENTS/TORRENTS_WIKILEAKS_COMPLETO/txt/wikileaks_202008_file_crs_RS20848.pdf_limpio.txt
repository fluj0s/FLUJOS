approximately two dozen specified agricultural commodities several permanent statutes provide the basic aut hority for these subsidies more recent multiyear farm bills shape their operation and funding levels th most recent omnibus farm bill is the farm security and rural inves tment act of 2002 pl107171 however congress since fy1989 has also passed 30 appropr iations authorization or farm disaster acts adding approximately 53 billion in s upplemental funding for usda farm and related programs through october 2004 this report will not be updated overview usda commodity and price support programs represent the heart of us farm policy by virtue of their long history nd cost net outlays for the commodity credit corporation ccc usdas program financing mechanism have averaged nearly 15 billion annually from fy1995 to fy20041 standing authority for usdaccc programs is provided mainly by three permanent laws the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 pl 75 430 the agricultural act of 1949 pl 81439 and the ccc charter act of 1948 pl 80806 congress frequently alters provisions of these laws through omnibus multiyear farm bills and through various budget measures the most r ecent omnibus farm law is the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl107171 this law is effective through 2007 in addition to passing omnibus farm laws congress frequently provides supplemental funding for usda farm and re lated programs from fy1989 through early fy2005 congress passed 30 appropr iations authorization or farm disaster acts addinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20848crs2 2 these

mustard seed milk peanuts beet and cane sugar wool mohair honey dry peas lentils and small chickpeas receipts for these commodities represent pproximately 3540 of all farm cash receipts estimated at 233 billion in 2004 other commodities that normally receive direct support include meats poultry fruits nuts vege tables and nur serygreenhouse products but even pr oducers of thes items can be affected by farm policy decisions they also might raise some pricesupported commod ities and can benefit also from periodic laws providing them with their ow n supplemental disaster or economic relief3 also government intervention in one farm sector can influence production and prices in another sector statutorily required support policymakers have devised variety of program methods for the ccc to assist producers each generally designed to achieve these broad objectives to supplement farmer incomes tools include annual fixed decoupled payments and countercyclical defic iency payments for grains cotton oilseeds and peanuts countercyclical ficiency payments for milk and nonrecou rse marketing loans and loan deficiency payments for grains cotton peanuts oilseeds wool mohair honey dry peas lentils and small chickpeas to manage supplies and support commodity market prices marketing allotments for sugar are available to restrict output surplus purchases help support farm prices for milk and various specialty crops the types and levels of support employed vary by commodity some are supported by only one method others receive their s upport through combination of program tools wheat feed grains upland cotton rice peanuts soybeans and other oilseeds eligible producers those with past production histories for these crops can receive fixed decoupled payments each year see

generally must be repaid with interest within nine months or else the producer forfeits the pledged commodity to the government which has recourse other than to accept it in lieu of money however two features are intended to help avert forfeitures and subsequent buildup of cccowned surpluses first the marketing loan feature enables the farmer to repay the loan at usdacalculated rate approximating market prices if that repayment rate is below the original usda loan rate the farmer captures the difference as subsidy marketing loan gain loan deficiency payments equal to marketing loan gains also

quota payments will be made in equal annua l installments for 10 years in the future there will be constraints on who can produce tobacco where it can be grown how much can be marketed or how low the price can go see crs report rl31790 tobacco quota buyout proposals in the 108th congress usda discretionary support in addition to the explicitlyrequired subsid ies described above fe deral law has long given usda the discretion to offer support fo r virtually any farm commodity examples have included direct payments of up to 10 per head for hogs in 1999 and of up to 8 per head for lambs under threeyear lamb meat adju stment assistance program authority and funding for these various activities can come from number of sources including ccc eg under the ccc charter act and section 32 section 32 of pl 320 1935 law permanen tly appropriates the equivalent of 30 of annual customs receipts to support the farm sector through variety of activities most of this appropriation now about 6 billion pe r year is transferred directly to usdas child nutrition account to fund school feeding and other programs however section 32 also provides usda with source of disc retionary funds of which up to 500 million annually can be carried over each year which it uses for emergency removals of surplus agricultural commodities disaster relief or other unanticipated needs usda annually purchases hundred s of millions of dollars in meat s poultry fruits and vegetables under section 32 each year see crs report rs20235 farm and food support under usdas section 32 program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20848crs5 payment and loan limitations most commodity subsidies are tied to units produced therefore higher output sometimes past sometimes curre nt depending upon the subsidy means higher benefits with some limits for grains cotton and oilseed s the law sets an annual ceiling for fixed decoupled payments at 40000 per person plus separate annual ceiling for counter cyclical payments at 65000 per person separate payment limit of 75000 per person applies to marketing loans gains for these crops and for dry peas lentils and chickpeas because an individual can receive halfpayments on two additional farms the effective annual cap on total combined pa yments actually has been 360000 per person limits apply to individuals rather than farm units thus single farm with multiple ownersoperators might receive much more than the above amounts also there is perperson monetary limit on the volume of crops that can be put under ccc loan or on how much can be forfeited in lieu of loan repayment finally marketing loan gains in the form of usdaissued commodity certificates which farmers immediately redeem to satisfy loan repayments are not counted toward the 75000 loan cap peanuts have separate payment caps as do wool m ohair and honey see crs report rs21493 payment limits for farm commodity programs issues and proposals policy discussion when the commodity programs were first au thorized in the early 1930s most of the nations 68 million farms were di versified and small by toda ys standards there was perceived need to address the severe ec onomic problems then faced by this large segment of society where about 25 of th us population then resided moreover it was argued stabilizing the agricultural sector through guaranteed minimum farm prices income payments to producers and or various supply mana gement techniques would help to ensure an bundant s upply of food and fiber at reasonable prices in the future since then farming has changed significantly most commercial agriculture is now confined to fewer larger and more sp ecialized operations in 1997 about 157000 large farms with annual agricultu ral sales averaging about 900000 accounted for 8 of all us farms but 72 of all farm sales most of the nations 2 million or so farms are mainly parttime where operators rely on fffarm sources for most of their income farm residents appear to account for less th an 2 of the total us population census longer publishes fa rm population data also the economic health of farmers has become increasingly tied to the needs of processors and marketers and to global markets critics have long argued that us commoditybased policies are outdated nd may even be detrimental to modern agriculture and to society in general alt hough the programs have retained many features dating to the 1930s they also have evolved in response both to the changes occurring in agriculture and the economy and to budgetary and trade pressures at issue is whether they have evolved quickly enough or in the most appropriate ways congress and the administration sought for many decades to steer price and income support programs onto more marketoriented course so that producers would look tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20848crs6 4 world trade organization panel released findi ngs in 2004 in case brought by brazil against us cotton subsidies the implications for th cotton program could affect payment mechanisms for other commodities see crs report rl32571 usbrazil wto cott on subsidy dispute the private market rather than the gove rnment for economic rewards from production agriculture succession of farm bills par ticularly since the 1970s moved farm policy in this direction mainly through incremen tal changes in existing programs the 1996 federal agriculture improvement and refo rm act pl 104127 written at time of high farm prices and expanding exports was aimed at accelerating the programs market orientation however unanticipated declines in export markets and in farm prices both drove up the projected cost of programs authorized by the 1996 farm law primarily marketing loans and loan deficiency payments and also led congress to enact supplemental aid each year these recordhigh subsidies help ed the farm economy as whole remain in relatively strong financial condition however most policymakers and farm groups sought new farm law that would preclude the need for such ad hoc assistance bills this led to adoption in the 2002 law of new count ercyclical assistance whereby subsidies for grains cotton oilseeds and milk automatically increase when farm prices decline and decrease when they rise similar to the older target pricedeficiency payment subsidies this and other commodity provisions in the law attracted widespread criticism from those here and abroad who viewed them as reversing the marketori ented course congress had charted for longterm farm policy in 1996 these critics have argued that the 2002 bill perpetuated outmoded commodityoriented policies that tie support to the prices of few major row crops with legislated target prices and loan rate s set well above market prices us producers continue to overpr oduce supported commodities distorting market prices and global trade they argue the bush administration in its fy2006 budget proposal reportedly is calling for reductions in the programs of 57 billion over 10 years furthermore the adoption of ex panded farm subsidy pr ograms has undermined us credibility in world trade negotiations where the united states has called on other countries to reduce their own trade distor ting agricultural subsidies they contend4 supporters counter that commodity programs provide needed support to farmers who otherwise would see plunging incomes and sset eg land values due to unfavorable and unpredictable price and market conditions worldwide the bill maintains market orientation by continuing to give farmers the flexibility to plant crops based on market signals unbound by government supply manage ment rules the 2002 law has complied with congressional spending limits and provided more in subsidies than farmers received under the last omnibus farm law as supplemented by the emergency farm measures they have noted the new law contains socalled circuit breaker that requires usda to cut tradedistorting subsidie s in order to remain within the 191 billion limit on such spending under the uruguay round agreement on agriculture and the 2002 law keeps the united states in stronger position to negotiate new agricultural trade reforms the united states should not unilate rally cut its own subsidies until foreign competitors reduce their own often higher subsidies as well as their barriers to us farm exports supporters contend
