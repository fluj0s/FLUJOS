sibilities of subnational institu tions proposed directions 38 vexecutive summary introduction 1 over the past year and particularly in recent months the question of subnational administration has escalated tangibly in importance it has become the focus of much attention in government documents has been th subject of number of substantial analytic efforts and donors have begun to direct expa nding amounts at initiatives targeted at the sub national level there are three chief reasons for this number of subnational institutions m andated by the constitution such as the provincial council have been established lifting expectations but also exhibiting problems and generating considerable confusio n about their roles and responsibilities in some cases such as the district and munici pal councils their introduction has been deferred indefinitely creating constituti onal and institutional vacuum and raising questions about how this is to be filled while numerous local investment and service delivery programmes have been rolled out they have often found that coordination and alignment are difficult and sustained delivery has been hard to achieve moreove r securitydriven investment approaches often but not exclusively emanating from the provincial reconstruction teams which focus mainly on the rapid creation of physical assets using nongovernment systems have sometimes conflicted with government institutions and processes and where broadly successful programmes have generated institutional capacity at the subnational level key choices concerning the future of this capacity have become stark and unavoidable what for example should become of the thousands of cdcs established under the nsp when their current funding runs out the continued weakness of subnational structures in certain parts of the country has allowed milita commanders and criminal elements to assert themselves undermining local governance and service delivery and aggravating security problems the resurgence of the insurgency an d the destruction of local facilities in certain parts of the country have brought home the point that the key question surrounding the character of the state in afghanistan is not that of strong centre vs strong peripheryies rather it is whether the current jure and often hollow state at the periphery can become facto state at the periphery whether robust and institutionalized systems of government can be expanded and deepened within the provin ces and below it is increasingly widely recognized that success in this area is central to achieving pr ogress in respect of the three fundamental challenges identified in the i ands security governance and development 2 one of the key constraints to strengthening the subnational system in afghanistan is the absence of clear policy framework regarding its desired institutional structure and strategy to guide actions and activities to realize it in fact goa has recently pointed this out identifying need for strategic institutional framework to improve the operating capacity of subnational governing unitswith need for higher clarity on the roles f unctions relationships and resource allocation for the various entities within the provincial administration 3 this report comprises an initial effort to address this question it builds on the considerable analytical work that has alread been done on subnational administration and governance and seeks to add value in four areas first to provide additional information and analytic insight into the nature of subnati onal service delivery and governance in afghanistan visecond to develop simple nd coherent substantive framewo rk regarding the subnational system for discussion and dialogue within government and the donor community third to propose number of concrete initiatives that coul d be undertaken in order to strengthen the sub national framework as proposed and fourth to suggest some procedural recommendations in order to move things forward the subnational institutional structure main elements key issues 4 territorially afghanistan is divided into 34 provinces 2 of which were created by the karzai administration immediately before the presidential election of may 2004 although there is some disagreement about numbe rs and boundaries as of april 2007 the central statistics office considered that there were 364 rural districts and 34 provincial urban centres some of which are subdivided into nahia or urban districts commonly agreed figure is that there are total of 217 provincial and rural m unicipalities with population of more than 5000 people according to the household listing exercise 20032005 there are an estimated 40020 rural villages 5 the institutional structure of governance and administration in afghanistan can be divided into four main levels the provincial level which comprises provincial line departments pds with basic service delivery responsibility in key sectors health education etc provincial governors pgs or oogs appoint ed by the president with considerable formal and informal powers including si gnoff on expenditures participation in procurement and certain powers of appointment provincial councils pcs elected with dvisory monitoring and conflict resolution roles provincial development committees pdcs with limited coordinating and planning functions b the district level which comprises district offices dosof some central ministries with limited functional responsibilities district governors dgs appointed by the president with relatively limited formal role c the municipal level which comprises municipal administrations led by mayors currently appointed by the president with functional and servicedelivery responsibility mainly for urban services d the village level which comprises cdcs currently in about twothirds of the country elected according to different systems in different areas responsible for local infrastructure development and some administrative functions 6 in addition there is very substantial c ohort of ancillary organizations which exist alongside and outside of the state and which are deeply involved in service delivery the most important of these fall into two categori provincial reconstruction teams and ngos vii7 the main body of the report provides detailed and updated overview of each of these elements and identifies the key issues that each confronts the remainder of this executive summary focuses on the key crosscutting features of the sn system as whole and proposed strategic framework for strengthening it the subnational institutional structure key features 8 the institutional structure described above exhi bits five important features collectively considered these constitute the core of the sub national problem in afghanistan and generate the basic challenges that efforts to st rengthen the system must address 9 first the overall structure is characterized by significant systemic contradiction direct formal functional and budget authority for the delivery of most key services in the provinces such as education health water and roads is held by highly centralized line ministries which work in vertically integrated silos with relatively weak externalized linkages between them however this system coexists with and is cut across by the provincial governor system which allows the pgs to intervene in the affairs of the line ministries and other agencies eg the municipalities through num ber of soft institutional channels some legislated some not for example pgs hold extensive powers over the appointments of civil servants to departmental positions in their pr ovinces and they hold approval powers for all expenditures of all the pds funded from the co re budget in sum centralized modalities of servicedelivery are combined with and subject to range of interventionist powers on the part of the pgs in way which blurs and undermines accountability and creates significant operational difficulties 10 second even given the choice of centralized governance and servicedelivery intergovernmental structure for afghanistan ex isting institutional arrangements are often highly inefficient in particular line ministries tend to be overcentralized with their offices in kabul retaining functions which could much more efficiently be performed at the provincial level to some extent this problem is not unrel ated to the one discussed above so long as line ministries perceive that any significant deconcentr ation of budget or functional authority to their provincial departments is likely to make these aut horities subject to influence and capture by the provincial governors they are unlikel to have much incentive to do so 11 third the current system is both asymmetric and inequitable while some of the current institutional asymmetries appear to make sense others are the result of arbitrary processes connected with history varying donor practices and the like rather than considered design choices the models of the provincial governor s offices that are being implemented in the pag provinces for example are rather different from those in balkh and herat resulting in higher degrees of governor influence in the latter and it is not at all clear why ultimately these are likely to introduce significant strains and tensions at the sn level as the system consolidates and attempts to cohere the inequitable distribution of resources across subnational jurisdictions also presents key problem per capita expenditur in health and education differ widely and consistently between provinces and cannot be accoun ted for by physical and other conditions that might cause input costs in different provinces to va ry these inequalities are also large relative to other countries characterized by strong interprovincial inequity even those with intergovernmental structures similar to those of afghanistan 12 fourth while the most autonomous and pote ntially accountable elements of the sub national system the municipalities and the cdcs escape some of the systemic contradiction viiiproblems mentioned above they confront major difficulties of their own municipal council elections have yet to occur and until they ar held the potential of municipalities to deliver accountable local government in their areas will be hi ghly circumscribed in addition the fiscal and functional framework governing them is bot h unclear and constraining of effective and efficient service delivery cdcs face existe ntial questions derived from the possible discontinuation of the funding which provides th em with the basic wherewithal to play meaningful role 13 fifth like the rest of the afghan state th entire sn structure is afflicted by the sorts of problems which are characteristic of licus countries severe human resource weaknesses an absence of properly functioning ope rational systems shortages of equipment and sparse supporting infrastructure such as electrical power and phone systems necessary to get things functioning properly af ghanistan is particularly badly affected by these and reform and strengthening of the sn system will be less affected by them than any other significant institutional reform in the society addressing the subnational challenge 14 the legal and political environment creates parame ters for reform actions to address these problems the most important of these is constitutional dispensation and political climate which precludes any significant reform to the underlying intergovernmental structure in the short or medium term the constitution refers to preserving the principles of centralism and it is also clear that the dominant consensu s within the current political establishment is committed to the current jure centralized in tergovernmental structure and has appetite for substantial political devolution to subnational levels consequently the basic thrust of any sn strategy must be to improve the functioning of th current system rather than to restructure it such intrastructural reform efforts need to be designed with two sorts of impact in mind first they need to strengthen specific elements of th system organizational impacts second they need to ensure that the func tionality of the system as whole improves systemic impacts 15 against this general backdrop the assessment given above suggests that at the sub national level four broad challenges need to be addressed if service delivery and governance are to be improved 16 challengeactivity area 1 establish an overall direction for reform of the sn institutional system which while building on th current one diminishes the existing levels of systemic contradiction and begins to reduce th unproductively mixed character of current arrangements this direction should be based on the br oad allocation of roles and responsibilities outlined in the figure overleaf among other thin gs this suggests two particularly important orientations for reform first in order to reduce the current levels of systemic contradiction it is necessary to strengthen and consolidate the role of the office of the provincial governor in the areas of coordination and planning while limiting it with respect to the exercise of functional budget and operational authority in the delivery of main services which fall under the provincial line departments second in order to enhance accountability the oversight and supervisory role of the pcs to provide checks and balances over the activities of the delivery agencies needs strengthening 17 challengeactivity area 2 the second major reform area is to focus on strengthening the performance of the main servicedelivery agencies through improving their organizational structures one key crosscutting activity in this ar ea is for line ministries to ensure that functions are divided between their central offices and the provincial departments in order to iximprove their organizational efficiency in number of cases this is likely to involve the deconcentration of various powers and functions of the line ministry from central to provincial department level in fact in some cases this is already underway moe for example is currently in the process of deconcentrating t eacher recruitment to the provincial level 18 challengeactivity area 3 the third major challenge is to provide sufficient resources for the key organs of sn governance and service delivery to play their ascribed roles for example cdcs face fundamental threat as th eir access to funding under nsp is due to terminate and without the funds necessary for th eir development activities they will wither and die at the provincial level organs such as th pcs need to gain access to sufficient funds to allow them to conduct their operations as envisag ed under the recently amended law while at municipal level an overall fiscal framework which provides rational equitable and affordable solution to the fiscal gap they face needs to be developed 19 challengeactivity area 4 the final challenge is to enhance the operational performance of all of the various organs at th subnational level through providing them with the systems and capacities that they require in some areas eg some oogs substantial progress is being made in others the provincial co uncils it has really only just begun needs obviously vary across organizations but certain generic themes can be identified training is one it offices and communications systems are others 20 in order to address these challenges wide range of concrete initiatives will need to be undertaken the most important of these are as follows provincial line departments 21 the performance of the provincial line departments needs to be improved through combination of capacity development and reo rganisation with specific reference to the division of powers and functions between cent ral and provincial offices in order to enhance efficiency this needs to be designed and implemen ted as appropriate to the servicedelivery model prevailing in each specific sector in general however it is likely to involve both vertical intraministry deconcentration and increasing operational autonomy from provincial governor offices at the horizontal level more specifically crosscutting par reforms should be accelerated at the subnational level with appropriate coordination with the development of the capacity development plan for the common functions ministries formulating restructuring pl ans under par particularly the new phases should explicitly address the division of powers and functions between central and lower levels in areas such as budgeting and expenditure authority b reform implementation and management units rimu should continue to be established to manage and oversee ministerial reforms alt hough care should be taken that rimus do not become large structure parallel to the civil service and substitute for sustainable capacity development of staff in line positions c the provincial budgeting process should be deepened and expanded with the proposed expansion in numbers of ministries and provinces as well as management at the local level of goods and services and asset acquisition allocations as planned d other pfm reforms at the subnational level should be continued and expanded to ensure strengthened oversight and monitoring role for the mof x roles and responsibilities of subnational institutions proposed directions provincial line depts provincial line depts prts municipalitiesprovincial governor provincial council pdc district offices delivery governance units eg smcsdelivery governance units eg smcscdcs cdcscdc federation ngos delivery authority and resources supportmonitoring andoversight participation andor election coordination beneficiaries beneficiaries ¾ responsibility for direct service delivery in sectors such as health education water and roads should fall under the operational jurisdiction of the line ministries and in their areas cdcs and municipali ties using variety of different service delivery models these organizations need to improve their internal organizational efficiencies through in creasingly deconcentr ating functions and expenditure responsibilities from the central offi ces to provincial departments their internal operations shoul d become increasingly less permeable to the interventions of external agencies particularly the provincial governors offices prts wi ll also play key investment role for the foreseeab future their activities need to be increasingly aligned with those of the orga ns of government andor directed in wa which does not negatively impact inst itutional development processes ¾ in the absence of district and municipal elections and except in respect of cdcs the basic bottomup accountability function in the provinces should be exercised through the provincial councils in essence this means that their monitoring and oversight functions in respect of both the provincial offices of the line departments and of the pg ffices need to be expanded and consolidated going forward their capacity to play this role needs to be strengthened thr ough increasing thei r resources imp roving their systems and making them increasingly selfsufficient in perf orming this function furthe r dimension of the oversight r ole of the pcs is the approval power they hold in respect of provincia l planning and budgeting which ppears now to be appropriately defined at the community level cdcs are structured in downwardly accountable manner hen ce exercise this function in resp ect of the activities which they undertake they may also support the pc accountability role through providing information and so on topdown accountability for delivery agencies eg the provincial offices of the line ministries is exercised through exist ing institutional processes and fiduciary mechanisms within the line departments and the mustofiat at the provincial level municipalities and cdcs ¾ coordination of the activities of the provinc ial line departments and provincial planning is the core responsibility of the provincial governors in and through the institutions which fall under his jurisdiction eg provincial adminstration assemblie s or over which he presides eg the pdcs given that budget functional and operational authority lie with the line ministriesdepartments the lateral coordinat ion links will be institutionally soft ra ther than hard in character noneth eless they are important and the provincele vel planning and coordination function needs to be strengthened by properly resourcing the k ey organizations which are responsible for it particularly the provincial governors offi ces and the pdcs at lower levels cdcs and municipalities have planning responsibility for their areas fede rations or alliances of cdcs may be able to play planning role at the district level eg through the na tional area based programme initiative ¾ conflict resolution is dealt with by combination of bodies mainly pcs cdcs and the district governor depending on the type and scale of the conflict these bodies need to be resour ced to be able to play this role more effectively xioffices of the governors 22 the core reform initiatives here need to fo cus on consolidating the role and capacity of the oogs for coordination and planning at the interdepartmental level while reducing their incentive and ability to become involved in the operational functions and activities of the line agencies in particular regulatory reform is needed to ensure cons istency between the powers given to different institutions at the provincial level so that line departments are able to operate effectively for example the signoff powers of the governor on line department expenditures should be eliminated or at least reduced in time re vised local government law should clarify the coordination role of the oogs at the interdepartmental level while reducing the scope for their involvement in intradepartmental matters b in order to avoid conflicting with the mandate of line ministries donors should avoid making substantial sums available to provin cial governors for service delivery activities c the capacity of governors to play coordina tion and development planning role in line with the overall institutional framework should be strengthened through the continued roll out of reform of the oogs through the par process but using appropriate institutional models provincial coordination and pl anning pdcspaas and pdps 23 in the current institutional structure pdcs and paas are the only fora where cross sectoral coordination and provincewide development planning can take place pdcs are also developing an important role in the mof provincial budgeting initiative participating in the formulation of budgets while pdps are emer ging as central to the planning process at the provincial level there remains need to clarify exactly what pdps are and can achieve specifically the pdcs need to be given sufficient support to play their mandated role in development planning and budgeting according to the overall ins titutional framework this mainly requires support in basic systems and organizational infrastructure as well as institutionalization of internal practices throug h the development of standard practices and manuals and so on c the relative roles of the paa and pdcs should be reviewed as there is currently the potential for overlap and duplication of effort the paa under the leadership of the governor could have stronger reporting role to centr government on provincial affairs d the active and direct participation of the governors in the pdcs needs to be strengthened through provision of appropriate support and by strong encouragement from the office of the president given the problems with linking pdps directly to resources or institutional action within the existing framework pdps should be seen less as costed plans and more as strategic documents giving some sense of priority issues to guide line ministry and donor decision making in the provinces xiiprovincial councils 24 the key role of the pcs is to exercise an accountability function in order to strengthen this number of things are needed ensure widespread dissemination of and training to both councils government bodies and other subnational actors on the roles of the councils as laid out in the revised provincial council law b clarify the mechanisms by which the pcs can exercise their oversight role and act on problems that they identify c to strengthen the accountability function clarify with all actors the role of pcs in providing qualified signoff on budgets formulated by pdcs d provide substantially more resources for in ternal systems and institutional development also it infrastructure transport and so on to sure improved coordination in this reestablish the joint governmentdonor technical working group on provincial councils ensuring some means of pc input to it enable councils to link up with government and other for example prt data sources to enable improved monitoring and oversight f in the mediumlong term assess whether the cu rrent institutional location under the oaa allows the proper development of th councils as independent bodies district level 25 in the absence of an agreed institutiona l framework surrounding the districts limited reform at this level is possible however some steps may be taken district offices of line ministries should be included in intraministry deconcentration initiatives b it is not clear that the district governor ffices should be extensively strengthened in terms of staff numbers given their limited role the rge numbers of districts and limited resources available to the government however it is important to ensure that district governors are appointed in transparent manner and are held accountable for their actions this will require reform at the moi as well as discussion with the national assembly c donors funding programmes operating at the district level and attempting to build institutions should ensure that they are establishi ng consistent structures across the country impromptu donor initiatives at the district leve l in the absence of wider institutional framework should be avoided d promote district level planning and servicedelivery processes as they begin to develop for example through nabdp but ensure that planning at this level is kept relatively simple with clear links both upwards and downwards xiiimunicipalities 26 municipal challenges should be addressed through number of broad measures developing legislation which provides clearer categorization of the different sorts of administration which should be created in order to manage different sorts of settlement and clarifying the resources consequences and claims of these eg what human resource and funding frameworks should pertain in each case and so on b clarifying the functional roles expenditure assignments and frameworks governing service delivery for municipalities c formulating comprehensive financing framework for municipalities which rationalizes and improves ownsource revenue assignments and clarifies municipal authorities over base and rate setting in respect of these introduces measures to strengthen municipal revenue administration and establishes transparent rul esbased system to allocate central transfers equitably and rationally among municipal jurisdictions d developing improved budgeting financial management and accounting systems and instituting measures to build capacity to administer these systems within municipal administrations introducing elections for mayors and municipal councils at the earliest feasible opportunity f developing institutional measures to deal with the cdcwakil interface and to bridge the current gap between the bottomup system for expression of community voice and need and planning and budget decisionmaking community development councils 27 three key initiatives are needed to assist the cdcs face the basic challenges they confront cdcs need to secure regular and reliable funding flow to resource the local level development activities which provide their raison detre the primary initiative here should be to establish dedicated fiscal transfer m echanism which gives them source of ongoing funding which they can then allocate to local projects at their discretion secondary initiative should be to seek oppor tunities for steering funding whic h is meant to be dedicated to support sectorspecific investments at th local or community level via cdcs or federations of cdcs b as far as cdcs roles are concerned these shoul d be consolidated on the basis of the new byelaw insofar as the parameters of their role are concerned cdcs should broadly take on public goods provision functions and should not become involved in activities such as the selection of individual microfinance benefici aries or livelihood assistance as this would entail risks of conflict of inter est nepotism and corruption c the matter of ownership of cdcs at the centr level will of course have to be settled within the central government by those agenci and ministries which have core interest in this question xivprovincial reconstruction teams 28 prts confront in fact they constitute critical dilemma in trying to create the space for the afghan state to develop and cohere they run the risk of undermining it number of steps may be identified in order to address this risk scale down prt activities in relatively secure areas and begin to route the resulting resources through government systems and budgets prts should really only exist where security conditions make them absolutely necessar the esc should undertake review of prt establishments in terms of this criterion and begin to phase them out or rightsize them accordingly diverting the resource yield to s upporting government ins titutions and onbudget projects and initiatives b each prt commander should develop conditionbased plan for phasing hisher prt out given that prts are interim structures which have their own demise as their core objective each prt should formulate description of the concrete conditions wh ich would make the realization of this objective possible key indicators of these conditions and plan for how they are to be achieved c prts should begin to move away from small scale communitylevel projects and initiatives where the conflicts between local prioriti zation and governance and topdown prt processes are likely to be most pronounced instead the cerp budget and other such resources should be focused increasingly on larger scale bulk and link infrastructure where the need is obvious and processconflicts are likely to be much fewer d insofar as prts continue to provide resources out side of the government budget they need to ensure maximum alignment with it this involves producing accurate and timely information on project costs and details and ensuring that government inputs are accurately costed particularly salary and operating costs once the project is completed finally the esc should issue policy discour aging the poaching of government staff and provision of salary topups procedural steps 29 in order for progress to be made on these fronts two initial procedural steps should be taken first an interministerial committee reporting directly into the presidents office should be formed to establish framework for subnational strengthening and reform in the short to medium term this should focus on providing cl earer direction for the evolution of the sub national system thus guiding donor initiatives in th is area in the longer term this sort of body should oversee more thoroughgoing policy exercise which should ultimately lead to the development of new local government law b donor group focusing specifically on subna tional issues policy questions institutional strengthening capacity building funding of services and infrastructure should also be formed in many other countries where the subnational is of critical importance these groups have been established and have played critical role in coordinating donor activities and ensuring that they support rather than undermine the development of coherent xvinstitutional framework at the s ubnational level apparently such group has recently met this is encouraging and should be encouraged 11 introduction1 background 11 over the past year and particularly in recent months the question of subnational administration has escalated tangibly in importance it has become the

from the provincial reconstruction teams which focus mainly on the rapid creation of physical assets using nongovernment systems have sometimes conflicted with government institutions and processes potentially undermining the latter and raising questions about the overall trajectory of institutional development at the sn level 3 and where broadly successful programmes have generated institutional capacity at the sub national level key choices concerning the future of this capacity have become stark and unavoidable what for example should become of the thousands of cdcs establishe d under the nsp when their current funding runs out as the csis noted earlier this year4 the continued weakness of subnational structures in certain parts of the country has allowed milita commanders and criminal elements to assert themselves undermining local governance and service delivery and aggravating security problems the resurgence of the insurgency and the destruction of local facilities in certain parts of the country5 have brought home the point that the key question surrounding the character of the state in afghanistan is not that of strong centre vs strong peripheryies rather it is whether the current jure and often hollow state at the periphery can become facto state at the periphery6 whether robust and institutionalized systems of governme nt can be expanded and deepened

achieving progress in respect of th three fundamental challenges identified in the iands security governance development b objectives 12 it is one thing for an issue to gain higher visibility it is another for set of coherent and definite steps to be formulated in order to address it arguably the critical constraint to strengthening the subnational system in afghanistan is the absence of either clear policy framework regarding its desired institutional stru cture and strategy either on the part of government or of donors to guide actions and activ ities to realize it in fact goa has recently pointed this out identifying need for strategic institutional framework to improve the operating capacity of subnational governing unitswith need for higher clarity on the roles f unctions relationships and resource allocation for the various entities within the provincial administration7 13 the constitution and other legislation pr ovide legal foundation for number of subnational organs such as the provincial councils and elected municipal councils but this tends to be broad and ambiguous and often begs more questions than it answers about who should be doing and is accountable for what the resource flows that are necessary for the effective exercise of powers and functions the implementing mechanisms that need to be developed and so on the costs of these l acunae have mounted steadily and have become increasingly visible to all both government and d onors need greater clarity on the basic structure of the subnational system how its different elemen ts fit together how best to allocate roles and responsibilities among them where to focus funding and institutional effort and which sorts of planning coordination and implementing mechanisms to support 14 this report comprises an initial effort to address this question it builds on the considerable analytical work that has alread been done on subnational administration and governance and seeks to add value in four areas first to provide additional information and analytic insight into the nature of subnati onal service delivery and governance in afghanistan second to develop simple nd coherent substantive framewo rk regarding the subnational system for discussion and dialogue within government and the donor community third to propose number of concrete initiatives that coul d be undertaken in order to strengthen the sub national framework as proposed and fourth to suggest some procedural recommendations in order to move things forward 15 the report begins section 2 by providing an overview of the chief elements of the sub national system in afghanistan and the core issues surrounding each of these it then section 3 proceeds to provide some analysis of its key f eatures and the environment for reform section 4 suggests strategic approach to strengtheni ng subnational governance and service delivery through outlining number of broad challenges developing substantive concept for the evolution of the sn service delivery and govern ance system and identifying the main generic activities that are necessary to strengthen it it also recommends number of specific initiatives that could be taken in respect of each of th main subnational organs of government and concludes by proposing number of procedural step s that may be taken in order to facilitate progress 7 goa provincial development provinc ial budgeting and integration of the provincial development plans into the ands april 2007 3 c qualifiers 16 three important points should be stressed at the outset all of which go to issues of some sensitivity in the afghan context first the authors of this report are acutely aware that great deal of government and donor activity is currently focused on the subnational question and that in certain areas much progress has been made none of the sometimes critical insights offered here is made in ignor ance of this nor does the discussion proceed on the assumption that reform of the subnational system can be approached as if it were tabula rasa on which an abstract picture can be painted and imposed on the contrary this report takes the existing structure and the current activities many of which have delivered promising results as point of departure and seeks to build on these 17 second the normative perspective adopted in this report is an institutionbuilding one this assumes that both government and dono r efforts should be directed primarily at the goal of building institutional systems and capac ities which will improve governance and effective servicedelivery over the medium and long term it implies that initiatives which focus on the creation of physical assets are important but should be designed in such way as to support rather than undermine this basic institutional goa l initiatives which are likely to aggravate the existing institutional incoherence or introduce in stitutional dissonance into the system should be avoided however tempting the shortterm prosp ects of putting pipes in the ground or tar on the roads may appear this perspective derives not just from wellestablished consensus in the international literature that institution building is cardinal to development it is also born of the view the ultimately the expansion of durable nd credible institutions of governance and delivery are fundamental to the security of the afghan st ate and are much better way of securing its future than attempts to buy popular credibilit with shorthorizon investments that leave lasting institutional impact and which usually grade rapidly without institutional systems to maintain them 18 third it needs to be acknowledged that the discussion of the subnational and what to do about it has often been clouded by an assump tion that an emphasis on the importance of the subnational implies normative view in favour of greater political devolution something which is anathema to the current government more on th is later these clouds need to be lifted the fact that this report suggests that it is impera tive that greater and more disciplined effort be placed on sorting the subnational system out does not suggest that afghanistan should go down the road of greater political devolution in fact as section 4 indicates the report takes the current centralprovincial structure in afgha nistan and the political consensus surrounding it as given and seeks ways to improve its perform ance and functioning within these parameters 4 box 11 variants of decentralization this report uses the terms deconcentration delegati on and devolution to describe different variants of decentralization or the relationship between central and s ubnational entities in practice most intergovernmental systems have some elements of each of these variants th is box clarifies these terms deconcentration refers to decentralization of central government ministries nd arrangements whereby subnational governments act as agents of the center sometimes regional branches of centr offices and agent governments have some authority to make independent cisions usually within ce ntral guidelines often t hough deconcentrated local government lacks authority over the scope or quality of local services and how they are provided under delegation subnational governments rather than branches of central government are re sponsible for delivering certain services subject to some supervision by the cen tral government delegation ma improve efficiency when subnational governments can better administer programs of na tional interestincluding cert ain aspects of education water and healthin ways that better reflect local circumstances the center or sometimes intermediate government determines what should be spent and may also set minimum servic standards while subnati onal governments define the details the design of intergovernmental fiscal transfers and the degree and nature of central monitoring influence the balance between central and cal decision making under delegation devolution is the most complete form of decentralization inde pendent or semi independent and typically elected subnational governments are responsible for delivering set of public services and for imposing fees and taxes to finance those services subnationa l governments have considerable flexibility in selecting the mix nd level of services they provide other levels of government may provide inter governmental transfers for devolution to work the central and local governments must act as partne rs with the former keeping its comm itment to devolve functions and local officials agreeing to make difficult choices and develo p the capacity to exercise their powers effectively taken from east asia decentralizes chapter 1 world bank 2005 52 the subnational inst itutional structure main elements key issues territorial and institutional overview 21 territorially afghanistan is divided into 34 provinces 2 of which were created by the karzai administration immediately before the presidential election of may 2004 there is disagreement about the number of districts w ith different ministries and government agencies disputing both overall numbers and boundaries as of april 2007 the central statistics office considered that there were 364 rural districts and 34 provincial urban centres some of which are subdivided into nahia or urban districts the ministry of interior and afghanistan geodesy and cartography head office agcho recognize diffe rent boundaries and numbers there is also disagreement about the number of municipalities however commonly agreed figure is that there are total of 217 provincial and rural m unicipalities with population of more than 5000 people according to the household listing exercise 20032005 there are an estimated 40020 rural villages but some ministries estimate figures very different from that 8 22 as administrative units were mostly form ed for political rather than technical administrative reasons the population and land area of each of these units vary enormously they also vary significantly in terms of terrain all of this has implications for the development of the subnational systems and the delivery of services the largest province kabul has an estimated population of nearly 2535 million and the pr ovinces of ghazni herat helmand and nangahar all have estimated populations of over 1 million nimroz and panjshir on the other hand have populations of less than 120000 the situation is the same for districts with districts in the same province ranging from populations of less than 6000 to nearly 100000 9 administrative units also cover vastly different geographical areas estimates suggest that helmand covers more than 57000 km² whereas panjshir covers less than 4 000 km² some rural districts cover less than 50 km² whereas others are nearly 600 km²10 23 the institutional structure of governance and administration in afghanistan can be divided into four main levels each of which is discussed in detail below the provincial level which comprises provincial line departments pds with basic service delivery responsibility in key sectors health education etc provincial governors pgs or oogs appointed by the president with considerable formal and informal power s including signoff on expenditures participation in procurement nd certain powers of appointment provincial councils pcs elected with advisory monitoring and conflict resolution roles provincial development committees pdcs with limited coordinating and planning functions b the district level which comprises district offices dosof some central ministries with limited functional responsibilities 8 these estimates can vary quite dram atically for example estimates of 2500030000 are not uncommon 9 source provisional estimates from house hold listing exercise conducted in 200305 10 source unofficial estimates from satellite images 6 district governors dgs appointed by the president with relatively limited formal role c the municipal level which comprises municipal administrations led by mayors currently appointed by the president with functional and servicedelivery responsibility mainly for urban services d the village level which comprises cdcs currently in about twothirds of the country elected according to different systems in different areas responsible for local infrastructure development and some administrative functions 24 provinces and districts are graded determined largely by population but with the influence of additional political factors grade 1 is the largest and grade 3 is the smallest the grade of province or district affects the size of the governors office as well as the position grades of the staff this formal governmental structure is complemented by large and substantial additional servicedelivery and velopment infrastructure including ngos prts and other initiatives 25 the 1382 constitution provides the overarching legal framework for subnational government establishing afghanistan as unitary state but stating article 137 that the government while preserving the principle of centr alism shall delegate certain authorities to local administration units for the purpose of expediting and promoting economic social and cultural affairs and increasing the participation of people in the development of the nation it mandates the establishment of elected provincial district municipal and village councils and the election of mayors 26 the legal framework below the constitution is rather unclear with variety of old and new laws and decrees which impinge in differe nt ways on the institutions of subnational government the 1379 law for local administrations issued under the taliban made minor revisions to various earlier local government laws revision of this law has been underway for several years but is currently stalled as key decisions such as the institutional location of provincial governors are under discussion re levant new laws include the 1384 provincial council law and its recent revision the 1384 civil service law and the 1385 procurement law recent bylaw has also started the process of institutionalizing the cdcs discussed in detail below b the provincial level provincial line departments 27 the most active departments at provincia l level are those of mof moph moe mrrd mopw maahf and moi which includes the governors offices with members of the judiciary and security services present as well recently the ministry of economy has been expanding into the provinces and now has represen tatives in every province the presence of other ministries depends on the size or grade of the province or specific circumstances or locations 28 some departments of ministries follow standard structure and size across the provinces and others vary however most provincial departments are led by department head grade 1 or 2 official with deputies unde r himher responsible for different areas in kapisa for example the education department s total administrative staff of 280 and 2617 7teachers the health department which in this province directly delivers health services see below has total staff complement of 396 29 line departments are responsible for delivery of most services in afghanistan two basic models predominate direct delivery by the centralized state as in the education sector and contracting out of service delivery to ngos nd other entities as in the health sector these different models emerged as result of the situa tion in relation to existing service delivery in 2001 and particular donor interests coupled with th strength of leadership in the ministries the different models display different mix of constraints and challenges but with many commonalities 210 in education 97 of afghan students are enrolled in public schools operated by civil servants under the management of the ministry of education moe 11 however even in sector where the majority of delivery is through the centralized state donors also provide some inputs inkind or provide salary topups and direct pa yments which has often reduced the ability of the government to assess needs accurately and ensure an equitable distribution of resources indeed recent review suggests that the government has direct control over only 62 of the funds spent on education12 ngos are also very important donors and service providers in the education sector and their activities cover variety of areas from school supplies supporting teachers salaries building school infrastructure assisting in curricula design and implementing national education programmes 211 until recently management of education deliver had been highly centralized the moe in kabul has managed everything from curriculum deve lopment to teacher training approval of the recruitment of teachers and administrative sta ff development production and distribution of textbooks and especially the planning and manageme nt of the budget schools for example have had very little access to nonsalary budget allo cations table 21 below shows functional responsibilities by level table

paper november 2006 13 taken from world bank stocktake par at moe november 2006 8 212 in practice it seems greater authority is alr eady being exercised at lower levels in some places in kapisa for example the provincial head of department is responsible for maintaining schools from his operating budget afs 35m for 152 schools although decisions are subject to general provincial level approval processes discussed below14 213 the health sector has very different approach with the delivery of services mostly outsourced to ngos and the private sector with cl ose supervision and regul ation by the ministry of public health moph in early 2002 th moph and major donors developed the basic package of health services bphs which has be delivered through variety of contracting mechanisms with number of international and national ngos as well as directly by the moph in three provinces independent evaluations s how improvements in quality of care improved health indicators and increased management capacity in moph 15 214 in the three strengtheningmechanism provin ces where the pho is contracted to deliver services directly the department exercises more authority than other line departments the pho is directly responsible for the running equipping nd supplying of all the health facilities as well as the immunization and vector control programm although all drugs are procured centrally most other procurements up to limit of afs 250000 are the responsibility of the pho although subject to the general pr ovincial approval process 215 in reality most sectors have hybrid system of service delivery as result of history the influence of donors and the imperatives of service delivery different levels of deconcentration have developed over time and in different programmes even within the same ministry for example in mrrd some decisions about nsp pa rticularly in relation to the location of cdcs were devolved at the beginning of the project yet with the exception of khandahar mrrd remains extremely centralized in its procurement practices and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future 216 the par process and associated restructurin g and reappointment of staff through priority reform and restructuring prr has ge nerally had limited impact to date in line ministries at the provincial level with the exception of mrrd and moph moreover it appears that the restructuring undertaken to date across ministries has not included consideration of the division of functions and responsibilities betwee n central and provincial levels the initial restructuring plans that ministries were required to submit under the prr process did not explicitly address this question 217 the new proposed postprr bank operation 204 million over 34 years will help to continue reform and restructuring in four nistries other donors are also supporting similar initiatives and there should shortly be considerable expansion of efforts into line ministries at the subnational level for example adb is curre ntly funding reform of the mustoufiat in seven provinces ensuring restructuring and some capacity development and it is hoped to expand this pilot effort to other provinces alt hough new donor may need to be found 218 generally speaking in their relationsh ips to their head offices provincial departments have little autonomy in key areas such as budget planning and execution human resources and procurement thus 14 interview with head pde kapisa 15 waldman r strong l and wali 2006 afgha nistans health system since 2001 condition improved prognosis cautiously optimistic briefing paper areu kabul 9 provincial departments are secondary budget units and the budget for each provincial department is largely determined in kabul the provinces have however recently been given greater flexibility to shift expenditure allotments between minor codes 16 i n practice this change is implemented in va rying ways across provinces with the mustoufie retaining different levels of control17 provincial departments have final author ity over civil service appointments above grade 5 this authority is held by the mini stry 35 or the appointments board of the iarcsc 12 below grade 5 the provincial governor plays the overriding role the 1385 procurement law gives provincial partment heads the right to initiate procurement process up to afs 20m for works and afs 10m for goods and services but i it has yet to be implemented in the provinces ii bids are assessed by committee on which the pd has minority representation 219 in response to the organizational inefficiencies resulting from this highly centralized structure some strong ministers have started to move ahead with significant reforms at all levels including steps towards greater intraminstry deconcentration moe for example has begun considering how best to devolve some admini strative and financial cont rols to lower levels in particular attempts are beginning to delega key administrative functions such as operations and maintenance of school buildings and manage ment of associated expenditure school mapping and selection of construction sites and implementa tion of teacher training activities to province district and school levels the moe has also started the process of overhauling the management and organizational system moreover the worl d bank funded education quality improvement program equip with strong emphasis on co mmunitymanaged schools has been declared the national education program of the country c overing all 34 provinces this program promotes school management committees smc responsible for their own funds for infrastructure teaching and learning activities monitoring teacher attendance and keeping their schools safe from violence 220 however the moe has encountered number of constraints in attempting to move ahead with deconcentration initiatives these include low levels of internal capacity and systems some disagreements with the iarcsc about the appropriate way forward poor quality of candidates for appointments at the subnational level attempts to influence subnational appointme nts from variety of sources including individual mps the national assembly as whole and provincial governors 221 one promising attempt to increase the involve ment of provincial departments in decision making and make their parent ministries in ka bul more sensitive to provincial needs has been the provincial budgeting initiative see box 21 although provinces did have some involvement in the budget preparation process during the soviet period recently ther has been highly centralized budget preparation and execution syst em as mentioned above line ministries are responsible for developing budgets with ge nerally very limited input from provincial departments staff in kabul decide how much funding they will request from mof how it will be split between the central offices and the subnationa l departments and the share across different 16 historically allotments have been br oken down into major codes and minor co des and only the parent ministry in collaboration with the mof has been able to change these allocations since 2004 the mof has been issuing allotments at the major code level onl and it is up to the provincial depa rtments to decide how these funds are allocated at the minor spending code level 17 for discussion of this issue see evans and osmani 2005 assessing progress update report on subnational administration in afghanistan areukabul 10provinces allotments are released on quarterly basis and the mustoufiat releases funds against requests with the signoff of the provincia l governor the provincial budgeting initiative although limited so far in scope is an attempt to improve the sensitivity of ministry budgets to provincial needs as well as strengthen the coordination of investments across ministries at provincial level as it expands it will enhance the ability of mof to improve the equity and transparency of allocations across provinces and report accurately on provincial expenditures to the national assembly and others it may also co rrect some of the misperceptions created by reporting systems about the balance of sp ending between the centre and provinces box 21 the provincial budgeting pilot the provincial budgeting pilot is intended to improve the budge tary efficiency and interdep artmental coordination of line ministries through program and provinc ial budgeting the ministry of finance in partnership with others is i attempting to make the central ministries more sensitive to pr ovincial imperatives ii address process procedure and system constraints iii begin to take on the question of equi ty in the distribution of fiscal resources both vertically between the centre and provinces and horizontally between provinces pilot ministries were selected on th basis of their impact on the iands and provincial development and their capacity to implement reforms select ed pilot ministries were mrrd the maahf and moe three provinces were chosen for the pilot balkh as provi nce with good capacity panj shir as newly establis hed province and kandahar as southern province with security problems the pilot was conducted during the 1386 budget preparation process covering the period from july 2006 to february 2007 the ministry of finance prepared general budget instruc tions as part of the annual budget process and requested additional information on the proposed provi ncial allocations of line ministries tailed additional instructions were provided to those ministries participating in the pilot provi ncial directorates af ter consultation with the pdcs sent budget proposal to their respective minist ries reflecting provincial needs both within and across ministries after revision the ministries returned budget proposal to be pproved by the pdc in case of disagreement the line ministries retained an override authority so budget aut hority remained essentially ce ntralized although with much greater input from the provincial level provi ncial allocations of line ministry budge ts for the pilot ministries were then included in the budget documentation presented to the national assembly the outcomes of the provincial budgeting p ilot projects were generall encouraging important lessons were learnt and the pilot project will be expanded for 1387 budget preparati on from 3 ministries to 8 identified candidates are the ministries of public works urban velopment energy and water agricultu re and finance the mof is further planning to decentralize the management of the ministries goods and services budge t as part of the expansion of the pilot however the pilot highlighted the follow ing systemic constraints and issues the provincial governance structure has limited legal authority and roles and responsibilities in budget formulation and execution are unclear pilot ministries currently do not have the capacity to communicate clearly their strategies policies and procedures to their provincial directorates provincial development plans pdps were still in an early stage in all three pilot provinces and the planning process had already started without clear objectives or methodology often resulting in unclear goals and unrealistic expectations fu rthermore it is not clear how the pdp pro cess will fit with budget processes see below complete and consistent information on the development needs and priorities of the provinces was not available some provinces had provincial profile andor district development plans ddp however these ddps were in the process of being consolidated into provincial devel opment plans so inadequate information was available at the time of the pilot information on the provincial allocation of some progr ams and projects was ofte n not readily available there is disagreement between mof and the ands secr etariat on whether there will be provincial budget ceiling the mof intends only to provide ministry ceilings drawn from goa 2007 provincial development provincial budgeting and integr ation of the provincial development plans into the afghan national development strategy draft discussion paper for the adf april 2007 and interviews with mof 11 222 in sum although the system is formally cen tralized substantially different levels of deconcentration have begun to emerge in different ministries in some cases this is the result of deliberate strategy in others it is emergi ng as result of decisions made about individual programmes with inconsistencies even between programmes within the same ministry there is lack of clear crossgovernment policies relati ng to the appropriate levels for functional responsibilities while few ministries are experi menting with deconcentration overall sentiment for centralized decisionmaking remains strong 223 it may also be noted that the formal centralized decisionmaking of line ministries is attenuated by the role of other actors particular ly the provincial governor this is discussed in detail below but provincial governors exercise cons iderable influence on the appointments of line department officials as well as approving all expenditures of departments the power of the governor can also be strengthened by the tendenc for strong interministerial rivalries at all levels exacerbated by the unclear divisions of responsibility in some areas further deconcentration within ministries therefore carries with it the risk of increasing the influence of governors on the daytoday operations of line nistries unless parallel action is taken to deal with the institutional contradictions in the system 224 finally serious capacity and systems co nstraints characterize all ministries particularly at lower levels an assessment conducted in 2005 18 found that few government employees at the subnational level have more than high school education nor do they understand the functions of the ins titution that they work for and most are also unclear about their own role within it there is also lack of in ternal procedures and systems as well as poor office facilities including lack of space equipment and basic utilities offices of provincial governors oogs 225 provincial governors are appointed by the president as his representative in the province but are formally part of the moi the exact relationship with the moi is somewhat unclear and is currently under discussion moreove r the level of support provided by the moi to the governors offices is minimal due to the unref ormed nature of that ministry and its overall emphasis on security rather than subnational administration issues 226 the provincial governor typically has staff of between 2055 although exact figures are difficult to come by as the staff of district offices are formally included in the headcount of the oog the oogs receive very limited nonsal ary budget allocations in general governors offices also have limited capacity particularly in terms of organisational infrastructure and systems 227 the governor has significant authority over the police in the province and direct authority over the district governors the various duties and authorities of the governor are formally laid out in the 1379 law for local ad ministrations other old nd new laws and decrees also stipulate certain powers in different areas for the governor but in general there is lack of clarity about the exact legally prescribed powers nonetheless the governor is seen to be the central figure and the direct representative of the president and is usually held in great esteem in reality in most provinces he or she there is one female governor in bamian plays pivotal role in provincial affairs although this depends partly on his own influence and personality and his relationship with other local powerholders 18 iarcsc and undp 2005 subnationa l training needs assessment report 12 228 provincial governors exercise considerable influence over the daytoday operational activities of the line departments it is commonly understood that the directors of provincial line departments have dual reporting line to their ministry in kabul and to the provincial governor the governor signs off on all provinc ial expenditures over afs1000 although for sums over afs 50000 he has to refer the matter to the provincial administrative assembly paa see below which he chairs there is some confus ion over the extent to which this is legally mandated authority nonetheless it is universa lly accepted the 1385 procurement law also gives the governor seat on the 3person provincial procurement committee 229 the governor is also influential in appointm ents and other management issues according to article 15 of the civil service law pgs have recommendation power s over appointments to provincial departments at grades 3 5 and approval powers over grades 610 19 it is also widely known that they exercise strong informal influence over the appointments that are made supposedly objectively and on merit by the appointments board to grades 1 and 2 230 one of the key mechanisms through which some governors exercise their influence is as chair of the provincial administrative assembly paa paas have long existed in many provinces as coordinating entities between the head s of department and the governor although they vary in membership and function across the country in some provinces they do not meet at all or the governor is not involved in others they are weekly administrative meeting of heads of department under the chairmanship of the governor in some places much of the paas time is spent on spending and procurement issues but they also deal with other administrative matters as well as security this is clearly forum whic h the governor can use to exert considerable influence over the activities of line department s as well as ensure his involvement in all procurement decisions 231 the governor also chairs the provincial development committee pdc discussed in more detail below though he may sometimes delega this responsibility there is potentially some overlap in functions between the pdc and th paa in the agreed plans for reorganization of the provincial governors officers through prr the paa is conceptualized as higher body with broader membership which includes issues such as security and the pdc as one of several subcommittees of the paa with mandate limite d to development and planning the actual relationship between paas nd pdcs seems to vary 232 although the governors receive limited nonsalary budget allocations many governors receive additional funding from ot her sources or have influence over the spending of additional sums in some cases this leads the gove rnor to become active in service delivery some governors have always had access to considerable sums through personal networks which have enabled them to strengthe n and equip their own offices while increasing their power of patronage however additional sources of funds have emerged since 2001 in particular many prts support activities initiated by the governors 233 until recently governors in insurgencyaffected provinces have received special operating funds of up to 5million per year through the gov ernors discretionary fund this is being phased out although there will likely be provision to ensure that governors have small amounts of money for the travel and entertaining necessary fo r their job in general there is currently an emphasis strongly supported by donors on ensu ring improved transparency and accountability 19 these powers will be further entrenched when the draft regulations to the civil service law which endorse them are promulgated 13for all sums from the government budget allo cated to governors there is also ongoing consideration by some donors mainly usaid as to whether funding can be used as an incentive to strengthen links to the centre and encourage good behaviour 234 the reform of the oogs through prr is being coordinated by the iarcsc who have completed reform processes in balkh and hera t have initiated efforts in the other northern provinces of jawzjan and samangan and are curre ntly working in 7 provinces in the central region the experience of reform in the oog in ba lkh is described in box 22 below as with prr in all units the process in the oogs involv restructuring including the development of an organogram and job descriptions appointment of staff on the basis of merit and some capacity building and training the basic agreed structur for the oog as shown below in figure 21 has two major organizational departments under the gove rnor and his deputy the office of the chief of staff and the office of the executive director th office of the executive director is responsible for daytoday operational responsibilities and activ ities of the local administration it has three major divisions sectoral technical services division local government operations division and finance and administrative division there is also separate internal audit office reporting directly to the governor the total civil servi ce staff in the provinces which have completed restructuring is about 54 box 32 reform of th governors of fice balkh recognizing the need for reform in the oogs starting in 1383 the iarcsc and moi worked together for over year to develop new structures and related job descriptions in line with the functions of the governor for grade 1 grade 2 and grade 3 provincial and district governors offices the implementati on of this was piloted through the prr process in balkh jawzjan and samangan provinces and dehdadi district in the northern region reform of the governors office in balkh province grade 1 began in 1384 and is the most advanced of the pilots th process in balkh was facilitated by high level of understanding of and commitment to the reform process by the governor and his old staff and recognition of the need for competent staff meritbased appointment process to fill each position under the new structure was completed in line with the 1384 civil service law it appears that over all meritbased procedures were obser ved as approximately 70 of old staff were deemed unqualified for positions under the new structur prior to the reforms only 2 staff had degrees following the merit based appointments process there are now 21 staff with bachelors degrees and two with masters degrees while there has been extensive review of the impact of the reforms to date overall coordination of development activity seems to have improve d for example database with the prof ile of the province has been established communication between the governors offi ce provincial council line ministries and the centre is also reported to have improved revenue collec tion and transfer back to the center has increased the reform is therefore genera lly considered to have been success howe ver coupled with the more general issues related to the role of the governor highlighted in this repor t there are three issues in the oog reform process that particularly need to be addressed the role of the technical services department tsd establishment of this depa rtment possibly encroaches upon the mandate of subnational li ne ministries although there may be scope for the shortterm establishment of such department until capacity of line ministries is increased further consideration of the structure and mandate of the tsd is required to ensu re that downstream problems between ministries are avoided the lack of retrenchment policy former staff understood the need for qualified personnel but there was great concern as to what would happen to those who we re not qualified under the new structure in the end positions were found for these staff in unreformed nistries in the province however longerterm solution to this issue across the civil service is urgently required capacity of iarcsc regional offices the seven iarcsc regional offices are overstretched as rollout of reform is expanded across the country it will be nece ssary to increase staff numbers to ensure the iarcsc can provide the required support particul arly for provinces with low capacity 14 figure 21 organizational structure of the provincial government administration balkh model executive director chief of staff internal audit provincial governor deputy governor provincial administrative assembly sectoral technical services division local government operations division finance and administrative division 235 the afghanistan stabilisation programme asp national programme which has suffered number of problems since its inception in 1383 has recently been revived and is also working to strengthen the oogs through the prov ision of technical advisors training and facilitation skills the asp has advisors in every pr ovince but is particularly focusing on the four provinces in the south receiving attention from the policy action group pag kandahar helmand uruzgan and zabul the activities of this programme appear to be poorly coordinated although not directly overlapping w ith the activities of the iarcsc 236 the issues surrounding the roles and responsi bilities of the governors offices are some of the most difficult in the afghan subnational system today in addition to their role in provincial planning and interdepartmental coord ination governors are also jure and facto other intimately involved in the daytod ay operational activities of the line departments they signoff on expenditures are involved in most all procurement cisions and have key powers in respect of appointments but they do all this in the absence of an accountability structure which could incentivise service deliv ery or governance performance moreover the flow of additional funds from variety of s ources to the governors offices has the potential to strengthen the tendency of some governors to engage in informal service delivery this runs the risk of establishing parallel service delivery m echanisms at the provincial level with the governors office duplicating the efforts of line ministries and working at cross purposes with them provincial coordination and planning pdcs and pdps 237 provincial development committees pdcs ar emerging across the country as the main coordinating mechanism for velopment activities and planning in november 2005 cabinet decision mandated the establishment of pdcs with the secretariat held by the ministry of the economy this brought some order to c onfused situation in which different coordinating bodies with different names had appeared across the country some with their roots in previously 15established unamasupported provincial coordinati on bodies and others initiated by governors or donors or prts20 238 mrrd and various donors including unama have assisted in forming pdcs and they have now been established in almost all provin ces in different forms particularly where the provincial governor chairs there are indications that they are becoming increasingly effective at least as an information and management coord ination mechanism annex ii provides list of dates of establishment the main actors involve d and their progress in developing pdps the main roles of the pdcs are understood to be21 to coordinate activities of the line ministries to prepare provincial development plans pdps to improve donor coordination to monitor the implementation of development projects and to enhance the capacity of the provincial ad ministration for public service delivery 239 as of april 2007 21 provinces had complete d pdps four had not started and further nine were in the process of developing them however the pdps that have been completed vary considerably in quality and many consist entirely of project wish lists with few attempts at prioritization they also vary normously in their scope and scale the case of the kandahar pdp which requested us 3bn has beco legendary balkh province requested us 970m over 5 years herat has asked for us 284m for 1386 bamian on the other hand only initially requested us5 m other pdps are deliber ately not costed the governor of kapisa for example understands that pdps are not linked to hard budget and therefore sees the kapisa pdp as simply broad priority list to be presente d to donors and the prt for that reason it has not been costed 22 240 the pdp process has now been strong ly linked into the ands process and is being seen as way of ensuring bottomup participa tion in national planning processes however there is lack of agreement between the ands cretariat and the mof about the exact nature of pdps and their usefulness partly to resolve th differences joint technical committee made up of moec mrrd mof and the ands secretariat has been created and to date has met twice its mission includes defining unified vision of the objectiv and financing mechanism for pdps defining mandatory common methodology to be used by all provinces for the preparation of their pdps preparing common format template for submission of pdps to ands and mof 241 number of difficulties surround the pdcs and pdps first much of the motivation and impetus for provincial development planning h as come from donors particularly the prts who are looking for projects to fund quickly to meet political and military as well as shortterm development objectives however as is evidenced from the wide variety of the outputs thus far there is considerable confusion about th nature of pdps how they link to other processes and what they are expected to achieve most importantly pdps to date have not been tied to any budget or resource envelope wh ile there have been increasing calls to make them budget constrained it is not clear what budg et is being referred to nor how helpful this 20 see lister s 2005 caught in confusion local governance structures in afghanistan briefing paper kabulareu and lister s and nixon h 2006 provincial governance structures in afghanistan from confusion to vision briefing paper kabulareu 21 goa provincial budgeting ibid 22 interview with pg kapisa 16prescription can possibly be if pdps are tightly linked to the core budget they become largely meaningless as the core budget is dwarfed by the external budget insofar as development funding is concerned if on the other hand they are linked to the external budget the term constraint becomes little oxymoronic as the external budget by definition is only very loosely constrained and is largely programmed by donors this dilemma is intractable it springs directly from the nature of the afghan budget and aid flows to afgha nistan and an appreciation of its implications is fundamental to developing constructive concept of what pdps should really be 242 second how pdps are meant to be produc ed with respect to bottom up participatory and top down cen tral planning processes is unclear the reality is that pdps have been formulated without much stru ctured connection to bottom up planning processes eg at district level nor is it clear how der current conditions they could or should be and while they are now linked into the ands it remains to be seen how any tensions emanating from this linkage eg disagreement between the ands and one or more pdcs on planning priorities for given provinces will be resolv ed although the goa has committed itself to abolishing parallel planning mechanisms and spite the formation of joint technical commission to look at such issues some of thes issues may be inherently unresolvable within current institutional arrangements 243 third there are many differences between pdcs being established in different provinces the composition of membership varies as does meeting regularity and capacity in some places pc members are invited to attend in others they are not in some places donors and other international actors particularly prts are dom inant but in others they seldom participate if pdcs are given increasing roles in budget approval as the provincial budgeting pilot proposes increasing tensions with the trend towards full mbership of international actors may emerge 244 finally pdcs have few resources to enable them to fulfil their functions the original cabinet decision on their formation specified that pdcs should not have separate budgets or additional staff as they are only coordination mech anism for existing staff however in practice some minimal resources are necessary to enable them to carry out their roles particularly given the weakness of the ministry of economy in the provinces at present they often receive logistical or practical support from the prts and in some places unama is effectively providing the secretariat provincial councils 245 the election of 34 provincial councils w oleyati shuras in september 2005 marked the establishment of afghanistans first elected provinciallevel institutions each council has between nine and 29 members depending on the popul ation of the province across the 34 pcs there are 420 members members ar elected in single provincial constituency meaning that all districts may not be represented on council the election law states that quarter of the seats on pc should be reserved for women each pc elects head deputy and secretary for the period of one year 246 the original law and supporting regulations ascribing their roles gave pcs mainly weak advisory functions and role in provinciallevel development planning revision to the pc law has recently been signed into law by the president which responds to some of the pc demands for greater authority and gives them ove rsight of the provincial administration and its financial resources it remains unclear what this precisely should amount to in practice but there is general acceptance that this involves wi dened role for the pcs in holding both the provincial governors and the provincial depart ments to account for their performance in 17recognition of this pcs have already establishe d monitoring and oversi ght committees in some provinces recent presidential decree also inst ructs provincial governor s to make development plans jointly with the pcs and to ensure that ther is an enabling environment for their activities and implementation of thei r oversight functions 247 the revision to the pc law has increased th mandate of the pcs but knowledge of the revision as well as the recent presidential decree is not widespread within the government and the implications of it are poorly understood there is an understanding in some parts of government that the revised law empowers the pcs to sign off on development budgets including the budgets of each line ministry however senior staff at the mof have not been aware of this to date and it has not been factored into plans for expansion of the provincial budgeting pilot 248 the passing of the revised pc law and issuing of the decree has also been accompanied by an institutional shift whereby pcs now relate to the minister for parliamentary affairs in the office of administrative affairs oaa previously they had split relationship between oaa and moi the president has also expressed desi re to meet regularly with the heads of all pcs the oaa understands that any serious comp laints about the performance of provincial administrations should be brought to the attention of the president 249 substantial capacity and resource constraint s have inhibited the pcs abilities to operate effectively and carry out even their earlier limited mandate in january 2006 all 34 councils noted inadequate working spac and finances among their main problems 23 attempts are now being made to allocate more resour ces to the pcs and their budget allocation has increased from afs 120m to afs 170m or around us 34million this is pparently reduction of the original full allocation of us4m promis ed in the previous year which they did not receive the increase in actual funds however still leaves them relatively few unallocated funds once the members monthly allowances of us400month have been paid the sum available is insufficient for establishing even basic systems and providing transport and other elements which will enable them to fulfill their functions effec tively moreover the budget allocations have been sent to pcs by oaa with standard line item allo cations for expenses and equipment which are almost the same for each council this clearly ne ither reflects the specific needs of the councils and the provinces they ser ve nor makes any adjustment for the size of the council nonetheless it is an improvement on last year that the councils have been informed of the money they have available for operating costs last year ma ny councils neither knew how much money was available nor how to access it 250 while venues and some other basic resources such as furniture were found for the inauguration of the councils in almost all provin ces in most places all resources were initially allocated through the offices of the provincial govern ors over whom the pcs were supposed to be exercising some measure of oversight in ma ny places resources are still provided through oogs but now the situation is bit more mixed 24 in some provinces such as nangarhar bamian and panjshir the pcs continue to use government buildings provided by the governor in other places the pcs have made their own arrange ments in daikundi balkh saripul baghlan kunduz and elsewhere the pcs rent property usin g their limited allocation in parwan the pc made arrangements to purchase land on the und erstanding that the prt would construct building however there are questions about ow nership of the building operating costs and so on transportation is also serious constrai nt for pcs many councils received one or two 23 lister and nixon 2006 ibid 24 the authors are grateful to algap for providing much of this detailed information on the current operation of the pcs 18russian jeeps donated by unopsundp after the elections but many of these were unusable and the councils generally do not have the resources to run them 251 some donors have also provide d limited resources to the pcs aside from logistical and practical support that has been provided by the prts and others the usaidfunded algap project has provided technical assistance to pcs and pc members by organizing regional and national conferences to discuss the issues and shar experiences as well as assisting site visits of pc members within their provinces 25 252 donors are also beginning to provide more assistance although the usaidfunded algap project is closing the national democra tic institute is rolling out programme which will continue to provide training and support to the pcs the undp afghanistan subnational governance program asgp is also planning to work with pcs additionally the usfunded afghans building capacity abc program to be implemented by bearing point could also contribute substantial sums numerous other donors are interested in supporting aspects of the pcs 253 in april 2006 joint governmentdonor working group was established to facilitate policy dialogue and the exchange of information to im prove cooperation in relation to the pcs and to ensure improved coordination between donors it was primarily composed of representatives from oaa moi the ministry of parliamentary affairs mopa and the meshrano jirga and those members of the donor community with support proj ects for the pcs however this ceased to function for various reasons attempts ar now being made to revitalize it 254 despite the severe lack of resources and ba sic systems pcs are beginning to play their roles increasingly ffectively in some places they are particularly active in dispute resolution working to resolve conflicts between government and citizens and between different local powerholders there are also examples of pcs beginning to exercise their oversight function taking up issues with governors and local officials as well as reporting problems to the meshrano jirga small number of councils are ev beginning to work with the mass media including producing newsletters in order to info rm their constituents about important issues 255 research suggests that the actual relations hips between governors and pcs vary from province to province depending on local conditi on and individuals with the security situation also influencing the dynamic between pcs and pr ovincial governments recent work by the asia foundation found that in some places there w as significant degree of conflict between the governor and pc much of it due to the lack of clarity about respective roles and mandates 26 256 the most fundamental point about the pcs is that aside from cdcs they are the only source of bottomup accountability in the subnational system in afghanistan while their role in this area remains limited and they have servicedelivery or administrative functions themselves it is an important one from legal standpoint this role has recently deepened the critical challenge that pcs now face is to expand their resources and capacities in order to ensure that the role now describ ed in law is realized in practice 257 related question concerns their independence the provision of resources through the governors offices and the facto approval right th at pgs have over all pc expenditures greatly curtails their ability to exercise their oversight and accountability role in respect of the oogs to 25 noted in taf 2007 ibid 26 taf ibid 19some extent this has now been rectified with the provision of budgets through oaa and the trend towards pcs arranging their own office accommodati on but these important constraints still need to be properly addressed in addition at the nati onal level there is some disquiet that pcs may now be effectively be subordinat ed to the oaa and this may be an issue that should be addressed in the mediumlong term c the district level district governors district offices and district development assemblies 258 uluswalswoluswals district governors are appointed by the president and represent the ministry of interior at the district level district governors report to the provincial governor and their role is primarily to represent the govern ment at the district level and to coordinate ministry activities they are also responsible for civil registration of births deaths and marriages they may also assist in conflict r esolution through referral to the police or the local shura they do not have primary authority over the district po lice who report primarily to the provincial police chief nonetheless district governors are usually heavily involved in security issues some research suggests that most citizens interacti ons with the district governor are around security issues district governors have limited formal lim ited influence over other civil servants who are responsible to their respective ministries 259 capacity at the woluswal level is extremely weak an estimated 40 percent of woluswals have not completed elementary school and they are generally very poorly resourced 27 although there has been some officebuilding th rough the asp and individual donor and prt initiatives some still have offices many have staff and real operating budget 260 however as with provincial governors district governors often have more actual influence through their own personal relatio nships than they are formally ascribed and district governors have often been observed play ing gatekeeper role between citizens and other authorities moreover woluswals are able to exert control over many activities in their districts and for that reason it is commonly understood that some district governorships are sold since opportunities for benefiting from illegal activities in district can be plentiful this informal power and the opportunities for personal gain appear to have slowed reform efforts at the district level in 2006 when there were plans to submit district governorships to more transparent meritbased recruitment processes th district governors used their connections to various power brokers including the na tional assembly to block reforms 261 staffing for the district offices of the line ministries varies significantly depending on various factors including the size of the distri ct and levels of security mrrd moe moph and maahf are the most commonly represented but these offices are tertiary offices of the central ministries with limited implementa tion responsibilities and individual representatives have little decisionmaking authority in dist ricts where there are education or health representatives personnel in the basic health clin ics and village schools report directly to the provincial departments 262 although mandated in the constitution district council elections have been postponed indefinitely given the many difficulties and costs involved it is very unlikely that there will be any directly elected accountability structure at the district level for the foreseeable future 27 taf 2007 ibid 20263 there has been relatively little government or donor activity to build institutional capacity at the district level the iarcscs plans to roll out reform of the district governors offices have not progressed as originally planned indeed it may be that the agreed structure for district governors offices is rather ambitious and staffheavy given the limited capacity and resources at this level according to the bal kh model the new organizational design includes district executive director ded with three sec tions reporting directly under himher sectoral technical services section local government operations section and an administrative and finance section the asp is also involved in some capacitybuilding and training activities in the district governors offices but only in limited number of districts and provinces 264 some ministries are currently attempting to increase their staff at the district level for example mrrd is placing two social organizer s in every district who will be responsible for facilitating rural development activities in partic ular village and district development planning the moe is also trying to strengthen its district representation 265 the most widespread initiative related to district institutions is mrrds national areabased development programme nabdp which is forming district development assemblies of cdc representatives and facilitating their planning at district level this programme too has experienced delays but as of april 2007 about 156 district development plans ddps had been developed however as discussed above these have not been integrated into other planning processes such as pdp processes moreover the programme is also not always well integrated into the initiatives of other national programmes such as the nsp 266 there are other donorfunded initiatives working at the district level but none of these have national coverage and they do not always work to an agreed in stitutional framework the ecfunded work of gtz on the project for alternative livelihoods in eastern afghanistan is working with asp to build the capacity of the woluswals office howe ver this project only covers 3 provinces jica has also been supporting initiatives in 4 provinces 267 at the district level there is glaring gap in terms of both an agreed overall institutional framework and activities to ei ther create or strengthen such framework while there is some albeit limited consensu s developing on roles and relationships at the provincial and community levels and considerable activities and funding directed towards these levels there is little clear idea of how the district level fits into the overall picture and how best to link communities with provin ces key questions here concern the number of districts and whether there is room for district consolidation their functional role and their future in the context of the trend towards cdc federation see be low in addition some argue that it will never be fiscally sustainable for the state in afgha nistan to maintain substantial presence at the district level and it simply cannot afford so ma ny layers of government others argue that the district level is the only level which can truly ggregate citizen interests and pass them upwards and it is vital that there is capacity at this level what is clear is that the role of the district governor needs to be clarified and better supervision put in place 268 in this situation and given that there is unlik ely to be directly elected body at this level for some time to come it may well be that the most appropriate coordinating fora will be the ddas however it is important that it is clear how such efforts fit into other upward and downward processes and that donors supporting th is initiative are working to an agreed framework 21d the municipal level28 269 municipalities are regulated predominantly by the municipal law of 200029 which creates kabul municipality as an entity with muni cipal status provincial municipalities in each of the provincial capitals and has allowed for the cr eation of in excess of 180 rural municipalities most of which operate without guidance or regula tion with an informal client relationship to nearby provincial municipality the emergence of rural municipalities appears to be related to inadequate and unapplied criteria for their creation30 this factor as well as the differences between jure and facto administration of municipal areas and tensions between the constitution and the municipal law point to th need for establishing clearer criteria for municipal status and legislation governing th status of different sorts of settlement 270 municipalities are responsible for the manage ment of their areas and for the delivery of basic infrastructure and services such as roads drains solid waste collection and disposal sanitation and so on in some cases eg networ ked water supply power they play this role together with state utilities such as the centra l authority for water supply and sanitation while the line ministries deliver the services for which they are responsible education health etc municipalities are meant also to play coordina ting role around service delivery in their areas however both this role and the direct service deliv ery function is made difficult by lack of clarity over functional responsibility in law and the absence of service livery frameworks for this reason and many others insufficient finan ce lack of capacity etc service coverage in municipal areas is low and the quality of service delivery is poor for example only 102 of municipal dwellers have access to piped water 61 of urban dwellers access their homes on unpaved roads and there is primary statepr ovided solid waste collection for 80 of the population in kabul 271 historically municipalities in afghanistan have been selfreliant and are meant to finance their activities through ownsource revenues while this has established important autonomy for municipalities it has also created number of significant problems first municipalities are subject to unfunded mandates wi th existing revenue sources being insufficient to cover the costs of reasonable level of serv ice delivery within their areas thus kabuls budget for 1386 was us 30m for city of 32m or roughly 7capita while that for jalalabad was 25capita these are both far below averages for other cities in the south asia region second the ownsource revenue structure itsel f is very problematic municipalities have proliferated wide range of often illegal taxes nd userfees which are not properly regulated at the centre land sales which are intrinsically unsus tainable have comprised significant share of total income and revenue administration is very weak revenue yield thus significantly lags behind revenue potential moreover notwith standing the commitment to fiscal self sufficiency substantial funds are transferre d to kabul municipality which relies on such transfers for over 40 of its total income in the absence of any clear rulesbased system for distributing central transfers among municipal entities this sort of flow is intrinsically inequitable inefficient and vulnerabl to politicized allocation process 28 most of the material for this and subsequent decisions on the municipalities is drawn from an internal bank report on the municipalities drafted by soraya goga and mihaly kopa nyi june 2007 which contains much more detail on the issues discussed here 29 11 other laws also apply but the m unicipal law is the key one there are number of contradictions between the constitution and the municipal law some of which receive attention below 30 municipal status is granted largely if the core settlement has more than 5000 inhabitants and there is capacity for implementing city master plan article 8 ml though master plan often nonexistent 22272 budgeting accounting and financial man agement at the municipal level are all extremely weak the municipal budget process is subject to confusing number of oversight checks or interference processes on the part of the mof moi and pgs31 and there is seldom much relationship between municipal budgets and actual performance particularly on the revenue side see table 22 accounting systems are poor and systems which allow for adequate control during budget execution eg to manage cash fl ows and working capital are essentially non existent financial and accounts personnel lack the skills necessary to exercise their basic functions table 22 actual and budgeted income million afs city actual income 1383 budget income 1384 actual income 1384 budget income 1385 actual income 1385 kabul 52956 70000 73000 100000 112000 mazar 1087 2536 3978 40600 na jalalabad na 70000 6900 86400 8460 kunduz 2439 5563 2306 6696 na kandahar 12047 36973 11019 23800 na herat na na na 39000 na for first 9 months of 1385 273 the accountability framework governing municipalities is highly problematic the most obvious difficulty is that whereas the constitution calls for the mayors and governing councils of municipalities to be elected such elections have yet been held and both the mayors and the councils are appointed the former by the president the allocation of functions between the mayor and councils is also unclear allocation of functions between the mayor and the councils is regulated by section 17 of the municipal law which suggests that the municipal council is the major governing body and resident institutions are obliged to implement the decision of the council however the section rema ins silent on the role of the mayor legally there is thus clear hierarchy between the mayor and the council defacto however the mayor runs the council he appoints the council members and they serve at his pleasure 274 at lower levels within the municipalities particularly kabul there are mechanisms for allowing for the expression of voice and determining community needs each neighborhood gozar has wakiligozar who is appointed and paid by the municipality as their representative the wakiligozar attends to the local administrative and management requirements of the municipality including registrati on of births and deaths registration of land dispute resolution between neighborhood residents etc they are also the neighborhoods primary link in accessing services including trash collection donor support education health etc primarily through interaction with the district office however there is forum for the development needs to be taken from the district vel to the central level of the municipality for incorporation into the municipalitys broader velopment planning agenda and city planners largely ignore this system of representation except when the municipality requires district officers and the wakils to mediate the impact of plans and property expropriations consequently there is considerable fracture between the two pa rts of what should be considered pyramid of representation and the institutional response to the needs of residents 31 widespread accounts of deep pg involvement in the termination of municipal budge ts were confirmed in the course of discussions with the mayor and muni cipal officials during the field visit to kapisa 23275 recent and older32 project experiences eg the bank funded kabul urban reconstruction project and the eu funded habitat ec 3 5 project have indicated some potential for cdcs and the wakils to coexist with the former playing role as mechanism for needs assessment planning nd monitoring and the latter focusing on management and administration however num ber of issues would need to be resolved including the sustainability of the cdcs themselves the precise nature of the wakil cdc interface particularly around management rol and the fracture between the system for determining community needs and ensuring that these are linked to actual budgetary and planning decisions the village level and cdcs33 276 the malik or arbab34 has been the traditional repre sentative of village to the government and the community point person for dealing with community problems although he can also call upon th help of the village elders shura35 the situation varies considerably in different parts of the country nd even from village to village but in many parts of the country maliks are still the daytoday li nk between the people and district authorities they are officially recognized by local author ities and authorized to refer issues to the government 277 cdcs are local representative bodies established at the village level assisted by facilitating agencies they plan and execute b asic infrastructure projects in sectors such as transport water supply power and education they were introduced as the main vehicles for implementation of the nsp in 2003 and by the nd of december 2006 covered over two thirds of afghanistans estimated 24000 villages across all of the countrys 34 provinces36 table 23 summarizes the position table 23 cdcs as of end december 2006 of community development councils elected 16072 of community development plans completed 15487 of subprojects financed 20038 of cdcs financed 10873 of subprojects completed 8843 total amount of block grants disbursed in us 2495m total amount of block grants committed in us 278m of districts reached by nsp 248 32 the forerunner of the cdcs in afghanistan were the ur ban community fora established by habitat during the taliban regime 33 much of the information for this section was drawn from recent bank report on cdcs authored by asger christensen and asta oelsen 34 the old system of malikarbab was replaced with qaryadar elected representative of people from qarya or village by the 1964 constitution and then the whole syst em was replaced by community based councils by daud khan 197378 however in many places ma liks continue to play impor tant roles and the reality is that most villages have hybrid system of authorities 35 l dupree 1966 aq kupurak town in northern afgha nistan south asia series cited in taf report 36 nsp quarterly report for october 1st to december 31st 2006 mrrd 24 278 second nsp has recently become effective nd intends to cover an additional 4300 communities which together with the target of 176 00 for the first nsp would achieve coverage of 21900 villages comprising 91 of afghanistans estimated total 279 various assessments have been conducted of cdcs some of the main points emerging from these are cdcmanaged projects are significantly cheap er around 30 than for similar projects implemented through conventional processes economic rates of return are ge nerally high little under 40 positive governance impacts have been substa ntial cdcs have generally established legitimacy and increased public faith in the broader afghan government there is also some indication that the presen ce of cdcs correlates with the stabilization of local communities for example schools burning rates appear to be much lower for nspbuilt schools than for regular schools even in the areas where overall schools burning rates are high 280 the average cdc grant under nsp works ou t at between 1733 per capita per annum 37 relative to international comparators this is very high the communesanghat fund in cambodia for example which targets entities quite similar to afghan cdcs funds at the level of about 1capitaannum while the very well known kecamatan development programme in indonesia funds at about 2capitaannum similar projects in east africa come out at between 1 and 3 per capita per annum 281 there are important reasons for the initially high funding levels of the cdcs first the rural infrastructure backlog in afghanistan is partic ularly large second investment at the local level through other channels and modalities has been very limited and has encountered many difficulties third the human settlement pattern in rural afghanistan combined with the way in which cdc boundaries have been drawn means th at each cdc covers on average relatively small population per capita amounts characteristic of other countries would thus yield much smaller amounts at the cdc level making it very difficult to identify projects of size worth funding at cambodian per capita funding levels for example the average cdc in afghanistan would only receive around 1000annum substantia lly less than the average 8500annum that the average cambodian commune recei ves these factors clearly need to be taken into account in thinking through the future of cdcs the key po int here is that at current funding levels the nsp raises fiscal sustainability questions however at levels more in line with international norms the picture changes substantially 282 there have been number of important recent developments concerning cdcs in particular in january this year the president si gned cdc byelaw which gives these entities formal organizational existence over and above their relationship to nsp in terms of this law cdcs may receive funds fro m variety of sources have planning allocation and project implementation powers for their areas and are even given some limited administrative responsibilities in areas such as births and deaths registration 37 cdc report p 7 the 16 to 33 range depends on whether the cdc spends its onceoff location over 1 or 2 years or period in between 25 cdcs are developing relationships with lin ministries to assist with planning and implementation of sector projects eg planning and llocation of schools rehabilitation at the district level with moe38 in some areas of the country through programmes such as th national area based development programme they have begun to federate at the district and cluster level for planning consultation and resource allocation purposes cdcs are also increasingly being established in urban areas where they coordinate their activities with the wakiligozar 283 while additional assessments of the cdc init iative are planned three themes are becoming increasingly clear first while experiences are mixe d and coverage of the country is still incomplete the available data indicates that they have become important vehicles of local service delivery second both from legal viewpoint and by virtue of their developing relations with other organs of governme nt cdcs are in the process of becoming institutionalized and formalized as local governance bodies at the subdistri ct level third they have begun to provide the building blocks for growing the state upwards fr om the community level in general then the argument in favour of expanding and consolidatin g them appears to be powerful one and is gaining ground39 284 however at this juncture cdcs face number of critical challenges the first is that cdcs face an acute existential th reat connected to their funding the nsp provides once off grant to cdcs which may be disbursed in more than one tranche aside from what they may attract from other line departments or donor s on an ad hoc basis and there are strong constraints to this there is other or ongoing funding flow for these entities 40 cdcs thus face very uncertain future unless this challenge is met it is likely that they will weaken and collapse and the social and institutional capita l that has been created will dissipate 285 second there is the question of their role whereas cdcs have shown themselves to be efficient entry points for delivery of public go ods rural infrastructure their suitability as delivery mechanisms for private goods household livelihoods seems more problematic as of now government donors and implementing agencies do not have common view on the roles and functions of cdcs visàvis the provision of public and private goods or with respect to other delivery entities clarification is required to preclude the introduction of conflicting cdc models operating in practice as well as to avoid conflicts with other delivery mechanisms eg with microfinance institutions regarding livery of credit for household investments in livelihoods 286 finally there is the question of their inst itutional mooring within central government to date as result of their association with nsp central responsibilit for cdcs has been assumed by mrrd as they become increasingl detached from the nsp and consolidate as local governance organs in their own right it is not clear whether this should remain the appropriate point of central oversi ght and supervision this issue will need to be addressed in concert with the two raised immediately above 38 nsp district school construc tion and rehabilitation window 39 this sense is based on numerous consul tations and conversations held while c onducting this study and the one which focuses specifically on cdcs which does not imply that ther is consensus on this point while some ministries in goa are clearly in favour of cdcs others appear to be more skeptical at this point 40 from 2007 on about 5500 cdcs will graduate from nsp annua lly and will longer have access to any regular or predictable funding 26f other actors 287 the core governmental structure outlined above is complemented by large cohort of additional servicedelivery and development actors two of these the ngos and prts are particularly important provincial reconstruction teams 41 288 there are currently 25 prts in afghanistan led by 13 different countries 12 by the usa two by germany and one each by new zeala nd lithuania italy canada the uk norway sweden hungary spain the netherlands and turkey42 they are dispersed widely throughout the country covering both secure and insecure are as but tend to be less concentrated in the central and northern areas than elsewhere 289 the role of the prts has attracted much comment and debate the prt mission statement states that prts will assist the islamic republic of afghanistan to extend its authority in order to facilitate the development of stable and secure environment in the identified area of operations and enable security sector reform and reconstruction efforts and the most recent edition of the prt handbook emphasizes that prts play vital role in occupying the vacuum caused by weak government presence and henc deterring agents of instability in other words according to official sources the role of the prts is both widely and diffusely defined it is neither combat nor development institution yet it is civilmilitary institution that is able to penetrate the more unstable and insecure areas because of its military component and is able to stabilize these areas because of the co mbined capabilities of its diplomacy military and economic components 43 this provides substantial latitude for the prts to pursue wide range of activities in the areas in which they operate 290 in this context different prt organizationa l and activity models have developed in different provinces driven by variations in the cond itions they face and different national leadership approaches in essence however prts do two basic developmentrelated things i they provide protective home for bilatera l donor and other government agencies which undertake development programmes and initiatives in the provinces eg usaid and the us department of agriculture in nangarhar dfid in helmand ii under the overall leadership of their commanders prts themselves identify and implement development projects funded from military budgets eg the cerp budget in the case of the usa or occasionally development funds 44 291 it has not been possible to get comprehensive data on prt budgets and activities but an examination of cerp expenditures over the past tw and half years table below indicates the following45 the funding flows are substantial total expenditures for projects completed and under implementation over the period amount to well over 200m 41 prts are examined here from an institutional persp ective as regards their relevance to the subnational system of service delivery and governance other stions such as their impact on humanitarian space and the like have t been considered 42 isaf prt handbook edition 3 february 2007 appendix 3 to annex d 43 ibid p 3 p 5 44 for example the ec funds some governancerelated ac tivities of european prts 45 information extracted from the acsp database at isaf hq 27 the expenditures are distributed over wide range of activities and sectors with fairly high expenditures in areas which are perhap s little unexpected for example while hard sector expenditures are understandably high transportroads and energy at 25 and 17 percent respectively expenditures in the soft sectors are also

rational programming of development initiatives typically us prt commander has discretion over sums of up to 50000month and is unde r substantial pressure to approve projects of at least half of this on monthly basis projects which require larger amounts must be sent up through the chain of command for approval nd the commander has little idea as to the likely success of the application the process thus tends to incentivise the identification and support of multiplicity of smallscale shortterm projects over largerscale bulky initiatives irrespective of the development needs of the province 293 isaf also provides resources which re ancillary but linked to the prts one of the most valuable of these is the afghan country st ability picture acsp gis containing detailed data on development spending project plans and implementation status across the country 294 prts execute their development activiti through institutional modalities which operate outside of and parallel to those of the government while they may consult with provincial or district governors or other local bodies prts ultimately decide on development priorities and projects themselves contract directly with companies to implement these projects 28provide supervision and oversight and so on this inevitably gives rise to range of problems46 first it is obviously difficult to ensure that prt determined priorities are aligned with those of local communities and leaders particularly when th ey may be driven by different imperatives and concerns second development investment may be fruitless if it isnt combined with sufficient recurrent cost funding in nangarhar for example in early 2006 an administration building put up by the prt remained empty and unused months after construction as the government funds for office furnishings powersupply and so on were not forthcoming third however imperfect they may be it is difficult to strengthen the institutional systems of government if they remain unused and underresourced in fact government we akness can become selffulfilling prophecy as skills are attracted away from the government ctor by prt and other agencies seeking to deliver physical outputs finally government accountability for service delivery is attenuated in sum the prts confront fairly typical dilemma but in highly concentrated form foreign aid that bypasses legitimate government can undermine it 47 295 prt leaders are aware of these risks and h ave taken number of steps to manage them these include the production of the third edition of the prt handbook which stresses things like careful processes of outreach 48 esc policy note 1 december 2006 which among other things states that prts are strongly encouraged to coordinate all projects with the pdc link them with provincial requirements and involve the relevant line ministries in all phases of the project support for the development of pdps to provi some way of aligning prt expenditures with priorities as determined by afghan leaders and communities 296 notwithstanding these efforts the core prt dilemma remains and will continue to remain for as long as they retain their current institutional character one way of illustrating this is to pursue metaphor that the prt handbook itself introduces the prt is scaffolding the handbook says it is an interim structure designed to help build up the capacity of the goa to govern and deliver essential servi cesonce that purpose h as been fulfilled its mission is complete and the prt structure can be dismantled the potential difficulty is that while the scaffolding functions as structure onto which an increasing number of things can be loaded precious little attention may be placed on building the wall moreover the problems in attempting shift in focus from scaffold to wa ll may well be aggravated by conventional military practices and culture not least the six or 12 month rotations of military staff which tend to create shortterm time horizon for action institutionbuilding on the other hand is long term process 297 none of this should be taken to imply that there is need for prts or that they should be disbanded overnight but it does suggest that finite measures should be taken both to manage the risks that they present and to move steadily onto an institutional track which makes them increasingly redundant 298 final issue concerns the staffing and skills of the prts again robust data is not available but anecdotal evidence suggests that while some prts have civilian advisors they often do not have great deal of dedicated cap acity in areas such as governance and institutional 46 see alastair mckechnie funding reconstruction and devel opment provincial perspecti ves and the role of prts may 2007 for an expanded discussion of these 47 ibid p 3 48 isaf prt handbook february 2007 p 22 29development there may thus be something of disconnect between some of the expenditure patterns see above and areas of prt comparative advantage nongovernmental organizations 299 ngos in afghanistan have historically held an important role in afghanistan many have been operating for years in areas where ot her agencies have been unable to work in the context of collapsed state they were often the only service providers 2100 there are several coordinating bodies for ngos particularly influential are the afghan coordinating body for afghanistan relief cbar which has been operating since 1988 and now has membership of 94 national and international ngos and the afghan ngo coordination bureau ancb which has membership of 330 afghan ngos 2101 it is difficult to assess the total amount of m oney currently flowing to ngos from different sources and through different cha nnels the only systematic study in recent years estimates that in 1384 ngos received some 450m in grants and contracts with 82 of their activity in the humanitarian and social protection sectors 49 estimates are flawed but the same study argues that this represents 13 of the planne d development budget but if unexpended funds as well as those disbursed to the army demining and the 2005 elections are discounted the percentage rises to 27 of what might be regarded as true development aid that year 2102 it is perhaps more helpful to look at spec ific sectors and examples of ngo involvement to gain an insight into the importance of ngos in the health sector as of may 2006 27 ngos 11 national and 16 international have participated in the contracting system delivering the basic package of health services bphs more than 21 contracts were awar ded to national ngos 27 to ingos and 4 to consortia of international nd national ngos 34 of total funds have been awarded to national ngos and 49 to ingos 50 some estimates suggest that 90 of total health service delivery is carried out by ngos51 by far the largest programme for ngos has be the nsp it is estimated that once the oversight partners fees are discounted in 1384 ngos accounted for the disbursement of around 180m of nsp money52 in 1384 mrrd spent 12m on rural wa ter and sanitation programme 80 of which was contracted through ngos in 1384 usaid spent 80m on an alterna tive livelihoods programme implemented through chemonics of which usaid estimate around 75 was subcontracted to ngos 2103 despite their long history in afghanistan in recent years there has been something of backlash against ngos with populist political figures claiming that ngos are using aid money which should be available to the state and squandering it on extravagant lifestyles this situation was exacerbated by large number of forprofit companies mostly construction companies who had registered as ngos to ta ke advantage of tax and other concessions 49 pounds n 2006 where

brie fing paper kabul areu 51 pounds ibid 52 all figures from 1384 from pounds 302104 in response to the criticism of ngos there have been two major initiatives to clarify the definition and role of ngos in afghanistan as well as improve accountability and transparency firstly legislation was passed in june 2005 which defined an ngo stipulated permissible activities and set criteria for the est ablishment and internal governance of ngos as well as clarifying reporting requirements profitmaking bodies registered as ngos were allowed to reregister as businesses under the new regulations some sources suggest that there are now about 830 registered national and inte rnational ngos operating in afghanistan 53 although others put the figure lower with 189 ingos and 367 local ngos registered54 2105 the second initiative led by the ngo community itself was the development of an ngo code of conduct as selfgoverning mechanis m to ensure commitmen t to transparency accountability and professional standards from all si gnatories as of september 2006 the code had almost one hundred afghan and international signatories55 2106 in addition to the recent improvement in the regulatory environment as the government gains capacity in some areas there are chan ging dynamics between ngos and government agencies for example in the moe leadership there is general trend to try to exercise more control and oversight over the activities of ngos and other communitybased groups the minister has stated that he will try to bring the teachers in the community education project funded by usaid and implemented by ngos onto the moe payroll there are also attempts to make sure that ministry staff are used where po ssible instead of contracting out tasks to ngos recognizing the changing roles of ngos and government the swedish committee of afghanistan sca recently handed over 400 schools to the government and care international is also in the process of handing over most of its schoo ls to the government similarly in the health sector the relative success of service delivery in the sm provinces has strengthened the argument in some quarters that not all delivery tasks should be contracted out to ngos 2107 ngos are and will remain key featu re of the service delivery framework in afghanistan and the government has publicly st ated its continued commitment to working with ngos nevertheless the involvement of ngos in what are still perceived to be state activities eg delivery of health services remain s politically sensitive and many continue to believe that ngos should be and are only tem porarily involved until the government regains the capacity to be direct service provider 53 goa figures cited in united states international gr antmaking country informati on

af ghanistan assistance fift h edition kabul areu 313 the subnational inst itutional structure key features the system 31 the institutional structure described above exhi bits five important features collectively considered these constitute the core of the sub national problem in afghanistan and generate the basic challenges that efforts to st rengthen the system must address 32 first the overall structure is characterized by significant systemic contradiction 56 on the one hand direct formal functional and bu dget authority for the delivery of most key services in the provinces such as education health water and roads is held by highly centralized line ministries which work in ver tically integrated silos with relatively weak externalized linkages between them thus in an organizational sense provincial and district administrations defined as horizontally integrated entities in which different agencies responsible for specific sectors fall under unified point of budget and executive authority do not actually exist in afghanistan what is ofte n referred to as provincial administration is really just the aggregate of the provincial offices of the line ministries ie the provincial departments the provincial gove rnors office the provincial velopment council and the like with hard institutional link between them qually there is such thing as provincial or district budget in the sense of an identifia ble fiscal resource dedicated to expenditures in specific province over which single authority has allocation and execution responsibility there are only aggregations of expenditure which ta ke place for services delivered at the provincial level eg by the provincial departments which the central line ministries largely control and which cannot even accurately be captured by the existing accounting systems 57 33 on the other hand this highly centralized lin ministry system coexists with and is cut across by the provincial governor system which allows the pgs to intervene in the affairs of the line ministries and other agencies eg the municipalities through six softer institutional channels some legislated some not first as mentioned earlier pgs hold extensive powers over the appointments of civil servants to departmental positions in their provinces second they are able to influence the daytoday activities of th civil servants simply by virtue of being proximate to them in fact this power is being extended in number of provinces as oogs undergo prr reform gain increasing capacity in t echnical areas and consolidate their influence through fora such as the provincial administrativ assemblies where they formally bring heads of provincial departments together in order to ma ke joint decisions on operational matters such as financing priorities and procurement third in so cases they have been able to gain effective influence over funds which allow them to build infrastructure in areas for which line ministries are responsible eg directly through the governors discretionary fund now winding down and directly through their influence over prts in their provinces 58 fourth they hold approval powers for all expenditures of all the pds f unded from the core budget which power underlies the other powers they exercise eg on pd procurements through the administrative assemblies 56 the focus here is on the contradictions between sy stems internal to the government structure at the sub national level there are also contradictions between donor allocation and implementation systems and those of the government which are wellknown and are not necessarily specific to the subnational level those which are most germane to subnational servi ce delivery and governance eg the prts receive attention at various other points in this report 57 mof interviews 58 see rubin 2007 32fifth they are able to exercise varying degrees of control over municipal budgets59 finally these formal and informal avenues of influence all exist within and are reinforced by an overall institutional culture which accords to the provincia l governors central and senior position in the political structure of the country and which tends to defer to the inheritance of existing practices even when such practices are longer consona nt with institutional developments so for example during the period in which actual lotments to provincial departments were significantly less than those budgeted there may have been legitimate role for pgs in the area of expenditure authorization after all someone had to ration the cash this problem was solved some two years ago and the basis for the practice thus disappeared but there has been real initiative to review or curtail it 34 the main problem this overall system creates is that centralized modalities of service delivery are combined with and subject to range of interventionist powers on the part of the pgs in way which blurs and undermin accountability and introduces significant organizational inefficiencies governors are political appointees of the president they have formal responsibilities or budgets for servicedeliver in the province have institutionalized links downward to citizens or consumers for serv ices and thus cannot be held accountable for them yet they are able significantly to influe nce the way in which the chief servicedelivery agencies the line departments and the municipa lities operate and function while there are undoubtedly some good governors who will exer cise this influence benignly given the accountability structure outlined above pg ins titutional incentives are unlikely to derive consistently from imperatives to improve servi cedelivery and it is thus unlikely that these interventions will be conducive to that purpose in aggregate moreover the simple fact that an external agency is able to become involved bot h in highlevel decisionmaking such as senior appointments and in the daytoday operations such as expenditure approvals of the activities of the pds is not conducive to operational efficiency on the ground and provides strong disincentive to the ministries and their officers to seek improvements in this area there is little point in doing so if such improvements can easily be overridden by governor actions finally it is worth noting that number of ongoing initiatives may well aggravate rather than ameliorate this problem the prr process underway in balkh and other provinces is aimed at making the pgs more effective and improving the capacities of their offices unless these actions are carefully targeted they may thus unwittingly also strengthen pg ability to interfere unhelpfully at the operational level 35 second even given the choice of centralized governance and servicedelivery intergovernmental structure for afghanistan ex isting institutional arrangements are often highly inefficient in particular line ministries tend to be overcentralized with their central offices in kabul retaining functions which could much more efficiently be performed at the provincial level teacher recruitment in the case of education for example to some extent this problem is not unrelated to the one discussed above so long as line ministries perceive that any significant deconcentration of budget or functiona l authority to their provincial departments is likely only to make these authorities subject to influence and capture by the provincial governors they are unlikely to have much incentive to do so 36 third the current system is both asymmetric and inequitable institutional asymmetries in intergovernmental institutional rrangements are not uncommon internationally of course and are not intrinsically problematic it all depends on why they exist and how they 59 research conducted by the asia f oundation in course of their recent ssessment of subnational governance indicates that in some provinces the pr ovincial governor plays central role in determining the budgets of the larger municipalities 33affect the intergovernmental system as it evolves in afghanistans case it is fair to say that while some of these appear to make sense others ar the result of arbitrary processes connected with history varying donor practices and the like rather than considered design choices the models of the provincial governors offices that are being implemented in the pag provinces for example are rather different from those in ba lkh and herat resulting in higher degrees of governor influence in these provinces and it is not at all clear why ultimately these are likely to introduce significant strains and tensions at the sn level as the system consolidates and attempts to cohere 37 the inequitable distribution of resources acro ss subnational jurisdictions presents more obvious and more pressing set of difficulties some preliminary work conducted within the ministry of finance provides sense of the magnitude of these the following table gives breakdown of the per capita budget allotments nd yeartodate expenditures as of november 2006 for health and education in each province as well as the totals per for all

were deliberately chosen because while one might expect significant variations in per capita expenditu res between provinces for ministries such as agriculture or rural developmen t where differing spatial and ec onomic realities might rationally drive differing expenditure levels for hea lth and education roughly equal per capita expenditures61 will tend to indicate equitable distributions of expenditure across provinces this is particularly so where ministry such as ducation has made the provision of equal access to quality education by all an explicit policy objective62 39 in afghanistan this is not the case for in stance the budget allotment figure for health for the province of panjsher is nearly twenty times that of sar i pul similarly the budget allotment for education is six times greater for paktika than for daikundi nor do these magnitudes represent an outlier pattern with fe w provinces deviating strongly from the mean the coefficients of variation for budgetary allo cation for health and education are 95 and 39 respectively for ytd figures 84 and 44 resp ectively this indicates that the per capita expenditures in health and education differ wide ly and consistently between provinces and cannot be accounted for by physical and other conditions that might cause input costs in different 61 discounting for the impact of factors wh ich might affect the costs of delivery equal service levels which in some provinces such as badakhshan may be significant 62 education sector strategy for the ands p 1 march 2007 35provinces to vary particularly where salaries which constitute large proportion of these costs are not governed by market factors these inequa lities are also large relative to other countries even those with intergovernmen tal structures similar to those of afghanistan in laos for example which is generally recognized to ffer from large horizontal fiscal inequities between provinces the coefficients of variation for per capita expenditure on health and education were 40 and 38 respectively in 20030463 310 in other environments limited degree of variation in per capita expenditure on health and education would not necessarily be regarded as problematic part of the rationale for increasing the autonomy of subnational entities is th at efficiencies arise when they are able to allocate their expenditures in line with varying local priorities afghanistan however does not possess strong subnational governance mechanis ms for citizen voice thus expenditure variations are unlikely to reflect local preferenc and so do not contribute to allocative efficiency at the subnational level 311 finally it should also be mentioned that th problems are aggravated by the fact that size composition and regional distribution of signi ficant fractions of the external budget which comprises about 70 of total public sector expenditure in afghanistan is largely unknown it is thus impossible to begin to distribute these expenditures in line with equity imperatives 312 fourth the most autonomous elements of the sn system the municipalities and cdcs face issues of their own municipalities have been established under law as important and selfsufficient local servicedelivery and governance entities community development councils were established as community level infr astructuredelivery vehicles in rural areas under the nsp and have since become increasingly in stitutionalized to the point where they have begun to emerge as the facto lowest level of local governance in afghanistan common feature of these entities which distinguishes them from entities at the provincial level is that in principle the elected authority in the municipal or community area is itself directly responsible for servicedelivery in that area in other words in structural sense these entities are largely devolved local governments or in the case of cdcs something approaching this and do not suffer from the accountability and autonomy problems characteristic of the other organs of sub national government in afghanistan 313 on the other hand they confront significan t issues of their own municipal council elections have yet to occur and until they ar held the potential of municipalities to deliver accountable local government in their areas will be hi ghly circumscribed in addition the fiscal and functional framework governing them is bot h unclear and constraining of effective and efficient service delivery cdcs face existe ntial questions derived from the possible discontinuation of the funding which provides th em with the basic wherewithal to play meaningful role moreover the level and scale at which they operate means that the roles that they play and the issues they face are very different from those of higher level bodies these challenges are discussed in greater detail later fo r the moment the important point is that the main issues cdcs and municipalities face are diffe rent in complexion to those at the provincial level and need to be addressed in their own right 314 finally like the rest of the afghan state th entire sn structure is afflicted by the sorts of problems which are characteristic of licus countries severe human resource weaknesses an absence of properly functioning ope rational systems shortages of equipment and 63 the centrallocal fiscal system in lao preliminary assessment roland white and jorge martinez world bank march 2006 36sparse supporting infrastructure such as electrical power and phone systems necessary to get things functioning properly af ghanistan is particularly badly affected by these and reform and strengthening of the sn system will be less affected by them than any other significant institutional reform in the society b the reform environment 315 the environment within which efforts to ddress the above problems unfolds generates both imperatives and parameters for action the introduction has already touched on some of the former three factors are of particular importance in respect of the latter 316 the first is constitutional dispensation and political climate which precludes any significant reform to the underlying intergovernmental structure in the short or medium term the constitution refers to preserving the prin ciples of centralism and it is also clear that the dominant consensus within th current political establishment is committed to the current jure centralized intergovernmental structur and has appetite for substantial political devolution to subnational levels 64 this is fundamental point of departure for the discussion on reform paths which follows 317 second there is weak oversight of the sn system at the central level number of ministries have overlapping responsibilities for the various subnational organs moi and moudh in respect of municipalities for exampl and capacity to provide monitoring and management of any given aspect of the subnationa l system is poor in addition the ministries which are active at the sn level exhibit high degrees of bureaucratic and political rivalry making it difficult to forge common overarching reform perspectives or to establish agreement on important reform initiatives reform and strengt hening measures may thus well need to proceed in focused disaggregated and partial way rather than as part of holistic comprehensive reform with wide crossgovernment support 318 third although substantial progress has recently b een made in trying to get greater alignment between donor activities which impa ct the sn level donor initiatives remain weakly coordinated the very extensive funding which flows to subnational initiatives through channels and modalities which lie out side of government systems compounds this problem in addition unlike many other countries wh ere the subnational is an important issue and consumes significant donor time and funding there is joint donor forum in afghanistan which focuses specifically on this problem and attempts to align donor resources across the broad range of research analysis policy formulation institution reform and capacitybuilding activities which are necessary if subnational systems are to be solidly built 65 64 see rubin b 2006 for discussion of the dynamics underlying this 65 such fora can be found in countries as diverse as uganda cambodia and indonesia 374 addressing the subnational challenge strategic framework 41 the iands places three core pillars at the centre of the governments overall poverty reduction strategy security governance and developmen t it has become increasingly clear that if progress is to be made on these fronts two cro sscutting public sector themes need consistently to be dealt with service delivery and institutiona l capacity these are related sustained service delivery is not possible without stronger public sector institutions and servicedelivery activities provide the catalyzing processes through which such institutions can be strengthened 42 against this general backdrop the assessment given above suggests that at the sub national level four broad challenges need to be addressed if service delivery and governance are to be improved the strategic framework proposed here focuses on these later the report suggests range of concrete in itiatives directed at specific subnational organs all of which contribute in some way to addressing one or more of these challenges 43 it is important to stress that given the reform environment discussed above the basic thrust or intent of any sn strategy must be to improve the functioning of the current system rather than to restructure it true this structure has intrinsic weaknesses from both servicedelivery and governance perspectives st rongly jure centralized state in large poorly linked country with relatively thinly spread population mainly rural but rapidly urbanizing inevitably confronts problems with regard both to organizational efficiency and accountability it also imposes strong constraint s on coordination and integration between different agencies however notwithstanding th difficulties the emerging structure allows for improved performance in respect both of accounta bility and effectivenessefficiency with appropriately focused reforms such intrastructural reform efforts need to be designed with two sorts of impact in mind first they need to strengthen specific elements of the system organizational impacts second they need to sure that the functionality of the system as whole improves systemic impacts again these are related specific elements of the system cannot function optimally if the system as whole does not improve eg if increasing discretion is deconcentrated from the centre to provincial offi ces within line depts increasing scrutiny of the activities of these departments is required at the provincial level conversely the system as whole cannot function if its par ticular elements remain weak 44 challengeactivity area 1 establish an overall direction for reform of the sn institutional system which while building on th current one diminishes the existing levels of systemic contradiction and begins to reduce th unproductively mixed character of current arrangements this direction should be based on the br oad allocation of roles and responsibilities outlined in figure 41 and the accompanying explan atory text among other things this suggests two particularly important orienta tions for reform first in order to reduce the current levels of systemic contradiction it is important to strengt hen and consolidate the role of the office of the provincial governor in the areas of coordinati on and planning while limiting it with respect to the exercise of functional budget and operational authority in the delivery of main services which fall under the provincial line departments s econd in order to enhance accountability it involves strengthening the oversight and supervis ory role of the pcs to provide checks and balances over the activities of the delivery agencies 38figure 41 roles and responsibilities of subna tional institutions proposed

exist ing institutional processes and fiduciary mechanisms within the line departments and the mustofiat at the provincial level municipalities and cdcs ¾ coordination of the activities of the provinc ial line departments and provincial planning is the core responsibility of the provincial governors in and through the institutions which fall under his jurisdiction eg provincial adminstration assemblie s or over which he presides eg the pdcs given that budget functional and operational authority lie with the line ministriesdepartments the lateral coordinat ion links will be institutionally soft ra ther than hard in character noneth eless they are important and the provincele vel planning and coordination function needs to be strengthened by properly resourcing the k ey organizations which are responsible for it particularly the provincial governors offi ces and the pdcs at lower levels cdcs and municipalities have planning responsibility for their areas fede rations or alliances of cdcs may be able to play planning role at the district level eg through the na tional area based programme initiative ¾ conflict resolution is dealt with by combination of bodies mainly pcs cdcs and the district governor depending on the type and scale of the conflict these bodies need to be resour ced to be able to play this role more effectively 3945 it is important to stress however that these are suggested as broad orientations to guide process of ongoing activity there is expectatio n that in country characterized by weak central state ethnic complexity an attenuated nd dispersed settlement pattern and history of political decentralization specific steps in furthera nce of these directions will be easily agreed or implemented moreover as pointed out elsewhere it appears that some of the current reform efforts cut against rather than in favour of th is overall orientation however without some movement in this direction the servicedelivery pparatus that is currently being built and which has achieved some apparent recent success is lik ely to run into increasing operational difficulties and the forward movement that has been estab lished in number of areas may be jeopardized 46 challengeactivity area 2 the second major reform area is to focus on strengthening the performance of the main servicedelivery agencies through improving their organizational structures one key crosscutting activity in this ar ea is for line ministries to ensure that functions are divided between their central offices and the provincial departments in order to improve their organizational efficiency in number of cases this is likely to involve the deconcentration of various powers and functions of the line ministry from central to provincial department level in fact in some cases this is already underway moe for example is currently in the process of deconcen trating teacher recruitment to the provincial level the rate and pace of such deconcentration will be determ ined among other things by capacity constraints but it should also be recognized that in the ab sence of functional deconcentration capacity at the subnational level will not built ultima tely functional deconcentration drives capacity building not the other way round 47 four important observations may be made he re first the current prrpar process is directly relevant new phase of par is currently being planned in terms of which number of affected ministries have to develop new propo sed organizational structure which will provide the basis for staffing plan for those ministries active at the provincial level one key decision that will need to be made as part of this planning process concerns the division of functions between central and provincial offices as propo sed below this process should be used as an opportunity to ensure that more organizati onally efficient structures emerge second notwithstanding this point any deconcentration process should be crafted flexibly enough to allow different ministries to implement the serv icedelivery models which are most conductive to success in their areas for example whereas d econcentration may be of significant benefit to moe which relies on delivery model based largel on direct delivery via the state the same may not be as true of moph which relies on contracting out to ngos and where centralized contracting authority could remain of importanc third ministries could consider asymmetric approaches mrrd for example has deconcentr ated significant functions procurement for example to its provincial office in one province kandahar an experiment which appears to be going well 66 other ministries could similarly pilot deconcentration in this manner fourth challenge 2 must be addressed in the context of cha llenge 1 in other words the extent to which line ministries deconcentrate to provincial depart ments will need to be moderated by the degree to which this risks the capture of departments by provincial governors there is little point in trying to improve organizational efficiency throu gh vertical deconcentration if this makes the delivery agencies more vulnerable to the exercise of horizontal power which inhibits operational effectiveness the centralprovincial dimensions of the restructuring of the line ministries under par will clearly need to be carefully considered 66 interview with minister rrd 052007 4048 finally it is important to note that this ch allengeactivity area relates as much to the municipalities as it does to the provincial departments67 as the municipal report points out the organizational structures of municipalities are fundame ntally problematic and in need of reform however municipalities are not subject to par so alternative initiatives will be necessary in this area 49 challengeactivity area 3 the third major challenge is to provide sufficient resources for the key organs of sn governance and servicede livery to play their ascribed roles for example as is pointed out later cdcs face fundamen tal threat as their access to funding under nsp is due to terminate and without the funds necessary for their development activities they will wither and die establishing modest annual fiscal transfer for these entities is thus necessary condition of their continued existence 410 similar issues arise with respect to other elem ents of the sn structure at the provincial level organs such as the pcs need to gain acc ess to sufficient funds to allow them to conduct their operations as envisaged under the recently ame nded law while at municipal level an overall fiscal framework which provides rational equita ble and affordable solution to the fiscal gap they face needs to be developed number of efforts will be needed to address these different needs 411 further dimension of the fiscal resource issue is moving towards more equitable distribution of fiscal res ources across the country the specific conditions of afghanistan make this uniquely difficult there is an understandable tendency to concentrate expenditures in those areas which are most vulnerable to security th reats and the large offbudget flows prt funding and the like distort distributional outcomes what ever efforts are made in respect of the core budget arguably too this is second genera tion issue which can only really be addressed once greater stability and predictability is established in ve rtical and sectoral flows but it is ultimately an important question which should not be neglected indefinitely 412 challengeactivity area 4 the final challenge is to enhance the operational performance of all of the various organs at th subnational level through providing them with the systems and capacities that they require in some areas eg some oogs substantial progress is being made in others the provincial co uncils it has really only just begun needs obviously vary across organizations but certain generic themes can be identified training is one it offices and communications systems are ot hers moreover it should be possible to handle some of these needs on modular basis i to define pack age of basic needs equipment for provincial councils for example nd to roll this out to pcs across the country fairly efficiently as with the three challenge areas above specific proposals in this area are made in the section below b specific activities 413 in order to address these challenges wide range of concrete initiatives will need to be undertaken this section makes proposals for these with reference to each of the main organs of subnational service delivery and governance some of these proposals are new but many leverage off activities which are already in place or are planned the matrix in annex i categorises the proposed initiatives in each of the four general challengeactivity areas identified under the strategic framework outlined above it also provides some incomplete reference to activities that are already underway and some summary comment on what is needed thus 67 districts are part of provincial departme nts so are not separately considered 41outlining rough and provisional gap analysis as basis for future discussion and dialogue with the government and donor communities68 it should be stressed that the proposals made here cover wide area and there is expectation that they will or should all be embarked on at once rather incremental movement will be required on as many fronts as is feasible at any given time provincial line departments 414 broadly speaking provincial line departme nts are overcentralized suffer too much interference from provincial governors in thei r daytoday operational activities and are undercapacitated their performance needs to be im proved through combination of capacity development and reorganisation with specific reference to the division of powers and functions between central and provincial offices in order to enhance efficiency this needs to be designed and implemented as appropria to the servicedelivery model prevailing in each specific sector in general however it is likely to involve both vertical intraministry deconcentration and increasing operational auto nomy from provincial governor offices at the horizontal level ministries which demonstrate willingness to pursue reform in this overall direction should receive concentrated support more specifically crosscutting par reforms should be accelerated at the subnational level with appropriate coordination with the development of the capacity development plan for the common functions 69 ministries formulating restructuring plans under par particularly the new phases should explicitly address the division of powers and functions between central and lower levels in areas such as budgeting and expenditure authority including procurement and contracts and facilities suppl planning hr recruitment deployment and management and facilities management in order to sure crossministry learning and smooth implementation the ability of both iarcsc nd line ministries to engage with each other must be increased b reform implementation and management units rimu should continue to be established to manage and oversee ministerial reforms alt hough care should be taken that rimus do not become large structure parallel to the civil service and substitute for sustainable capacity development of staff in line positions c the provincial budgeting process should be deepened and expanded with the proposed expansion in numbers of ministries and provinces as well as management at the local level of goods and services and asset acquisition allocations as planned d other pfm reforms at the subnational level should be continued and expanded to ensure strengthened oversight and monitoring role for the mof if the adb does not continue its current funding for mustoufiat reform after ma 2008 then an alternative donor should be found 68 the list of existing activities is partial and is based only on information that the authors were able to collect during the time available to them it ne eds to be expanded and improved 69 see goa capacity development plan for the civil servic in afghanistan draft paper produced for the adf april 2007 42offices of the governors 415 oogs are defined by simultaneous ability to become deeply involved in the affairs of the servicedelivery agencies in the provinces and lack of any structured accountability for the performance of those agencies the core reform initiatives here thus need to focus on consolidating the role and capacity of the oogs for coordination and planning at the inter departmental level while reducing their incentive and ability to become involved in the operational functions and activities of the line agencies given the historical and political context and the important role that governors curren tly play in provincial ffairs change in this area is likely to be slow and incremental ho wever the proposed initiatives are closely in line with the goas own identified areas for reform70 regulatory reform is needed to ensure cons istency between the powers given to different institutions at the provincial level so that line departments are able to operate effectively for example the signoff powers of the governor on line department expenditures should be eliminated or at least reduced in time re vised local government law see below should clarify the coordination role of the oogs at the interdepartmental level while reducing the scope for their involvement in intradepartmental matters other laws such as procurement civil service laws and so on as well as par guidelines and iarcsc initiatives should again over time be amended in line w ith this overall institutional direction b in order to avoid conflicting with the mandate of line ministries donors should not make substantial sums available to provin cial governors for service delivery activities c the capacity of governors to play coordina tion and development planning role in line with the overall institutional framework should be strengthened through the continued roll out of reform of the oogs through the par process it is important that the specifics of the models being implemented and the capacity provided is reviewed in order to ensure that the oogs are not being built and supported in manne r which encourages and allows for their deepened involvement in intrade partmental activity particularly at the operational level for example the core need of governors is for or ganizational infrastructure and some technical support on planning and other issues and they do not need technical sector specialists to become involved in line department functions d in this context an indepth review of the balkh experience should be carried out and the actual impact on institutional issues at the provincial level should be assessed provincial coordination and pl anning pdcspaas and pdps 416 in the current institutional structure pdcs and paas are the only fora where cross sectoral coordination and provincewide development planning can take place pdcs are also developing an important role in the mof provincial budgeting initiative participating in the formulation of budgets however practices va ry widely across the country and capacity is generally weak particularly as pdcs are s upported by weak ministry while pdps are emerging as central to the planning process at the pr ovincial level there remains need to clarify exactly what pdps are and can achieve and to manage expectations around the process specifically 70 see page 21 of goa provincial deve lopment provincial budgeting and inte gration of the provincial development plans into the afghan national devel opment strategy ands draft disc ussion paper for the adf april 2007 43a the pdcs need to be given sufficient support to play their mandated role in development planning and budgeting according to the overall ins titutional framework this mainly requires support in basic systems and organizational infrastructure as well as institutionalization of internal practices throug h the development of standard practices and manuals and so on donors over time shoul d withdraw from providing the secretariat function to the pdcs b the role of the moec is matter for the government to decide but assuming that it has continued role in planning then it is importa nt that it should be supported to fulfil this function rather than constantly circumvented as is currently the case c the relative roles of the paa and pdcs should be reviewed as there is currently the potential for overlap and duplication of effort the paa under the leadership of the governor could have stronger reporting role to centr government on provincial affairs d the active and direct participation of the governors in the pdcs needs to be strengthened through provision of appropriate support and by strong encouragement from the office of the president over time the secretariat and suppor t function for the pdcs could be moved away from central ministry into the governors offices to cement this participation although this not priority reform given the problems with linking pdps directly to resources or institutional action within the existing framework pdps should be seen less as costed plans and more as strategic documents giving some sense of priority issues to guide line ministry and donor decision making in the provinces pdp processes should th erefore be supported with due regard to their limitations and what is likely to come out of them it is also important that information about what the pdps can and cannot achieve is widely disseminated to ensure that expectations are lowered provincial councils 417 the key role of the pcs is to exercise an accountability function in fact aside from cdcs they are currently the only source of bottomup accountability in the subnational system in afghanistan the recent revision of the lega l framework has strengthened the scope of the pcs mandate considerably and this mandate w ill increase in importance as and when the line ministries deconcentrate however there are si gnificant constraints both financial and capacity related to their ability to exercise this mandate effectively two types of initiatives are needed those that clarify and inform all actors about their roles and those that provide the resources and capacity to ensure that they can play these roles properly ensure widespread dissemination of and training to both councils government bodies and other subnational actors on the roles of the councils as laid out in the revised law b clarify the mechanisms by which the pcs can exercise their oversight role and act on problems that they identify there is for exam ple currently confusion about whether they should report issues to the governor or to the president through oaa c to strengthen the accountability function clarify with all actors the role of pcs in providing qualified signoff on budgets formulated by pdcs 44d provide substantially more resources for in ternal systems and institutional development also it infrastructure transport and so on to sure improved coordination in this reestablish the joint governmentdonor technical working group on provincial councils ensuring some means of pc input to it enable councils to link up with government and other for example prt data sources to enable improved monitoring and oversight f in the mediumlong term assess whether the cu rrent institutional location under the oaa allows the proper development of th councils as independent bodies district level 418 there is gap at the district level in terms of both an agreed overall institutional framework and activities to strengthen existing instit utions the reform of the offices of district governors has not proceeded as planned under the prr initiative it is also unlikely that there will be any directly elected bodies at this level in the medium term the appropriate structures and roles at the district level is topic for decision by the proposed interministerial commission see below in the absence of an agreed framework limited reform at this level is possible district offices of line ministries should be included in intraministry deconcentration initiatives b it is not clear that the district governor ffices should be extensively strengthened in terms of staff numbers given their limited role the large numbers of districts and limited resources however it is important to ensure that district governors are appointed in transparent manner and are held accountable for their actions this will require reform at the moi as well as discussion with the national assembly c donors funding programmes operating at the district level and attempting to build institutions should ensure that they are establishi ng consistent structures across the country impromptu donor initiatives at the district leve l in the absence of wider institutional framework should be avoided d promote district level planning and servicedelivery processes as they begin to develop for example through nabdp but ensure that planning at this level is kept relatively simple with clear links both upwards and downwards municipalities 419 the municipal system faces challenges in number of key areas the rules and criteria governing their establishment the frameworks governing their servicedelivery functions financing budgeting and financial manageme nt their accountability framework and their relationship to cdcs these could begin to be addressed through number of broad measures enact new legislation providing clearer categorization of the different sorts of administration which should be created in order to manage different sorts of settlement and clarifying the resources consequences and claims of these eg what human resource and funding frameworks should pertain in each case and so on 45b clarify the functional roles expenditure assignments and frameworks governing service delivery for municipalities c formulate comprehensive financing framework for municipalities which rationalizes and improves ownsource revenue assignments and clarifies municipal authorities over base and rate setting in respect of these introduces measures to strengthen municipal revenue administration and establishes transparent rul esbased system to allocate central transfers equitably and rationally among municipal jurisdictions d develop improved budgeting financial management and accounting systems and institute measures to build capacity to administer th systems within municipal administrations introduce elections for mayors and municipal councils at the earliest feasible opportunity f develop institutional measures to deal with the cdcwakil interface and to bridge the current gap between the bottomup system for expression of community voice and need and planning and budget decisionmaking community development councils 420 cdcs face three basic challenges an existential threat deriving from the potential drying up of their funding as nsp terminates more robust definition of their role and the question of which agency at the centre takes ownership and responsibility for them as they develop an institutional existence outside of the nsp in order to address these the following steps should be taken cdcs need to secure regular and reliable funding flow to resource the local level development activities which provide their raison detre the primary initiative here should be to establish dedicated fiscal transfer m echanism which gives them source of ongoing funding which they can then allocate to local projects at their discretion this should be distributed horizontally between cdcs according to simple and transparent formula given international standards and in order to make th is sustainable the funding level should be set substantially lower on per capita or per cdc b asis than that under the nsp while donor operation underpinned by multiyear commitment from more than one donor source will probably be necessary to put this system into place the transfer should ultimately form an integral part of the intergovernmental fiscal framework in afghanistan secondary initiative equally important in the short term should be to seek opportunities for steering funding which is meant to be dedicated to suppor t sectorspecific invest ments at the local or community level via cdcs or federations of cdcs the artf funded rural water supply and sanitation initiative is good example as are some of the projects taking place under the nabdp initiative such opportuniti should be deepened and expanded b as far as cdcs roles are concerned these shoul d be consolidated on the basis of the new byelaw ie i allocation of their own funding and planning and implementation of local projects using this funding with similar role being played in respect of sectorearmarked funds ii limited administration role particularly in the areas of civil registration eg births and deaths registers and land verificati on iii planning and allocation at the district or subdistrict level where cdcs are able to federate or cluster and iv providing information on servicedelivery and governan ce to pcs to assist them with their accountability function insofar as the parameters of their role are concerned cdcs should broadly take on public goods pr ovision functions and should not become involved in 46activities such as the selection of individual microfinance beneficiaries or livelihood assistance as this would entail risks of conflict of interest nepotism and corruption finally it is important that cdcs do not become res ponsible for the governance and management of local servicedelivery units such as schools in competition with bodies such as schools management committees which have been specifi cally set up for this purpose the allocation of general cdc resources to specific schools with in their areas would of course be another matter here cdcs have legitimate role c the matter of ownership of cdcs at the centr level will of course have to be settled within the central government by those agenci and ministries which have core interest in this question it would be premature to make sustantive proposal on this question but as matter of procedure the best way forward woul d probably to have this issue specifically flagged as one of the questions that the in terministerial committee proposed below should look into and decide provincial reconstruction teams 421 prts confront in fact they constitute critical dilemma in trying to create the space for the afghan state to develop and cohere they run the risk of undermining it number of steps may be identified in order to address this risk and ensure to employ the earlier metaphor that the scaffolding they represent does not substitu for the wall they are trying to support scale down prt activities in relatively secure areas and begin to route the resulting resources through government systems and budgets prts should really only exist where security conditions make them absolutely necessar the esc should undertake review of prt establishments in terms of this criterion and begin to phase them out or rightsize them accordingly diverting the resource yield to s upporting government ins titutions and onbudget projects and initiatives b each prt commander should develop conditionbased plan for phasing hisher prt out given that prts are interim structures which have their own demise as their core objective 71 each prt should formulate description of the concrete conditions wh ich would make the realization of this objective possible key indicators of these conditions and plan for how they are to be achieved these plans should be subject to scrutiny and oversight of the prt esc which should stipulate standard format and timetable for their production and should monitor progress against it c prts should begin to move away from small scale communitylevel projects and initiatives where the conflicts between local prioriti zation and governance and topdown prt processes are likely to be most pronounced except where there may be need for initiatives directly related to kinetic operations instead the ce rp budget and other such resources should be focused increasingly on larger scale bulk and li nk infrastructure where the need is obvious and processconflicts are likely to be much fewer rehabilitation and surfacing of major roads is good example here as is the rehab ilitation of water supply and drainage systems the budget and approval processes for cerp and other such funds would need to be revised to be conducive to this d insofar as prts continue to provide resources outside of the government budget they need ensure maximum alignment with it this involves producing accurate and timely information 71 isaf prt handbook edition 3 p 5 47on project costs and details and ensuring that government inputs are accurately costed particularly salary and operating costs once the project is completed at more general level prts should begin to provide regular aggregra budget and expenditure information on their development activities countrywide specifica lly the esc should provide detailed annual report with semiannual update to goa on these matters finally the esc should issue policy discour aging the poaching of government staff and provision of salary topups an overall orientation supporting local institutions and people to learn by dong even at cost in time and quality should be encouraged and prts should minimize the actions which push in the opposite direction c procedural steps 422 the strategic framework and activities outlined above provide an agenda for strengthening the sn system in afghanistan so far as the authors of this report are aware this is the first time that proposal which focuses comprehensively on the overall system and the institutional arrangements which comprise it has been made it is thus best seen as basis for stimulating dialogue and discussion within the government and donor communities 423 the matrix in annex i summarizes the main elements of this proposal with reference to some of the key activities already underway 72 in doing so it begins to point to areas where there is significant disconnect between the things that are needed to strengthen the system and what is going on on the ground to pi ck just one example it is clear that if service delivery and governance are to improve botto mup accountability needs to be strengthened particularly if the trend towards deconcentrated organizational modalities is to intensify yet with the termination of the usaidfunded algap programme the pcs which provide the only real source of such accountability at the provincial level will be virtually without any support of this type this is serious weakness which government and donor s need collectively to address 424 the proposal also provides substantive sugg estions for the direction of institutional reform at the subnational level in so doing it identifies number of policy issues for donors and government in respect of which explicitly or implicitly choices will be made these choices will inevitably influence the focus of donor activ ities going forward they may also have implications for programmes which are alread underway for example the par activities centered on the oog in balkh have largely been dertaken in the absence of clear concept of the role of the oog within the overall subnationa l institutional structure they have thus arguably led to the capacitation of an organizati onal model which is not entirely appropriate and which may aggravate rather than ameliorate the systemic contradictions identified earlier in that pgs will now be encouraged to interfere more ra ther than less in the operations of the line departments review of number of such programmes may be necessary by government and donors once highlevel agreement on th overall way forward is reached 425 in order for progress to be made on these fronts number of initial procedural steps are necessary first an interministerial committee reporting directly into the presidents office should be formed to establish framework for subnational strengthening and reform in the short to medium term this should focus on providing cl earer direction for the evolution of the sub 72 this is only partial reflection of the many activities unde rway further work would be necessary to generate more complete list 48national system thus guiding donor initiatives in th is area in the longer term this sort of body should oversee more thoroughgoing policy exercise which should ultimately lead to the development of new local government w project which began some time ago but which now appears to be in state of suspended animation this sort of proposal has been made before most recently by the asia foundation without success and the political barriers to the formation of such an entity seem to be high but if at all possible something of this kind should be established b donor group focusing specifically on subna tional issues policy questions institutional strengthening capacity building funding of services and infrastructure should also be formed in many other countries where the subnational is of critical importance these groups have been established and have played critical role in coordinating donor activities and ensuring that they support rather than undermine the development of coherent institutional framework at the subnational level 73 apparently such group has recently met this is encouraging and should be encouraged 73 examples include uganda tanzania philippines indonesia cambodia 49annex i summary matrix existing and required activities to strengthen subnational service
