prowhite organization running prowhite candidate for president in 2008 join the national socialist movement and make history accept substitute supremacist group uses bully tactics by travis mcadam montana human rights network 04052006 when we brought the white supremacist affiliations of legislative candidate shawn stuart to the attention of the montana standard we felt it was information the butte community needed to knowwere glad that the standard agreed the newspaper provided needed service to the community when it ran the article on stuart over the weekend the standard helped shine the light of public scrutiny on the racist and antisemitic beliefs of stuart and the national socialist movementpublic and critical exposure is valuable tool for communities trying to keep hate groups from taking hold unfortunately those of us who help expose the agendas of hate groups often become targets ourselvesfollowing publication of the article stuarts national socialist movement began targeting montana human rights network employees it began with harassing phone calls and continued with postings on national socialist movement websitesone website features my home address and telephone number as well as those of my fellow network coworkers ken toole and christine kaufmann websites for the national socialist movement are also smearing the networks reputation saying that we engage in terrorist bombings and arsons these actions by the national socialist movement illustrate the tactics hate groups like to useintimidation threats of violence and misinformationwhite supremacists prefer to use these tactics under the cover of night and anonymously in other words they are bullies and thugs who feast on public apathy and target those of us who stand up to them many people do not take the hate movement seriously since the number of hardcore racists is relatively small however just like the school yard bully they will continue trying to intimidate us until the larger community publicly condemns themmontanas history is full of examples of racist and antigovernment bullies trying to run roughshod over communities in the early 1990s group of neonazi skinheads terrorized billings jewish community it began with cemetery vandalism and escalated to brick being thrown through the front window of jewish homein the mid1990s the montana freemen formed their own illegal courts and issued death warrants for criminal justice employees in eastern montanain 2001 david burgert and project 7 militia group compiled hit lists containing personal information about criminal justice employees and their families in the flathead areabeginning in 2004 kevin mcguire racist recruiter in bozeman posted false and misleading propaganda about local citizens on racist websites before running for the local school boardthe logical question to ask in all of these cases is what happened with the montana freemen and project 7 group activists were arrested and sentenced to prison in bozeman kevin mcguire has had problems following the law but he remains on the streetshowever thanks to the network and its bozeman affiliate the people of bozeman have clear picture of who mcguire is and what he representsthe community of billings came together and opposed the neonazi skinheads in the not in our town campaign which has been replicated in cities across the nationall the montana examples reveal common theme white supremacists and antigovernment bullies cannot win if we stand togetherit is up to us to tell those who target our communities that we will not look the other way and be complacent instead we will tell them that if they target one of us they will have to answer to all of us right now it is our staff that is under fire from the national socialist movementtomorrow it could be local judge elected official or business owner butte now has the opportunity to say not in our town travis mcadam is the montana human rights networks research director
