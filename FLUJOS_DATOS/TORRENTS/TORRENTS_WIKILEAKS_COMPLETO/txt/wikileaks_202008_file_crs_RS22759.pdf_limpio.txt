by far the largest tax provision in the house bill is provision designed to curb what is so metimes termed treaty shopping that is the use of the taxreducing provisi ons of bilateral tax treaties by firms which are not actually residents of the countries party to the treat the provision would raise an estimated 32 billion over 5 years and 75 billion over 10 years and incorporates the language of hr 3160 standalone antitreatyshopping bill introduced by representative lloyd doggett its context is this foreign individuals and firms who invest in the united states are generally subject to flat us withholdi ng tax on interest dividend royalty and similar income paid to them by us payers income generally subject to the tax includes payments by uschartered subsidiary corpor ations to their foreign parents while the rate of the withholding tax is nominally 30 it is often reduced or eliminated under the terms of one of the many bilateral tax tr eaties which the united states like most developed countries has signed in some cases the payment subject to th withholding tax may be taxdeductible by the payer under the corporate income tax fo r example uscharter ed corporations that are owned by foreign parent firms are ordinar ily subject to the us corporate income tax but are permitted subject to some restrictions to deduct the interest they pay to their foreign parents on intrafirm debt in such cases the only tax applicable to foreign investors us income is thus the withholdi ng tax where the withholding tax is reduced by treaty little or us tax may therefore apply to the ussource payments the provisions proponents argue that in so cases foreign investors resident in countries where the withholding tax is not substantially reduced or eliminated can save taxes by arranging to receive their us inco through an intermed iate entity chartered in country whose us treaty does eliminate the withholding tax if the treaty country does not impose its own withholding tax or s treaty with the foreign parents home country the intermediate subsidiary can simply pass the payments on to its ultimate foreign parent without incu rring additional taxes s upporters of the provision have argued that it will close what they characterize as loophole that permits foreign firms tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22759crs3 1 citizens for tax justice senate should enact the d oggett

taken alone the committee bills tax cut provisions would reduce revenue by an estimated 133 billion ove r 5 years and 146 billion over 10 years8 the taxcut items fall into four gr oups containing provisions re lated to conservation energy agriculture and an agriculture disaster reserve fund the conservation provisions are together estimated to reduce revenue by 55 billion over 5 years and 72 billion over 10 years in general the provisions provide tax incentives for various activities to conserve forests wetlands wildlife and endangered species the single largest tax cut however is the tax credit noted above that shifts th budget cost of the existing us department of agriculture usda conservation reserv program crp from the spending side of the ledger to the receipts side by permitting r ecipients to elect tax credit in lieu of cash payments under the crp program it is likel that for most recipients the credit would exceed the conservation payments in value because the tax credit would be excluded from taxable income while payments from the crp are taxable9 the provision would reduce revenue by total of 38 billion which would occur in fy2009fy2012 the bills energy provisions are generally group of tax incentives to promote domestic fuel security taken from broader energy taxbill approved by the finance committee in june although there are severa l narrow revenueincr easing items in the group together the energy provisions woul d reduce revenue by an estimated net amount of 405 million over 5 years and 15 billion over 10 years the single largest tax cut 11 billion

the tax provisions contained in hr 4297 jcx106 february 9 2006 p 5negligible amount over 10 years this pattern occurs because the provision has the effect of advancing the timing of depreciation

would be 51 billion all in the b ills first five years it would be funded by customs revenues revenueraising provisions the bills revenue raising provisions would together increase revenue by an estimated 133 billion over 5 years and 149 billion over 10 years the single largest item is provision designed to curtail the use of tax shelters codification of the judicial economic substance doctrine that has developed in court cases related to tax shelters in general terms the doctrine denies the use of tax reducing items eg tax deduc tions and credits generated by transactions that do not result in meaningful change in the taxp ayers economic position in general the committee proposal integrates portions of the doctrine into the inte rnal revenue code the committees provisions would not apply unless court dete rmines the economic substance doctrine to be relevant but when such determination is made it would apply twopart conjunctive test to transac tion requiring that 1 the transaction change the taxpayers economic position in meaningful way an objective test and 2 the taxpayer has substantial nonfederaltax purpose for engaging in the transaction in addition the proposal would apply 30 penalty for tax understatements where economic substance is lacking10 proposals to codify the economic substa nce doctrine have been considered by congress for number of years the senate versions of both the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 and tax increas prevention and rec onciliation act of 2005 pl 109222 contained economicsubstance pr ovisions that were dropped in conference the current finance committee provision is s imilar to the previous proposals in broad outline for example its twopart test but differs in some details and is estimated to raise approximately one third less revenue than the previous proposals11 several of the remaining re venueraising items apply to farm taxation including limitation on deductible farm losses restrictions on likekind exchange benefits and increased reporting requirements each in cas where the taxpayer receives agriculture program payments or commodity credit cor poration loans an additional revenue raising item would change the effective date of existing restrictions on salelease back silo transactions involving us taxpayer s and foreign entities not subject to us tax under current law deductible losses relating to such transactions would not be allowable for leases entered into after march 12 2004 th proposal applies the restriction to leases entered into on or be fore that date
