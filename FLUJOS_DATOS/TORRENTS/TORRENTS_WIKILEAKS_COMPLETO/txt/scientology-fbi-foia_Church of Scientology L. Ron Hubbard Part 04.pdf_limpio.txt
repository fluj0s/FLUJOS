explaining progression of coursesiv the moneyback guarantee though scientology is quick to take students money in advance for courses and auditing it appears reluctant to make good on its money back guarantee student who wants his or her money back is ignored by people higher up in the organization if the student persists he or she is complex form to fill but silscientologys younger ccfivert poorly trained thatthey need out the form properlyliven any of are so lefpia part of filling out the form requires going through several hoops within the downtown organization and in so doing the disenchanted student can expect to encounter great deal of unpleasantness finally if all is done correctly the money the student has in his or her account balance at the church will be returned minus service charge of as much as 12a per cent of the total those exstudents who have gone to lawyers instead of trying to wade their ways through this forbidding and expensive bureaucratic process have had more luck in the majority of cases the threat of suit has been enough to get the money bade v where does the money come from this is the simplest question to answer about scientology the money is generated by sales of hubbards books by charges lor auditing by fees for courses and by gifts first off even the briefest sd entology brochures have price tags and scientology dgsta steady trade in the wide atray 06 more expensive liien there mtist be salaries for staff hubbard boob and course materials people but most of them dont dress auditing costs 47 per hour and or behave as if they re making great any scientologist worth his or her salt deal of money and many are doing purchases at least 50 hours 0much of their work in return for freeauditing then the coursesthere are manythat

salmon street on this site scientology s6fattwi severil of them from sacramento califhave been working since april to refurbish what was formerly all reds downtown drugstore the work thats been done there is impressive but the cent is steep over 1000 per month plug utilitieswhat most observers lorget how ever is that scientology must pay huge legal fees for the church hires good lawyers and works them hard finally there are rumors in portland that one of hubbards dictates about his organizations is that they keep reserve accounts with banks the accounts are supposed to be large enough to support continued opera tions of the church for two years without income from other sources vii the local organizations lack of 5 candor perhaps the strongest understand ing this investigation left us about scientology is that its organizations are aot candid this failing mani fested itself in several ways for example patton the spokes person for both scientology organiza tions downtown spent large parts of two afternoons with willamette week in late august he seemed to be doing his best to answer our questions yet he answers he gave seemed unneces sarily vague and evasive im not sureand i dont know exactly were frequent responses f rr jw turn to pdse 9 religion or iwsinesscontinued from 5 even when asked about fees for courses patton professed ignorance h dont know they set fees for courses he told us the first after noon he agreed to get them for us the next day but when we asked him for them he replied prices there are not any i could find except what the registrars of the church have after more questioning patton lowed as how complete course in scientology could cost between 1000 and the price of new car when asked whether the mission of davis was run as franchise with samuels taking cut off the top patton said i dont know how it works tr hj furthermore this was frustrating as pattoo u the only person allowed to answer far die organizations downtown and he b president of the church which puts most of its efforts into coursework and auditing patton denied the existence of many of the policies and practices of the church outlined elsewhere in this article fromwhat we have seen of the church of scientologywhat the article does not say is that the photographswere not taf erf by journal photographer that splon skowskt is not the name presently used by the articles
