6110c05 shspec63 sec checking types of withhold punishment following the revelation of withholds is mechanism of older groups by which they sought to enforce their mores it is bad mechanism since it encourages withholding if you the auditor are worried about your own withholds or trying to present an image of sinlessness because youre scientologist youll q and at times with the pcs withholds and start mutual avoidance of certain subjects the auditor must have the courage to ask the sec check questions matter how crude and nasty it seems to do so its rough enough if your withholds are off if they arent youll back off the subject altogether auditors instructors etc can back off from being sec checked because of fear of loss of reputation or image theyll then slack off sec checking other people if you find someone who is ducking being sec checked he will also duck sec checking but it is not true that to be good auditor you must never have done anything wrong if you let yourself take that viewpoint you are surrendering to an oughttobe which action would slow the progress of scientology by putting every good auditor in lousy case shape along with every good exec the mechanism by which man has been governed had in it the idea that man was evil and therefore has to be held in line by evil practices they never noticed that the evil in the world stemmed from holding men in line society without arc is society which will inevitably have crime man is good but only to the degree that he is in arc with existence the primary mechanism someone uses who is out of arc with existence yet trying to survive is to withhold society is forced apart to the degree that people are made guilty to prevent murder dont hang murderers make it unnecessary for people to resign from the human race people get grievances about things theres agency in society to remedy the grievance and they end up committing desperate overts the unintentional withhold is something that occurs when the person is not able to tell anybody though hes willing to this could be because one is there or one is listening it happens in insane asylums all the time you get this peculiar kind of withhold which you mustnt overlook in sec checking then there is kind of withhold where the pc knew that he was withholding because hed be punished if others knew or theres withhold which would damage his beingness or reputation not necessarily doingness thats withheld it could be beingness group is based on communication withholds all add up to cut communication so it falls apart to the degree that there is communication up to point withholds appear to cohere group sec check is dedicated to the restoration of communication if comm were restored totally in any past group the pc will longer be hung in that group he will not be parked on the track so he will be more able to be part of his present group the group you are most concerned with in auditing isnt the group called scientology its the little group which is the session when the individual is too individuated end develops an unintentional withhold in that group or the auditor conducts himself in such way as to bring about punishment because of withhold or crime or demands specious reactions from the pc the auditor has shot the session group auditing is third dynamic activity for the session to be good group youve got to get all three kinds of withholds off 1 unintentional withholds when one will listen to the pc hence the process what werent you able to tell an auditor 2 reputational withholds defense of ones beingness eg ones family came from the wrong side of the tracks 3 withholds for fear of punishment the only thing that can deteriorate graph is arc breaks the basis of an arc break is being made to have an unintentional withhold from that immediate group thats more serious evidently than an intentional withhold as far as session results go then theres the enforced withhold on the basis of improved state someone who is pretending to audit gets result but seeks to convince the pc that hes much better here the pc thinks hed better not say otherwise then youve got the withhold of protecting beingness this is the reputational withhold its pretty rare on this basis but you can also have the propitiative pc who tells the auditor its all fine because he doesnt want to make the auditor feel bad when actually he still has his headache or whatever rudiments are aimed at handling these withholds the arc break questions ask for unintentional withholds what couldnt you tell an auditor and what didnt an auditor do the latter question is going after an auditor in games condition unintentional withhold and games condition questions go together compartmenting question you take the words get the charge off them you get reads off any phrases in it then if it still reads the read is on the question never leave question still reading it will throw the pc out of session immediately you can leave it for the next session but tell the pc that thats what you are doing another important point is to select sec check relevant to the pcs activities sec check against the reality of the pc taking into account the moral codes by which he lives never treat sec checking as repetitive process its for getting off withholds so vary the question and be real be inquisitive nosey and imaginative theres an overt act consisting of enforcing the mores of group to make others withhold thats the makeguilty action which also acts as withhold eg girl says i never raped anybody ive been raped and the question keeps reading dont q and by auditing out the rape get the overt which is gotten by whom have you made guilty of rape youll find the makeguilties lie on an actual done anyway so always come back to the original question with the same wording as you first used if pc thinks question is insulting he is telling you that he has done the thing
