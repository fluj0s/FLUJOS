trading program the european commission ec adopted l earningbydoing approach to prepare the eu for the kyoto protocols emission limitations the eu does not have major experience with emissions trading and the ec felt that an initial program beginning in 2005 would give the eu practical fa miliarity in operating such system at first glance it would appear that the eu may have little difficulty meeting its kyoto protocol require ments during the second trading period the anticipated deficit between the second trading period fo r the original 15 member states can be covered by trading with the 10 newer member states that anticipate surplus also credits are likely to be available through joint implementation ji and clean development mechanism cdm proj ects sanctioned under the protocol however there are other considerations the availability of surplus credits created via ji and cdm is restricted by the ec requirement that such credits be supplemental to countrys domestic efforts each country is to spell out what supplemental means in its national alloca tion plans naps for the second trading period individual countries are likely to fine that term differently restricting allowance trades and purchases in some countries another consideration is the overall commitment of the kyoto protocol as noted earlier the ets covers only pe rcentage of the overall greenhouse gas emissions in the various member states of the eu some sectors not covered by the ets may grow faster than sectors covered by it creating difficulties for compliance in particular the transportation area is already source of concern final consideration for the ets is its suitability for directing longterm investment toward lowcarbon future the ultimate goal of any climate change program it is too early to tell whethe r the etss market si gnal and individual countries naps will move investment in th appropriate direction the early signs are not particularly encouraging with the 20052008 naps producing an over allocation of allowances and one major member state germany attempting to direct its second nap toward carbonintensive coalfired electricgenerating facilities rather than lowcarbon alterna tives reluctance by countri to redirect their naps and an inconsistent price signal from the ets make the longterm effect of the ets uncertainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33581contents v r v i w 1

1990climate change the european unions emissions trading system euets overview climate change is generally viewed as global issue but proposed responses typically require action at the national level with the 1997 kyoto protocol now in force countries that ratified the protocol are developing appr opriate imple mentation strategies to begin reducing th eir emissions of greenhouse gases1 in particular the european union eu has decided to use an emissions trading scheme called cap andtrade program along with other ma rketoriented mechanisms permitted under the protocol to help it achieve compliance at least cost2 the decision to use emission trading to implement the kyoto protocol is at least partly based on the successful emissions trading program used by the united states to implement its sulfur dioxide acid rain control progra m contained in title iv of the 1990 clean act amendments3 the eus emissions trading system ets is cornerstone of the eus efforts to meet its obligation under the kyoto prot ocol it covers more than 11500 energy intensive facilities across the 25 eu member countries including oil refineries powerplants over 20 megawatts mw in capacity coke

in 2008 covering the period of the kyoto prot ocol with third one planned for 20134 under the kyoto protocol the thenexisting 15 nations of the eu agreed to reduce their emissions by 8 from 1990 leve ls under collective arrangement called bubble by 2001 collective greenhouse gas emissions in the eu were 23 below 1990 levels mostly the result of stru ctural shift from coal to natural gas in the united kingdom and the incorporation of east germany into west germany several countries including ireland sp ain and portugal experienced emissions growth of over 30 during this period5 in light of the kyoto protocol targets the eu adopted directive establishing the eu ets that entered into force october 13 20036 the importance of emissions tradin g was elevated by the accession of 10 additional central and eastern europe c ountries to eu membership in may 2004 collectively these 10 countries gr eenhouse gas emissions dropped 226 from 19902001 with only slovenias emissions in creasing during that time 104 this expansion of the eu trading zone to 25 countries greatly increases the opportunities for costeffective allowance trades in deciding on its trading program the european commission ec adopted learningbydoing approach to prepare th eu for the kyoto protocols emissions limitations the eu does not have major experience with emissions trading and the ec felt an initial program beginning in 2005 would give the eu practical familiarity in operating such system the ec also wanted the most comprehensive program possible as stated in its green paper the wider the scope of the system the greater will be the variation in the costs of compliance of individual companies and the greater the potential for lowering costs overall this argues in favour of comprehensive trading scheme across different member states covering all 6 greenhouse gases and sinks and encompassing all emissions sources7 economic analysis conducted by the european commission confirms the potential costsaving available from comprehensive trading scheme as shown in table 1 comprehensive trading program is estimated by the ec to reduce kyoto compliance costs to eu countries by 3 b illion euro or onethird over compliance scenario that does not include trading among member countries and by 09 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33581crs3 8 the first political decision noted by the au thors was the

coverage rather than comprehensive system coveri ng all sources and gases some european analysts have noted that eu politics played an important role in preventing serious consideration of comprehensive progra m as noted by boemare and quirion significantly wider coverage could have been provided only by an upstream system which had been excluded by the european commission at the beginning of the process the reason was again political an upstream scheme would have too much looked like tax8 not surprisingly this reason was not em ployed by the ec in explaining its decision to create less comprehensive trading scheme at this time as stated by the ec there are sound scientific and practical reasons why the community might not wish to establish comprehensive scheme at this stage there are considerable uncertainties surrounding the emissions of the fluorinated gases hfc pfc sf6 and the absorption of carbon dioxide by sinks allocating allowances monitoring emissions and enforcing compliance of small mobile emitters such as private cars raise complex technical and administrative issues9 for determining the size of the trading program the ec looked at five criteria 1 environmental effectiveness 2 economic efficiency 3 the potential effects on competition 4 feasibility and 5 existen ce of alternative po licies and measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33581crs4 10

starting with relatively sm all number of economic sectors and sources that contribute significantly to total emissions and for which trading could reduce cost significantly would substantially satisfy these criteria10 as noted the six sectors chosen emit about 45 of the eu15s co2 emissions which are about 80 of the eus total greenhouse gas emissions the coverage for individual countries varies widely only 20 of frances greenhouse gas emissions are covered compared with 69 of estonias emissions11 implementing the ets national allocation plans national allocation plans naps are centr to the eus effort to achieve its kyoto obligations each member of the eu must submit nap that lays out its allocation scheme under the ets including individual allocations to each affected unit for the first trading period each c ountry had to prepare nap by march 31 2004 may 1 2004 for the 10 new eu members naps for the second period were due june 30 2006 these naps are assessed by the ec to determine compliance with 11 criteria 12 for the second period delineated in an annex to the emissions trading directive12 criteria include requirements th at the emissions caps and other measures proposed by the stat are sufficient to put it on the path toward its kyoto target protections against discrimination between companies and sectors along with provisions for new entrants clean technology and early reduction credits for the second period the nap must guarantee kyoto compliance for the first period the ec approved most of the necessary naps by the end of 2004 the last nap wa s approved june 20 2006 from greece in general the primary problem the ec found with naps th at resulted in revisions were excessive allocation of allowances and state efforts to permit expost adjustments to their allocations excessive alloca tion problems resulted from states that left gap in how they would achieve their target to be filled with measures to be defined later insufficiently delineated plans to purchase allowances and unrealistic economic or emissions growth assumptions expost adju stments by states are not allowed such adjustments are seen by the ec as potentially disruptive to the emissions market and creating uncertainty for companieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33581crs5 13 four of the 25 member states cyprus luxembourg malta and poland have not submitted

euets may 9 2006 p 14 the primary economic influence on th ets revolved around fuel prices during 2005 point carbon analysis indicates 79 of the variance r2 in allowance prices was explained by changes in fuel prices particularly for electric power with 23 of the variance explaine d by the weather this linkage between allowance prices and the power market is not surprising as the power sector conducted the majority of trades in 2005 and therefore significantly influenced price development kaasik argues that the evidence from the past year indicates that fuel prices influence carbon prices but not the reverse specifically kaasik sees allowance prices as derivative of natural gas and co pricing at least in the shortterm assuming natural gasfired and coalfi red generation are the marginal cost suppliers of power allowance prices w ill respond positively to increasing natural gas prices or decreasing coal prices likewise allowance prices will respond negatively to decreasing natural gas prices or increasing coal prices this creates correlation over time between allowance prices and electricity price by influencing the marginal price of electric ity how this has evolved

eu would have little difficulty meeting its kyoto protocol require ments during the second trading period the anticipated deficit between the second trading period fo r the original 15 member states can be covered by trading with the newer member states that anticipate surplus however there are other considerations first count ries with potential surpluses may want to retain at least some of that surplus to help fuel their countries economic growth possibly at the expense of member state that needs llowances second the extent to which surplus credits would be created via ji the ec linking directive requires that such credits including from cdm be supplemental to countrys domestic efforts each country is to spell out wh at supplemental means in its nap for the second trading period third consideration is the overall commitment of the kyoto protocol as noted earlier the ets only covers pe rcentage of the overall greenhouse gas emissions in the various member states of the eu the analysis provided in table 3 assumes that the ets will have to provi proportional amount of that reduction based on 2003 emissions howe ver some sectors not c overed by the ets may grow faster than sectors covered by the ets creating difficulties for compliance in particular the transporta tion area has become major source of concern the transportation sector is not part of the ets and is not likely to be included before the third trading period29 instead transport cont rols are based on voluntary agreements with automobile manufacturer s to improve fuel economy fueleconomy labelling of cars and promoting fuel efficiency by fiscal measures30 the cornerstone is the agreements with automobile manufacturers to achieve improve new car fleet average co2 emissions rates as announced in 1996 the objective of the eu council of environmental ministers and european parliament was to achieve new car fleet average co2 emissions rate of 120 gr ams per kilometer g co2km by 2005 or by 2010 at the latest31 this objective was not met in 2005 and is unlikely to be met by 2010 voluntary commitments by the european japanese and korean automobile manufacturers associations in 1998 and subse quently endorsed by the ec set targets of 140 g co2km by 20082009 at the end of 2005 the average new car emissions rate is about 160 g co2km the rate of reduction in co2km for new cars would have to double for the automobile manu facturers to achieve their commitments which appears unlikely32 indeed despite improveme nts in emissions rates co2 emissions in the eu continue to rise becau of

burden between ets and nonets sectors have already created tension in germany with respect to the second trading period in its draft nap for the second trading period nap ii submitted june 28 2006 germany proposes to reduce its ets allocation from about 499 million metric tons to about 471 million metric tons decrease of 5634 however germanys 2005 emissions were only 474 million metric tons thus th reduction is only 06 from last years emissions in addition germany is propos ing to permit every new power station built between 2008 and 2012 to opt out from co2 caps and the ets for 14 years generally to encourage construction of coalfired facilities these emissions increases will have to be covered by the nonets sector s commercial residential and transportation an asse ssment done for greenpeace intern ational states that the german nap ii places disproportionate burden for emissions reductions on the nonets sectors in terms of meeting its commitments under the eu burden sharing agreement35 policies to fill in the gap reportedly include one plan to reduce emissions by 3 million tons by training ge rman drivers to drive more economically36 as noted by the ec report cited above the effectiveness of public education programs such as this may be problematic harmonizing naps the euets system involves an interp lay between definitions and procedures that are euwide and those that are nationw ide the groundwork for the system is the kyoto protocol which 1 defines the pollu tants and sets the countries emissions targets 2 defines the scope of participation annex 1 countries may implement emissions trading programs and nonannex 1 countries ma participate through the cdm 3 defines baseline missions years and sinks and 4 sets national inventory and compliance requirements

aluminum and chemical indus tries thought benchmarking was an interesting alternative less than thir d of the respondents from the pulp and paper industry and refineries thought so38 in many ways diversity between member countries with respect to the ets is inevitable as stated by grubb nd neuhoff with respect to allocation the final way in which the eu ets differs from many other trading systems is in the devolution of allocation respons ibilities in this case to its 25 member states this was an essential part of the deal that enabled the adoption of the directive member states would have never ceded to the european commission the power to distribute valuable assets to their industries nor is the eu ets unique in devolving powers of allocation it is typical in number of us systems moreover there are different degrees of harmonization applicable to different aspects of the eu ets and the commission can and does seek to increase the degree of harmonization through guidance notes39 footnote omitted new entrants the economic value of allowances is nowhere more evident than in discussions of new entrants indeed as noted above germany is proposing to permit new coal fired powerplants built between 20082012 to optout of the ets for the first 14 years of operation in order to encour age construction in its survey of ets stakeholders the ec found that 85 of all respondents favor harmonized approach to new entrants and closures nearly 75 believed that those allowances should be provided free40 likewise an eu questionna ire conducted by the european environmental agencys topic centre on air and climate change indicated that most member states would welcome harmoni zation of the treatment of new entrants and closures across the eu41 analogous to the us acid rain progra m eu states have set up reserves to provide allowances to new entrants in general these allowances are provided free as that is widely seen as helping boos t new investment however the allocation methods developed by the member states di ffer most states have yet to dip into their reserves for new entrants however the importance of the reserve will increase as the ets enters its second and eventu ally third trading period the manner in which new entrants receive allowances may have significant effect on the longterm direction of investment whether it is directed toward lowcarbon opportunities or used to support continuation of current economic development irrespective of itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33581crs19 42 michael grubb and karsten neuhoff allocation

output and not differentiating according to the carbon intensity of the proj ect would provide an incentive to develop low carbon alternatives an exam ple provided by grubb and neuhoff new entrant reserves should be based on output or capacity and avoid differentiating according to the co2intensity of the new investment in particular giving more to coal than gas plants rewards investment in new coal facilities which would conflict with objectives to tackle climate change increase the cost of future emissions reductions nd in the long run could lead to higher electricity prices the damaging effect s would be amplified if carbonintensive new entrants not only receive free llowances for the period 20082012 but also receive promises for subsequent periods42 the proposed treatment of coalfired pow erplants by the german government indicates how difficult it will be to direct future investment toward lowcarbon projects however it could be argued th at the longterm success of the ets and the eus commitment to kyoto and any subsequent agreements rests on such redirection with respect to new trants and longterm investment definition of affected units another area in which several member states would like more harmonization across the eu is the definition of combustion installation43 concerns revolve around ambiguity in the current definiti on of combustion installation and the number of small installati ons covered under the ets the ets applies to energy activities for all sectors with combustion in stallations above 20 mw of thermal rated input oil refineries coke ovens and subject to size criteria iron and steel cement lime glass ceramics and pulp and paper facilities however finland and sweden opted to include small district heating inst allations with rate d thermal input below 20 mw44 in contrast as noted previously germany is attempting to have some planned coalfired powerplants wh ich will be large producers of co2 able to optout of the ets for 14 years in addition to the consistency issue small installations between 20mw and 50mw account for 30 about 3000 of th total facilities c overed under the ets but very small percentage of total co2 emissions45 surveying 22 member stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33581crs20 45 continued allowance allocations to small installation accounted for about 2 of the total see european environment agencys

1136 of the covered insta llations produced less than 10000 metric tons of co2 annually46 the somewhat weak emissions data available at the time of the eu questionnaire suggest that while threequart ers of all emissions are produced by the largest 75 of installations the small in stallations under 10 000 metr ic tons are responsible for less than 1 whether the ets should continue to cover the roughly 3500 facilities under 10000 tric tons annually remains hotly debated issue expansion of coverage in choosing gradual incremental appr oach to emissions trading the eu is relying on other programs to control gree nhouse gas emissions in other sectors such as transportation the difficulties the ec may encounter in not choosing comprehensive approach to begin with is suggested by its survey of stakeholders the survey suggests that the future direction of the ets in terms of increasing coverage is toward incrementally adding more economic sectors rather than addressing the more complex issue of comprehensive system based on the survey the focus is currently on the chemi cal aviation and aluminum industries47 given that the numberone recommendation for future implementation of the ets is to provide participants with longer time frame for imple mentation it is unclear when the ets will become as comprehensive as the european commission would like conclusion at first glance the ets would appear an effective vehicle for the eu to meet its kyoto protocol obligations during th second trading peri od the anticipated deficit between the second trading period fo r the original 15 member states can be covered by trading with the newer member states that anticipate surplus in addition potential cers and erus from the cdm and ji respectively may help maintain limits on allowance costs table 6 provides one series of estimates of available allowances for the kyoto pr otocols fiveyear compliance period obviously not all these allowances may be available to the eu alone other countries such as japan nd canada may decide to in corporate emissions trading into their implementation strategies and acquire allowances from these sources yet the totals suggest that all else being equal the supply of allowances would be adequatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33581crs21 table 6 international supply of emissions credits and allowances cumulative total 20082012 million

ukraine aaus10003000 8000 source compiled by grubb and neuhoff allocation and competitiveness in the eu emissions trading scheme policy overview p 20 however there are other considerations the availability of surplus credits created via ji and cdm is restricted by the ec linking directive that requires that such credits be supplemental to countrys domestic efforts each country is to spell out what supplemental means in its nap for the second trading period individual countries are likely to define that term differently restricting allowance trades and purchases in some countries another consideration is the overall commitment of the kyoto protocol as noted earlier the ets only covers pe rcentage of the overall greenhouse gas emissions in the various member states of the eu some sectors not covered by the ets may grow faster than sectors cove red by the ets creating difficulties for compliance in particular the transportation area is already major source of concern final consideration for the ets is its suitability for directing longterm investment toward lowcarbon future the ultimate goal of any climate change program it is too early to tell whet her the ets market si gnal and individual countries naps will move investment in th appropriate direction the early signs are not particularly encouraging with the 20052008 naps producing an over allocation of allowances and one major member state germany attempting to direct its second nap toward carboninte nsive coalfired electric generating facilities rather than low carbon alternatives reluctan ce by countries to redirect their naps and an inconsistent price from the ets make the longterm effect of the ets uncertainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33581crs22 48 international energy agency act locally

operating on january 1 2005 norways system covers 51 facilities in the energy and process sectors such as oil refining and iron and steel processi ng and has several features in common with the eu ets48 these sectors account for about 1015 of the countrys emissions other parts of rways industry particularly its offshore oil and gas sector are covered by the c ountrys carbon tax of almost 40 euro per metric tonne of co2 much higher than the antic ipated allowance price under the trading program the carbon tax is levi ed on about 64 of the countrys co2 emissions about half the country s total greenhouse gas emissions49 the first phase of the trading prog ram covers the period 2005 2007 with second expanded phase to begin in 2008 developing its initial trading scheme independently of the eu norways quota commission created in 1998 stressed that the 2008 program be as comprehensive as possible suggesting that the system could include close to 90 of the countrys greenhouse gas emissions50 to achieve this coverage the commission envisioned hybrid system of quotas depending on costeffectiveness and practicality considerations arguing in favor of regulating co2 emissions at the producer upstream level from mobile sour ces and some stationary sources the quota commission states for these emissions regulation at the producer level will not create weaker incentives for reducing emissions than regu lation at the consumer level because the volume of emissions from particular commodity is not dependent on technology for those process emissi ons which are recommended for inclusion in the system regulation by quotas should be imposed at the enduser level in cases where the processes originate w ith major industrial companies for process emissions stemming from series of small sources eg emissions of n2o from commercial fertilizers regulation by quotas should be imposed on retailers or importers in order to avoid unacceptably high system costs51 the
