shsbc 74 clearing lecture given on 24 october 1961 okay here we are and this is the 24th of october 1961 and very interesting day it is the reason im late is ive been building fireplace and if i start making little errors here and talking about well the flue goes over here or something youll understand this now you are embarked upon an interesting activity just now not all of you but the bulk of you are running your terminals on new series of commands and this new series of commands is very well thought out hydrogen bomb and i cant tell you at this moment that there will be exactly change in this particular series of commands but i have been working on nothing but this command package for about two weeks im just trying to smooth these things out now this very well may shorten clearing do you think it will audience yes because i have told you many times that auditing was third dynamic activity and so it is even more importantly apparently most aberration as we learn in problems intensive stems from group mores now how would this be itd be basically that there was an agreement and if you look at the reality scale you will see that an agreement ranks high on the reality scale well group is multiple agreement and as an individual agrees to and then disagrees to he runs onetwo contradiction on his own postulates in other words he says i agree and then suddenly he says i dont agree when person becomes member of the group he agrees to certain things and then finds that he cannot uphold these certain things and then of course disagrees to these certain things now this is one of the highest levels of the reality scale this is very high on the scale but having agreed to and then having disagreed to he of course does not then asis ordinarily his original agreement all he does is disagree to so he finds himself in disagreement with himself well it was his agreement wasnt it and now he disagrees to this so now he is in disagreement with his own agreement which of course is the apparently the first and foremost invalidation of thetan he invalidates himself by agreeing and then disagreeing to his own agreements in between the agreement and disagreement we get further set of agreements and activities all of which are less in value but nevertheless bring about complexity he agrees to be member of the i will arise burial society of birmingham and he agrees to get hisself buried and he agrees to pay twentyfive cents week from here on out until hes buried and he doesnt get buried and he hasnt got the twentyfive cents but he also finds out that the treasurer of the organization doesnt spend this on tombstones as hes agreed to do he hears some kind of rumor or something of the sort that he spends it on new buicks and then he finds out dat the last few brethren was buried dey was buried face down and dey wudnt wearin coffin so he now disagrees to pay his twentyfive cents week and he disagrees that its good thing to be part of the i will arise burial society and now he runs up whole series of overts he goes around and tells all of his friends that they must stay out of the i will arise burial society all right so were busy running this fellow and he tells us motivator motivator motivator motivator dey took dis twentyfive cents and dey put it in dey pockets and dey didnt put anybody in ground proper and he tells you all of this they did this to they did this to actually it was seventyfive dollars nine hundred dollars or something of the sort it doesnt matter what and he tells you motivator motivator motivator motivator see well to free up this whole situation you have to somehow or another uncover the something on the order of the original agreements or activities now it so happens that the i will arise burial society had great many social activities and after they joined they had right to go to all of the funerals and the i will arise burial society always provided all of the beer and they provided band and it was supposed to be quite an affair you know and actually as we begin to sound this particular activity with this group we find out that for something on the order of twentyfive cents week over period of five or six years this fellow averaged funeral party week and at every funeral party drank fifty cents worth of beer you see and frankly the i will arise burial society ceased to exist for economic reasons they were burying people too proper that was the trouble you see and they exceeded their exchequer well what have we got in there weve got whole area of motion enjoyed motion the individual enjoyed himself during that period of time mutually with other members of the i will arise burial society in fact he was at one time completely unable to differentiate what was his decision and what was anybody elses decision in the i will arise burial society dey was dancin and dere was lot of beer and during some of those beer times it was totally impossible to differentiate who was decidin what so we get an unknown area we get mutual action area and all of these things have to do with little group that came and went and disappeared because of financial insolvency and we find our pc absolutely certain that he will never be buried and weve got half the pictures hes got on the track of being of dying on point of land you see that is out in the open and just lying there with his bones being picked upon by the vultures and hes got it with full somatics you see and weve got pictures of him floating as jetsam flotsam on the high seas with the seagulls scratching his eyes you see there he is stone dead women float face up thats right anyhow scratching the back of his neck and so forth and there he is decaying into cadaver with the fishes nibbling upon his face and all of these are very interesting pictures and im sure that we could be very elucidative on the whole subject of how these pictures came to view and we all agree that this is horrible circumstance not to be buried but we begin to look at the chain of not being buried on the track and we find out that he practically never got buried well weve cracked through barrier here which has been in existence for lets see 1948 to 1961 why if the thettan was making his own pictures why was he making that particular type of picture yeah why was he making this what was his proclivities for morbidity and we find the answer in the fact that he can longer differentiate between his actions and other peoples actions thats one of the first things we find out he cannot differentiate he cant tell what happened he doesnt know what he did and he can only condemn what they did and he is not sure who was cause thats what it all amounts to who was cause of any of these communication lines or actions who caused these lines well you find somebody dancing in the i will arise burial society hall and theres tremendous crowd of them and theyre all dancing and they are dancing faster and faster and all of sudden theres tremendous crash and all of the beer barrels which are stacked up roll on the floor because the combined efforts of the crowd move too surgingly in that direction who caused it well he gets we caused it oh isnt that interesting we caused it did we now thats fine theres actually only very few of his motions were contributive to the beer barrels going out on the floor but which motions well he doesnt know and he gets confused with his causes then he doesnt know who caused what and one day at particularly violent funeral there was fight and he was in tremendous fog because of too much beer and when all of the smoke cleared away of fight dere was brother lyin on floor and he wasnt breathin who killed him well he doesnt know who killed him in fact nobody ever finds out who killed him the i will arise burial society sort of killed him but there is motion caused by any mass called the i will arise burial society that is bunch of motions individually caused and the fellow after that begins to wonder if he maybe didnt kill that brother dat was lyin on flo some commotion occurred and he doesnt remember what he did and it could be that he killed somebody but certainly he was member of group who killed somebody that he knows but where he was at the exact instant of the death of this brother is not something he can tell you in other words hes getting interiorized into the motion of the society till he can longer differentiate between his motions and the motions of other individuals in that society but begins to call them our motions there is our motion all motions are of course caused individually fundamentally and basically all motion is individually caused there is collectively caused motion thats where the governments of earth are going astray left and right they say the people the people the people the masses the masses and youll find people right up here in the council house not ten miles away five miles away im sure will tell you that we must protect the people and every people as an individual that comes up to the door gets kick in the teeth because theyre not the people you see every individual is himself and the government doesnt want anything to do with the individual the government can only be concerned with people in the mass and each person as an individual moving in to ask for assistance in some category is immediately told that hes not the people and that he shouldnt think selfishly for himself this way that its for the greater good of the greater people and youll find there are people in government like this you would be amused someday as you begin to look it over the people the people the people the masses the masses the masses see and they shoot individuals and they have never realized that this thing theyre calling the people is made up of nothing but individuals and if you shot every individual that you found in the people now im not talking of the russian cultism of individualism im just talking about this identity single identity not people identity if we shot every single identity we found amongst the people we of course would have people isnt that correct all right the government goes on the basis that you must only take care of the people and you mustnt pay any attention to the single identity well of course then theyre governing nobody are they see there we get condition where all motions are confused with all motions to point where nobody can differentiate what his motions are and the third dynamic attainable for the preclear is the most fruitful source of this confusion of mutual motion you can call it the confusion of mutual motion the individual doesnt know what he did who he did it with or which was his effort that contributed to the motion and hes longer able to tell about this and he defends himself from this confusion by backing out of it and he says well it was all bad and here i am outside of it at least i am still an identity and thetan has gone through this on and on and on actually the dynamics give us an excellent picture of this the sixth is exclusively comotion undifferentiated all the collective undifferentiated comotions of the past become what we call matter energy space and time of the sixth dynamic that is what the sixth dynamic apparently is it is the cumulative effect of undifferentiative mutual motions nobody can say what he did after builder gets through building the building he stands back and hes in bit of fog about it and there were five thousand windows put in this building and he knows he put some windows in which windows did he put in well he might be able to count them up and he might not be able to so he but he takes defense from the effort of not asising it he takes defense from not asising it he doesnt asis it he simply says well that was our activity well now that was very innocent action and it doesnt have very much to do with anything and of course life was made up of our activities but its only when these things come cropper we built this bridge and then the first locomotive that goes across it caves it in everybody says the company built this bridge and they built this bridge they instantly deny their own comotion well theyve forgotten their individual contribution and then they have denied their part of the comotion and then they say they had part of it and that is about the cycle that these group things go now if we were processing this fellow from birmingham and he was trying to get squared around on the i will arise society and he has this terror of being buried of not being buried and every time we get anything like it we find these pictures of burials and we find all sorts well we dont know any background picture of the i will arise burial society we dont even know hes ever been part of it it happened in an earlier lifetime it doesnt even exist now it is just lost piece of comotion on the track thats not commotion you know i mean its just co hyphen motion cooperative action and weve got pc who is terrified of not being buried and if we trace this down very carefully well eventually run into the i will arise burial society he has so many overts against the i will arise burial society and such tremendous dependency on being buried by it that of course he cant be buried if hes not member of it well he was member of it three lifetimes ago and he has terror of not being buried well now if we were trying to chase down every phobia that person had on the basis of find the phobia find the group run out the coaction get redifferentiation of the individuals responsibility toward and for the group all of these things we could probably do it but we would also have this fascinating thing that at any given time on the track at any given time on the track an individual is member of two or three groups at the same time member of the family hes member of the society hes member of the business hes connected with i mean anything like that you know even if hes bum hes member of group called bums hes at least two or three groups you see all right now how long has he been on the track about two hundred trillion and id say that it was about three groups every twentyfive years would be the most conservative underestimate of the situation so that is something on the order of twelve groups century times two hundred trillion less one hundred you see less two cycles so its two trillion times twelve or twentyfour trillion and you would have to do this twentyfour trillion times now how long are you going to live could you afford the number of emeters that you were going to wear out during this period now if you are going to able to be able to differentiate or get the individual to differentiate every single area and point and action of the track where he had come cropper because of coaction it would be that kind of an operation if you were going to take each one of them individually apart it would add up to something like twentyfour trillion you see every time he died he deserted the society just take that every time he died he left group he had overts on the group too dying was also an overt on the group all kinds of wild computations will come up on this line but it becomes an unauditable situation is all the point im trying to make and its good thing that were assisted by thing called automaticity all overts and withholds are preceded by coaction which is an interesting thing in itself there must have been coaction for later overt and withhold to occur all right lets be much more down to earth here theres husband and wife and they have fight and she decides to leave and he decides to leave perfectly routine daily situation all through the societies some kind of small vestige of this takes place you see well how come how come well they are group theyre group of two they have mutual actions which are also flanked by nonmutual actions well just get the idea she takes care of the home and he takes care of the business she cooks food he eats it he earns it she buys it theyre almost duplicative but not quite now if we look this over we find out that theres an ample opportunity here to have mutual action and great deal of different actions all going on at the same time which makes it rather confusing an individual has is evidently duplicating somebody else while not duplicating anyone wifes wearing powder and paint he isnt hes shaving she doesnt you get these differences all the time we have an apparency of mutual action we have tremendously different individual actions going on well this thing could very well add up just as itself to bunch of overts and withholds because the mutual action is always being interrupted by differences the differences exist so they speak of these differences but of course its just overts and withholds and that sort of thing but there were mutual actions now you can straighten out these people by running the ow or you can free the effect of the ow by differentiating the coaction and that is the basic discovery which i am telling you about now you can knock out the coaction which preceded the difference of action now we take this fellow with the i will arise burial society and we start processing all the parties and good times he had and well find out that itll rather automatically discharge all of his overts against the i will arise burial society and we think its because well he looks at the good times he had and to where he understands the situation you see well theres truth in that but the coaction precedes the other and youre running more basic action than the ow but the coaction is something he cannot face if he is withholding himself from the group he of course cant even remember the coaction of the group theres many fellow saying oh well i belonged to this terrible space opera society and everybody dressed like spiders and we all went around strangling people they were terrible and i finally got down on the whole thing and i left them all i didnt want anything to do with them and so forth and we run this down little bit further and we find the withhold is is he is longer member of the group he is withholding group member from the group namely himself thats your most fundamental withhold all right so as long as he is withholding himself from the group he also withholds his memory from the group so he really cant tell you what the group was all about all right but we can get him up now to confront the idea that hes done something to the group and hes withholding something from the group and hes done something else to the group and hes withholding something else from the group and something sort of goes bzzuh well he gets you know little freedom occurs well hes in close enough to the thing now to be able to observe so now if we ask him about the coactivity of the group he would be able to tell us and the next thing you know he would look it all over and say well i dont know us spiders we just tramped all over the universe and we kept doing this and that and wed jump on planet and wed eat it all up and it was marvelous and we actually had lot of fun if truth be told and get rather nostalgic about the whole thing and tell you all about what they did and you go well what about these overts and withholds against the group well its nothing in particular well how about your not being member of the group right now youre withholding body from the group well thats not very important groups break up and groups come and groups go im just not member of the group now and theres reaction on the needle you see the approach the fellow is so far outside of it that he couldnt touch the coaction to begin with it so an initial approach to the situation is not find the coaction its sneaking up on it you ask you can ask about the coaction and hell tell you something about it and then you have to get withhold off or an overt off or something and then he can tell you more about the coaction and then you get another overt or withhold off and he can tell you more about the coaction and you get another overt withhold off he tells you more about the coaction and all of sudden he realizes everything they did do and that group blows do you see the progress made well these mechanics are inherent in the processes which were issued to you that have to do with groups body of agreement has been violated and thereafter will remain aberrative and theres where you get the packaged imsupposedtos theres where you get the packaged postulates theres where you get the wholecloth personalities we call them valence and so forth they were enforced by group mores youll find some young girl who is member of family who didnt have any great avidity for family life perhaps but she was member of the family and she was going along and now we find her years later in terrible condition and she says the family chopped us up chopped her up and the family chopped her up and the family did this and the family did that and the family did something else of the sort and well find that even the memory of that family causes her pain whats going on well she cant asis it because she cant get near it because shes got overts and withholds on it and is withholding herself from it of course she cannot approach the actual situation at all so she really cant tell you what went on in her family and its quite common for somebody to say well my mother beat everyday and twice on sundays and my father used to take an ax to every tuesday and then to find out as you run the situation out that nothing like this occurred at all his father once threatened him with an ax and his mother quite customarily used to duck when the preclear threw schoolbooks at her i mean this was about as close as we had to the situation well why are we so far from the situation actually the individual is withholding himself from the area of the situation in the physical universe and in his mind at the same time so the mind you see is approximating what he is doing now lets take another activity lets take speedboat driver he drives speedboat races and we find this pc wouldnt go near speedboat if you put him in speedboat why itd go off both sides of the harbor theres telling what would happen if we put him in speedboat because he doesnt want to go anywhere near speedboats and we say this is peculiar thing this man sees speedboats and he gets sick at his stomach well you say thats natural you get seasick in those its not natural these things have causes what activity was he engaged in what is that group all about im afraid its something on the order of we are group who are at total odds with one another and who when we tangle tangle with violence speedboat 27 running into speedboat 34 seldom do it quietly the coaction of the group is crash otherwise theyre in total contest with one another so theyre not an actual group but the collision of the group is the coaction of the group so you ask this pc what is the mutual action of speedboat racers wrecking speedboats of course well he doesnt want to be any part of that group because the whole mission of the group is to wreck speedboats thats the way it looks to him at first you see there couldnt possibly be any other differentiation other than speedboats what is speedboat racer speedboat racer is member of group who wrecks speedboats then we get him little closer into it and we get him over and he sees the individuality of the whole thing and we see how its running and it all of sudden begins to run he can look at the situation but his first look at the thing will probably be i dont want to have anything to do with the process you are trying to run on thats probably the first entrance point because hed say well ive been sitting here for generations perfectly happily withholding myself from anything to do with speedboat racers and then you you of aarr you come along and you say associate with them thar speedboat racers and i thought processing was to make people feel better and look at now you done it well what are you actually asking pc to do youre asking pc to stop withholding himself mentally merely because hes withholding himself physically from zone of coaction and motion you see hes withholding himself mentally as he withholds himself physically youre processing grown man hes longer member of his family well hes longer member of his family or he has some difficulty with his family all right and there he is hes withholding himself mentally from his family so you ask him to think about his family its almost the same as asking him to go back and join his family as full participating member of the family he doesnt know that he wants to do this in fact he wouldnt consider it wise so youll find all sorts of weird dodges being used by pcs not to run this process computational dodges of one character or another now why do the rudiments have to be in in order to find goal or terminal why well its because youre asking the individual to walk very closely to the fact of an identity from which he is actually withholding himself hes withholding himself from the identity and being the identity he is not executing the goal while executing the goal youre asking him to look at something he is in the middle of now as you start to run groups you normally ask what group comotion are you still in the middle of that you are now having nothing to do with and this appears very confusing to him nevertheless it works out and it works out very well there is nothing very esoteric about the way the process works you should know however this one sequence of theres an agreement to join or to be part of or to agree to the mores of or the activities of or and all groups have mores of one kind or another followed by coaction followed by overts followed by withholds and more overts and culminating in total withhold physically and mentally from participation with the group of any kind whatsoever all right ill repeat then the steps that you go backwards on it you could security check the individual on this group and he would walk little bit closer to the group and then youve got these overts and his withholds off dont you see now he could be asked about the coaction of the group and pretty soon he would get recall of coaction and be able to differentiate his own actions from the actions of the group now the next step above that of course is not something you necessarily i dont think would have to process it certainly could not be processed originally because look at the barriers that intervene and that is his agreement to join the group that should fall out of the hamper sooner or later in processing youve walked this group backwards in other words but theres the way you approach it the pc is being tank driver thats his terminal tank driver well you cant even find his terminal at first but hes right in the middle of it well the rudiments have to be in so he can look because hes going to need all the attention hes got in order to look and the rudiments have to be in to run these things because youre going to ask him to run ows and youre asking him to get the comotion of tank drivers really by getting the ow off we get the comotion of tank drivers at each point of this youre asking him to confront just hair more than he would be comfortably accustomed to confronting see there he is perfectly safe hes just got busted neck arthritis and three 88 millimeter shells through his brisket theres nothing wrong with the man hes perfectly normal human being sits there and gibbers and there he is comfortably and theyll even tell you this well i have left that long time ago and i longer have anything to do with it and i dont know why you should ask to look at these things which i considered so unpleasant at the time youll hear this out of more pcs when you start running into this sort of thing i am not sure i want to go on with this is the total expression and the common denominator as you start to clear somebody of all his arc breaks all of his computations all of his figurefigures all the reasons he should blow all of everything is i am not quite sure i want to get any closer to that group of spiders thats what it adds up to you see but it expresses itself in various ways he says well i dont want to get clear i dont know if i should go along with this i feel fine the way i am hell show up for the next session but hes kind of telling you this all the time he expresses it to you as member of your group of an auditor pc you see he expresses it to you as i see reason to go on with this because its all been unproductive of great unhappiness in the past and i am trying to escape all that and the main reason i am being audited is so that i can escape all that and here you you traitor are turning around and pointing long bony finger on the backtrack and im not sure i want to look down over the fingernail because its just been just little bit grim now this cough is perfectly easy to understand its caused by bacteria these holes in my stomach theyve been perfectly diagnosed as ulcers my eyesight well everyone knows that when you get along in life when you get up to twentyone or twentytwo your eyesight starts to fail and of course with the world in the state that it is in you cant expect anybody to be to be happy so naturally im unhappy but ive been getting along somehow and i dont see any reason why i shouldnt be permitted to go my own unhappy if somewhat aberrated way because i have everything explained theres mystery here and you say well what are your goals of life ah well this is great see youve just come up there with roan horse all sleeked up ready saddled and its pointed on the out trail see its up thataway see and hes come from down thisaway and he is not about to go down thisaway again but goals oh future ah now future oh well lets get out of here good future well my goals are brrdrrdrrdrrdrr and you sight it out and you find out which goal sticks he says thats sort of funny i didnt really realize that was my goal but it is you know hadnt thought about it for long time thats it well now who would you ask him now give list of people and he gives you list of people very interested in this list of people somehow or another theres sort of compelling horror theres the bird looking at the the birdstaringatthesnake sort of fascination about this terminals list and it finally narrows down right straight on the head of very unlikely thing which seems to explain it all and hes there all right thats perfectly correct you understand but he really didnt expect that he would land there but of course it is perfectly obvious why he is there but it on the other hand so on they never seem to tell you that the assessment is wrong they will sometimes tell you they dont like it they sometimes are quite pleased with it and it very often explains many things to them but they hope more or less at this point that you will go off and let them sleep quietly because now youve got this roan horse and youve turned the roan horse around and you say now just go back down the trail there and go around that pile of rock the guy says well i just came from there and you know whats on the other side of that pile of rock we all know theres bunch of vultures and if i go around there again why be the end of and youre liable at that moment to get the most remarkable series the absolute most remarkable series of reasons why they dont want to become clear and now begins the most critical period in processing oh they go along with the goal like shot they go along with the terminal like shot they themselves want to get clear thats for sure but the fact of facing back to the group and that group and that group and those people and those locations of the track and that activity and what they did then and what happened to them someplace else oh well now thats another thought that is another thought that is something else yesterday was something that should remain buried it was okay as long as we could skim along the edges and skate along the corners of the pond and never fall in that was all right because that was fancy figure skating but it was very safe but we go out there and were liable to have anything happen to us and the most critical period of processing is immediately after you begin to run the goal and terminal particularly with powerful process and that can be wicked that can be very wicked in the first place if you have the wrong goal and if you have the wrong terminal youll throw the pc in over his head and itll take some real experts to bail him out so it is not light thing to attempt there is only one goal there is only one terminal available and now we have given you if this works out all right surcease from your nervousness about the assessment of the prehav scale that was little bit tough to do of course the goal and terminal is the critical things to do that is really something you have to find the right goal the right goal can only be found with the rudiments totally in you have to find the right terminal the right terminal can only be found with the rudiments totally in all right now our period of departure from that point begins what could be some very trying times in the first place the pc does not want to have anything to do with what he has left and he does not know that if he has to cross over that again he wants to get clear at all so you can look for all manner apparently of arc breaks rudiments out this and that figurefigures ducks and dodges you can look for all kinds of ducks and dodges he doesnt want to go back there so theres all kinds of this and thats he doesnt know the price he will have to pay isnt too great for the prize of being clear after all hes still alive as aberrated he doesnt know that hell be still alive after he gets through with all that why doesnt he know this because its well proven he died last time didnt he he got hurt last time didnt he well hes certainly going to be hurt again and you get the mustnt duplicate situation and you get other things coming up pc can also begin to slide out from underneath terminal up into degradation and this is one of the more alarming facts of running terminals and one of the things which is very discouraging to an auditor an auditor really has to understand this in order to survive much of it because the pc looks so pathetic the pc comes up to degradation the pc is noplace the terminal is everything the pc isnt there and the pcs first awareness is in gooey ulnyah and degradation it very often happens this way it isnt necessarily usual but it does happen this way the worse off pc has been in life the more interiorized the pc has been inside the terminal the more liability you have in trying to pull him out of it because he comes up through degradation band and he doesnt know that he wants to go on at all because it is too doggone grim somebody can get degradation practically dripping off of him but all of his escapements are reactive all of his mechanisms to escape are reactive and you mustnt lose track of that fact those are all reactive by keeping the rudiments in and keeping the pc being audited and pointed straight ahead on his line you will succeed why because actually the pc what there is of him at the time you begin to process him is with you all the way and the objections are reactive objections and if you qanda with these reactive objections too much you stop the pcs forward progress and that is basically what is the most critical period of auditing given the right goal given the right terminal right now with the process you are running the first six to eighteen hours after that point will be the most critical period of auditing once youve got them over that jump all right maybe they wont have any trouble at all maybe theyll just come through it like dream that they come through it easily doesnt mean nothing is happening it just means youre lucky or your auditing is very smooth or your altitude as an auditor is very high or the arc which youve generated is carrying the person through rather easily and this looks fine it goes through very smoothly and there is dynamite happening theres just lots of motion theres lots of cognition and lots of this and lots of that and everythings going along very swimmingly and the pc doesnt necessarily go into any degradation at all doesnt necessarily do so but dont be so alarmed if the pc does because degradation is the lower harmonic of apathy you know what im talking about when i say degradation its really gucky its the lower harmonic of apathy how can person be more apathetic than apathetic by being totally degraded and it is the first emotion that pc encounters on his road up the first emotion encountered on his road up if he is below the point is degradation and then he comes up through some other unnamed oddball emotions up to apathy when hes up in apathy man hes way up of course the pc goes through band between degradation and apathy of dying the band of death lies straight across the line thetan is easily below death easily in fact most aberrated people walking around are bit below death and when you bring them up they get odd ideas about dying and things of this character well what is this this is just route from degradation to apathy they pass through periods of dying obvious its just band on the tone scale thats all it is its just the individual goes through this before he comes out of it now itd be very fine if you could take him from totally dead totally insensate totally unfeeling to total enthusiasm with gradient be wonderful if you could do that but i think the only way you could do it is get an electronic cap and put it on his head and implant him and have him be totally enthusiastic and of course you havent cleared him you havent freed him hes even more down there than he was before but youve given him some kind of an implant of you now feel enthusiastic about everything well if hes going to go up through degradation and up through death and up through apathy remember hell also go through grief well he doesnt have to cry to go through grief but hell go through grief and hell go through fear and hell go through anger and hell go through the lot hell go right on up the tone scale and theres sort of hurdygurdy goes on which you must understand did you ever see one of these little counterbalances whereby you put some pennies or some sand in one bucket that is up in the air and the bucket goes down and the other bucket goes up you know theres two buckets over pulley you see and as one bucket goes down the other bucket goes up now the up bucket as you start to process the pc is the valence and he is as overwhelmed as of course the valence is hightoned thats rule the pc is as overwhelmed as the valence is hightoned its direct rule although valences can have chronic tones of their own youll find this on the prehav scale the rule is the higher the valence is on the prehav scale the more the pc has been overwhelmed by it works reversely the more or the higher the valence is on the prehav scale on the tone scale actually the worse off the pc is underneath so if the one bucket valence is way up inevitably the pc is way down and they swap positions and in the process of processing them you find out that the position interchanges that there is period when the buckets are even just as you lower one bucket the other bucket comes up there will be period when they are both level and thats very schizy situation the pc is not in his valence and he is not out of his valence and the valence is not there its not effective but its not ineffective the imsupposedtos are not working very well and the pc has not begun to function yet very well and these two buckets pass each other on the counterbalance and the valence sinks out of sight and vanishes and the pc goes on up to the top that is essentially what happens with valence that demonstration by the way of the tone scale is not inept it is very factual you draw two buckets connected with piece of string one bucket at each end of the piece of string and hang the center of that string over pulley and then plot tone scale back of each piece of string as it drips down youll get the exact operation that occurs the tone scale the valence goes down tone down tone down tone down tone down tone down tone what valence and the pc goes what pc see then oh im so degraded oh terrible i feel awful very degraded i dont know whether im ready to go on with this sort of is it always this bad and then they up little bit and they say well i want to die now ive seen everything ive done everything ive done everybody theres nothing left and so on and then they go up to point of oh god whats the use thats better than dying you see but its just oh god whats the use little bit later why you see the bucket has gone up to point of its so sad it is all so sad everything is so sad is there anything in the world that isnt sad and then it goes up to point you know this is pretty scary stuff to be going through are you sure you know what youre doing and then god damn it what do you think youre doing you know and then well we can leave this now i havent haha actually this doesnt bother any now im not worried about it we can leave the whole thing and thats wonderful invitation to an auditor these are all wonderful invitations to an auditor to do something else but particularly this one its flat now the pc tells you so it must be true and they strike that boredom band and more processes and engrams have been deserted by auditors at the boredom band than any other point and they go up to the boredom band and then the person says it isnt bothering now so the auditor says well thats wonderful thats good time to leave it theyve just struck boredom you go little bit further and they will become conservative about it well it probably is all right if i am careful and then they will get enthusiastic about something else and theyve come out of it the valence goes down the same course now this fellow is gambler the valence is gambler and you have at first serene gambler nothing bothers him all pervasive nothing worries him not successful gambler just nothing worries him you see hes very serene about it as he trumps his partners ace and down goes the bucket little bit as you process this the next thing you know you have an enthusiastic gambler now this is whats weird youve got an enthusiastic gambler about the same time as you have dead pc and these two things give us an odd view and then it goes down little bit more and you have person who says well theyre bored with gambling and they dont think they will gamble anymore now as they pick packet of cards out of their pocket and start to deal you hand but it really doesnt interest them and they can really leave it alone and they now know that they can leave gambling alone and so forth leave life alone leave everything alone theyd still deal you hand however while not being interested in what you have then they go down and you get an angry gambler and you would then about the time you see you have got an apathetic pc youve got an angry gambler and then pretty soon why you have weeping gambler you dont see every level of the tone scale very often in processing theyre passed by fairly rapidly or they dont express themselves or manifest themselves very cleanly and you see skip go from for instance from anger to fear and thered be anger and then the pc about the time the pc is getting sort of griefy about it all why the gambler is sort of scared and that is an interesting time to process him because youve stable high tone theres stable high tone to fall back on the valence is now frightened and the pc is weeping well which can the pc be you see the pc is weeping and his normal escape from it would be to be serene gambler but the gambler is now afraid so theres just place to hide along about that point and the pc really starts really unloading about this point because he finds out that if hes gone this far there is backtrack that he can reverse on in processing hes got to face up to the lot next line of action of course is the gambler just sort of fades out of view and if you looked around little while later you might find degraded fragment left and then it sort of disappears the pc meantime has gone on up the tone scale now after this interchange of the counterbalance on the tone scale has taken place under the action of auditing tell now what happens what should you do how would you know whether or not this interchange has taken place how do you know if that valence is flat if your rudiments are totally in and the tone arm is getting motion the valence is flat but you make awful sure that you sweat hard over those rudiments awrrrrrr get them really in before you make final check and make up your mind because the most fruitful source of fouled up cases is unflat valences next to wrong goal wrong terminal now what occurs here what occurs youve got valence flat youve checked it out youve had another auditor test it very carefully on the pc check the pc for rudiments get the rudiments in check the terminal very carefully it is apparently longer active rudiments are in and its not active the pc is not clear what do you do now you do it all over again you do everything that you did before step by step the whole works you do the lot except please dont take so long at it because if you take thirty hours to assess each new goal and each new terminal youre going to find on the pc thirty hours for the goal and fifteen hours for the terminal you are getting up into astronomic figures because at the end of it they will blow it something on the rate of fifty an hour so you see your plot of time is starts being thrown your next assessment is done exactly the same as your first assessment was done you get the original list and you try to add any new goals to it the pc now has you get the rudiments in with great thoroughness and you assess that list and try to find goal and that time you probably will find one you take that goal and you do not use any old terminals list at all you simply go over this situation with the terminal what terminals cause effect and try to find the terminal that will hang up and will register and you assess that exactly the same way as you did before now you take the terminal fit it into the commands which you have been given or in the old way the prehav scale and there are lot of pcs by the way that you will have to run on the old prehav scale run children particularly children you wont be using any other than prehav scale so the prehav scale has not disappeared out of your lives we simply upgraded some of it and the individuals terminal is then assessed on the prehav scale and you run that level and so here we go and its all perfectly okay same way as before except dont expect that to run very long dont expect it to run long dont expect it to run forever i dont know itd be wild guess you couldnt tell how long the second terminal is going to run thered be guessing it at all but it should be much less than the first terminal took but of course many other things could happen and if it starts taking long or as long as the first terminal took you should really get in and check your rudiments and check your do security check and find out what in the name of common sense is going on here because his rudiments out there is difficulty here that had to do with the rudiments not to do with the other now you run that one flat and you do the same thing all over again all in the twentyminute test of the tone arm and you just keep doing this over and over the only trouble is you will very shortly get into this kind of situation it is utterly completely impossible to do an assessment but the thing that you have to face up to is you have to keep trying because the keep trying to do the assessment is actually auditing and youll just blow them by the bucketload youll blow goals goals goals goals goals goals you get goal and it stays in out thuuthuu we got that goal that goals staying in thank heaven well we got that goal staying in all right now how is the terminal now how is the terminal all right lets get list of eight nine ten terminals oh we got these terminals now if we find one reacting there oh well are there any more terminals there are more terminals are there any more you cant get any reaction more terminals and the guy hasnt got any more terminals for that particular goal you go back and you look at the goal it isnt reacting so you get the rudiments in with the greatest of care you see because two reasons the thing can be reacting youre always in the bind as an auditor it isnt reacting because the rudiments are out or it isnt reacting because its flat until you get to be flatout expert on it you wont sometimes be able to tell which so you have to make sure that those rudiments are in and you go back to find the goal which you just found and its gone and its like trying to shuffle quicksilver it just keeps disappearing and the tone arm settles closer closer down to clear and the needle begins to float more and more and then the needle does nothing but float its totally free needle needle is totally free you have to be terribly quick at that particular stage of the game you have to be fantastically fast to get any kind of read at all the pc is the pc isnt stabilized as clear yet see the pcs just borderline clear and hes got stomachache so you sit down and you try to find stomachache and give him an assist or something or find something and trying to get the needle to react enough to find any kind of confusion that would give him stomachache or anything thats left out its just straight on the fly you cant it is not possible to build meter that will react little enough that will still react on the reaction i mean if you cut down the reaction of the sensitivity enough you wouldnt get any reaction of any character whatsoever on the thing that was wrong and the thing is just defeated in all directions but thats perfectly all right theres nothing really wrong with that you merely have to be real fast you have to watch the needle very carefully and you suddenly see that at swing of the needle it did slight hesitation as it went by you got it you got that engram it has to do with murdering eight babies and being operated on and so forth and then you have the pc look it over and youre going to straighten it all out except now its gone and its still there and the pc can put it back and confront it and handle it and so forth well what do you want to know about it the name of the doctor well it was jones and youre not getting any reaction on this thing theres reaction on the pc oh pc has still got pictures thats all it says it blows and that is about the way it goes that is the way the thing rolls on up the line now we just speeded and accelerated this enormously but at the same time we have done this we have taken away one of the tests which you had the test is the prehav level if terminal is wrong or if goal is wrong and the terminal is wrong of course the goal is wrong also the terminal usually is wrong but if the terminal is wrong and you give the pc run on the prehav scale youll have maybe ten levels alive at the first assessment of the prehav scale and you give him run on the prehav scale and then if youve got less levels are alive or react on your first assessment chances are your terminal is right and if there are more your terminal is wrong and you are forewarned from running that terminal any further it isnt necessary for you to run the terminal any further youve got to go back and check the whole thing over again but you havent got this now that youre not running the prehav scale that youre running packaged process you have prevention whatsoever from running bad terminal and let assure you of this that if you run the wrong terminal on pc with this particular process particularly you will just foul up his bank like fire drill that will be one awful mess and i just cannot warn you too much about it it gives us an administrative problem how in the name of common sense are we going to be absolutely sure that everybody who is run to clear all over the world is always run on the right goal and the right terminal because this has been invariable now its very solid its leading right straight through to clearing how can we guarantee that every one found will be the right one how can we guarantee this because theres not even now secondary test to find out if its the right one there is point of skill there is point of skill and excellence so you can only say never run goal and terminal unless its been checked by an expert who has been well trained at saint hill that would be the most conservative thing that you could possibly could do about it i mean i mean the most sensible thing you could i cant see possibly how we could do anything else but that because let let you in on an interesting datum that maybe you dont know we have had lot of people arrive here lot of students arrive here with their goals and terminals already assessed and let tell you they have been assessed with the greatest of care in the best possible spirit and they have been 100 percent wrong and if run they just would have spun somebody right into the ground food for thought isnt it im not exaggerating or trying to tell you how important saint hill is im telling you point of danger on the road running the right terminal does not react the same on pc as running the wrong terminal the misemotional states the pc gets into is not an index of wrong terminal misemotional states will only occur if the right terminal is being run what you get on wrong terminal is rising tone arm which eventually sticks and doesnt blow down youve beefed up the bank and thats what wrong terminal will do on run now there are other things that can make the tone arm do this too the rudiments can be out and the tone arm will do this so if your rudiments are put in then you have an opportunity to sort out the goal and the terminal and make sure theyre right but theres terrible danger im not exaggerating this in actually running very long wrong terminal it is very dangerous the whole bank goes solid and although it will key out in three to seven days if the fellow just you just leave him alone see three to seven days why itll key out hell be feeling all right any psychosomatic hes got is going to get worse but not with any misemotion about it its simply going to get worse the pressure in his chest is going to get harder the pressure on his head is going to get worse that is all its just going to get worse all the way around and the tone arm is going to come up and stick because the bank is getting more solid if you are running the right terminal you generally get more and more action and looser and looser needle and more and more misemotion you get emotional changes if you are running right terminal and if your pc is crying and everything and youre just having hell of time because you havent got big enough mop and if its just terrible whats going on in life and its all so grim and you say well it must be the wrong terminal come up and see sometime i have some antique dueling pistols and you can load them up with ground glass and other bits of razor blades so i can shoot you i have to add that preventive just for one reason because we have had cases of auditors who ran from emotion you know the pc is getting too emotional so lets change the process there must be something wrong because the pcs getting emotional thats the reaction if the pc isnt getting emotional there must be something wrong its just exactly the reverse you see the pc sits there yeah well the rosicrucians they read things yes i left them yes all right good what is my problem yes and this goes on by the hour and theres never any cognitions he never sheds any tears he never says what do you know you got the wrong terminal so there are ways to tell there are ways to tell that youve got the wrong terminal on the pc but the best way to be absolutely sure that you have the right one is the best way and thats to get the right one in the first place and make sure that its the right one before its run thats the achilles heel right now of scientology on routine 3 is getting the right goal and the right terminal because ive just packaged you up set of processes that perhaps will have to be downgraded or rearranged as we run into cases and so forth but for the usual case should blow it straight on through and you dont have to worry about prehav scale if this continues to work out properly may run into some bugs but i dont think so ive been working on it here for months actually and just for the last two weeks have been doing nothing but orienting this set of commands and it looks to like theyre pretty well oriented you could add to them there are quite few commands you could add to them and you get 15 30 40 60 112command bracket you could go on and on and on and what youre trying to strike is the intermediate whereas you give the effective commands which are adequate so they wont hang up the case all right do you understand little bit more of what youre about now with regard to this you say well what where does this leave class ii auditor it leaves class ii auditor right where he is security checking and running problems you say well what happened to all these problems intensives well nothing happened to these problems intensives you can still do problems intensives but i have learned this about problems intensive and you taught that after you found the problem just as youve been going about it you dont dare run the problem the problem is simply an index and an indicator to give you the area of confusion immediately ahead of it and you do nothing but security checking after finding the problem and you never do repetitive run on the problem of any kind you disregard the problem you find the problem find the area of change find the problem and then disregarding that list the personnel in the area of confusion immediately ahead of that and do security check on them and that is how you do problems intensive ill write all this up on form its all good going its just fine itll just work dandy and everybody will be pleased with it and lot of cases make lot more advances than theyre making now people will be set up so that they can be assessed and cleared that never have been before all this is very valuable but just at the present moment why this doesnt happen to be for you youre on your road to clear so dont strike any barricades just go right on through will you by the way by the way you can always talk to did you ever realize that you can always talk to you never realized that well you always can you know the least way you can do so is send note i always see all of them this works for people all over the world i see an enormous amount of correspondence believe and although i sometimes snarl at people on staff for sending note or letter and i sometimes dont see letters and so forth if theyre just totally routine and that sort of thing if somebody really has to i generally i generally listen and before you drop yourself off london bridge i can probably i can probably give you some pointers on waiting on tug schedules so that you wont so if it gets too horrible why you can write note or have word with okay audience yes thank you
