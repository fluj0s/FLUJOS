united states is an event of major significance in american politics because of the enormous power that the supreme court exercises as the highest appellate court in the federal judiciary the chief

individuals havi ng served in that position since 1789 an average tenure of 13½ years per chief justice the process for appointing chief jus tice is the same as for appointing associate justices and

justice nominees may be selected from the ranks of sitting associate justices as three of the 16 chief justices were or from outside the court with each approach from the perspective of the president having certain advantages and disadvantages the criteria that presidents use in selecting supreme court nominee vary but typically involve po licy and political cons iderations as well as desire to select person with out standing professiona l qualifications and unquestioned integrity leader ship qualities may also be important when the chief justice position is involved presidents have also varied in the degree to which they have sought or used advice from senato rs in selecting supreme court nominees as part of senate cons ideration the judiciary committee holds hearings on the nominee and votes on whether to report th nomination favorably unfavorably or without recommendation rega rdless of the outcome of that vote the reporting of supreme court nomination sends it to the full senate for debate and vote like the president senators may evaluate the nominee by such standards as professional excellence integrity and leadership qualities but may also again as the president is free to do focus on the nominees judicial philosophy views on constitutional issues or how they believe the appointment might affect the courts future direction on major legal and constitutional issues under any circumstances the appointment of new chief justice will command the attention of congress especially the senate which votes on whether to confirm judicial nominations even more

the nomination to the full senate which is exp ected to vote on whether to confirm judge roberts on september 29 any supreme court nomination must be confirmed by the u s senate which in recent congresses has been embroile d in controversies over various of the presidents nominations to the lower federal courts at times senate democrats have accused president bush of using his nominating power to appoint to the courts persons having controversial ideologi cal agendas and of making judicial appointments during senate recesses in order to bypass the need for senate confirmation6 senate republicans in turn have accused senate democrats of using their own ideological litmus tests to oppose certain judici nominees and of making improper use of filibusters exte nded debate as delaying tactic on the senate floor to block nate votes on circuit court nominees whom they oppose7 against this backdrop supreme court vacancy can be seen by senators of both parties at least to some extent

process for instance might become more contentious if the appointment of new chief justice were s een as affecting the ideological balance of the court and thus galvanize oppos ition from senators unhappy with the implications of the appointment the pro cess also might become more complicated if another supreme court ppointment needs to be made at or around the same time as the chief justice appointment this situa tion can arise for instance if president nominates an associate justice to be chief justice or if as happened recently an associate justice stepped down at about the same time

judiciary committee holds hearings on the nomination during which the nominee typi cally appears to testify and answer questions from committee members then the committee votes on whether to report the nomination to the senate and if so whether to re port it favorably unfavorably or without recommendation report with negative recommendation or recommendation like favorable report permits the nomination to go forward to be considered by senate as whole but it also alerts the senate that substantial number of committee members have reservations about the nominee in the next stage consideration of the nomination by the full senate is scheduled by the senate majority leader usually in consultation with the minority leader if there is extended debate by opponents of the nomination commonly called filibuster debate may be brought to close by clot ure vote of threefifths of the full senate membership if threefifths of the senates memb ers do not vote in favor of cloture senators opposing the nomina tion even if in the minority may use extended debate and opposition to cloture to prevent vote on confirmation from taking place scenario however which has played out that way only once in the past after senate deba on the nomination is conc luded the senate votes to confirm or disapprove the mination with confirmation requiring majority vote if the senate votes in the negative on whether to confirm the nomination is defeated and resolution of disapproval is forwarded to the president if the senate votes to confirm the nomination the secretary of the senate transmits the resolution of confirmation to the white house where the president signs document called commission offi cially appointing the individual to the court the commission after being

ideological views appear compatible with their own presidents are for the most part resultsoriented this means that they want justices on the court who will vote to decide cases consistent with the presidents policy preferences60 the president also may consider whether prospective nomination will be pleasing to the constituen cies upon whom he especially relies for political support for political or other reasons such nominee attributes as party affiliation geographic origin ethnicity religion and gender may also be of particular importance to the president61 president also might

perform the tasks sp ecific to the position of chief justice such qualities in the presidents view could include administrative and human relations skills with the latter especially important in fostering collegiality among the courts members the presid ent also might look for distinction or eminence in chief justice nominee sufficient to command the respect of the courts other justices as

political geographical personal philo sophical in deciding on successor to vinson ma jor geographical consideration which was said to favor the appointment of earl warren governor of california was that among the courts eight remaining members there were representatives from the west and of the fiftysix appointments to the court since the beginning of the civil war only two had been from california66 however another factor age was said to favor former new york governor thomas dewey who at 51 was 11 years younger than governor warren the reasoning urged upon the president by dewe supporters was that all other things being equal the authority of chief justi ce tends to increase with the duration of his service on the court hence younge rappointed chief justice might have more time for his personality and character to leave strong imprint on the courts decisions and to develop strong lines of allegiance among the other justices67 the news analysis noted that both governors dewey and warren have distinguished legal and administrative records both have impressive traits of character both have strong personal nd political claims on the president but in the last analysis the question is what test will president eise nhower apply when he puts his mind to this momentous decision68 ultimately the president appointed go vernor warren president eisenhower and his closest

candidates for chief jus tice that immediately came to mind the former president recalled most were au tomatically eliminated either because of advanced age or record of unsound healt h these considerations he noted ruled out number of members of the court for evation to chief justice while two other justices represented what i thought were extreme views in matters that could be expected to come before the court for decision74 early in his administration but after th appointment of earl warren as chief justice president eisenhower added another criterion to be applied specifically to the selection of suprem court justices i told the attorney genera l that i would not thereafte r appoint anyone who had not served on lower federal court or on state supreme court my thought was that

senate advice historically presidents have varied in the degree to which they have sought or used advice from senators in selecting supreme court nominees it is common though not universal practice for presidents as matter of courtesy to consult with senate party leaders as well as with members of the senate judiciary committee before choosing nominee77 senators who candidly inform president of their objections to prospective nominee may help in identifying shortcomings in that candidate or the possibility of confirmation battle in the senate which the president might wa nt to avoid conversely input from the senate might draw new supr eme court candidates to th presidents attention or provide additional reasons to nominate pe rson who already is on the presidents list of prospective nominees78 as rule presidents are also careful to consult with candidates homestate senators especially if they are of the same political party as the president the need for such care is due to the longstanding custom of senatorial courtesy whereby senators in the interests of collegial ity are inclined though not bound to support senate colleague who opposes presid ential nominee

or recommending role to the pr esident prior to his selection of nominee in addition to confirming role afterwards82 others by contrast have insisted that the senates advice and consent role was meant to be strictly that of determining after the presidents selection had been made whether to approve the presidents choice83 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32821crs23 83 continued president should secure the

specter rpa regarding the role of senate advice on supreme court appointments at february 24 2005 news conference senator specter in response to stion stated that for president taking advice is not too hard as long as you get to make the final decision and the constitution doesnt say the president should do more than take advice but the constitution does say that there should be advice from the

however the senate is not pr ecluded from confirming the associate justice continuedappointment of an associate justice to be chief justice if successful creates vacancy in the associate justice positi on selecting chief justice nominee from within the court thus affords the presid ent the opportunity in conjunction with the chief justice appointment to make sec ond supreme court appointment to fill the vacancy created by the associate justices elevation it has been suggested that selecting chief justice from within the court and therefore being able to make two court appointments might appeal to president if he is concerned with making the court more in accord with his own values or vision for the court88 instead of selecting chief justice nominee from outside the court and having only one appoin tment opportunity president taking the associate justice option could potentially through car efully screening of nominee candidates name two persons to the court with views and values similar to his own moreover the associate justice vacancy could be regarded as an opportunity to nominate relatively young person to the court whos influence might be felt on the court for years and who himself or herself could at some later point be considered by president for appointment to chief justice the twoappointment option however might pose political pose risks for president depending on the circumstances two nominations for instance might lead to two confirmation battles in the senate generating more conflict or controversy in congresss upper chamber th an the president would care to contend with one supreme court appointment ev of relatively controversial nominee might not provoke widespread opposition in th senate if the ppointment were not by itself seen to portend significant change in the ideological balance of the courts membership by c ontrast two court appointment s made at the same time might if balance on the court were seen to be at stake galvanize the presidents political opponents in the senate to oppose either or both nominees when nominating someone from within the court to be chief justice the president does not have to wait for the chief justice nomination to be confirmed before nominating successor to the associat justice being elevated the associate justice nomination is made with the unders tanding that before its new appointee can take office the associate justice position must become v acant this vacancy occurs only when the chief justice nominee steps down as associate justice which he or she presumably will do only after r eceiving senate confirmation to be chief justice89 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32821crs25 89 continued nomination prior to confirming the chief justice nomination in such an event the confirmed associate justice nominee cannot not assume office until after the chief justice nominee has vacated the associate justice offi ce presumably doing so only after having received senate confirmation there has b een one instance in which such scenario occurred involving the june 12 1941 nominations of associate justice harlan f stone to be chief justice and of senator james f byrn of south carolina to be associate justice the byrnes nomination was confirmed by the senate the same day it was received on june 12 without being referred to committee before the stone nomination was confirmed on june 27 1941 however justice byrnes took the judicial oath of office on july 8 1941 only after chief justice stone took his judicial oath on july 3 1941 90 these were the chief justice nominations of john rutledge in 1795 and charles evans hughes in 1930 both had served as associate ju stices prior to but not at the time of their nominations to be chief justice rutledge from 17901791 and hughes from 1910 to 1916 see table 1 at the end of this report 91 such consideration concerned president rry s truman following the death of chief justice harlan f stone on apr 22 1946 at the time the court was experiencing an internal feud between associate justices hugo l black and robert h jackson with the latter publicly accusing the former of blocking his ascendance to the top spot on the court abraham

position given his demonstrated administrative and legislative leadership he was one of the very few members of the bench to have served in all three branches of the federal government ibidchoosing someone outside the court to be chief justice if the president chooses someone from outside of the court to be chief justice there will be only one vacancy to fill and therefore only one nomination to make thirteen of the courts past chief justices including in this count the first chief justice john jay were selected as nominees from outsi the court although two of them had been associate justices prior to the time that they were nominated to be chief justice90 single chief justice nomination from outside the court might seem the more desirable option to president if he sees clear potential leader or unifier among the courts current associate justices president particularly might be reluctant to choose chief justice nominee from am ong associate justices who are highly polarized or antagonistic to each other as such an appointment might only worsen divisiveness within the court91 in 1969 when explaining his choice of warren burger circuit court of appeals judge to be chief justice president richard m nixon noted that the option of selecting nominee from within the court had been considered by him on at least one occasion the idea was raised presiden t nixon said by

others he said it would be better to bring man from the outside rather than one from the court and with that he took himself out and asked not to consider him92 chief justice nomination from outside the court also allows the white house to concentrate its efforts to secure c onfirmation on one nomina tion rather than on two for the current president george w bush one analyst has suggested that

courts or us circuit courts of appeals are sometimes not reported by the judiciary committee particularly if nominees c onfirmation is opposed by senator from the nominees state114 reporting supreme

is then scheduled by the senate majority leader usually in consultation with the minority leader criteria used to evaluate nominees once the senate begins debate on supreme court nomination many senators typically will take the floor some in their opening remarks will underscore the importance of the senates advice and consent role and the consequent re sponsib ility to carefully determine the qualifications of nominee before voting to confirm invariably each senator who takes the floor will state for the record his or her reasons for voting in favor of or against the nominees confirmation the criteria used to evaluate supreme court nominee are personal very individual matter for each senator118 in their floor remarks some senators may cite nominees professional qualifi cations or character as th key criterion others may stress the importance of the nominees judi cial philosophy or views on constitutional issues while still others may indicate that they are influenced in varying degrees by all of these criteria in recent decades senate debate on virtually every supreme court nomination has focused to some ex tent on the nominees judicial philosophy ideology constitutional values or known positions on specific legal controversies when evaluating chief justice nominee senators can be expected to apply criteria which focus on the unique demands of that office in addition to standards they might apply to supreme court nominees in general this special focus was evident during the senates 1986 debate on the nomination of associate justice william h rehnquist to be chief justice during the debate various supporters and opponents of the nomination based their pos itions in significant part on standards they applied uniquely to chief justice nominee for instance senator joseph r biden jr dde who opposed the nominati on expressed concern as to whether justice rehnquist can serve eff ectively as leader of the court and to my mind this does not mean whether or not he can be an effective administrator or whether or not he will do that expeditiously119 senator biden explaine d that he found justice rehnquist wanting based on two elements
