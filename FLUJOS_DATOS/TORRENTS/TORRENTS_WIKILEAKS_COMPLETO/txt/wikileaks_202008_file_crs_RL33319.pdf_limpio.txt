levels of permanent immigration some question whether the department of homeland security dhs can handle the increased immigration workload there are concerns that the immigration responsibilities in the dhs are not functioning effectively dhs secretary michael chertoff announced second stage review 2sr in 2005 that includes strengthening border security and interior enforcement and reforming immigration processes as major agenda items currently three agencies in dhs have important immigration functions customs and border protection cbp immigration and cust oms enforcement ice and us citizenship and immigration services uscis the immigration functions are dispersed across three agencies within dhs the assistant secretary of ice the commissioner of cbp and th director of uscis all serve with the same rank directly under the dhs secretary of these only the director of uscis has responsibilities that are exclusively immigration while the dhs secretary is the lead cabinet officer on immigration issues he shares substantial immigration policymaking roles with the attorney general and the secretary of state some now argue the disaggregation of the gove rnments immigration responsibilities across several agencies has weakened immigration as policy priority and has made it much more difficult for the executive branch to develop comprehensive immigration reform and border security strategy others maintain that the current organizational structure sharpens the focus on the key yet disparate immigration functions and is optimal from homeland security perspective in seven of the eight workload measures analyzed over the past decade in this report the immigration workload has declined in recent years only removals of aliens has surpassed levels prior to the restructuring of immigration responsibilities while several key workload trends notably border apprehensions and immigration adjudicationsare inching upward the workload trends in asylum inspections naturalization criminal prosecutions and work site enforcement have declined or remained flat thus far independent assessments of the functi oning of immigration in dhs have centered on problems rather than successes indeed the us government accountability office gao has concluded that many of the management problems that existed before the restructuring of the federal immigration functions still remain an underlying question is whether sufficient length of time has elapsed to assess dhss efficacy in managing immigration policy this report does not track legislation and will not be regularly updated

improve dhs management2 currently three agencies in dhs have important immigration functions customs and border protection cbp immigration and customs enforcement ice and us citizenship and immigration services uscis in 2004 the us government accountability office gao reported that many of the management problems that plagued the former immigration and naturalization service ins have carried over to the three dhs immigration agencies 3 late in 2004 the heritage foundation released report that reached the following conclusion in consolidating responsibility for border immigration and transportation security dhs actually increased the number of involved agencies to eight and created additional problems that now need solving 4 there are at least three elements to consider when assessing dhs effectiveness in immigration policy 1 the immigration laws and regulations 2 the management and administration of the agencies charged with implementation of the immigration laws and regulations and 3 the funding resources and staffing to carry out these laws and regulations as figure 1 illustrates these three elements drive the effectiveness of immigration policy over the years congress has considered all three elements to address perceived as well as reported problems in immigration policy 5 1 for example see mark krikorian not so realistic why some immigration reformers

1905 this agency was known as the bureau of immigration and naturalization when the department of labor dol was established in 1913 the immigration and naturalization functions were transferred and

ins arose as the agency was unable to stymie illegal immigration and was faced with growing backlogs of adjudications during this period the gao published several reports that found problems in the administration of adjudications the enforcement of immigration laws and the management of case records overall9 the select commission on immigration and refugee policy scirp which congress established in 1978 offered comprehensive package of recommendations in 1981 that included options aimed at strengthening and streamlining ins scirp referred to ins as beleaguered and specifically recommended that ins be elevated as an agency within doj with the commissioner upgraded to director reporting directly to the attorney general 10 the immigration reform and control act of 1986 irca strengthened

featured many of the recommendations of scirp it did not address the organizational issues raised by scirp indeed some observers have subsequently concluded that irca exacerbated the management problems of ins by overloading it with competing mandates which included the legalization of 27 million unauthorized aliens additional border controls and the expansion of work site enforcement and employer sanctions11 when the commission for the study of international migration and cooperative economic development irca commission which congress blished in irca issued its final report in 1990 it called for the creation of an agency for migration affairs that reported directly to the president the irca commission recommended placing all immigration naturalization and refugee functions from the ins except the law enforcement functions of the border patrol and interior enforcement agents and from the department of state into this independent agency the irca commission argued that consolidating and elevating these functions would address the problems brought on by inadequate prioritization and fragmentation across departments 12 by the close of the 20th century there was widespread concern with ins management that primarily centered on the competing priorities of adjudicating immigration benefits service and enforcing violations of immigration law enforcement in september 1997 the us commission on immigration reform became yet another congressionally mandated study group to point out the administrative and management problems that plagued the implementation of immigration policy it described ins as an agency suffering from conflicting priorities and mission overload whose enforcement and service missions were incompatible the us commission on immigration reform opted not to echo the past commissions proposals to elevate the federal immigration system rather it recommended that the federal immigration system be fundamentally reorganized by among other things dismantling ins 13 gao focused on specific problems with ins most notably for having antiquated databases failing to integrate its systems and continuing the use of paper for tracking most of its data functions the gao reports were critical of the in ss field and regional offices due to an absence of communication among the various offices14 the doj office of inspector general also questioned the reliability of inss information systems and the accuracy of the information15 the last two commissioners of ins doris meisner 19932000 and james ziglar 20012003 each proposed to

secretary exclusive authority through the secretary of state to issue or refuse to issue visas was thorny point the house select committee on homeland security approved compromise language on visa issuances in hr 5005 that retained doss administrative role in issuing visas but added specific language to address many of the policy and national security concerns raised during hearings an

stated that ice would comprise ins interior enforcement functions including the detention and removal program the intelligence program and the investigations program along with the former us custom service interior enforcement activities the administration went on to state that cbp would contain the resources and missions relating to borders and ports of entry of the former us customs service and the former ins including the border patrol and the immigration inspections responsibilities as well as the agricultural inspections function of the agricultural quarantine inspection program 23 the subsequent decision by cbp officials to further integrate the inspection duties so that there is one face at the border meant that cbp inspectors are essentially interchangeable and responsible for all primary inspections cbp inspectors are now charged with enforcing host of laws the ina requires the inspection of all aliens who seek entry into the united states and every person is inspected to determine citizenship status and admissibility all goods being imported into the united states are subject to customs inspection but an actual physical inspection of all goods is not required there also are laws that subject animals and plants to border inspections range of legal administrative and policy issues have emerged with unified border inspections 24 the memorandum of understanding mou that implements 428 of hsa on visa policy and delineates the working relationship between dos and dhss three immigrationrelated bureaus was signed september 28 2003 some have expressed the view that dos retains too much control over visa issuances under the mou maintaining that the hsa intended dhs to be the lead department and dos to merely administer the visa process proponents of dos playing the principal role in visa issuances assert that only consular officers in the field have the country specific knowledge to make decisions about whether an alien is admissible and that staffing 250 diplomatic and consular posts around the world would stretch dhs beyond its capacity 25 as result of hsa the international immigration components now have greater responsibilities than did those of

united states immigration inspectors like their border patrol counterparts are the first line of contact for all aliens seeking entry into the country including asylum seekers who may not have proper documents they play the major role in facilitating the processing of people into the united states as result many view cbp inspectors as retaining the dual functions of enforcement and service 28

the results of this study which he announced in july 2005 became known as the second stage review 2sr the 2sr produced reorganization of the department as well as new policy initiatives 44 several of the policy initiatives that secretary chertoff offered are targeted to immigration concerns among other things chertoff emphasized new approach to securing our borders through additional personnel new technologies infrastructure investments and interior enforcementcoupled with efforts to reduce the demand for illegal border migration by channeling migrants seeking work into regulated legal channels and restructuring the current immigration process to enhance security and improve customer service45 in reorganizing dhs the secretary proposed the abolishment of the directorate of bts but retained the three distinct immigration agencies cbp ice and uscis despite calls from some to merge ice and cbp all of the policy coordination functions initially performed by the directorate of bts are now to

some of which may reflect the allocation of staff and resources and others of which may more simply capture the demand for certain immigration benefits for example the number of naturalization petitions filed in given year are largely influenced by demographic social and political factors that are external to dhs border patrol apprehensions on the other hand are shaped by dhs resources and staffing as well as the social political and economic factors that drive actual incidence of aliens crossing illegally into the united states generally the workload in adjudication of benefits and services results from external factors and the workload in enfo rcement results from combination of resources staffing and external factors the following analysis of the pas dataeven though

need further study notably uscis has evidenced reduction in pending cases however this trend may be as much the result of lessening in the demand for certain immigration benefits as it is of improvements in managing caseload similarly the drop in cbp inspections more likely reflects international travel trends that are shaped more by economic and social phenomena than by cbp policies 60

areas of specific concern none has been more prominent than the problem of integration between ice and cbp during hearing of the house committee on homeland security in march 2005 representative christopher cox thenchairman of that committee offered the following in his opening statement questions remain about whether dhs has organized itself and is managing its immigration enforcement and border security resources in the most efficient sensible and effective manner anecdotal evidence suggests that the division of customs and immigration inspectors from their related investigative colleagues may be building administrative walls and hampering cooperation and information sharing between ice and cbp in critical mission areas some observers also have suggested that the distinction between the interior enforcement activities of ice and the border security functions of cbp are artificial constructs that contribute to needless administrative overlaps programmatic turf battles mission gaps and sometimes dangerous operational conflicts 61 the media often center on anecdotal criticisms by stakeholders one recent article reported that the official said one of the biggest problems is ice and cbp have separate legal offices which sometimes hand down differing legal interpretations disputes also have arisen when ice wants to parole an illegal immigrant in order to pursue investigative leads but cbp objects the official added advocates of stronger immigration enforcement argue that former customs agents at ice do not fully understand immigration laws and are more interested in performing investigations than enforcing immigration rules 62 cable network news shows frequently feature problems along the us border in regular segments63 surveys of public opinion indicate particular concern with illegal immigration and recent survey reported that 61 of respondents disapprove of the administrations handling of illegal immigration64 in addition to the concerns over the integration of ice and cbp and their roles in abating illegal immigration there is reported lack of coordination between uscis and ice in the area of fraud and national security investigations uscis established the office of fraud detection and national security to work with the appropriate law enforcement entities to handle national security and criminal hits on aliens and to identify systemic fraud in the application process 61 house committee on homeland security hearing on cbp and ice does the current organizational structure best serve us homeland security interests

that ice would not pursue single cases of benefit fraud ice field officials who spoke on this issue cited lack of investigative resources as to why they could not respond in the manner uscis wanted65 moreover uscis appears to have problems of its own the dhs inspector general found problems in the background checks for which uscis is now responsible among other findings the report concluded that usciss security checks are overly reliant on the integrity of names and documents that applicants submit and that uscis has not developed measurable riskbased plan to define how uscis will improve the scope of security checks it further stated that usciss management controls are not comprehensive enough to provide assurance that background checks are correctly completed 66 pending caseloads and processing backlogs conti nue to plague uscis gao concluded that it is unlikely that uscis will completely eliminate the backlog of pending adjudications by the deadline of 200667 despite progress in cutting the backlog of pending cases from 38 million in january 2004 to 12 million in june 2005 gao speculates that uscis may have difficulty eliminating its backlog for two complex application types that constitute nearly threequarters of the backlog68 g17g159g142g155g138g155g140g145g146g151g144g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the dispersal of immigration functions across three agencies within dhs means that one person is responsible for immigration policy and operations in clear chain of command the assistant secretary of ice the commissioner of cbp and the director of uscis all serve on parity under the secretary of dhs of these only the director of uscis has responsibilities that are exclusively immigration while the secretary of dhs is the lead cabinet officer on immigration issues he shares substantial immigration policymaking roles with the attorney general who oversees the eoir immigration judges and the board of immigration appeals and the secretary of state who oversees the bureaus of consular affairs and of population refugees and migration does this disaggregation of immigration operations sharpen the focus to perform the disparate functions and prompt sense of responsibility across broader set of managersincreasing the stakeholders and improving administration of immigration law and policies or does the dispersal of immigration functions muddy the chain of

immigration in dhs have centered on problems rather than successes69 these identified problems have ranged from uscis processing of background checks and adjudication of benefits ice worksite enforcement efforts and information technology systems and cooperation between cbp and ice on the usvisit system indeed the gao has concluded that many of the management problems that plagued the former ins remain with the dhs organizational structure70 the paucity of evaluations that describe successes resulting from the current organization of immigration functions does not necessarily mean that the restructuring is failing by their very nature inspector general reports tend only to focus on areas that need improvement it is possible that some of these problems may be the result of inadequacies in the immigration laws or the funding resources rather than the management of the agencies the underlying question remains whether sufficient length of time has elapsed to assess dhss efficacy in managing immigration policy g21g142g149g142g140g157g142g141g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g19g158g142g156g157g146g152g151g156g561 as congress considers whether comprehensive immigration

customs and immigration enforcement would any substantial reorganization of immigration functionsno matter how optimalbe too disruptive to be prudent at this time ultimately these questions are addressed in the broader policy making context congress weighs at least three elements ie the immigration laws and regulations the funding resources and staffing and the management and administration
