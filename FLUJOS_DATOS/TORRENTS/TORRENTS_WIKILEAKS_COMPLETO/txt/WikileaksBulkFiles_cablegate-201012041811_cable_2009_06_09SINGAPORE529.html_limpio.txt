minister mentor mm lee kuan yew chee hong tat principal private secretary to mm cheryl lee country officer americas directorate mfa 3 s summary deputy secretary steinberg used his meeting with minister mentor lee kuan yew to stress the importance of chinese cooperation in addressing the north korea nuclear issue and to elicit mm lees views on china and north korea mm lee said the chinese do not want north korea to have nuclear weapons and do not want north korea to collapse if china has to choose beijing sees north korea with nuclear weapons as less bad than north korea that has collapsed mm lee asked deputy chief of the peoples liberation army pla general staff ma xiaotian what china can do about north korea general mas answer was that they can survive on their own the deputy secretary noted that the dprk could have fair and attractive deal if it would change its approach if not north korea faces change of course by the united states the rok and japan mm lee said he believes japan may well go nuclear mm lee also offered views on the chinese economy taiwan chinese leaders and uschina relations end summary china and north korea 4 s deputy secretary steinberg met with singapore minister mentor lee kuan yew on may 30 on the margins of the shangrila dialogue the annual international security forum held in singapore the deputy secretary used the meeting with mm lee to stress the importance of chinese cooperation in addressing the north korea nuclear issue and to elicit mm lees views on china and north korea mm lee said the chinese do not want north korea to have nuclear weapons at the same time the chinese do not want north korea which china sees as buffer state to collapse the rok would take over in the north and china would face us presence at its border if china has to choose beijing sees north korea with nuclear weapons as less bad for china than north korea that has collapsed he stated 5 s mm lee said he asked deputy chief of the peoples liberation army pla general staff ma xiaotian what china can do about north korea general mas delphic answer was that they can survive on their own mm lee said he interpreted this as meaning that even if china cut off aid the dprk leadership would survive this is leadership that has already taken actions like killing rok cabinet members in burma and shooting down kal flight if they lose power they will end up facing justice at the hague like milosevic they have been so isolated for so long that they have friends not even russia they have not trusted china since the chinese began cultivating ties with the rok given chinas interest in attracting foreign investment he said the deputy secretary noted that the dprk could have fair and attractive deal if it would change its approach if not north korea faces change of course by the united states the rok and japan mm lee expressed worry about the effect on iran if the dprk persists mm lee said he believes the dprk can be contained and will not proliferate but iran has very high ambitions ties to shiite communities outside iran and oil wealth 6 s the deputy secretary noted that north koreas decisions will have an impact in japan mm lee said he believes japan may well go nuclear the chinese must have factored this into their calculations and concluded that the prospect of japan with nuclear weapons is less bad than losing north korea as buffer state the chinese take longterm view and must think that within few years the dprks current leadership will be gone and there will be new leadership with new thinking but there will still be north korea he said 7 s mm lee said he wishes the usg well in its efforts on north korea but he would be surprised if the north koreans agree to give up nuclear weapons they might give up firststrike capacity but they want nuclear weapons in case the usg decides to seek regime change they are psychopathic types with flabby old chap for leader who prances around stadiums seeking adulation mm lee noted that he had learned from living through three and half years of japanese occupation in singapore that people will obey authorities who can deny them food clothing and medicine 8 s mm lee said the rok after seeing what had happened with german unification does not want immediate unification with the dprk there is nothing there in the dprk other than military organization kim jongil has already had stroke it is just matter of time before he has another stroke the next leader may not have the gumption or the bile of his father or grandfather he may not be prepared to see people die like flies china is calculating all this they have their best men on the job they want to help the united states to advance common objectives but they do not want the south to take over the north mm lee said chinese economy 9 c regarding the chinese economy mm lee said the global economic crisis has hit many countries but the feel on the ground differs considerably from place to place the chinese economy is reportedly in the doldrums but when mm lee visited jiangsu province on may 24 his impression was one of continued prosperity shanghai has been harder hit with container port traffic down 3035 percent similar to the situation in singapore there is sign of deep unrest in china the chinese are very confident they will be able to sustain eight percent growth the government is pumping resources into the economy with focus on developing western china whether such policies can be sustained for three to four years is unclear but china can certainly sustain these policies for at least year he said 10 c mm lee stated that in the absence of social safety net in china the chinese savings rate is 55 percent exceeding even singapores 50 percent level consumption accounts for only 35 percent of chinese gdp as opposed to 70 percent of us gdp the chinese leadership may be loath to shift permanently to more consumptionoriented economy but the leadership will do so temporarily if only to avoid unrest 20 million people have moved back to the countryside because of economic dislocations the government is providing microfinance to facilitate the transition the pragmatists are in charge there is nothing communist about it they just want to preserve one party rule the deputy secretary expressed concern that current chinese policies designed to counter the economic crisis could undermine reform mm lee said this cannot be helped china wants to prevent riots like the ones that happened in guangzhou in march when hong kongconnected enterprises suddenly shut down he said taiwan 11 c the deputy secretary asked mm lee for his assessment of taiwan mm lee said former president chen shuibian had left taiwan in weak economic position which had enabled president ma yingjeou to come to power with his pledge to strengthen the economy through means including expanding the three links with china in beijing former president jiang zemin was wedded to his eightpoint approach but president hu jintao was more flexible jiang wanted to show he was great man by solving the taiwan issue in his lifetime but hu is more patient and does not have any fixed timeline in chinese domestic politics hu had wanted vice premier li keqiang from the communist youth league to emerge as his successor not vice president xi jinping but hu did his calculations and accepted xi when it became clear that xi had the necessary backing from the rest of the leadership similarly on taiwan hu will be pragmatic it does not matter to hu if it takes 10 years or 20 or 30 the key is building links with taiwan as in the case of hong kong if necessary the tap could be turned off he said 12 c in this context mm lee said hu could live with mas positions on the 92 consensus and on not addressing the reunification issue during his term in office what mattered to hu was that taiwan not seek independence if that happened china has 1000 missiles and is building its capacity to hold the us fleet at distance the implicit question for taiwans leaders is if that is what they want mm lee said 13 c mm lee stated that the alternative is mainland investment in taiwan stocks and property the mainland has already assured hong kong that it will help out economically the mainland has not said this to taiwan but the mainlands taiwan affairs director wang yi did urge chinese companies to invest in taiwan in four years taiwans economy will pick up and ma will win reelection the dpp lacks strong potential candidates zhenchang is promising but seems unlikely to be able to win meanwhile even the traditionally dppsupporting farmers in taiwans south need chinas market for vegetables and other products taiwans continued participation in the world health assembly depends on beijing beijings calculation seems to be to prevent taiwan independence in the near term then bring taiwan back to china even if it takes 40 or 50 years mm lee said he is looking forward to visiting fujian province where preparations are underway for new southern economic area linked with taiwan xi jinping 14 c the deputy secretary asked if in the future leader like xi jinping would continue the policies on taiwan followed by hu jintao mm lee responded affirmatively xi is princeling who succeeded despite being rusticated when the party needed his talents xi was brought in as shanghai party secretary xi is seen as jiang zemin protege but in another three and half years jiangs influence will be gone the focus now is on maintaining the system there are more strongmen like deng xiaoping jiang did not like hu but could not stop him because hu had the backing of the system and he did not make mistakes wang qishan 15 c mm lee said vice premier wang qishan whom the mm saw in connection with celebrations in may of the 15th anniversary of singaporechina suzhou industrial park is an exceptional talent very assured and efficient wang handled sars superbly when he was in hainan he excelled in coordinating the beijing olympics li keqiang may not get the premiership and the party is looking for way to keep wang on past his 65th birthday until he is 70 mm lee said he had met first wang back in the 1990s but had forgotten their meeting this time when they met wang told lee he had reviewed the records of all lees meeting with chinese leaders going back to the days of deng xiaoping to see how lees thinking had developed wang told lee he respects him as consistent man chinas rise 16 c mm lee said china is following an approach consistent with ideas in the chinese television series the rise of great powers the mistake of germany and japan had been their effort to challenge the existing order the chinese are not stupid they have avoided this mistake chinas economy has surpassed other countries with the exceptions of japan and the united states even with those two countries the gap is closing with china growing at sevennine percent annually versus twothree percent in the united states and japan overall gdp not gdp per capita is what matters in terms of power china has four times the population of the united states china is active in latin america africa and in the gulf within hours everything that is discussed in asean meetings is known in beijing given chinas close ties with laos cambodia and burma he stated 17 c mm lee said china will not reach the american level in terms of military capabilities any time soon but is rapidly developing asymmetrical means to deter us military power china understands that its growth depends on imports including energy raw materials and food this is why china is working with south africa on the chinaafrica development fund china also needs open sea lanes beijing is worried about its dependence on the strait of malacca and is moving to ease the dependence by means like pipeline through burma build ties with young chinese 18 c mm lee said the best course for the united states on china is to build ties with chinas young people chinas best and brightest want to study in the united states with the uk as the next option then japan while they are there it is important that they be treated as equals with the cultural support they may need as foreigners why not have international military education and training imet programs for china why not have chinese cadets at west point alongside vietnamese cadets and indian cadets americas advantage is that it can make use of the talent of the entire world as in silicon valley china still tends to try to keep the foreigners in beijing and shanghai mm lee noted that his own experience as student in the uk had left him with an enduring fondness for the uk when he spent two months at harvard in 1968 an american professor had invited him home for thanksgiving this was not the sort of thing that happened in the uk and lee had realized he was dealing with different civilization in the future chinas leaders will have phds and mbas from american universities he predicted 19 u the deputy secretary has cleared this message visit embassy singapores classified website httpwwwstatesgovgovpeapsingaporeind excfm shields
