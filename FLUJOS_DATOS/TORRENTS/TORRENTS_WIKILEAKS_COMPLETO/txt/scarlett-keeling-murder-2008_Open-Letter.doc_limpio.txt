open letter 6 march 2008 to the director general of police police headquarters panjim goa dear mr brar my name is fiona mackeown i am british national and the mother of scarlett keeling my daughter was reported dead on the morning of 18th feb 2008 we arrived in india on the 22nd nov 2007 and this was the first visit to goa for my daughter scarlett among all my travels i have found goa to be one of the most beautiful places in the world to my mind the only thing more beautiful than the landscape of goa is the people that live here i have found every goan who i have interacted with to be warm friendly and openhearted in my daytoday interactions with the local people i have never faced any rudeness or aggression i love goa and the goans and so do my entire family we retain our dream of someday making goa our permanent home but after the murder of my daughter i have been talking to lot of people both locals and westerners i understand from the experiences they have shared with that there is small group of ten or twelve criminals stalking the beach area and committing crimes like extortion rape and murder none of the victims who are mainly tourists and on shortterm visas have the strength or the resources to move the wheels of justice against this small group of criminals those who do take the first step are strongly dissuaded by your men in uniform i am very fortunate that i came across and have the support of the media advocate vikram varma and his family dakini runningbear as well as the support of many of the locals without this support i would have been just another lost case brushed under the carpet i certainly would not have been able to proceed as i have mr brar in the case of my daughters death your men have lied to about the facts and circumstances they have lied to about her body being found floating in the sea they have lied to that she was wearing her swimwear and had gone for swim in the middle of the night they have lied to as well as the media about her body having bruise marks your police officers have done their best to persuade to quietly take scarletts body and quickly return home to the united kingdom to my simple mind i see that the very men in uniform whom i have trusted to be my first point of contact with justice have brazenly tried to manipulate and thwart justice from their conduct it clearly seems that they consider themselves above the law mr brar i do understand from newspaper reports that in the third week of feb 2008 around the time my daughter was killed some of your men in uniform also went ahead and assaulted sitting mla from taleigaon your men attacked representative of the people his wife and their young i dont know this mla but i can sense the grief of his family i am sure most of the goa police is honest and upright but mr brar some of your men in uniform certainly consider themselves above the law i am sure mr brar that you might turn around and say that you are not responsible for the actions of your men but to my mind as the head of the goa police you are responsible and have failed to take timely action in the matter i have given written communication to you on the 22nd of feb 2008 regarding my convictions of foul play yet you have neither taken step forward nor shown any signs of sympathy directly or through any of your officers i would have expected man as senior as you to have the level of sensitivity and values required to head police force but unfortunately what is clear to is that you have not aligned yourself with the millions of good goans but have chosen to shield the actions of this small group of ten to twelve criminals and few policemen who consider themselves above the law your actions in this direction and considerable inertia towards justice leave doubt in my mind you have still not answered the key questions about why you are shielding the officers 1 who repeatedly lied to and the media about bruises being on the body of my daughter 2 who misinformed the pathologist about the circumstances of the body and the possible cause of her death 3 who cajoled and convinced that it is simple case of drowning and i must take her body back home quickly 4 who sent four male officers to stare at my daughters naked body while i identified her and spent that half an hour with her dead body for the first time most probably you would maintain your inertia and silence on this issue and there is nothing i can do about it i am single mother of eight children and i do not have the might or power to confront man in your position with the truth in fact i do not even have access to an audience with you but i do believe in god and the indian judiciary and am confident that my daughter would get justice god bless you fiona mackeown
