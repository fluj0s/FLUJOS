from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to kevin trenberth trenbertcgducaredu subject some weekend thoughts date mon dec 13 092924 2004 kevin read everything over the weekend and here are few comments glad i did this yesterday as not thinking too well at the moment as daughterinlaw in labour for the last 4 hours news yet just waiting havent made any alterations yet here are my thoughts 31 ill make few cosmetic changes mainly to refer to the appendices couple of times re significance box 33 reads better will replace with this one when merge is done 34 3415 needs some work doesnt seem to read or flow that well 3421 maybe need to expand on homogeneity tests 3422 4th seems little at odds with previous one 3423 3424 ok 343 clouds needs some more work to develop clearer message youre aware of this 344 radiation similar comments to the cloud section i have some specific notes for both despite this probably ok for the zod maybe all we need to do is to highlight this to the reviewers 35 section seems overlong i know youve reduced it lot contains number of sentences where english could be improved 351 ok 352 significance levels for fig 351 need some discussion well need to work some on this figure 353 and 354 ok for the zod with few better sentences 355 and 356 both sections seem overlong again know youve reduced this lot but if we need reductions here is good place 357 ok box 35 ok 36 generally good 361 ok 362 probably remove the impact leave for the moment though 363 ok 364 i can improve this little it isnt all scandinavian glaciers that are advancing just those in sw norway those in the north of sweden are retreating 365 ok 366 367 basically ok may need more re acw and sam link if we can say anything 37 this is probably too long so would be another area for some reduction agree on your suggestions for deletions as repetitive 37113713 ok though all little long 3714 this is the one where there is some repetition not much on monsoon lot here is already in 38 on extremes and the dai et 2004 paper is now referred to in 33 here and in 38 suggest it should just be in 33 and again in 39 it isnt there yet your figures seem in better shape than those in my section we will likely need to work on the one dennis is doing will need some colour youre aware of which need more work from your comments we can leave these in for reviewer and thoughts dave has sent first go at the figures made loads of suggestions dave was aware colour choices poor and will be doing more on them today is chris landsea the only person youve removed from the ca list so far it seems so i should have time tomorrow onwards to do merging and send out the 3 files to all our are you happy with merging in your refs list ill keep the discard ones at end in separate list still hopeful of doing all this by close of play here on thursday all day in london on friday and cru party today week from 11am onwards going for dec 16 means i will only be able to get some of the figures in 32 and 33 properly into the text will send daves next figure versions if they are much better point with current one still news cheers phil at 2116 10122004 you wrote phil attached are the three sections please use these for any suggested edits of the text 37 is losest and needs careful comparison with 33 to check for inconsistencies there is model stuff in there that is not quite right or incomplete i removed some there is reduncdant ensorelated stuff lot of the monsoon variability is linked to enso and we could say that succinctly but it would decimate what the cas and panmao have done i think we will need to do this in beijing but i left it for now note the refs has list of discards at the end suggest we keep this perhaps in different file and if stuff gets deleted with references then the refs get moved there some of the figures are not quite in order in 36 and their is the extra figure that dennis generated not currently referred to key question is whether to follow up on this and how to make the multiple figs in 36 more compatible i know you have suggestions on long time series and i urge you to keep in mind the purpose here to show the past variability and place recent trends in that context lot could be done on indices and assoc plots and patterns i think we have license to do some of this as long as the figs are in literature but we may not be able to reproduce the results i have hedged lot on clouds and radiation and maybe clarification will come see if you think it is ok for now note these 3 versions are dated 1210 10 dec they replace entirely the 1204 versions which you can discard kevin kevin trenberth email trenbertucaredu climate analysis section ncar 1wwwcgducareducas p box 3000 303 497 1318 boulder co 80307 303 497 1333 fax street address 1850 table mesa
