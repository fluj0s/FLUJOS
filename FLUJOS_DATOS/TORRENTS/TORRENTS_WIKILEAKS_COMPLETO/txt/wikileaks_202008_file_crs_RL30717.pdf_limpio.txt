determining paternity and identifying human remains research is resulting in improvements in sensitivity and power and reductions in cost such use and improvements are raising several policy issues the use of dna in identification results from its unique characteristics it is complex molecule containing much information each person has billions of identical copies the structure of the molecule varies from person to person and is inherited so the dna of relatives is more similar than that of unrelated people also dna is easily preserved with the structure intact identification requires comparing dna whose source has not been determined with dna whose source is known the first step is to characterize corresponding dna sequences from samples the resulting profiles are then compared if they differ the samples did not have the same origin if they match then they could have come from the known source or from someone else who has an identical profile the science of population genetics provides ways of estimating quantitatively the chances that the matched dna could have come from another source databases or indexes are often used in dna identification they might contain profiles of persons whose ident ity is known such as convicted felons or whose identity is not known such as from crime scene samples or unidentified remains the combine d dna index system codis administered by the fbi contains both kinds when profile is obtained from relevant sample the database can be searched to determine if match is found thus suspect may be identified when profile from crimescene sample is searched against profiles of convicted felons congress has enacted several laws relating to dna evidence the dna identification act of 1994 pl 103322 authorized codis and grants program for state and local laboratories and addressed quality control and privacy issues the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pl 104132 expanded codis and established grants program that required states to be eligible to collect dna samples from persons convicted of felony sex crimes the crime identification technology act of 1998 pl 105521 established grants program that funds broad range of activities including several related to dna typing the national institute of justice nij and the bureau of justice assistance bja administer those and other relevant grants programs the national institute of standards and technology nist the armed forces institute of pathology afip and the army criminal investigation laboratory usacil also have significant dna identification activities policy issues raised by the use of dna in identification include how best to eliminate the large backlog of samples awaiting processing for codis whether to broaden the offenses that qualify how to respond to the increasing number of requests for postconviction dna analysis how to address privacy issues and what impacts the broadening applications of the technology may have

dna identification applications and issues introduction as our understanding of human genetics has become more and more sophisticated scientists have developed incre asingly powerful tools using genetic information to aid in identifying individual people dna can be helpful in many situations where identification is at question for example in criminal cases forensic dna evidence can link suspect or weapon such as knife to crime scene it can also exclude suspect the best known sources of dna evidence are blood and semen but increasingly it can be obtained from other items such as bottle cap toothbrush bite mark on piece of cake or fragment of contact lens another use is to identify human remains such as of soldier killed in battle or it might be used to determine biological relationship such as in paternity cases this report focuses on using human dna to determine individual identity but animal and plant dna can also be used to identify species for example did sample of meat come from protected whale species or even individuals did seed pod found in truck come from particular tree at crime scene1 those and similar developments raise several policy issues including the use of genetic information in the criminal justice system the impacts of continuing technological improvements and the effects of the technology on privacy and individual rights this report provides an overview of how genetic information is used in identification and some of the issues associated with those uses it begins by discussing the unique properties of genetic information that make it powerful tool for identification and what is involved in making identifications from physical evidence next is description of current federal programs and activities related to dna identification followed by discussion of issues raised by the development of this new technology legislation activity in the 106th congress focused on several criminaljust ice issues for detailed discussion see crs report rl30694 dna evidence legislative initiatives in the 106th congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs2 2 it is sometimes also called dna testing in this report for clarity that term is used only to refer to medical tests 3 for more indepth description see human genome program us department of energy primer on molecular genetics washington dc 1992 httpwwwornlgovhgmis publicatprimerprimerpdf 4 the human genome project is an international effort performed with both government and private funding the us federal effort began in 1988 with the signing of memorandum of understanding between the department of energy doe and the national institutes of health nih at doe the program is housed in the office of biological and environmental research ober within the office of science see the doe genome project website at httpwwwscdoegovproductionoberhug_tophtml for more information at nih the program resides in the national human genome research institute nhgri see the nhgri website httpwwwnhgrinihgov80indexhtml for more information nhgri was established by statute under the name national center for human genome research in the national institutes of health revitalization act of 1993 pl 10343 the doe genome efforts do not have separate statutory authorization 5 the major exceptions are germ cells eggs sperm and their precursors which have 23 single not paired chromosomes and red blood cells which have dna dna extracted from blood comes from white blood cells the dna sequences in different germ cells are not identical because each contains half the full dna complement partially mixed through process called recombination also rare changes called mutations can occur in sequence through damage errors in replication or other means only mutations that occur in the germ cell line can be inherited they are called germline mutations all others are called somatic mutationswhy dna can be used in identification the use of dna in identification sometimes called dna typing or dna profiling2 results from its unique characteristics those characteristics also affect how it can be used and the issues that arise from using it key features are described below it is complex molecule containing much information dna is chemical deoxyribonucleic acid consisting of modular components called nucleotides that are connected in linear sequence each nucleotide contains one of four bases called adenine cytosine guanine and thymine often designated by their initials c g and t each dna molecule consists of two complementary strands with each adenine on one strand paired with thymine on the other and each guanine with cytosine the sequence of bases strung along dna molecule contains the information that forms the basis of the genetic code of humans and most other organis ms3 much of the growing body of knowledge about dna comes from efforts of the human genome project major goal of which is to create map of the code and identify the sequence of bases on the dna molecule4 dna identification technologies tap small part of the large set of information that the molecule contains each person has billions of identical copies of dna in the cells of the body most of the billions of cells in persons body contain identical sets of dna molecules5 approximately 3 billion basepairs per cell altogether most of the dna is contained in 23 pairs of chromosomes in the nuclei of cells within each pairhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs3 6 except for mutations and certain other minor variations 7 except for the sex chromosomes in males see below 8 the technical term is homozygous if they are identical and heterozygous if they are different 9 exceptions are mitochondrial dna and the sex chromosomes in males in whom the chromosome is much smaller than the x and contains many fewer alleles 10 the power of using this maleline inheritance of the ychromosome was demonstrated in the genetic research that provided strong support for the assertion that thomas jefferson fathered at least one by sally hemings eugene foster and others jefferson fathered slaves last child nature 396 1998 2728 11 except for mutations one chromosome is inherited from the mother and the other from the father some dna inherited only from the mother is also contained outside the cell nucleus in structures called mitochondria which are small bodies with many copies in each cell because the human body contains so many copies of dna even very small amount of body fluids or tissues such as blood or skin can yield useful identifying information the structure of the molecule and therefore the information it contains varies from person to person dna sequences from any two people will be the same at many points along the dna molecule but the overall nuclear dna sequence of each person is unique except for identical twins who have identical dna6 on single chromosome individual alleles which are discrete components of dna sequence are inherited intact each pair of chromosomes has many pairs of alleles7 the total number is as yet unknown with one member of the pair inherited from the father and the other from the mother the region of pair of chromosomes containing pair of alleles is called locus the dna of the two alleles inherited at any particular locus may have identical or different basepair sequences8 it is the substantial variation in dna among people that is characterized with the technologies used in dna identification the struc ture is inherited so the dna of close relatives is more similar than that of distant relatives or unrelated people since half of persons dna comes from each parent9 full siblings also share half their alleles on average and grandparents and first cousins one quarter however since receives his chromosome from his father all the alleles on that chromosome are identical to the fathers and are inherited through the paternal line alone10 similarly all alleles in mitochondria are identical to the mothers and are inherited through the maternal line alone11 therefore the mitochondrial dna of male for example will be identical to that of his maternal grandmother and his ychromosome dna identical to that of his paternal grandfather the inheritance patterns of dna mean that analyzing persons dna can also provide identifying information about relative most of persons dna has known biological function genes are segments of dna that contain the code for making specific chemicals mostly proteins humans have tens of thousands of genes the exact number is not yet known buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs4 12 rflp stands for restriction fragment length polymorphism chemical called restriction enzyme cuts the dna molecule in certain restricted places corresponding to particular base sequences the result is pieces of dna called restriction fragments that vary among people are polymorphic in length rflp and vntr are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to the analysis of vntrs using rflp technology they comprise only small part of persons dna most of whic h has known function however many nonfunctional segments of persons dna can be characterized with the techniques of molecular biology those segments are called markers the distinction between genes and markers has implications for use in identification that will be discussed later dna is easily preserved with the structure intact dna is surprisingly stable chemical and sequences can be easily preserved intact in dried or frozen samples however dna can be degraded particularly in warm or moist environments or in the presence of many common chemicals the ability to use dna in identification depends both on the size and the condition of the sample that has consequences for sample collection handling and storage in applications such as law enforcement how dna is used in identification using dna in identification requires compar ing dna whose source has not been determined such as from crime scene or from child in paternity case with dna whose source is known such as from suspect or from putative father four basic steps are involved characterization comparison calculation and interpretation they are each discussed below along with implications for applications and issues characterization the first step is to characterize or profile corresponding dna sequences in the samples to be compared for forensic evidence in criminal case one or more samples of blood semen or other sources of dna related to the crime will be processed as will usually sample from one or more suspects it is not possible with current technology to characterize the entire dna sequence instead alleles at specific loci are characterized the technique used depends on the particular kind of marker the major kinds of markers in use today are vntrs strs mtdna and certain simpler sequences for most of the fifteen years during which dna typin g has been used in forensics vntrs variable number of tandem repeats have been the major kind of marker used they have the greatest potential power to identify or exclude because they vary more from person to person than any other dna system used in identification they consist of sections of dna in which sequence of about 1570 bases is repeated many times analysis of sample using vntrs measures the approximate number of repetitions in each marker examined that number varies substantially from person to perso n analysis of vntrs uses rflp12 technology which requires that substantially more dna be present and in good condition in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs5 13 twelve str loci provide about the same power to identify as five vntr loci for most populations dennis reeder national institute of standards and technology conversation with the author 9 june 2000 the current standard set of str loci established by the federal bureau of investigation for use in law enforcement contains 13 loci 14 armed forces dna identification laboratory afdilabout usmtdna httpwwwafiporgoafmednamtdnahtm 22 october 1999 sample than do the other systems described below therefore many samples that are degraded or have very small amounts of dna cannot be processed using vntrs strs short tandem repeats also consist of repeated sequences but the number of bases repeated is smaller 24 as is the total length of dna comprising an allele approximately 100300 bases for strs versus 50010000 for vntrs strs are not as variable as vntrs and therefore more loci must be typed to obtain the same resolving power as with vntrs13 nevertheless strs can be examined with much smaller samples for example requiring bloodstain the size of pinhead rather than one the size of quarter coin for two reasons first dnaamplification procedures known as pcr the polymerase chain reaction can be used the process uses the ability of dna to replicate itself to make many identical copies from small initial amount of dna the procedure does not yet work with vntrs second because the sequences are shorter they are less likely to be damaged if the sample is degraded therefore such samples can often yield more usable results with strs than with vntrs strs also have some other technical advantages over vntrs in particular they can be processed in the laboratory much more quickly and they are easier to interpret for those reasons strs which first became available for forensic use few years ago are quickly replacing vntrs as the standard marker for typing mitochondrial dna mtdna can be used in even smaller or more degraded samples than strs that is because the relevant dna sequences are moderately short approximately 1200 bases or less there are thousands of copies per cell and they can be amplified this kind of dna can be extracted even from skeletal remains and has been used for example in identifying the remains of armed forces personnel from conflicts as far back as world war ii14 because of the way it is inherited mtdna from remain s must be compared with samples obtained from maternal relatives therefore it cannot be used to distinguish among maternally related persons also mtdna is not as variable as strs and vntrs and it is therefore not as powerful tool for making positive identifications it also takes much longer to analyze than strs some other nuclear dna markers such as dqa and polymarker are also used to aid in identification those consist of simpler dna sequences than strs or vntrs they can be amplified and require only small amounts of dna but they are less variable than strs or vntrs and some of the loci used are closely linked to genes or are genes themselves however they can be processed very rapidly and are often used to determine quickly whether potential source of dna should be eliminated or investigated further using more sensitive marker systems they are also used extensively in paternity cases httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs6 15 louis j freeh ensuring public

september 1999 2 available at httpwwwojpusdojgovnijpubssum177626htm 17 however those distinctions between interpretation of fingerprint and dna analysis are beginning to blur see section on interpretation below comparison once dna from the samples is character ized the resulting profiles are compared if one or more alleles differ in the two samples they are said not to match in that case if the analysis was performed correctly the samples did not have the same origin in the case of criminal suspect that means that the suspect did not produce the dna found in the evidence in paternity case it means that the putative father was not the biological father if an attempt is being made to identify remains using mtdna it means that the person whose remains were typed is not related to the supposed maternal relatives this use of dna as means of exclusion is powerful and important use particularly in the criminal justice system common estimate is that onequarter of named suspects are excluded in cases where dna evidence is used15 also in the past few years more than 60 people convicted of violent crimes in the united states have been subsequently exonerated as result of dna evidence16 if the profiles match that is if they are identical at every locus then they could have come from the same source alternatively the source could be someone else who has an identical profile for the markers that were examined the way such match is treated in dna evidence has usually been different than for other sources of identifying information such as fingerprints in the latter match has usually been considered either positive identification or inconclusive for example either the suspect left the fingerprints or could not be ruled out depending on the quality of the print for dna in contrast the science of population genetics provides in many cases way of estimating quantitatively the chances that the dna could have come from another source the chances of such coincidental match depend on both the number of mark ers used and the variability exhibited by those markers therefore results of dna analysis have usually been given in terms of the probability that such match could be coincidental rather than conclusion about identity17 calculation for several years there was controversy about how best to perform calculations to estimate probabilities in dna identification but that issue is now largely although not completely settled the specific procedures can be complex and will vary depending on the circumstances and the system used however there are two basic steps httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs7 18 see for example federal bureau of investigation vntr population data worldwide survey 5 volumes quantic va fbi academy 1993 the data are drawn from anonymized samples from blood banks or other sources they should not be confused with the databanks housing dna profiles of convicted criminals which are discussed below 19 for example if the dna comes from different kinds of tissues or fluids as in vaginal swab from sexual assau lt it is often possible to separate the male and female dna however if dna from more than one male is present separating those is often not possiblethe population frequency of each allele in the profile that is the percentage of people who have that allele in the population examined is identified in most cases those frequencies are estimates drawn from extensive data banks such as those compiled by the fbi18 subpopulations within country such as the united states vary in the frequencies of different alleles and therefore comparisons may be made to data from the most relevant subpopulation usually racial or linguistic group or if it is not known what group the source of dna belonged to as is often the case with dna from crime scenes from two or more subpopulations the frequencies are multiplied together with the aid of appropriate mathematical formulas to produce an estimated probability that someone drawn at random from the population would have that profile if enough loci are used those probabilities can be very small on the order of one chance in billions or even trillions even though the frequency of any given allele is likely to be on the order of 110 in some cases probability calculations may not be appropriate or useful for some loci the frequencies of alleles in the population as whole might not be known or there might be too few loci or too few alleles at locus to yield useful probability estimates in such case match means that putative source cannot be excluded but there might be many other potential sources or the particular case might not require calculation for example if the question is which of two men fathered child calculation is necessary if the profile of one yields match and the other does not or in case of identification of remains with mtdna it might be known that soldier came from one of four families if the maternal mtdna profile of only one of the four yields match then the soldier came from that family however if more than one source produces match in either of those two examples then dna eviden ce cannot resolve the question unless more loci can be examined another situation that can present problems for making useful calculations is where dna from more than one person is in the sample in such mixed samples if the dna contributed by different people cannot be separated19 then it might only be possible to determine if someone can be excluded interpretation there are two essential questions involved in interpreting the results of dna identification did the dna come from the person or family who is thought to be its source and what is the significance of the answer for the case at hand the probability calculation when performed is used to help answer the first question if the probability estimate is low enough the expert who provides it mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs8 20 for example in 1997 fbi experts switched from simply providing probability estimates to stating in addition that person whose profile matches sample is the source of the sample provided that the calculated match probability is less than about 1

of dna evidenc 9 april 2000 httpwwwojp usdojgovnijdnamtgtrans9transehtml for comparison that probability is about 150 the chance that person drawn at random from the entire world population would have that profile the original scientific work that provided the basis for the use of fingerprints in identification established that the probability of second person having the same fingerprint pattern on given digit was about 140 the reciprocal of the world population at the time national research council the evaluation of forensic dna evidence washington dc national academy press 1996 57 the average match probability yielded by using 12 of the 13 core str markers used by the fbi is about 1 in 700 billion james f crow research and development working group report proceedings national commission on the future of dna evidence 28 february 1999 httpwwwojpusdojgovnij dnamtgtrans4trans chtml nevertheless many forensic experts prefer to provide probabilities but not state firm conclusions about the source of the dna 21 such misinterpretation s are sometimes called the prosecutors fallacy this can be surprisingly complex issue and technical discussion of it is beyond the scope of this report for more information see nrc evaluation of dna evidence 133 198 and david h kaye and george f sensabaugh jr reference guide on dna evidence in reference manual on scientific evidence 2nd ed washington dc federal judicial center 2000 539 continueddeclare positive identification that the person in question was in fact the source of the dna20 however the question of what probability level or other criterion is required to ensure positive dna identification is not yet settled and in many cases experts may be reluctant to make such declaration preferring to provide simply the probability estimate for the jury or other trier of fact to interpret that is in contrast to the situation with fingerprints which are accepted as unique even in identical twins unlike dna but for which probabilities are not calculated fingerprints have been used effectively for much longer than dna so little question remains about how they can provide positive identification in addition they are not as amenable to statistical analysis as is dna evidence although that is beginning to change as automated fingerprint analysis systems are developed and refined however with dna triers of fact may interpret very low probability estimate as positive identification provided that there are significant questions about how the evidence was handled the quality of the laboratory analysis or special circumstances of the case once positive identification has been made or found very likely its significance must be determined that would seem straightforward but is not always for example in rape case involving dna evidence if the probability of coincidental match is very small that would be strong evidence of sexual encounter but would not of itself be proof of guilt since the encounter might have been consensual however unlikely it is also possible for example that there was laboratory error or even that blood or other sources of dna might have been planted by someone wishing to frame suspect for those and other reasons match probability in criminal case should not be interpreted as probability of guilt21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs9 21 continued available at httpairfjcgovpublicfjcwebnsfpages16 22 such socalled convenience samples might seem unlikely to generate accurate frequencies of the distribution of alleles in the underlying population but they work

httpwwwfbigovpressrmpressrelpressrel99 coldhithtm kathleen sweeney dna testing links rapes to slain man florida times union thursday 22 july 1999 sec 1 the index system is discussed below however it does provide evidence for the jury or judge to consider in determining whether the accused was the perpetrator of the crime databases databases or indexes used in dna identification are of three basic kinds one provides the allele frequencies that are used in calculations to estimate profile frequencies and match probabilities such population databases are drawn from anonymous samples and are separated or stratified according to the population group usually based on ethnicity or race of the donors since allele frequencies and therefore match probabilities for different profiles may differ among such groups sources are various such as blood donors or medical patients22 the secon d kind contains profiles of persons whose identity is known one example is databases with str or vntr profiles of convicted felons or of victims of unsolved crimes such as the codis database system discussed below another is databases with profiles of missing persons or their biological relatives such as mtdna profiles of maternal relatives of armed forces personnel lost in past military conflicts see below when profile is obtained from relevant sample whose source is not known the database can be searched to determine if match called cold hit is found for example in an increasing number of cases suspect is identified when dna profile from crimescene sample is searched against database containing profiles of persons convicted of violent crimes or other felonies the third kind of database contains profiles of persons whose identity is not known samples might come from crime scenes or unidentified remains when profile is obtained from relevant sample whose source is known the database can be searched for cold hits as above for example profile obtained from suspect in another crime can be searched against forensic database of profiles associated with crimes for which there are suspects in 1999 dna profile of male murdered in florida was found to match dna evidence from nine

afrssir collects and stores dna samples taken from active duty and reserve personnel39 armed forces personnel are required to provide dna samples for deposit in the repository currently the repository

applications of advances in genomics43 the national science foundation an independent agency supports relevant basic research in molecular biology and in the social sciences at universities and other research institutions44 relevant public laws when dna evidence first became available in the united states questions often arose about the quality of analyses and the absence of widely accepted standards45 also the typing of specimens was expensive46 and its availability to many state and local law enforcement agencies was therefore uneven the dna identification act of 1994 subtitle of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 pl 103322 addressed quality control and privacy issues it authorized the dnahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs16 identification grants program administered by nij see above the law authorized appropriations for the program through fy2000 it also authorized use of drug control and system improvement grants for similar purposes 42 usc 3751 those grants are part of the edward byrne memorial state and local law enforcement assistance programs or byrne grants the dna identification act required that forensic laboratories receiving the grants follow specified quality assurance and privacy provis ions recipients are to meet current qualityassurance standards as specified by the fbi director and undergo regular proficiency testing in dna analysis the use of dna samples analyzed by recipients are restricted to use in law enforcement judicial proceedi ngs and criminal defense however anonymized samples can also be used in population databases research and quality control activities the act also provided for the establishment of the fbis dna advisory board to recommend qualityas surance and proficiencytesting standards to the director sec 210303 and required that fbi personnel engaging in dna analysis undergo regular proficiency testing sec 210305 it also authorized the establishment of codis indexes containing profiles of

106th congress see crs report rl30694 for discussion of those legislative initiatives httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs17 47 steadman survey 6 48 see codis offender database backlog reduction discussion proceedings national commission on the future of dna evidence 23 november 1998 httpwwwojpusdoj govnijdnamtgtrans3transkhtmllaw enforcement and criminal justice sample backlogs dna samples are now collected in all 50 states from persons convicted of certain crimes also dna evidence is routinely gathered from crime scenes and victims in cases of rape murder and other violent crimes as dna technology has improv ed and states have increased its scope in criminal justice activities see next section the workload in forensic laboratories has increased for example from 1996 to 1997 casework increased 40 from total of about 15000 to 21000 and convictedoffender samples increased more than 60 from 72000 to 11600047 given limited resources forensic laboratories must prioritize the analysis of those and other samples they receive therefore many samples such as from scenes of crimes for which there are suspects and from convicts who are not suspects for additional crimes are given lower priority currently there is backlog in the united states of several hundred thousand such samp that have not been analyzed and entered into codis databases that means that profiles from those samples are not available for database searches given that cold hits have been identified through such searches the dna commission and others have proposed that funding be increased to process that backlog also the 30 million appropriated by congress in fy2000 for dna grants included funding for processing backlogged samples an additional factor is the conversion of existing profiles from vntrs to strs some states have not converted to using the core str markers and profiles that use other markers cannot be searched against ndis or codis str records conversion requires that dna sample be retyped reanalyzed with str technology more than 200000 existing profiles may need such retyping also there are many owed samples that is samples that can be taken under existing law but have not been those include many paroled or released convicts the number of such owed samples nationwide may exceed the number currently backlogged48 failure to process backlogs may have several consequences crimes that might be solved with the help of database match may remain unsolved that is of particular concern in cases where perpetrator is likely to perform additional crimes or where database match would prevent an innocent person from being wrongly suspected or perhaps even charged with the crime also crimescene samples from unsol ved crimes may eventually be destroyed as statutes of limitations expire permanently eliminating any possibility of typing any dna evidence the size of the backlog makes the question of prioritizat ion particularly important but it is not straightforward for example typing persons dna is usually much less expensive than typing dna from crime scene because in the latter case several samples must usual ly be processed and unlike with convicted offender samples processing cannot usually be automated with existing technology that might suggest that the highest priority should be given to typing convictedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs18 49 adams hearing statement figures cited are as of december 1999 from an fbi survey of laboratories participating in codis states have continued to pass laws expanding the list of qualifying crimes so the numbers cited for some categories have since increased 50 among the additional recordable offenses are public drunkenness taking part in prohibited assembly and certain kinds of illegal hunting government of great britain the national polic records recordable offences regulations 2000 statutory instrument 2000 1139 28 april 2000 available at httpwwwhmsogovuksisi2000 20001139htm 51 the forensic science servic annual report and accounts 19992000 25 july 2000 continuedpersons since many more samples could be processed per dollar invested however to make successful cold hit requires that crimescene samples also be typed so that they can be compared with the profiles of convicted persons also logistically it is often easier to obtain sample from someone newly in custody than from someone who has been released however person while in prison is not threat to the community whereas someone who has been released might be nevertheless prisoner might be discovered through dna analysis to have committed other crimes before having been imprisoned finally solving old crimes with the help of dna evidence serves justice and might help prevent future crimes but it might also have negative consequences for example reopening case that is several years old might retraumatize victims or their families who have worked to recover from the effects of the crime additional federal funding to help reduce the backlog could substantially increase the speed with which backlogged samples are processed easing uncertainties about how best to prioritize the samples and increasing the rate at which crimes are solved also the existence of the backlog could be attributed in part to the success of the dna identification act grant program and the granteligibility requirements in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 discussed above in addition the processing of backlogs would have benefits across states especially with respect to travelling offenders who commit crimes in more than one state databases central issue relating to the kinds of crimes for which dna is collected from convicted persons for inclusion in profile database or index states vary in the crimes for which they collect dna samples qualifying offenses include at minimum felony sex crimes but several others are included by different states offenses against children 40 states murder 36 assault and battery 27 kidnapping 22 robbery 19 burglary 14 and all felonies 6 also 24 states collect samples from juvenil convicted of qualifying offenses most collect retroactively from incarcerated convicts and some collect from those previously paroled or on probation49 in the united kingdom the forensic science service an executive agency of the home office maintains national database with dna profiles of suspects charged reported cautioned or convicted for recordable offence which is any crime punishab by imprisonment plus certain other specified offenses50 profiles are removed if suspect is exonerated or acquitted as of july 2000 the uk database held approximately 700000 profiles and had yielded more than 77000 matches of suspects to crime scenes since its inception in 1995 with almost 130000 profiles removed following acquittal51 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs19 51 continued available at httpwwwforensicgovukforensiccorporateannual_rep annual_report2000pdf 2021 52 the answer to these two questions depends on several factors one is the frequency with which those who commit nonviolent crimes also commit other crimes that dna evidence would help to solve there are few data on this topic so far but the experience of virginia might be illustrative using convictedoffender database of approximately 118000 profiles as of june 2000 virginia obtained 156 matches of offenders to crimes the state collects dna samples from everyone convicted of felony dr paul ferrara director of the virginia division of forensic sciences has estimated that about half of those hits would not have occurred had the database been limited to violent offenders personal communication with the author 28 august 2000 another factor is the cost of collecting samples and analyzing the dna for convicted offender the dna commission has estimated the latter at approximately 50 per sample with current technology but it can vary significantly depending on circumstances third factor is costeffectiveness of other methods of crime solving and prevention these and other factors involved can be difficult to measure and compare accurately 53 rose marie arce surveillance and dna testing are among the latest police weapons but how will we balance fighting crime and preserving civil rights newsday 30 may 1999 sec 17 see the section on privacy below for further discussion of this issuein determining whether to broaden the range of qualifying crimes questions might be raised such as the following what is the costeffectiveness of profiling those convicted of particular class of crime for example are the resources needed to profile those convicted of nonviolent crimes more effective if spent on profiles or on other aspects of crime solving and prevention52 what is the proper balance between using profiles to help protect citizens from crime on the one hand and the need to protect the civil liberties and privacy of those who might be subject to profiling on the other the power of dna evidence has led some to call for indexing profiles of all arrestees or even of all citizens at birth while others have raised concerns about the effects of such measures on civil liberties53 postconviction analysis powerful use of dna evidence is in exonerating the innocent including in some cases where people have been wrongfully convicted several issues are associated with postconviction dna analysis among them are when such procedures are appropriate and what is the proper role of the federal government there are several potential reasons why dna analysis might not have been done when case was first prosecuted one is that the identity of the suspect might not have been an issue at the trial for example the involvement of suspect in sexual encounter might not have been in question but rather whether the encounter was consensual in such case dna evidence would probably not be relevant another possibility is that dna evidence was found at the time but turned up later third is that there was dna evidence but the technology to analyze it was not available when the case was prosecuted the first use of dna typing in the united states was in the late 1980s and it was not widely available until few years ago httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs20 54 dna commission postconviction dna testing 9 55 in some cases convicted persons who were actually innocent have served more than ten years before being exonerated by dna evidence for examples of those and other cases of postconviction exoneration see edward connors and others convicted by juries exonerated by science case studies in the use of dna evidence to establish innocence after trial national institute of justice report ncj161258 june 1996 56 dna commission postconvi ction dna testing 10 for example evidence containing dna would usually not be newly discovered but would likely already be in the control of the prosecution however dna analysis migh t not have been done or might have been inconclusive because of earlier technological limitations also some law enforcement agencies destroy evidence in case after all appeals are exhausted connors convicted by juries 26 57 see eric fischer dna evidence legisl ative initiatives in the 106th congress crs report rl30694 12 january 2001 for discussion of these issuesin some cases relevant dna evidence might have been found and analyzed at the time of the original prosecution but yielded inconcl usive results because of the limitations of the technology at the time the much more sensitive str technology did not become an established standard until the late 1990s and many states still use the older less sensitive vntr markers strs or the potentially even more sensitive but less powerful mtdna can provide useful profiles from much smaller or more degraded samples than vntrs consequently an analysis that was inconclusive with vntr technology could lead to either definitive exclusion or alternatively strong match if more sensitive system is used improvements in dna technology are likely to continue into the future potentially making even more samples amenable to typing most states currently do not permit new trials based on newly discovered eviden ce more than three years after conviction54 however dna evidence properly handled is very stable and can often provide useful information even ten years or more after it was initially deposited55 this confluence of advances in the technology the stability of dna evidence and its strong and growing exclusionary power raise questions such as whethe r the time limit should be extended for cases where dna evidence newly discovered or analyzed can be probative and whether postconviction legal procedure s should be changed to accommodate the particular features presented by dna evidence56 to date few states have passed laws that specifically permit postconviction dna analysis for convicted persons claiming actual innocence in considering proposed federal legisla tion congress may consider questions including the following should such legislation apply only to crimes under federal jurisdiction or should it also apply to states what evidence standards should petitioner be required to meet for the procedure to be permitted should there be requirement for evidence to be preserved beyond exhaustion of appeals and if so for how long should it be preserved under what circumstances should elimination samples from victims or other third parties be required what if any accommodation should be made for retyping when new advances are made in dna technology should the government pay for analysis requested by an indige nt inmate should wrongfully convicted persons receive compensation57 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs21 58 see amy argetsinger court opens door to new paternity challenges washington post thursday 29 june 2000 sec 1 19 59 these and other potential developments are being considered by the dna commission and continuedpaternity challenges as more powerful dnatyping techniques have become more affordable their use in paternity analysis has grown an emerging issue involves cases where men who have legally acknowledged paternity sometimes for several years are shown by dna typing not to be the father of the child central question is whether the men in such cases who may claim not to be responsible for child support since they are not the childs biological father should nevertheless continue to be held responsible concern of child advocates is the potentially negative impacts on children if such challenges are allowed states have varied in their treatment of this issue58 future directions of the technology current research on improvi ng dna identification is performed or supported mainly by nist nij the fbi laboratory afdil and private industry such research has several broad goals improvements in sensitivity of analyses would make useful typing possible from even smaller or more highly degraded samples than at present that could permit more powerful identification or exclusion from dna in trace evidence from for example saliva tears and skin cells coupled with further improvements in specificity such as via use of larger set of markers it would also increase the ability of dna evidence to make positive or unique identifications even identical twins possess minor genetic differences that could eventually be detected reducing the time required to complete typing could lead to more timely following of leads as well as more quickly removing from further consideration those persons excluded by the evidence as the costs of performing dna analysis has come down its use has increased further reducing cost would make use of dna identification more widely available research on automation and miniaturization of the typing process may lead to cost reductions and further improv ements in quality control conceivably an automated portable dnatyping system could eventually be developed that would permit onsite analysis and identification through comparison against database via wireless communication such major improvements in the technology will take several years at least to perfect it is generally believed that str markers will remain the standard for dna identification over the next decade with mtdna increasingly used to analyze highly degraded samples research to develop ways to amplify longer sequences may however lead to more use of vntr or other more variable systems in the near future also the human genome project and related efforts are increasingly identifying very small genetic differences even at the level of single base single nucleotide polymorphisms or snps such research may lead to eventual development of better marker systems in some cases relevant physical characteristics such as for eye color might even be deducible from genetic sequences and could help for example in identifying suspects59 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs22 59 continued are described on the commissions website at httpww wojpusdojgovnijdna welcomehtml 60 for example when the first nrc report on dna evidence proposed new method of calculating match probabilities the

approaches include proficiency testing laboratory accreditation and providing opportunities for retyping of evidence by the defense for discussion see nrc evaluation of dna evidence 8587 179185 62 for discussion of this and other legislative issues see fischer dna evidence there are several challenges raised by the likely future improvements in dna typing improvements in forensic typing will need to be validated by the scientific and law enforcement communities and accepted by the courts before they become widely available for use in cases therefore any given case is likely to involve technologies that are technically sound but not the most recently developed furthermore significant pressures exist to maintain substantial degree of stability in the systems used not only is adopting new technology costly but frequent change can lead to longer and more costly procee dings and to uncertainty about the most appropriate approach60 one concern raised is that technological advances could lead to lengthening of the appeals process in cases involving dna evidence or flood of postconviction petitions for typing or retyping in situations where it would not actually be helpful such concerns will need to be balanced against whatever added ability the advances provide in reversing or avoiding wrongful convictions as the power of dna profiling to identify person continues to improve the question arises can person be positively or uniquely identified from dna profile fbi experts will currently testify that person is the source of dna sample provided that the match probability is low enough see the section on interpretation of dna evidence abov however it has not yet been settled generally what probability or alternatively how many loci are needed to effectively eliminate the possibility that match could be coincidental one complication is that match probabilities do not take into account the possibility of misidentification resulting from errors at the laboratory or in the evidence custody chain both experts and the courts have generally agreed that such possibilities are best addressed in other ways61 the stability of dna evidence makes it potentially useful not only in postconv iction typing it also raises the question of whether statutes of limitations should be extended for crimes in which such evidence is potentially important that question will likely increase in importance as the number of dna profiles from cold cases grows in databases and indexes such as codis the benefits of using dna evidence to bring effective prosecutions after longer period than currently feasible will need to be balanced against factors such as the desire to avoid retraumatizing victims who have recovered from the effects of crimes and the need to prioritize the use of limited lawenforcement resources62 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs23 63 there are other potential uses of genetic tests such as to predict how patient is likely to respond to particular drug but variability at any given locus will usually be low in such cases as well also genetic tests often use techniques other than direct identification of sequences such as visual examination of chromosomes karyotypes or examination of gene products 64 in the simplest case the frequencies of particular genotype for each locus are simply multiplied together to get an overall likelihood see section on calculation above while most medical genetic tests do not currently involve more than one locus there will likely be an increased focus on multilocus testing as medi cal genetic technology becomes more sophisticated however it is only for identification that independence of the loci is an advantage 65 see section on why dna can be used in identification at the beginning of this report 66 for nonfunctional loci the effects of natural selection which are difficult to quantify do not need to be taken into account when calculating the likelihood that someone will have particular combina tion of alleles the probability can be calculated directly from the frequencies of those alleles in population if certain other assumptions apply for example in the simplest case if the frequency x of particular allele is 10 then x2 or 1 of the population will have only that allele relationship of dna identification to medical genetic testing both similarities and differences exist between the use of dna for identification and for medical genetic tests with respec t to techniques applications and the issues raised the most fundamental similarity is that both rely on genetic differences among people the most fundamental difference is in the characteristics of the dna sequences that each currently uses in particular variability functionality and independence variability genetic marker used in identification should be highly variable that is there should be many alleles and none of them should be very common the more variable the markers the fewer are needed for positive identific ation in contrast gene examined in genetic test is unlikely to be highly variable that is because genetic tests are most often used in medicine to diagnose or predict the likelihood of disease or condit ion caused by genetic abnormality which most people will not have63 independence refers to whether different loci tend to be inherited together two loci that occur close together on chromosome will usually tend to be inherited together they will be linked not independent two loci that occur on different chromosomes will usually be inherited independently they will be unlinked in genetic testing only one locus is usually of interest so linkage is not usually important in contrast use of dna to identify people requires examining several loci and the mathematics that is used works best if the loci are independent64 functionality sequence is of interest in genetic testing specifically because it is gene that codes for particular chemical product however in identification noncoding sequence or marker is of most interest65 that is because the mathematics that is used in identification works best with noncoding loci66 although most loci used in identification are noncoding it is possible that functions for at leasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs24 67 one vwa is actually noncoding segment of the human von willebrand factor

process where custodychain and qualitycontrol procedures as well as other aspects of typing may be challenged68 consequently new dna technologies are likely to be adopted more slowly for forensic use than for medical testing privacy and discrimination there is currently federal law governing genetic privacy and discrimination per although congress has considered several bills addressing such concerns from medical perspective the executive branch has also taken some actions as have several states69 the privacy act of 1974 5 usc 552a places restrictions on agencies with respect to the

relationships will be discovered in the future as the functions of human dna sequences become better understood for certain other kinds of personal information relati ng to health and medical research70 current federal and state laws also provide safeguards against the misuse of dna profiles collected in law enforcement specifically the dna identification act of 1994 pl 103322 required grantees to certify that dna samples and analyses be made available only to criminal justice agencies for law enforcement identification purposes b in judicial proceedings if otherwise admissible pursuant to applicable statutes or rules c for criminal defense purposes to defendant who shall have access to samples and analyses performed in connection with the case in which the defendant is charged or d if personally identifiable informati on is removed for population statistics database for identification research and protocol development purposes or for quality control purposes the act also applies those privacy requirements to federal state and local participants in codis however state laws vary with respect to how such samples can be used some disagreement exists over whether state protections are adequate71 samples deposited in the armed forces repository of specimen samples for the identification of remains are limited to the following uses identification of human remains internal quality assurance activities purpose for which the donor or surviving nextofkin provides consent or when specifically authorized criminal procedures for which reasonable alternative means for obtaining specimen for dna profile analysis is available dodd 515424 sec 35 since most genetic markers currently used in dna identification are noncoding the privacy and discrimination issues raised are somewhat different than with medical genetic testing for example knowing someones dna profile for the 13 core str loci can provide information about paternity but provides information at this time about physical traits such as propensity to particular genetic disease72 however the issues may begin to converge as new advances in genomi cs are developed and applied or if current identification technologies are applied in the context of genetic testin g for example in some cases clinical research laboratories have reportedly used str typing of samples as an added protection against the possibility of potential mislabeling httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs26 73 see the fss website httpwwwforensicgovukforensicentryhtm 74 directive 9546ec of the european

research service biometric science and technology for personal identification devices uses organizations and congressional interest by william c boesman crs report rl30084 8 march 1999more generally as dna identification becomes more sophisticated its potential applications are likely to broaden potentially increasing privacy concerns for example it is already possible for parents to purchase kits for obtaining dna samples from their children and to have profiles developed from those samples and placed in database to be used potentially if the children become missing such privatesector practices are not covered by federal laws and judicial rulings that provide privacy or other protections against misuse or abuse of the information government agencies in other countries have also become involved in dna identification activities that would likely be limited to the private sector in the united states britains forensic science service fss is an executive agency of the british government but is permitted to operate as nonprofit corporation that offers services not only to the government but also to the public among its services to corporations is the development of dna profiles of employees who might be at risk of being kidnapped the profiles could then be compared to any biological material provided by kidnappers fss also provides paternityanalysis services to the public73 the privacy of genetic information obtai ned or used in such services would presumably be protected by european union directive on privacy of personal data74 such broadening applications may raise concerns about function creep75 the gradual widening of an application to uses not originally intended one example often given is the slowly broadening range of uses over the years of social security numbers the identifying power of dna the decreasing cost of typing and the increasing ability to obtain useful sample without drawing blood make dna potentially attractive for wide range of uses requiring verification of identity76 as long as dna typing uses noncoding loci privacy issues arising from its use in identification should remain limited however three potential issues might deserve particular attention as the use of the technology increases first as genomic research leads to increasingly sophisticated technologies for detecting genetic differences it may become possible to use coding loci genes to provide identification use of coding dna for identification could raise issues of privacy and discrimination similar to those that have raised concerns with respect to medical testing if for example such information became publicly available during judicial proceeding second dna samples obtained from person and in many cases from crime scene evidence remains or other sources contain the persons entire genetic codehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30717crs27 77 matt richtel ftc moves to halt sale of database at toysmart new york times 11 july 2000 sec c 2 judge

782787 for discussion of this issue and an application to an actual case not just the profile information therefore the disposition of the samples themselves after profiling is potentially an issue that is especially potential concern with respect to privatesector activities where disposition of profiles or samples is not necessarily regulated by current law case involving electronic commerce illustrates the concern toysmartcom collected information about customers under privacy policy that claimed the information would not be shared with third parties however when the company filed for bankruptcy it included the database of customer information among the assets it was selling the federal trade commission unsuccessfully opposed the sale of the database77 third dna sample and profile contain information not only about the subject but also about that persons biological relatives therefore consideration of privacy issues related to dna identification as with genetic testing in medicine must take into account potential impacts on family members that can raise potentially difficult issues as illustrated by the following hypothetical example suppose that dna profile from convicted offender is similar but not identical to that obtained from crime scene is it appropriate based on that information for sibling of the convicted offender to be arrested as suspect alternatively suppose that person is suspected of committing crime but there is insufficient evidence to make an arrest suppose further that the person has sibling who has profile in codis is it appropriate to examine the profile of the siblin g to determine how similar it is to the crimescene evidence such examples are likely to arise in real cases as dna becomes more widely used in identification78 the growing use of dna as an effective identification tool and its increasing overlap with aspects of medical genetic testing are likely to create range of policy challenges over the next several years while this report has discussed several current and emerging issues new ones may well develop as the technology evolves the biological role of dna the information it contains about family members and other features of the molecule and the technology may make some of those issues and the appropriate legislative response especially challenging
