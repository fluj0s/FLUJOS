september 18 2006 stephen cooney industry specialist resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress chinas impact on the us automotive industry summary china is both the fastest growing motor vehicle market and the fastest growing vehicle producer output and sales have grown from less than two million vehicles annually before 2000 to nearly six million vehicles in 2005 in the number of vehicles that it manufactures china has passed korea and france is on pace to overtake germany and would then trail only the united states and japan disproportionate share of chinas output has always been heavy vehicles but since 2000 chinas growth has been led by the increase in passenger cars they now account for about half of chinas production china exports or imports few motor vehicles less than 200000 of each exports are growing much more rapidly than imports and are mostly light trucks shipped to developing country markets chinas industry has developed extensively with the aid of foreign direct investment unlike those of korea and japan this investment has been from major international automobile manufacturers that are unlikely to promote chinese exports in competition with their own products in other markets as consequence the chinese companies that have expressed an interest in exporting cars are those who are less dependent on such cooperation and may struggle to meet safety and emission standards in industrial countries most experts do not see high volume of exports from china into these markets in the near future by contrast chinese auto parts exports are already making inroads into the united states while us motor vehicle trade with china was insignificant in 2005 the united states imported 54 billion in parts from china while it exported about onetenth of that amount china accounted for about 6 of us auto parts imports in 2005 but the amount has quadrupled since 2000 many of these imports are aimed at the aftermarket as most of what china now exports to the us market are standard products such as wheels brake parts and electronics but with high rates of investment in china by the leading us manufacturers of both cars and parts major companies such as gm look to increase sourcing from china the bush administration has noted that the new chinese auto policy announced in 2004 eliminated practices not compatible with chinas commitments as member of the world trade organization wto however this policy maintains limit of more than 50 ownership by any foreign investor in motor vehicle manufacturing joint venture in china moreover the us government joined by canada and the european union has alleged discriminatory chinese application of tariffs on automotive parts and requested wto dispute settlement panel congress has been concerned with broad policies giving chinese exporters unfair trade advantages the senate approved bill added as an amendment to other legislation that would place high tariff on chinese imports unless china revalues its pegged exchange rate s 295 further action has been postponed on this measure legislation to allow us producers to bring countervailing duty cases against chinese firms subsidized by their government has been approved in the house hr 3283 and new law has tightened rules against trade in counterfeited goods pl

on the us automotive industry introduction the modernization of chinas economy may be the worlds most transforming development in the early twentyfirst century within this process the growth of chinas automotive industry may be the most important development in the automotive sector since henry ford developed the assembly line process for manufacturing cars and changed the product from convenience item for wealthy consumers to nearly essential component of everyday life in industrial economies there have been three key aspects so far to the evolution of the chinese automotive industry the spectacular growth in volume of the chinese automotive industry in recent years in 2005 china produced nearly five times as many motor vehicles as in the early 1990s with annual production nearing six million vehicles it is on pace to overtake germany as the third largest national vehicle producer and would trail only the united states and japan in total vehicle output partnerships with major industrial country motor vehicle manufacturers chinese products are increasingly sophisticated because of this technological cooperation an active government policy has economically liberalized the chinese automotive industry in some key respects but it requires foreign manufacturers to undertake joint ventures with chinese partners in order to obtain market access the stated goal of the chinese government is to achieve market dominated by limited number of internationally competitive joint venture assemblers supplied by local parts manufacturers producing to world standards the most significant impact on domestic us industry may be in automotive parts while uschina trade in motor vehicles is very limited and likely to remain so us exports and imports of automotive parts to and from china have grown rapidly since 2000 albeit from very low base congress and the bush administration have not taken any steps to impede the growth of chinas automotive sector or uschina automotive trade however congress and the administration have expressed concerns about the conditions under which us manufacturers must compete with chinese firms in china and in global crs2 markets including the domestic us market the concerns have focused on such issues as chinese currency policy which continues to maintain virtually fixed exchange rate chinese implementation of its commitments as member of the world trade organization especially with respect to protection of nonchinese firms intellectual property the extent to which chinese firms are subsidized or otherwise supported by government when they compete with foreign companies in 1988 after visit to china and its fledgling automotive industry then chrysler corporation ceo lee iacocca is said to have reflected that chinas modernization process would be long haul very long haul1 it is now clear that the process has picked up considerable speed china becomes major motor vehicle producer figure 1 illustrates the speed with which china has become major automotive manufacturer china first produced more than two million vehicles of all types in the year 2000 since then it surpassed south korea 2002 and france not shown on graph in 2003 with 52 million units of total production china drew close to the production level of germany europes largest national producer and number three in the world in 2004 china was on pace to overtake germany in total vehicle production in 2005 moreover among the leading vehicle producers china is the only one showing substantial growth in its production level since 2000 the european union including only the 15 members before 2004 and north america each produce more than three times as many vehicles as china but between 2000 and 2004 total us production dropped by net 800000 units and the two leading producers general motors gm and ford registered losses in production and domestic market share in 2005 both canada and mexico also registered net declines so that the total north american output declined by 13 million units despite large increases in north american production by some internationally owned manufacturers similarly production levels in europe were virtually flat or even declined not only in germany but also in the other four leading carproducing countries in western europe france spain britain and italy in descending order of production the countries of central and eastern europe including both new eu members and nonmember countries have been touted as the new detroit of europe low wage levels and easily trainable industrial work forces have attracted major assembly operations from virtually all major manufacturers however by comparison with china the expansion of output in these countries is still largely prospective total 1 quoted in jim mann beijing jeep case study of western business in china boulder co westview press 1997 ed p 296 crs3 vehicle output for central and eastern europe including russia and ukraine increased only from 29 million units to 30 million between 2000 and 2004 japan the secondlargest producing country and the largest motor vehicle exporter also has shown little or overall growth in production in part because of the lost decade of slow economic growth in the 1990s its total output has stagnated around 10 million vehicles per year strengthening exports including to china and the united states led to an increase to about 105 million units of production in 2004 figure 1 leading motor vehicle producers chinas increase in volume output has also placed it far ahead of other developing countries that are considered in the industry as actual or potential major automotive producers production in thailand has actually increased at faster rate than in china from 300000 units in 2000 to 900000 in 2004 and probably more than one million in 2005 brazils production was stable from 2000 through 2003 then increased by 400000 units to 22 million in 2004 india viewed by some sources as being comparable to china in terms of its potential as both an automotive market and location of production saw its annual assembly volume increase from 900000 units in 200002 to 12 million in 2004 the combined net growth of these crs4 three leading developing country producers in 200004 was thus about onethird of the total volume growth in china2 figure 2 chinese motor vehicle production equally significant is the product composition of chinese motor vehicle output which appears to be evolving toward meeting growing domestic consumer demand for personal vehicles notably passenger cars this is closer to the pattern of production in mature industrial producer than in developing economy such as 2 for more detailed comparative analysis of growth and change among major motor vehicleproducing countries see crs report rl32883 us automotive industry recent history and issues by stephen cooney and brent d yacobucci crs5 thailand which is the worlds secondlargest producer of pickup trucks trailing only the united states despite assembling only about one million vehicles per year3 in the mid1990s out of total output of 12 million vehicles china produced 300000 passenger cars with the remaining output accounted for by more utilitarian products namely trucks and buses figure 2 the data in the source for the figure do not distinguish among different types of vehicles in the latter category as trucks and buses are grouped together through 2001 the united states in the 1990s also produced more trucks than passenger cars but in the us case trucks overwhelmingly consisted of minivans suvs and pickup trucks that were generally considered products for personal consumer use in china the truck category in the 1990s was much more oriented toward heavy duty and mass transit equipment wards automotive yearbook for example notes that in 1998 china produced 16 million vehicles state figures show including 610000 heavyduty trucks 4 that would be nearly 40 of all vehicles compared to less than 10 of us output similarly the data for 20022004 for which wards breaks out truck and bus entries separately indicate that annual production of each type of vehicle was more than one million units annually as late as 2004 combined truck and bus production in china was still slightly higher than output of passenger cars5 the pattern had begun to shift decisively after 2000 prior to that year chinas leading automakers were joint ventures with foreign partners with product mix and output subject to bureaucratic intervention and negotiations process well documented in the book beijing jeep cited above but this began to change as noted in wards annual review although the products were often illsuited to market conditions multinational automakers agreed to build them in order to get foothold in the potentially high volume chinese market in 2000 china granted the wishes of many global automakers allowing them to build small affordable vehicles known as peoples cars for the domestic market the liberalization of product regulations undoubtedly positioned china for long term growth in the private car ownership market the countrys pending entry into the world trade organization wto was expected to open the market even 3 even though thailand has much higher per capita national income than china its automotive economy is evolving more as an export platform for light utility vehicles assembled by nameplate manufacturers and distributed throughout southeast asia see reuters car jobs in high demand in thailand as output grows in detroit news autos insider dec 23 2005 this article notes the preference of international manufacturers for thailand over china as regional export base in part because of the lack of bureaucratic interference with development of the industry 4 wards automotive yearbook 1999 p 72 5 however in chinese data the truck category includes light trucks while the bus category appears to include at least some types of minivans thus the key variable would appear to be the rise of the share of production devoted to passenger cars which indicates rising demand among middleclass consumers crs6 further for private consumers and ensure big payoff for companies waiting to tap chinas boundless potential6 passenger car output increased slowly from quarter of motor vehicle production in 1994 to about 30 in 200001 after that it was the expansion of passenger car output that drove rapid motor vehicle production growth as overall output increased from an annual range of 600000700000 vehicles to upwards of five million annually by 2004 nearly 50 of total production was passenger cars by that year figure 2 moreover exports have played very small role so far in china unlike the pattern that developed in the other major asian producers notably japan and korea china only become net exporter for the first time in 2005 but exports were still less than 200000 units perhaps 23 of total production the vehicles were mostly destined for russia ukraine and markets in the middle east7 foreign investors in chinese motor vehicle industry general motors now the market leader american automotive manufacturers were among the earliest international companies who sought to take advantage of the opening of the chinese market to foreign investors in the 1980s after tedious and difficult negotiations american motors corporation amc in 1983 signed joint venture agreement with chinas beijing automotive factory the first such major manufacturing deal reached by western industrial company in china despite this early initiative american companies lost out in the early period of growth in the chinese automotive market first to japanese imports and then to european investors particularly volkswagen vw the tiananmen square incident of june 1989 had chilling effect on investment by us companies and their development of the chinese market8 despite the early lead gained by amc and the successful followup by chrysler corporation in managing the beijing jeep factory after it acquired the us parent company general motors gm is the us automotive manufacturer that has made the biggest investment and achieved the most success in the chinese auto market gm states that it had 13000 employees in china by the end of 2005 they participate in 5050 joint venture with the shanghai automotive industry corporation group saic to manufacture passenger vehicles and as minority shareholder in joint ventures with saic and the wuling automobile company in joint ventures to manufacture minivans minitrucks and the chevrolet spark mini car product based on designs from gms korean subsidiary daewoo while gm generally uses the chevrolet and buick nameplates in china many of the vehicles are based on products of daewoo or gms european subsidiary opel

g richard wagoner in announcing the companys annual results for 2005 gms success in china and the asiapacific region included 524 million net profit in 2005 although that was lower than the 729 million profit for the region in 2004 in part because of higher costs associated with gms growth initiatives in china the net earnings in asia contrasted with gms 56 billion loss in north american operations in 200513 this positive performance is making some in the company hopeful that earnings in asia can help offset and pay for period of difficult restructuring at home14 among other companies hyundai has been moving up the vehicles sales list fast in part because changes in chinese government policies led consumers to buy smaller vehicles after 200415 after late entry into the market hyundai in the first quarter of 2005 actually took the lead for period as the numberone seller16 the table also illustrates rapid gains in total sales by honda and growing position after late start for toyota17 among the us big three producers ford has gotten off to the latest start in china but its sales also increased dramatically in 2005 ford brand sales were up 41 to 82000 units for the year while total annual sales of affiliated brands including ford transit vans produced for the chinese commercial market by its joint venture partner jiangling nearly doubled from 120000 to 11 listings in the 2001 edition of wards automotive yearbook for example show production by 68 different plants and sales by 71 different manufacturers without further classification or identification in only few cases does that source indicate foreign company affiliation more recently wards has focused on the more significant manufacturers and classified their sales by passenger cars trucks and buses the latter may include minivans production data are also available but as currently almost all production in china is for the domestic market sales and production are closely linked 12 detroit news autos

china remain small and most of the output from the famous beijing jeep factory are vehicles designed by the companys former global partner mitsubishi19 independent production vs foreign cooperation overall the story of the year for 2005 according to one chinesebased industry source was the quiet but determined march of the chinese brands in their home market gm might have been the leading motor vehicle seller in china and hyundai the fastestgrowing single brand but in the fastest growing market segment passenger cars japanese brands as group led with 274 of the market closely followed by chinese domestic brands which claimed 26 share the leading single chinese brand domestically was the charade produced by the first auto works xiali plant with 180000 in sales this is based on microcar model originally licensed from daihatsu japanese small car specialist now owned by toyota the numbertwo local brand was the chery qq minicar design that gm claimed was copied from daewoo model and whose sales more than doubled to 116000 units in 200520 it is also significant that the two companies with stated ambitions to export vehicles to the united states chery and geely are independently owned without direct ownership or joint venture ties to the major international producers though they are in many cases actively supported by local governments in china this is in contrast to the larger operating companies such as shanghai automotive beijing automotive first auto works dongfeng and jiangling all of whose automotive operations are subsidiaries of central governmentowned and controlled companies21 the current efforts to promote the export of chinesemade motor vehicles to the united states will be reviewed in more detail in the next section of the report the joint ibmuniversity of michigan study of the chinese auto industry which focused on the perspective of chinese participants themselves indicates key dilemma in china becoming major independent force in

comprehensive automotive joint ventures each more than 50 controlled as matter of policy by major foreign nameplate automotive manufacturer which will become the leaders in bringing automotive technologies to china these companies will work with local suppliers to produce parts components and equipment that meet international automotive standards according to this plan22 but some chinese in the industry have number of doubts about the effectiveness of the joint venture approach in assisting development of the national automotive industry from the foreign joint venture partners perspective chinas intellectual property rights ipr regime provides insufficient protection for foreign partners iprs as will be discussed in the section on trade below from the chinese perspective however operating through joint ventures has been least satisfactory in terms of the perceived benefits for local research and development activities moreover they assert cooperation through joint ventures inherently restrains the chinese partner from independently developing its own export market outreach in this view support and planning for global vehicle sales must be coordinated within the sales and service network of the international partner the inside china report reveals widespread belief that the approach undertaken in the governments 2004 auto policy leading to consolidation of major producers all operating within foreign joint venture arrangements probably will not work if the goal is competitive independent chinese industry in this view the evolution of the industrys development under this framework may be too slow on the other side the report says foreignbased companies will be reluctant to withdraw from the market if they are not among the leading companies because of chinas vast market potential for example see above the efforts being made by ford and toyota in china after their respective late starts the report concludes that both government restrictions on foreign ownership of vehicle manufacturing companies and the governments significance as direct participant in the industry may fade away it may be noteworthy as an example that government planning and support in japan and korea did not lead to the industrial outcomes envisioned by bureaucrats two major japanese companies fell under effective foreign control nissan and mazda while another developed outside the system honda korea today is left with just one locally owned and controlled motor vehicle producer hyundai which also controls kia two chineseowned firms one of them saic which maintains partnerships with gm and vw are seeking to obtain advanced automotive technology and manufacturing capacity directly through the acquisition of the failed british company mg rover the latter is the remains of bmws efforts to become volume producer by acquiring the last major independent british producer when that effort was not profitable bmw kept the rollsroyce and mini

mg rover soon failed saic had entered technical cooperation agreement with mg rover and now plans to produce vehicles in china based on mg rover plans and technology the other chinese company nanjing has acquired the longbridge plant and may produce vehicles in britain23 at least one us source has commented that the episode could serve as model for how chinese and other foreign manufacturers could establish or expand footholds in the united states through acquisition of parts of gm and ford as daimler has already acquired the entire chrysler group the smallest of the us big three24 diversity of other strategies may be adopted by chinese automotive suppliers including direct relationships with foreign automotive suppliers with government restrictions on joint venture ownership rules such as those that affect nameplate vehicle assembly operations some international suppliers have established manufacturing operations in china another option is outright purchase of technology from international suppliers one uniquely aggressive approach was the effort in early 2006 by chinese independent motorcycle manufacturer based in chongqing and supported by the local communist party to purchase outright bmwchrysler joint venture engine plant in brazil the idea is to disassemble the plant and move it physically to china thus giving the country its first independently owned automobile engine plant with uptodate manufacturing technology25 with us auto parts suppliers suffering financial distress with declines in ford and gm production chinese parts manufacturers could gain direct access to the us automotive supplier market as well as to improved technology through reverse investment in us firms one chinese parts manufacturer wanxiang of hangzhou has reportedly indicated an interest in buying some of delphi corporations us operations out of bankruptcy wanxiang has also reportedly been contacted by ford as possible buyer for economically troubled visteons us plants that were taken back by ford in 200526 former assistant us trade representative is reportedly specializing in trying to develop such investment links between chinese and small us familyowned auto parts suppliers27 but even such strategies rely on tapping into expertise already developed in the industrial countries as one chinese interviewee from supplier company is quoted in the ibmmichigan report

china not only because of its large potential market but also because of its lowcost labor the report notes that chinese companies foresee ten years or more to reach worldclass levels28 impact of china on the us automotive market chinesemade vehicles not imminent factor the number of vehicles produced in china annually more or less equals the number of vehicles sold there with both exports and imports at minimal levels china became net motor vehicle exporter in 2005 notable milestone as exports more than doubled to 172800 units and imports increased modestly to 16100029 total production and sales each totaled nearly 6 million units one analysis calculates that 59 of exports were pickups and other light trucks mainly destined for markets in the middle east southeast asia and africa 16 were passenger cars imports were mainly mediumsize and larger luxury vehicles which are coming under increasing pressure from higherend domestic production30 another auto industry source stated that it will likely be five to 10 years before china is exporting cars in significant quantities furthermore chinas biggest staterun auto makers dont have big export plans according to this speaker since they are in joint ventures with big multinationals such as gm31 consequently the most active chinese companies with export plans aimed at north america are the producers without major jointventure tieups with the large international automobile companies american entrepreneur malcolm bricklin in 2005 undertook widely publicized efforts to create 200dealer network visionary vehicles aimed at

rico not the mainland united states34 while these beginnings seem quite modest the wall street journal quoted li shufu as saying that by 2015 the company is aiming to make two million cars year with twothirds of them sold outside china35 this is not to say that the major auto producers have current participation or interest in car exports from china the leading foreign manufacturer using china as an export platform is honda one of its operations is joint venture producing sedans in which it is allowed an exceptional 65 ownership position because the output is solely for export in 2005 this

dept of commerce definitions major chinese impact in automotive parts china is playing more significant role in parts for which us imports from china had increased from 16 billion in 2000 to 53 billion in 2005 compared to 593 million in us exports to china in the latter year as shown in table 2 the resulting deficit of about 5 billion is still small part of the overall us deficit of 37 billion in auto parts 55 billion in exports mainly to canada and mexico and 92 billion in imports the nafta countries supplied 465 billion in auto parts to the united states in 2005 most of the rest came from japan 164 billion and europe 105 billion reflecting the roles of japan and germany as leading exporters of cars to the united states surprisingly though china does export twice as much in parts to the united states as korea even though that country is also major exporter of cars and light trucks to the us market 88 billion in 2005 38 us government accountability office china trade us exports investment affiliate sales rising but export share falling report gao06162 dec 2005 tab 9 crs15 nearly all of the auto parts imports from china are in the major product groups shown in table 2 the largest category is chassis and drivetrain parts 16 billion in 2005 out of this total about onethird more than 500 million was aluminum wheels another 400 million consisted of brakes and brake parts electronic and electrical parts accounted for the secondlargest category 13 billion more than 40 of this type of imports consisted of car radioscddvd players 561 million the secondlargest product group 227 million was ignition and other wiring sets though this definition also includes such items for aircraft and ships visteon corporation the former automotive parts unit of ford has announced that it is moving the headquarters for its global electronics group to china while gm is moving its worldwide electronics purchasing group there39 varied group of miscellaneous auto parts accounted for 630 million in 2005 imports the leading identifiable products within this category were trailer parts and automotive radiators each in the 8090 million range auto bodies and parts also accounted for more than 600 million in imports this title is perhaps somewhat misleading as the leading imported product in the category was car seats for children 171 million various vehicle seat parts and safety belts accounted for about another 100 million in this category engines and parts accounted for the smallest of the major categories with imports of less than 200 million this mostly consisted of assorted small quantities of parts however the small total is misleading the 34 liter v6 engine for the chevrolet equinox crossover utility vehicle sold in the united states is manufactured in china this product does not show up as us auto parts import probably because the equinox is assembled at the gmsuzuki joint venture plant in ontario the finished vehicle may appear in

justintime inventory control and supply techniques are key component of lean production now widely used in north american vehicle production in current practice major vehicle parts components and systems must be produced more than several hours transport distance from final vehicle assembly and delivered not only just in time but also just in sequence for different styles and models built to order off the same vehicle platform justin time manufacturing differentiates essentially between discrete standardized parts that may be used in many different vehicles and large bulky parts and systems or modules that may only be installed in specific models such as front ends or cockpit units smaller standard parts may be produced globally and sourced from anywhere based on low labor and other production costs42 major system modules may be built up in part by integrating standard parts and components thomas klier and james rubenstein analysts writing for the federal reserve bank of chicago report in what was imported from china we find that the rapid increase was overwhelmingly in aftermarket parts sold to retailers not manufacturers rather than original equipment for example 29 of all imports from china during the first half of 2005 were wheels and tires china passed canada as the leading source of wheels in 2002 and has expanded its share of the market since then producers of aftermarket parts face more pressure to minimize price than to maximize quality43 the manufacture of aftermarket parts is the smaller share of the us auto parts industry about 30 of the total the commerce department has cited private sector report predicting that the fastestgrowing product group in the aftermarket will be electrical and electronic products particularly sound systems44 trade data cited above indicated this is one of the major strengths of chinese automotive exports to the us market but beyond the aftermarket as international automakers increase their manufacturing investment and sourcing in china they will be seeking ways to 42 this production model and its implications for parts suppliers are discussed in crs report rl32883 see graeme maxton and john p wormald

many us oe supplier companies have located operations in china and it is to be expected that they will export more to nameplate manufacturers from their capacity there and in controversial move gm announced that it expects to increase its original equipment parts purchases from china from 200 million in 2003 to 4 billion in 2009 while spending around 5 billion on sourcing for its china production45 more recent comments from gm spokesman raised the 2009 target for sourcing from china to 10 billion by the latter date46 if the analysis of this section is correct the news is not necessarily comforting for us automotive workers while the press and public opinion focuses on the nameplate manufacturers about three times as many people in the united states work for auto parts suppliers about threequarters of the millionplus workers in the total industry47 these are the jobs that could be directly impacted by chinese parts imports even if imports of motor vehicles from china remain at essentially zero the farther down the tiers of automotive supply that workers job is the more likely that worker is going to compete with product from china particularly in factories that produce standard parts for assembly plants or for tier 1 suppliers that integrate standard parts and components into customized modules for final assembly competitive labor costs many outside china express interest or concern with chinas labor costs which are assumed to be chinas key competitive advantage in manufacturing unquestionably the us dollar rate of chinese wages and salaries is extremely low even chinese currency rate appreciation of 2540 against the us dollar as sought by some us industries and members of congress would do little to equalize them with equivalent us wages and salaries for example canadianbased magna international the worlds thirdlargest auto parts manufacturer operates 18 plants in china and has wide range of experience with salary levels at variety of types of plants and locations it has reported the following data on chinese wage and salary levels annual salary levels for general production workers range from less than 1000 to high of 3000 for

country48 us policy issues in economic relations with china in view of the increase in total us imports from china and bilateral us trade deficit that increased to more than 200 billion in 2005 representatives of the bush administration as well as many members of congress are seeking what they consider more level playing field in uschina trade relations from the perspective of congress the initiatives which have received the most support to date are those which seek to address factors that underlie the basis of trade such as exchange rates and alleged government subsidies to industrial producers from the perspective of the administration the main effort besides focus on exchange rate issues has been on ensuring that china lives up to the spirit as well as the letter of trade policy commitments that it has made including in the auto sector49 administration focus on chinese auto sector commitments the united states and other members of the world trade organization wto had been highly critical of chinas 1994 industrial policy for the automotive sector this policy was replaced by new one announced in may 2004 the us view is that it is important that china fairly treat imports of end products as well as parts that can be exported competitively to its market to support this view the us government filed its second wto case ever against china on march 30 2006 over the issue of import tariffs on auto parts 48 magna international inc 10 recommandments for conducting business in china presentation by keith lomason executive director china 2004 data p 14 lomasons report is also

legislation crs19 the new chinese auto policy of 2004 abolished many formal restrictions and domestic content rules however the us trade representative ustr is concerned about the vague and unclear nature of many statements in the 2004 policy such as how china plans to regulate imports in keeping with its new registration system for auto manufacturers and whether china will effectively allow imports of complete knockdown kits50 moreover as cited above the new policy still requires foreignowned manufacturers in china to operate through joint ventures in which their ownership is limited to more than 50 the united states and other countries believe that the chinese government may be seeking to establish facto policies that would restore or maintain local content rules that it had to give up as part of its wto accession agreement with respect to formal tariff rules china reduced its duties on imported cars and parts from much higher levels to unified rate of 25 on imported vehicles and 1014 on parts by july 1 200651 however china has subsequently established regulation measures on importation of parts for entire automobiles which may effectively reestablish discrimination in favor of local content motor vehicle manufacturers are required to register their parts if more than 60 of the value of vehicle is accounted for by imported parts the manufacturer must pay duties of 25 on all imported parts in the vehicle the united states the european union and japan expressed concern with this policy at the october 2005 wto review of chinas implementation of transitional measures on march 30 2006 the united states and the eu requested consultations with china on this issue the first step in wto trade case52 on september 15 2006 the us government along with canada and the eu took

settlement of all issues terms of the agreement are private but reportedly chery has agreed not to use its company name when marketing cars in the united states because of its similarity to the well known chevy trade name55 the general attitude of chinas manufacturers is expressed by geely founder li shufu who studied foreignmade vehicles by disassembling them in order to learn about fit finish and assembly procedures the inside china report quoting from press source states li by his own admission was not concerned with intellectual property rights in his initial efforts to start his company56 while the ustr is seeking to address ipr issues directly with the chinese government the next section includes discussion of action taken by congress to tighten the law against us imports of counterfeit auto parts and other manufactured goods congressional concerns with competition from china while the bush administration has focused on market access in china the emphasis in congress has been on defending us producers against what is perceived to be unfair competition from china these efforts which have increased in the 109th congress have not been specific to the automotive industry but have instead focused on the broader aspects of economic competition the issues that have generated the most attention and that have led to bills that have made progress in congress are the exchange rate question and us trade remedies against chinese government subsidies chinas government has maintained fixed exchange rate against the dollar leading many us manufacturers to claim that in

exchange rate policy which tied its currency to an international currency basket rather than directly to the dollar policy change that had the effect of slight upward revaluation the senate subsequently agreed further to postpone floor action in consideration of other steps that the chinese government might take57 legislation has also moved that would allow us producers to bring countervailing duty cvd cases against exporters alleged to be receiving subsidies from governments of countries that are designated nonmarket economies such as china current commerce department enforcement policy is not to bring cvd cases in these circumstances but rather to require us producers to seek trade relief exclusively through antidumping laws58 on july 27 2005 the house passed by vote of 255168 hr 3283 bill introduced by representative philip english that would apply us countervailing law to nonmarket economies such as china require extensive monitoring of chinas commitments on trade and intellectual property rights and require the treasury department to report on chinas new currency mechanism59 number of members especially in the house have voiced concerns that protection of the us steel industry through trade remedy laws has hurt automotive parts producers during the period of us safeguard tariffs on wide range of steel imports in 200203 they argued that higher domestic steel prices were hurting us auto parts producers in competition with imported parts from china but the price of steel has actually risen substantially since the safeguards were terminated therefore some members have turned their attention to the continuing impact of us antidumping ad tariffs which are applied to the importation of many steel mill products used in the automotive industry representative joseph knollenberg introduced bill hr 4217 which would amend us adcvd law to require that the us international trade commission take into account the harm that may

the measure was passed without opposition in both houses and signed into law by president bush on march 16 2006 pl10918160 conclusion there appears to be consensus among observers of both the global automotive industry and the industry in china that china is not yet ready to challenge the major international producers of fully assembled vehicles in their home markets most of the sources reviewed in the context of the present report talk about competitive chinese industry in fivetoten year time frame or even longer the british experts graeme maxton and john wormald rate china among countries still trying to develop an independent auto industry as having the best chance of doing so but they are skeptical that china with statedeveloped plan for the industry and the worlds largest market potential can achieve this goal within the near term each additional one million vehicles sold per year in china they noted is the equivalent of one weeks worth of sales in the advanced industrial countries even if china succeeds in creating an export industry its greatest impact in the markets of industrial countries may be in small lowpriced vehicles which many companies already import rather than producing locally61 chinas impact on the automotive parts industry is much more at hand already china is major supplier of parts to the united states and the only one if the european union is counted as single entity whose parts exports are not linked to the export of vehicles many us companies both nameplate automotive manufacturers and parts suppliers have set up operations in china and parts from those operations are increasingly being circulated in global trade moreover chinese companies themselves have become active in this business especially in the aftermarket beyond the aftermarket however chinesemade parts and equipment are being used by original equipment manufacturers in assembled vehicles the pressure to use chinese parts will likely increase as the major international vehicle manufacturers increase their commitment to production in china for the sake of the local market there it is thus likely that chinese production will be increasingly integrated into international motor vehicle and parts production and distribution networks this gives chinese firms direct access to the us justintime automotive manufacturing market but also allows them
