usg estimates he fears it could happen this year asd vershbow assured mbz of the us commitment to uae security as shapiro relayed that his trip to the uae was his first since taking on his new position reflecting the importance we place on the relationship 4 snf mbz reiterated his belief that an israeli preemptive strike against iran was increasingly likely saying he was convinced the netanyahu government was prepared to act against iran and that he agreed with israeli intelligence assessments regarding how close tehran is to achieving its nuclear ambitions the iranian response to preemptive strike predicted mbz would be attacks on us allies in the region foremost among them the uae iran may also unleash terrorist cells against western interests around the world asd vershbow explained that the usg assessment differed in timeframe we do not anticipate military confrontation with iran before the end of 2009 stressing however that denying irans nuclear ambitions and stemming its efforts to achieve regional hegemony were foremost among us international security concerns 5 s in response to mbzs position that ultimately engagement efforts with iran would fail both asd and as made clear than while the usg continues to press for diplomatic solution the offer of engagement is not openedended and will not come at the expense of gulf security abu dhabi 00000754 002 of 004 6 s referring to the iran region presence office irpo in dubai mbz asked hows that office doing he did not demonstrate any particular concern or sensitivity regarding irpo activities in uae mbz said that the iranian regime was in trouble internally and would move swiftly to oppress postelection opposition as for rafsanjani mbz said he was survivor who would not succeed in leadership bid because he will not act unless he is onehundred percent sure he will win again turning to his primary security concern mbz suggested that tehran would likely accelerate its nuclear program to draw attention away from its internal weakness and to foment nationalism among its citizenry time is not on our side he said hinting that move should be made against iran and the sooner the better russia 7 casd vershbow briefed mbz on the positive outcome of potuss recent talks in moscow mbz said that he had met with putin in june and he did not believe russia saw nuclearized iran as challenge to its interests nor did putin appreciate the threat of regional proliferation in response to an iranian bomb he encouraged the us to continue to press the russians saying he believed if the russians came over to our side with regard to tougher sanctions the chinese would follow mbz said his he would travel in late july to beijing where he will surely press the chinese on iran asd vershbow suggested he urge the chinese to send iran message by diversifying its oil imports away from iran afghanistan neighbors not doing enough 8 snf mbz complained that arab regimes are not doing enough to help in afghanistan he said that as of one month ago he surveyed the region and found that only oman had funded its tokyo conference pledge of 2 million he singled out saudi arabia and qatar in particular for not doing their part saying that the saudis clearly did not see how important it was to their own interests 9 snf mbz criticized other regional leaders for playing both sides and for dating iran mbz compared the current situation to prewwii europe saying ahmedinejad is hitler and neighboring capitals believe erroneously that they can prevent iranian retaliation by playing nice or signing agreements with tehran they think the are backing the winning horse mbz explained emphasizing that if they think that by appeasing iran they will avoid iranian retaliation then they are seriously mistaken sir national defense strategy 10 s throughout the discussions mbz repeatedly called for coordinated military planning for the worstcase scenario of an unpredictable iranian response to an israeli strike stressing that usuae preparations must begin now well before commencement of hostilities both sides agreed that improved coordination was good idea with asd vershbow utilizing the opportunity to push

humanitarian aid for ct 12 c in the context of defeating aq in afghanistan and pakistan mbz called for arab and muslim regimes to do more to stem terrorist financing whether it means closing down charities business interests whatever is necessary he also pointed to the zealousness of arab fighters vice afghani nationals ninefive percent of arab fighters go to afghanistan knowing they are going to die for ideological reasons afghan nationals on the other hand are more practical this makes one of them arabs more valuable to aq than ten or more afghan fighters afghanis mbz pointed out have tribes families homes therefore the best way to counter local extremism in afghanistan and to lesser extent pakistan is to improve the quality of life 13 sbu mbz described uae humanitarian commitments

pakistan sharif cannot be trusted to honor his promises mbz continued that new personality may emerge but for the time being the uae position was to play helpful role by supporting the pm lebanon support for laf and pm hariri 15 c asd vershbow reiterated our request that the uaeg assist the lebanese armed forces laf by funding the purchase and transfer of some of 56 usorigin tanks from jordan to lebanon noting our appreciation of the uaes earlier funding of the first 10 tanks this would help capitalize on the positive outcome of the elections and help reduce hezbollahs and irans influence in lebanon promising to look into what the uae could do to help with this matter mbz asked if we had made the same request to doha asd replied that we had and that he would do so again when he arrived in qatar july 20 16 c reiterating his favored theme of the generation gap in regional leadership uae having already passed the baton to the younger generation mbz praised lebanese pm saad hariri saying he was good man he feels very threatened at the moment presumably by the syrian regime and it is important we do not lose him as shapiro agreed pointing to us security assistance as proof of our concern and suggested that the uae support us efforts to strengthen lebanese government institutions as the best opportunity to build gol stability and security july 18 nasrallah speech 17 s mbz pointed to hezbollah syg hassan nasrallahs july 18 speech saying he believed it reflected change in hezbollahs tone due to calculations that its iranian backers were currently in weakened state postpresidential elections mbz said that nasrallah is likely suffering from decreased financial support at least for abu dhabi 00000754 004 of 004 the next six months behavior change in syria i think not 18 snf vershbow pointed to recent progress with syria on border control issues to stem the flow of foreign fighters to iraq as small step forward in effort at eliciting behavioral change from damascus mbz showed confidence that syria could be separated from the iranian camp if you want my opinion replied mbz i think not he advised that syria had lot of options and that judging from past
