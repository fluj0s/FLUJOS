chinas further integration into the globa l economy and vast new market opportunities in the worlds most populous country us ag ricultural exports to china already an important destination we re projected to expand significan tly as its government began to open its markets both to the outside wo rld and to its own private sector while longerterm optimism prevails us and other exporters of agricultural products have encountered difficult nearter m obstacles at the chinese border some believe that at least number of these obstacles may be contrary to commitments china has made in its agreements with the wto and the united states us officials at all levels have been working with their chin counterparts to resolve these problems without taking china into wto dispute settlement

meats seafood and grain exports have grown in r ecent years leading us exports to hong kong are poultry and red meat s and fruits and vegetable products according to usdas economic research service ers chinas wto accession will increase international demand for major usproduced commodities like wheat corn soybeans and other products raising u s farm prices by from 05 to 3 over 20022009 baseline us exports and net farm income could increase by 900 million and 800 million respectively by 2009 howeve r those predictions hinge on number of factors not the least being the assump tion that china will comply with its wto commitments to open its markets see below recent market access agreements chinese wto accession and market access commitments to gain wto membership china negotiated bilaterally with each of its major trading partners including the united states and multilaterally with wto working party the most favorable bilateral concessions were consolidated into single wto accession agreement the uschina bilateral agreement was sign ed in november 1999 and contained chinas best offers on agricultural products the bilateral market access commitments consolidated into the protocol of accession are available to all wto members china agreed that with accession it would gradually reduce by 2004 its tariffs for agricultural products from an average level of 22 to an average of 17 the average reduction on several produc ts important to the united states including soybeans meats fruits wine and dairy products are to be reduced from 315 to 145 china

details on the trade agreements discussed here see crs report rs20169 agriculture and chinas accession to the world trade organization agreed to establish tariffrate quotas trqs for bulk agricultural commodities thereby meeting wto requirements that nontariff qua ntitative barriers be converted to trqs in trq specified levels of imports up to quota limit can enter at low tariffs with those above the limit assessed much higher duty china also agreed not to use export subs idies on corn cotton and rice to eliminate nontariff barriers by ensuring that inspection testing and other san itary and phytosanitary sps and technical measures comply with wto rules to cap and reduce tradedistorting domestic agricultural subsidies to more th an 85 of national fa rm production value and to make its trade nd policy regulations public and more transparent in order for the united states to take dvantage of these market concessions and to use the wto dispute settlement mechanisms in any trade disputes the united states had to grant china permanent normal trade relations pntr which the 106th congress approved and the president signed into w pl 106286 passage of permanent ntr extends to china the same low tariffs pplied to other wto members from 1980 to 2001 the united states essentially had been granting conditional ntr status on year toyear basis the pntr debate pitted many us commercial agricultural interests who argued that pntr would significantly raise us farm exports against others skeptical that china actually would open its markets and abide by wto rules1 such concerns now are at the heart of recent uschina agricultural trade issues see below 1999 agreement on uschina agricultural cooperation in the course of accession negotiations china and the united states signed bilateral agreement resolving several longstanding trade disputes regarding chinese sps restrictions on us wheat meat and citrus imports this agreemen t became effective immediately upon signature on april 10 1999 specifically china agreed to 1 liminate restrictions on wheat imports from the pacific northwest that had b een imposed out of concern that it had tck smut plant fungus 2 open its market to us pork beef and poultry imports by promising to accept usda certification of thei r safety 3 eliminate its comprehensive ban on imports of us oranges grapefruit and other citrus fruit china did make some purchases of wheat meats and citrus as it was working on its wto accession but us exporters of these products say they have since encountered chinese import barriers selected issues both the us government and the wto have established mechanisms to monitor chinas implementation of it accession commitments including those on agriculture chinas progress is affected by number of factors the country must contend with competing internal forces including those likely to benefit from more open trade eg those in the private sector and others that stand to lose eg displaced farmers and workers communist officials provincial governments etc also china must have time to rewrite rules to comply with wto and other global standards and to make them more consistent and transparenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21292crs4 2 see the usda economic research service website on china wto accession implementation issues at wwwersusdagovbriefingchinawtoimplementationhtm for details and references 3 chinese corn exports are expected to remain strong through at least the 2002 marketing year according to an october 10 2002 report from us das agricultural attache in china gain report ch2048 subsidies appear to be tinuing despite chinas wto commitment and chinas grain stocks remain very largegiving the motivation for further exports the report concludes noting that corn imports are neglig ible and wheat imports weak because of large domestic stocks and stronger world priceschina has sought to vigorously protect its agricultural sector which accounted for 275 of its gross domestic product in 2000 out of fears that import competition and other wtofueled changes will cause major ec onomic pain and social instability nearly twothirds of chinas 13 billion people are ru ral according to usda on the other hand chinese policies that shield its farmers from wto reforms create sectoral inefficiencies and tie up resources that coul d generate investme nt and jobs in other economic sectors western economists have argue d nonetheless these chinese internal tensions may help to explain some of the difficulties faced by us negotiators seeking resolution of agricultural trade issues2 not all of these issues necessarily violate wto rules nor are us officials pursuing wto dispute settlement to resolve them at this time tariffrate quotas for example one china wto accession commitment was to set new trq quantities for wheat corn rice cotton and soybean oil all important us exports with inquota duties ranging fro m 1 to 9 nong overnment enterprises were to receive specified share of each trq each year so that us firms can deal directly with chinese customers rather than through the tightlycontrolled state trading enterprises stes the commitment is fo r transparency in trq administration and reallocation of unused ste quotas to other buy ers in china who want to import products china repeatedly delayed announcement of regulations for the trqs and when announced they did not appear to provide th market access that the united states and other exporting countries had anticipated under chinas wto agreement us officials complain that us exporters have been unable to identify clearly which users in china have received trqs and how much trqs for wheat have been distributed in shares that are too small to be commercially viable chinese officials are requiring that some of the nonste trq allocations be pro cessed for reexport rather than used at home this likely violates wto rules us interests ve reported also chin reportedly has newly imposed valueadded tax vat of 13 on gr ain imports to further discourage imports these and other grainrelated problems see below may in part reflect chinese efforts to reduce large domestic surpluses of wheat and corn according to analysts export subsidies although china agreed to end grain export subsidies upon wto accession they continue according to us reports secretary of agriculture ann veneman reported in late july that chinese official s had acknowledged that they may be doing so in violation of their wto commitments us companies and government authorities have reported that chinese corn c ontinues to receive export subsidies and that subsidies for wheat exports also have been instituted for example they contend corn has been exported at prices that have been 20 to 30 per metric ton less than chinas domestic price and at prices below t hose of cornproducing competitor nations3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21292crs5 biotechnology regulations us farm and trade interests also express concern about permanent new chinese rules now in abeyance for approval and labeling of farm products containing genetically modified organisms gmos these rules were set to take effect in march 2002 but chinese official s delayed them first until december 20 2002 and again until september 20 2003 meanwhile temporary gmo import regime is in place whereby gmo products are supposed to be acceptable if exporting countries have approved them and they are undergoing chines testing and approval procedures in the interim however us producers worry that c onfusing conflicting and overly vague rules still could impede us soybean exports to china valued at 1 billion annually in recent years and other gmo products among speci fic us complaints are uncertainties about how the import regime will function likely extensiv new paperwork requirements concerns that chinese officials in the future will arbitrarily impose additional inspection and quarantine requirements th expectation that several different agencies eg the ministry of agriculture and the ministry of health will have to approve gmo imports using separate and possibly conflicting sets of rules and how to ensure that the transition from the interim system to permanen t one does not further disrupt trade impediments to us meat and poultry imports us meat and poultry industry officials contend that china has not complied with its commitments both in the wto and under the 1999 agreement on us china agricultural cooperation to accelerate removal of all unjus tifiable nontariff measures rest ricting trade china has imposed more burdensome import permit system that arbitrarily restricts import quantities to 200 tons per import permit according to us industry officials also the system only issues permits to beef and poultry product types that do not compete with domestically produced goods they charge import permits take approximately 30 days to be issued compared with 48 hours prior to wto accession they add recently china unilaterally delisted seve ral usdaapproved meat and poultry plants under zero tolerance standard for pathogens despite the absence of published regulations for imports including pathogen standards viol ating both the 1999 agreement and of the ur agreement on the application of sps measures us meat industry organizations wrote in june 20 2002 joint letter to the us trade representative ustr chinese officials in july denied that they were using these practices to restrict imports china also said it would delay for 6 months through ma rch 31 2003 what us officials said were costly and burdensome new labeling requirements for im ported beef pork and poultry according to reports in inside uschina trade other import problems us wheat exporters ve reported that china has continued to discourage imports of wheat from the pacific northwest which it had previously blocked due to c oncerns about the presence of tck smut the imposition of additional handling requi rements and other hurdles for pacific northwest wheat would be violation of the 1999 agreement which lifted the earlier ban as long as any tck spores are at or below the tolerance levels specified in the agreement china also has denied access to its markets for number of other us farm and food products on sps grounds including fresh potatoes avocados p eaches pears and certain apple varieties according to the ustr on august 9 2002 china notified the wto of proposed new cotton quality standards for imports to take effect next year which us government and industry officials assert are arbitrary and unreliable and thus would violate wto rules new chinese restrictions for natural fertilizer imports also are at issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21292crs6 4 for information on the bill including procon analysis see crs report rl31195 the 2002 farm bill overview and status outlook for resolution as noted the united states has establis hed mechanisms for monitoring chinas performance in meeting its accession commitme nts in addition us trade and agriculture officials have been working diligently both through meetings and consultations with chinese officials at all levels and in some cases through the wto to resolve the various problems which have ar isen up to now however us officials have not invoked wto dispute settlement procedures among other things they want to ensure that longterm growth in agricultural trade with china will continue and to allay skepticism among some us farm groups about chinese intentions for example the united states in late june 2002 requested formal wto consultations invoked under the uruguay round agreement on agriculture or uraa not wto dispute settlement procedures on the grain trq and related issues these issues also were among number of the trade concerns raised by agriculture secretary veneman during her trip to china in late july secretary veneman said during her trip that she had appointed usda senior trade counsel david hegwood to lead working group on biotechnology with china meanwhile other us authorities were to continue meeting with the chinese on the issue and other highlevel administration trade officials were to travel to china to seek clarifications of the gmo rules after us meat and poultry industry official s raised concerns about barriers to their exports to china the united states formally complained to china however they acknowledged that substantiating such charge s might prove difficult given that chinese importers were orally informing us exporters of the questionable practices rather than providing any written documentation of them chinese officials have countered with critic ism of us farm po licy and particularly the new farm bill signed in may 2002 which they contend is tradedistorting they state that its passage could cause them to increase their own agricultural subsidies and will make it more difficult for them to meet their wto obligations4 past experience in resolving agricultural trade disputes not only with china but with other us trading partners suggests that their satisfactory resolution usually takes extended time and effort and of ten the intervention of officials from the highest levels even the countries leaders some us agricultural producers remain skeptical that china will act expeditiously to further open its markets to their exports nonetheless given the size and growth potential of the chinese mark et the desire of the us government and businesses to bring china into the global economic community and the new ability to use the wto dispute settlement mechanisms if necessary to pressure china to meet its obligations other us farm in terests remain optimis tic about their future prospects there
