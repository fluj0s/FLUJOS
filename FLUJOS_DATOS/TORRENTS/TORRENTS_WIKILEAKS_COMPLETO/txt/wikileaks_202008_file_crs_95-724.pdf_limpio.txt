supreme court determined that the constitution protects womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy in companion case doe v bolton 410 us 179 1973 the court held fu rther that state may not unduly burden womans fundamental right to abortion by prohibiting or substantially limiting access to the means of effectuating her decision rather than settle the issue the courts decisions kindled heated debate and precipitated variety of gove rnmental actions at the national state and local levels designed either to nullify the rulings or hinder their effectuation these governmental regulations have in turn spawned further litigatio n in which resulting judicial refinements in the law have been more successful in dampening the controversy the law with respect to abortion in mid19 th century america followed the common law of england in all but few states by the time of the civil war number of states had begun to revise their statutes in order to prohibit abortion at all stages of gestation with various exceptions for therapeutic abortions the year 1967 marked the first victory of an abortion reform movement with the passage of liberalizing legislation in colorado the legislation was based on the model penal code between 1967 and 1973 approximately onethird of the states had adopted either in whole or in part the model penal codes provisions allowing abortion in instances other than where only the mothers life was in danger between 1968 and 1972 abortion statutes of many states were challenged on the grounds of vagueness violation of the fundamental right of privacy and denial of equal protection in 1973 the court ruled in roe and doe that texas and georgia statutes regulating abortion interfered to an unconstitutional extent with womans right to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy the decisions rested upon the conclusion that the fourteenth amendment right of personal privacy encompassed womans decision whether to carry pregnancy to term the supreme courts decisions in roe and doe did not address number of important abortion related issues which have been raised subsequently by state actions seeking to restrict the scope of the courts rulings these include the issues of informed consent spousal consent parental consent and reporting requirements in addition roe and doe never resolved the question of what if any type of abortion procedures may be required or prohibited by statute in 1989 the court indicated in webster v reproductive health services 492 us 490 that while it was not overruling roe and doe it was willing to apply less stringent standard of review to state restrictions respecting womans right to an abortion then in 1992 in planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey 505 us 833 1992 the court rejected specifically roes strict scrutiny standard and adopted the undue burden analysis in 2000 in stenberg v carhart 530 us 914 2000 the court determined that nebraska statute prohibiting the performance of partialbirth abortions was unconstitutional in 2007 however the court upheld the federal partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 in gonzales v carhart 550 us 124 2007 in upholding the federal act the court distinguished between the federal measure and the nebraska statute

the law with respect to abortion in mid19th century america followed existing common law of england in all but few states4 thus indictment would occur for aborting fetus of consenting female prior to quickening but by the time of the civil war an influential antiabortion movement began to affect legislation by inducing states to add to or revise their statutes in order to prohibit abortion at all stages of gestation by 1910 every state had antiabortion laws except kentucky whose courts judicially declared abortions to be illegal in 1967 fortynine states and the district of columbia classified the crime of abortion as felony the concept of quickening was longer used to determine criminal liability but was retained in some states to set punishment nontherapeutic abortions were sentially unlawful the states varied in their exceptions for therapeutic abortions fortytwo states permitted abortions only if necessary to save the life of the mother other states allowed abortion to save woman from serious permanent bodily injury or her life and health three states allowed abortions that were not unlawfully performed or that were not without lawful justification leaving interpretation of those standards to the courts 1 410 us 113 1973 2 410 us 179 1973 3 webster v reproductive health services 492 us 490 1989 planned parenthood of southwestern pennsylvania v casey 505 us 833 1992

laws in the united states for 1967 saw the first victory of an abortion reform movement with the passage of liberalizing legislation in colorado the movement had started in the early 1950s and centered its efforts on proposed criminal abortion statute developed by th american law institute as part of its model penal code that would allow abortions when childbirth posed grave danger to the physical or mental health of woman when there was high likelihood of fetal abnormality or when pregnancy resulted from rape or incest between 1967 and the supreme courts 1973 decisions in roe and doe approximately onethird of the states had adopted either in whole or in part the model penal codes provisions allowing abortions in instances other than where only the mothers life was in danger also by the end of 1970 four states alaska hawaii new york and washington had repealed criminal penalties for abortions performed in early pregnancy by licensed physician subject to stated procedural and health requirements the first us supreme court decision dealing with abortion was rendered in 1971 in united states v vuitch the court denied vagueness challenge to the district of columbia abortion statute 5 the net effect of the vuitch decision was to expand the availability of abortions under the dc laws provision allowing abortions where n ecessary for the preservation of the mothers health

the constitutionality of restrictive abortion statutes of many states was challenged on the grounds of vagueness violation of the fundamental right of privacy and denial of equal protection these challenges met with mixed success in the lower courts however in 1973 the supreme court issued its rulings in roe v wade and doe v bolton in those cases the court found that texas and georgia statutes regulating abortion interfered to an unconstitutional extent with womans right to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy the texas statute forbade all abortions not necessary for the purpose of saving the life of the mother the georgia enactment permitted abortions when continued pregnancy seriously threatened the womans life or health when the fetus was very likely to have severe birth defects or when the pregnancy resulted from rape the georgia statute required however that abortions be performed only at accredited hospitals and only after approval by hospital committee and two consulting physicians the courts decisions were delivered by justice blackmun for himself and six other justices justices white and rehnquist dissented the court ruled that states may not categorically proscribe abortions by making their performance crime and that states may not make abortions unnecessarily difficult to obtain by prescribing elaborate procedural guidelines the constitutional basis for the decisions rested upon the conclusion that the fourteenth amendment right of personal privacy embraced womans decision whether to carry pregnancy to term the court noted that its prior decisions had found at least the roots of guarantee of personal privacy in various amendments to the constitution or their penumbras ie protected offshoots and characterized the right to privacy as grounded in the fourteenth amendments concept of 5 402 us 62 1971

scope of that right the court stated that it included only personal rights that can be deemed fundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty and bears some extension to activities related to marriage procreation contraception family relationship and child rearing and education7 such right the court concluded is broad enough to encompass womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy8 with respect to protection of the right against state interference the court held that since the right of personal privacy is fundamental right only compelling state interest could justify its limitation by state thus while it recognized the legitimacy of the state interest in protecting maternal health and the preservation of the fetus potential life and the existence of rational connection between these two interests and the states antiabortion law the court held these interests insufficient to justify an absolute ban on abortions 9 instead the court emphasized the durational nature of pregnancy and held the states interests to be sufficiently compelling to permit curtailment or prohibition of abortion only during specified stages of pregnancy the high court concluded that until the end of the first trimester an abortion is more dangerous to maternal health than childbirth itself and found that with respect to the states important and legitimate interest in the health of the mother the compelling point in light of present medical knowledge is at approximately the end of the first trimester10 only after the first trimester does the states interest in protecting maternal health provide sufficient basis to justify state regulation of abortion and then only to protect this interest11 the compelling point with respect to the states in terest in the potential life of the fetus is at viability following viability the states interest permits it to regulate and even proscribe an abortion except when necessary in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother 12 the court defined viability as the point at which the fetus is potentially able to live outside the mothers womb albeit with artificial aid13 it summarized its holding as follows for the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester of pregnancy the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant womans attending physician b for the stage subsequent to approximately th end of the first trimester the state in promoting its interest in the health of the mother may if it chooses regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reason ably related to maternal health c for the stage subsequent to viability the state in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may if it chooses regulate and even proscribe abortion except where it is 6 roe 410 us at 152 7 roe 410 us at 1523 8 roe 410 us at 153 9 roe 410 us at 14850 10 roe 410 us at 163 11 roe 410 us at 1634

life or health of the mother14 in doe the court reiterated its holding in roe that the basic decision of when an abortion is proper rests with the pregnant mother and her physician but extended roe by warning that just as states may not prevent abortion by making their performance crime states may not make abortions unreasonably difficult to obtain by prescribing elaborate procedural barriers in doe the court struck down state requirements that abor tions be performed in licensed hospitals that abortions be approved beforehand by hospital committee and that two physicians concur in the abortion decision15 the court appeared to note however th at this would not apply to statute that protected the religious or moral beliefs of denominational hospitals and their employees16 the court in roe also dealt with the question whether fetus is person and thereby protected under the fourteenth amendment and other provisions of the constitution the court indicated that the constitution never specifically defines p erson but added that in nearly all the sections where the word person appears the use of the word is such that it has application only post natally none indicates with any assurance that it has any possible prenatal application17 the court emphasized that given the fact that in the major part of the 19th century prevailing legal abortion practices were far freer than today the court was persuaded that the word person as used in the fourteenth amendment does not include the unborn18 the court did not however resolve the question of when life actually begins while noting the divergence of thinking on this issue it instead articulated the legal concept of viability defined as the point at which the fetus is potentially able to live outside the womb although the fetus may require artificial aid 19 many other questions were also not addressed in roe and doe but instead formed the grist for burgeoning book of post roe litigation

supreme court those involving 1 funding restrictions for nontherapeutic elective abortions and 2 funding limitations for therapeutic medically necessary abortions 1 the 1977 trilogyrestrictions on public funding of nontherapeutic or elective abortions the supreme court in three related decisions ru led on the question whether the medicaid statute or the constitution requires public funding of nontherapeutic elective abortions for indigent women or access to public facilities for the performance of such abortions 20 the court held that the states have neither statutory nor constitutional obligation in this regard 14 roe 410 us at 1645 15 doe 410 us at 1969 16 doe 410 us at 1978 17 roe 410 us at 157 18 roe 410 us at 158 19 roe 410 us at 160 20 see beal v doe 432 us 438 1977 maher v roe

legislative history of title xix of the social security act medicaid requires participating state to fund every medical procedure falling within the delineated categories of medical care the court ruled that it was not inconsistent with the acts goals to refuse to fund unnecessary medical services however the court did indicate that title xix left state free to include coverage for nontherapeutic abortions should it choose to do so similarly in maher v roe the court held that the equal protection clause of the us constitution does not require state participating in the medicaid program to pay expenses incident to nontherapeutic abortions simply because the state has made policy choice to pay expenses incident to childbirth more particularly connecticuts policy of favoring childbirth over abortion was held not to impinge upon the fundamental right of privacy recognized in roe which protects woman from undue interference in her decision to terminate pregnancy finally in poelker v doe the court upheld municipal regulation that denied indigent pregnant women nontherapeutic abortions at public hospitals it also held that staffing those hospitals with personnel opposed to the performance of abortions did not violate the equal protection clause of the constitution poelker however did not deal with the question of private hospitals and their authority to prohibit abortion services 2 public funding of therapeutic or medically necessary abortions the 1977 supreme court decisions left open the question whether federal law such as the hyde amendment or similar state laws could validly prohibit governmental funding of therapeutic abortions the court ruled 54 that the hyde amendments abortion funding restrictions were constitutional the majority found that the hyde amendment neither violated the due process or equal protection guarantees of the fifth amendment nor the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment the court also upheld the right of state participating in the medicaid program to fund only those medically necessary abortions for which it received federal reimbursement21 in companion cases raising similar issues the court held that state of illinois statutory funding restriction comparable to the federal hyde amendment also did not contravene the constitutional restrictions of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment22 the courts rulings mean there is statutory or constitutional obligation of the states or the federal government to fund all medically necessary abortions

related to maternal health and are not overbearing23 the fact that the informed consent laws must define their requirements very narrowly in order to be constitutional wa s later confirmed the supreme court in 197924 the requirements of an informed consent statute must also be narrowly drawn so as not to unduly interfere with the physicianpatient relationship although the type of information required to be given to woman of necessity may vary according to the trimester of her pregnancy in city of akron v akron center for reproductive health inc along with various other provisions the court struck down the informed written consent section of the ordinance25 this provision required that the attending doctor inform the woman of the status of her pregnancy the development of her fetus the date of possible viability the physical and emotional complications that may result from an abortion and the availability of agencies to provide her with assistance and information with respect to birth control adoption and childbirth 26 the attending physician was also required to tell the patient of the risk s involved and any other information which in the physicians medical judgment would be critical to her decision of whether to terminate the pregnancy the court found this informed consent requirement to be constitutionally unacceptable because it essentially gave the government unreviewable authority over what information was to be given woman before she decided whether to have an abortion it was also objectionable because it intruded upon the discretion of the pregnant womans doctor27 the supreme court also invalidated the 24hour waiting period holding that the city of akron had not shown that any legitimate state interest was being served by an arbitrary and inflexible waiting period g21g153g152g158g156g138g149g550g18g138g155g142g151g157g138g149g561g5g152g151g156g142g151g157g561 in addition to informed consent the court in danforth found that spousal consent statutes which require written statement by the father of the fetus affirming his consent to the abortion are unconstitutional if the statutes allow the husband to unilaterally prohibit the abortion in the first trimester it should be noted that on the same day that the supreme court decided danforth it also summarily affirmed the lower court decision in coe v gerstein which held unconstitutional spousal consent law regardless of the stage of the womans pregnancy28 with respect to parental consent statutes the supreme court held in danforth that statutes which allow parent or guardian to absolutely prohibit an abortion to be performed on minor child were unconstitutional subsequently in bellotti v baird the court ruled that while state may require minor to obtain parental consent it must also provide an alternative procedure to procure authorization if parental consent is denied or the minor does not want to seek it29 bellotti thus entitles minor to some proceeding

incapable of making the decision at least showing that the abortion would be in her best interests in city of akron the court invalidated the provision in the akron ordinance which prohibited doctor from performing an abortion on an unemancipated minor unless the doctor obtained the informed written consent of one of her parents or her legal guardian or unless the minor herself obtained an order from court having jurisdiction over her that her abortion be performed or induced 30 the court relied on its earlier rulings in danforth and bellotti to conclude that the city of akron could not make blanket determination that all minors under the age of 15 are too immature to make this decision or that an abortion never may be in the minors best interests without parental approval31 moreover the akron ordinances provision concerning parental approval did not create expressly the alternative judicial procedure required by bellotti thus the ordinances consent provision had to fall because it foreclosed any possibility for casebycase evaluations of the maturity of pregnant minors32 in planned parenthood association of kans as city missouri inc v ashcroft the supreme court upheld missouris parental consent requirement33 it distinguished the provision involved here from that challenged in city of akron the missouri requirement unlike the akron one did provide an alternative procedure by which preg nant immature minor could show in court that she was sufficiently mature to make the abortion decision herself or that despite her immaturity an abortion would in her best interests

dependent minor without notifying her parents in h l v matheson 63 decision the court examined the narrow question of the facial constitutionality of statute requiring physician to give notice to parents if possible prior to performing an abortion on their minor daughter when the girl is living with and dependent upon her parents b when she is not emancipated by marriage or otherwise and c when she has made claim or showing as to her maturity or as to her relationship with her parents 34 the supreme court cited the interest in preserving family integrity and protecting adolescents in allowing states to require that parents be informed that their daughter is seeking an abortion and emphasized that the statute in question did not give veto power over the nors abortion decision the court rejected the minor womans contention that abortion was being singled out for special treatment in contrast to other surgical procedures like childbirth which do not require parental notice in

challenges to the constitutionality of state parental notification laws in hodgson v minnesota the court held 5 to 4 that minnesota requirement for notice to be given to both parents prior to minors having an abortion was unconstitutional unless the state legislature provided for an alternative hearing in court ie judicial bypass procedure36 in ohio v akron center for reproductive health 63 decision the court upheld an ohio statute requiring notice to one parent37 the court concluded that the statute which included judicial bypass procedure was consistent with the statutes upheld in danforth bellotti ashcroft and akron it is corollary to the greater intrusiveness of consent statutes that bypass procedure that will suffice for consent statute will suffice also for notice statute38 although the court upheld the ohio statute it made clear that it wa s not deciding whether parental notification statute must always include judicial bypass procedure to be constitutional39 in lambert v wicklund 1997 case involving montana parental notification statute the court again declined to consider whether parental notification requirement must include judicial bypass procedure40 the courts

reporting requirements must relate to maternal health remain confidential and may not be overbearing42 in ashcroft the court upheld the pathology report requirement this provision was related to

proscribe advertising regarding the availability of an abortion or abortionrelated services in another state45 the court found that the statute in question was unconstitutional because the state of virginia where the advertisement appeared had only minimal interest in the health and medical practices of new york the state in which the legal abortion services were located 3 abortions by nonphysicians in connecticut v menillo the supreme court ruled that state statutes similar to the texas law challenged in roe were constitutional to the extent that the statutes forbid nonphysicians from performing abortions46 the roe decision made it clear that state could not interfere with womans decision made in consultation with and upon the advice of her doctor to have an abortion in the first trimester of her pregnancy the menillo court found that pre roe restrictive abortion laws were still enforceable against nonphysicians47 4 locus of abortions in city of akron the court invalidated the challenged akron ordinance provision relating to where abortions can be performed the requirement stated that any second trimester abortion had to be performed in fullservice hospital the accreditation of these facilities required compliance with comprehensive standards governing an extensive variety of health and surgical services the result was that abortions under this section of the akron ordinance could not be performed in outpatient facilities that were not part of an acutecare fullservice hospital the court found this restriction unconstitutional noting that the possibility of having to travel to find facilities could result in both financial expense and added risk to womans health 48 the court also cited changed medical circumstances and the availability of safer procedures for performing second trimester abortions since roe for its conclusion that the akron hospitalization requirement imposed an unreasonable burden on womans right to an abortion in ashcroft the court invalidated missouris second trimester hospitalization requirement by the same 63 vote as in city of akron it said its decision and rationale in city of akron were controlling in simopoulos v virginia the supreme court ruled that virginias mandatory hospitalization requirement for second trimester abortions was constitutional49 the court distinguished the requirement in question from those it invalidated in city of akron and ashcroft which mandated that all second trimester abortions be performed in acutecare facilities in simopoulos the court said that in contrast the virginia law did not require that second trimester abortions be performed exclusively in fullservice hospitals the determination upholding the virginia provision actually turned on the definition of hospital the c ourt wrote under virginias hospitalization requirement outpatient surgical hospitals may qualify for licensing as hospitals in which secondtrimester abortions lawfully may be performed 50 45 421 us 809 1975 46 423 us 9 1975 47 menillo 423 us at 911 48 city of akron 462 us at 435 49 462 us 506 1983 50 simopoulos 462 us at 516

courts articulation of the concept of viability has required further elaboration particularly with regard to the critical question of who defines at what point fetus has reached viability in roe the court defined viability as the point at which the fetus is potentially able to live outside the mothers womb albeit with artificial aid51 such potentiality however must be for meaningful life and this cannot encompass simply momentary survival52 the court also noted that while viability is usually placed at about 28 weeks it can occur earlier and essentially left the point flexible for anticipated advances in medical skill finally roe stressed the central role of the pregnant womans doctor emphasizing that the abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently and primarily medical decision53 similar themes were stressed in danforth in which missouri law which defined viability as that stage of fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life support systems was attacked as an attempt to advance the point of viability to an earlier stage of gestation the court disagreed finding the statutory definition consistent with roe it reemphasized that viability is matter of medical judgment skill and technical ability and that roe meant to preserve the flexibility of the term54 moreover the danforth court held that it is not the proper function of the legislature or the courts to place viability which is essentially medical concept at specific point in the gestation period the time when viability is achieved may vary with each pregnancy and the determination of whether particular fetus is viable is and must be matter for the judgment of the attending physician 55 the physicians central role in determining viability and the lack of such definitional authority in the legislatures and courts was reaffirmed by the court in colautti v franklin 56 in danforth the court ruled that fetal protection statutes were generally overbroad and unconstitutional if they pertained to previable fetuses such statutes require doctor performing an abortion to use available means and medical skills to save the life of the fetus in colautti the supreme court held subsequently that such fetal protection statutes could only apply to viable fetuses and that the statute must be precise in setting forth the standard for determining viability in addition the court in colautti stressed that in order to meet the constitutional test of sufficient certainty fetal protection laws had to define whether doctors paramount duty was to the patient or whether the physician had to balance the possible danger to the patient against the increased odds of fetal survival 57 in ashcroft the court found that the secondphysician requirement during the third trimester was permissible under the constitution because it reasonably furthers the states compelling interest in protecting the lives of viable fetuses 58

present was unacceptable in situation such as this where there was the prospect of criminal liability being imposed59

questions relating to hospital requirements for second trimester abortions informed consent requirements waiting periods parental notification and consent and disposal of fetal remains the supreme court reaffirmed its decision in roe and its intention to continue to follow the trimester framework balancing womans constitutional right to decide whether to terminate pregnancy with the states interest in protecting potential life the states interest in protecting potential life becomes compelling at the point of viability ie when the fetus can exist outside of womans womb either on its own or through artificial means the definition of viability is the one used by the court in its roe decision in 1973 again in 1986 the court reaffirmed roe in thornburgh v american college of obstetricians and gynecologists 60 in 1989 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the state of missouris abortion statute in webster v reproductive health services 61 in this 54 decision while the majority did not overrule roe it indicated that it was willing to apply less stringent standard of review to state restrictions on abortion webster made it clear that state legislatures have considerable discretion to pass restrictive legislation in the future with the likelihood that such laws would probably pass constitutional muster the main provisions in the 1986 missouri law upheld by the court included 1 barring public employees from performing or assisting in abortions not necessary to save the life of the mother 2 barring the use of public buildings for performing abortions despite the fact that there were public monies involved eg building situated on public land and 3 requiring physicians believing woman desiring an abortion to be at least 20 weeks pregnant to perform tests to determine whether the fetus is viable the courts majority chose not to rule on the missouri laws preamble language which described life as beginning at conception with constitutional protections attaching at that point chief justice rehnquist writing for the court said that the preamble by its terms did not regulate abortion and that it was an expression of value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion he noted that the court in past cases has emphasized that roe implies limitation on states authority to make such value judgment the webster ruling was narrow in that it did not affect private doctors offices or clinics where most abortions are performed its significance derives more from the rationales articulated by the five justices regarding how abortion restrictions would be reviewed in the future webster set the stage for the courts 1992 decision in casey 59 city of akron 462 us at 451 60 476 us 747 1986 61 492 us 490 1989 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95724g3g139

reviewed the missouri provision respecting doctors testing for viability at 20 weeks of pregnancy while the five justices rehnquist white kennedy scalia and oconnor agreed that the provision was constitutional they had different reasons for so holding chief justice rehnquist joined by justices white and kennedy agreed with the district court and court of appeals that the required tests added increased costs to obtaining second trimester abortion in roe the court had held that in the second trimester of pregnancy the state could regulate abortion only in the interests of the health of the mother and that it is only after viability when the fetus can exist outside the womb on its own or through artificial means that states are allowed to actually restrict abortions in the interests of protecting the fetus ie potential life plurality disagreed with the roe reasoning in this context and with the trimes ter framework upon which it is predicated chief justice rehnquist and justices white and kennedy instead proposed to apply new standard of review for state abortion restrictions whether the state regulation permissibly furthers the states interest in protecting potential human life they concluded that the missouri laws viability testing requirements did and therefore found that pr ovision to be constitutional the plurality put in doubt the whole concept of viability as the basis of determining when the states interest in regulating abortion pertains we do not see why the states interest in protecting potential human life should come into existence only at the point of viability and there should therefore be rigid line allowing state regulation after viability but prohibiting it before viability however because the missouri law did not limit abortions prior to viability the plurality did not believe it was necessary to consider overruling roe also chief justice rehnquist stated that the missouri statute was different from the texas statute challenged in roethe latter being criminal abortion law the plurality stated that it was instead modifying and narrowing roe for application in future cases involving challenges to the constitutionality of state abortion restrictions justice scalia wrote separate concurrence because he believed that the court did not go far enough he would have overruled roe explicitly justice oconnor also part of the majority wrote separate concurrence as well but for different reasons she was not ready to go as far as justice scalia and overrule roe nor was she prepared to join the plurality and dispense with the trimester framework of roe at this time she stated in concurrence that the trimester system was problematic but that there was need to modify it in webster because the validity of the missouri laws viability provision could be decided under existing precedent ie roe and succeeding decisions she applied standard of undue burden and found the restriction to be constitutional requiring the performance of examinations and tests useful to determining whether fetus is viable when viability is possible and when it would not be medically imprudent to do so does not impose an undue burden on

an abortion was not burdened by these regulations the co urt reasoned that there was such violation because the government has duty to subsidize an activity simply because it is constitutionally protected and because woman is in worse position than if congress had never enacted title x both webster and rust energized legislative activity the former at both the federal and state levels and the latter only at the federal level some of the state legislative proposals that have become law have been challenged in the courts eg pennsylvania guam louisiana and utah the pennsylvania case planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey was decided by the us supreme court on june 29 1992 63 in highly fractionated 54 decision the court reaffirmed the basic constitutional right to an abortion while simultaneously allowing some new restrictions justices oconnor kennedy and s outer wrote the plurality opinion and they were joined in part by justices stevens and blackmun chief justice rehnquist and justices white scalia and thomas dissented the court refused to overrule roe and the plurality explained at length why it was important to follow precedent the constitution serves human values and while the effect of reliance on roe cannot be exactly measured neither can the certain cost of overruling roe for people who have ordered their thinking and living around that case be dismissed64 at the same time the plurality indicated that state laws which contained an outright ban on abortion would be unconstitutional nevertheless the court abandoned the trimester framework articulated in roe and the strict scrutiny standard of judicial review of abortion restrictions instead it adopted new analysis undue burden courts will now need to ask the question whether state abortion restriction has the effect of imposing an undue burden on womans right to obtain an abortion undue burden was defined as substantial obstacle in the path of woman seeking an abortion of nonviable fetus 65 the court applied this new analysis to the pennsylvania statute and concluded that four of the provisions did not impose an undue burden on the right to abortion and were constitutional those provisions upheld were the 24hour waiting period informed consent parental consent by minors with judicial bypass and reporting requir ements the court also upheld the medical emergency definition under which other requirements can be waived the spousal notification provision requiring married woman to tell her husband she intends to have an abortion did not survive the undue burden test and it was struck down as being unconstitutional the dissenters would have upheld all of the provisions in the pennsylvania law as well as overturn roe itself justices stevens and blackmun wrote separate opinions they joined the plurality in holding the spousal notification provision unconstitutional justice stevens was vague concerning whether he was accepting the new undue burden analysis but he did indicate that his application of it might be more stringent than the pluralitys on the other hand justice blackmun stated that he would retain the analysis used in roe ie strict scrutiny the courts decision in casey was significant because it appeared that the new standard of review would allow more state restrictions to pass constitutional muster the decision was also noteworthy because the court found that the states interest in protecting the potentiality of 63 505 us 833 1992 64 casey 505 us at 856 65 casey 505 us at 877

the state could regulate even to the point of favoring childbirth over abortion from the outset under roe which utilized the trimester framework during the first trimester of pregnancy the womans decision to terminate her pregnancy was reached in consultation between her and her doctor with virtually state involvement also under roe abortion was fundamental right that could not be restricted by the state except to serve compelling state interest roe s strict scrutiny form of review resulted in most state regulations being invalidated during the first two trimesters of pregnancy the undue burden standard seems to allow more regulation during that period this is evident from the courts overruling in part two of its earlier decisions which had followed roe city of akron and thornburgh v american college of obstetricians and gynecologists 66 in those cases the court applying strict scrutiny struck down 24hour waiting periods and informed consent provisions in contrast the court in

hear appeals in three abortion cases67 contrary decisions by the us courts of appeals regarding the validity of state statutes prohibiting partialbirth abortions as well as congressional interest in enacting federal partialbirth legislation may have prompted the court to decide stenberg v carhart 68 the term partialbirth abortion refers generally to method of abortion that involves the removal of the fetal body with the exception of the skull intact69 dilation and evacuation or d is the most common abortion procedure70 d involves the dilation of the cervix and the dismemberment of the fetus inside the uterus fetal parts are later removed from the uterus either with forceps or by suction the partialbirth abortion procedure is variation on the d procedure the procedure begins with the induced dilation of the cervix if the fetus presents head first the doctor will collapse the skull and remove the entire fetus through the cervix this procedure is called intact d by the medical community 71 if the fetus presents feet first the doctor will extract the fetal body through the cervix collapse the skull and remove the fetus through the cervix this procedure is commonly referred to as dilation and extraction or d x by the medical community72 the procedural similarities between the intact d and d x procedures and the d procedure 66 thornburgh v american college of

abortion bans may prohibit both methods of abortion73 for the remainder of this report the term d x is used to represent both the intact d procedure and the d x procedure in stenberg nebraska physician who performs abortions at specialized abortion facility sought declaration that nebraskas partial birth abortion ban statute violates the us constitution the nebraska statute provides partial birth abortion shall be performed in this state unless such procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother whose life is endangered by physical disorder physical illness or physical injury including lifeendangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself 74 the term partial birth abortion is defined by the statute as an abortion procedure in which the person performing the abortion partially delivers vaginally living unborn child before killing the unborn child and completing the delivery75 the term partially delivers vaginally living unborn child before killing the unborn child is further defined as deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina living unborn child or substantial portion thereof for the purpose of performing procedure that the person performi ng such procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn child76 violation of the statute carries prison term of up to 20 years and fine of up to 25000 in addition doctor who violates the statute is subject to the automatic revocation of his license to practice medicine in nebraska among his arguments dr carhart maintained that the meaning of the term substantial portion in the nebraska statute is unclear and thus could include the common d procedure in its ban of partialbirth abortions because the nebraska legislature failed to provide definition for substantial portion the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit interpreted the nebraska statute to proscribe both the d x and d procedures if substantial portion means an arm or leg and surely it must then the ban encompasses both the d and the d x procedures 77 the eighth circuit acknowledged that during the d procedure the physician often inserts his forceps into the uterus grasps part of the living fetus and pulls that part of the fetus into the vagina because the arm or leg is the most common part to be retrieved the physician would violate the statute 78 73 see womens medical professional corporation v voinovich 130 f3d 187 199 6th cir 1997 cert denied 523 us 1036 1998 the primary distinction between the two procedures is that the d procedure results in dismembered fetus while the d x procedure results in relatively intact fetus more specifically the d procedure involves dismembering the fetus in utero before compressing the skull by means of suction while the d x procedure involves removing intact all but the head of the fetus from the uterus and then compressing the skull by means of suction in both procedures the fetal head must be compressed because it is usually too large to pass through womans dilated cervix in the d procedure this is typically accomplished by either suctioning the intracranial matter or by crushing the skull while in the d x proced ure it is always accomplished by suctioning the intracranial matter 74 neb rev stat 283281 75 neb rev stat 283269 76 id 77 carhart v stenberg 192 f3d 1142 1150 8th cir 1999 78 id

requirement limited its scope and made it applicable only to the d x procedure according to the state the statute applied only to the deliberate and intentional performance of partial birth abortion that is the partial delivery of living fetus vaginally the killing of the fetus and the completion of the delivery79 however the eighth circuit found that the d procedure involves all of the same steps the physician intentionally brings substantial part of the fetus into the vagina dismembers the fetus leading to fetal demise and completes the delivery physician need not set out with the intent to perform d x procedure in order to violate the statute 80 the supreme court affirmed the eighth circuits decision by 54 margin the court based its decision on two determinations first the court concluded that the nebraska statute lacks any exception for the preservation of the health of the mother second the court found that the statute imposes an undue burden on the right to choose abortion because its language covers more than the d x procedure despite the courts previous instructions in roe and casey that abortion regulation must include an exception where it is necessary in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother the state argued that nebraskas partialbirth abortion statute does not require health exception because safe alternatives remains available to women and ban on partialbirth abortions would create risk to the health of women 81 although the court conceded that the actual need for the d x procedure is uncertain it recognized that the procedure could be safer in certain circumstances82 thus the court stated statute that altogether forbids d x creates significant health risk the statute consequently must contain health exception83 in its discussion of the undue burden that would be imposed if the nebraska statute was upheld the court maintained that the plain language of the statute covers both the d x and d procedures84 although the nebraska state attorney general offered an interpretation of the statute that differentiated between the two procedures the court was reluctant to recognize such view because the court traditionally follows lower federal court interpretations of state law and because the attorney generals interpretative views would not bind state courts the court held that the statutes reference to the delivery of living unborn child or substantial portion thereof implicates both the d x and d procedures 85 because the stenberg court was divided by only one member justice oconnors concurrence raised concern among those who support womans right to choose justice oconnors concurrence indicated that state statute prohibiting partialbirth abortions would likely withstand constitutional challenge if it included an exception for situations where the health of the mother is at issue and if it is narrowly tailored to proscribing the d x procedure alone 86 79

partialbirth abortion statutes that differentiate appropriately between d x and the other procedures87 in april 2007 the court again addressed the validity of statute that prohibits the performance of partialbirth abortions the federal partialbirt h abortion ban act of 2003 was signed by the president on november 5 2003 pl 108105 in general the act prohibits physicians from performing partialbirth abortion except when it is necessary to save the life of mother whose life is endangered by physical disorder physical illness or physical injury including life endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself physicians who violate the act are subject to fine imprisonment for not more than two years or both in gonzales v carhart the court upheld the federal statute finding that as facial matter it is not unconstitutionally vague and does not impose an undue burden on womans right to terminate her pregnancy 88 the court distinguished the federal statute from the nebraska law at issue in stenberg according to the court the federal statute is not unconstitutionally vague because it provides doctors with reasonable opportunity to know what conduct is prohibited89 unlike the nebraska law which prohibited the delivery of substantial portion of the fetus the federal statute includes anatomical landmarks that identify when an abortion procedure will be subject to the acts prohibitions the court noted if an abortion procedure does not involve the delivery of living fetus to one of these anatomical landmarkswhere depending on the presentation either the fetal head or the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the b ody of the motherthe prohibitions of the act do not apply 90 the court also maintained that the inclusion of scienter or knowledge requirement in the federal statute alleviates any vagueness concerns because the act applies only when doctor deliberately and intentionally delivers the fetus to an anatomical landmark the court concluded that doctor performing the d procedure would not face criminal liability if fetus is delivered beyond the prohibited points by mistake 91 the court observed the scienter requirements narrow the scope of the acts prohibition and limit prosecutorial discretion92 in reaching its conclusion that the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 does not impose an undue burden on womans right to terminate her pregnancy the court considered whether the federal statute is overbroad prohibiting both the d x and d procedures the court also considered the statutes lack of health exception relying on the plain language of the act the court determined that the federal statute could not be interpreted to encompass the d procedure the court maintained that the d procedure continued amount in practical terms to substantial obstacle to woman seeking an abortion citation omitted thus ban on partialbirth abortion that only proscribed the d x method of abortion and that included an exception to preserve the life and health of the mother would be constitutional in my view 87 see stenberg 530 us at 950 88 550 us 124 127 s ct 1610 2007 unlike asapplied challenges which consider the

statute uses the phrase delivers living fetus93 the court stated does not involve the delivery of fetus because it requires the removal of fetal parts that are ripped from the fetus as they are pulled through the cervix94 the court also identified the acts specific requirement of an overt act that kills the fetus as evidence of its inapplicab ility to the d procedure the court indicated this distinction matters because unlike d x standard does not involve delivery followed by fatal act 95 because the act was found not to prohibit the d procedure the court concluded that it is not overbroad and does not impose an undue burden womans ability to terminate her pregnancy according to the court the absence of health exception also did not result in an undue burden citing its decision in ayotte v planned parenthood of northern new england 96 the court noted that health exception would be required if it subjected women to significant health risks97 however acknowledging medical disagreement about the acts requirements ever imposing significant health risks on women the court maintained that the question becomes whether the act can stand when this medical uncertainty persists98 reviewing its past decisions the court indicated that it has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty99 the court concluded that this medical uncertainty provides sufficient basis to conclude in facial challenge of the statute that it does not impose an undue burden 100 although the court upheld the partialbirth abortion ban act of 2003 without health exception it acknowledged that there may be discrete and welldefined instances where the prohibited procedure must be used101 however the court indicated that exceptions to the act should be considered in asapplied challenges brought by i ndividual plaintiffs in an asapplied challenge the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced than in facial attack102 justice ginsburg authored the dissent in gonzales she was joined by justices stevens souter and breyer describing the courts decision as alarming

obstetriciangynecologists and surgeons who perform abortions justice ginsburg maintained that the courts hostility to the right roe and casey secured is not concealed109 she argued that when statute
