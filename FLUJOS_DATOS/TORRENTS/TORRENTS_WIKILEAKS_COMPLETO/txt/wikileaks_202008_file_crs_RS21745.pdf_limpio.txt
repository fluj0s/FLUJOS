related pape rs include crs report rs21432 and crs report rs21695 historical background the differences between the sunni and shiite isla mic sects are rooted in disagreements over the succession to the prophet muhammad who died in 632 ad and over the nature of leadership in the muslim community the historic debate centered on whether to award leadership to qualif ied pious individual who would follow the customs of the prophet or to transmit lead ership exclusively through the prophets bloodline the question was settled initially when community leaders elected companion of the prophets named abu bakr to become the first caliph arabic for successor although most muslims acce pted this decision some supported the candidacy of ali ibn abi talib the prophet s cousin and soninlaw husband of the prophets daughter fatima ali had played prominent role during the prophets lifetime but he lacked seniority within the ar abian tribal system and was bypassedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21745crs2 this situation was unacceptable to some of alis followers who considered abu bakr and the two succeeding caliphs uma r and uthman to be illegitimate alis followers believed that the prophet muhammad himself had named ali as successor and that the status quo was viola tion of divine order few of alis partisans orchestrated the murder of the third caliph uthman in 656 ad and ali was named cali ph ali in turn was assassinated in 661 ad and his hussein 680 ad died in battle against forces of the sunni caliph alis eldest s on hassan d 670 ad is also revered by shiite muslims some of who claim he was poisoned by the sunni caliph muawiyah those who supported alis ascendancy b ecame later known as shia word stemming from the term shiat ali meaning supporters or helpers of ali others respected and accepted the legitimacy of his caliphate but opposed political succession based on bloodline to the prophet this group who c onstituted the majority of muslims came to be known in time as sunni meaning fo llowers of the prophets customs sunna the caliphate declined as religious and political institution after the thirteenth century although the term caliph continued to be used by some muslim leaders until it was abolished in 1924 by turkeys first pr esident mustafa kemal ataturk the decline and abolition of the caliphate became powe rful religious and political symbol to some sunni islamic activists during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries these activists argued that leaders in the islamic world d undermined the caliphate by abandoning the true path of islam inspired by these fi gures some contemporar sunni extremists such as osama bin laden and others advocate th restoration of ne w caliphate based on pure islamic principles international terrorism and sectarian violence in iraq islamic theology and sectarian considerations are rarely suffi cient explanations for instances of terrorism and political violence in the contemporary muslim world political social and economic factors often determine whether given dispute reflects sectarian identities or transcends them sunni and shiite organizations nd governments are known to collaborate when they perceive that their interests overlap in other instances theological differences can directly fuel sectarian hatred and viol ence members and supporters of terrorist organizations like qaeda and its affiliates exhibit regional and theological diversity that makes it difficult to identify shared motives that can be linked to specific religious doctrines many sunni and shiite muslims re fer to members and supporters of qaeda and similar groups simply as takfiris arabic for those who accuse others of apostasy because of qaedas habit of denounc ing individuals who dont accept narrow interpretation of sunni islam as non believers and leg itimate targets in iraq sunnishiite relations are comp licated by the dramatic shift in power dynamics that accompanied the removal of the s unnidominated sadda m hussein regime which ended centuries of sunni political dom inance lingering sh iite resentment and sunni fears associated with this shift have helped transform local and individual political or economic disputes into broa der sectarian confrontations in some cases both sunni and shiite insurgent groups and m ilitias have c onducted attacks on coalition and iraqi government forces and civilians since 2003 although major shiite political factions largely abandoned violent tactics in favor of political participa tion during 2005 intra shiite political rivalries have led to outbreaks of violence particularly in southern iraq similarly some sunni iraqis in baghdad nd anbar province are now fighting against predominantly sunni insurgent groups foreig n fighters and qaeda operatives whom they hold responsible for ongoing violence in their communitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21745crs3 core beliefs and shared practices although there are considerable differences between sunni and shiite islam the two islamic sects share common traditions beliefs and doctrines all muslims believe that the prophet muhammad was the ssenger of allah the arabic word for god all believe that they must abide by the revelati ons given to the prophet by allah as recorded in the quran and by the hadith sayings of the prophet and his companions the concepts of piety striving for goodness nd social justice are fundamental to islamic belief and practice additiona lly all muslims are expected to live in accordance with the five pillars of islam 1 shahada recital of the creed the re is god but allah and muhammad is his prophet 2 salat five obligatory prayers in day 3 zakat giving alms to the poor 4 sawm fasting from sunrise to sunset during the month of ramadan and 5 hajj making pilgrimage to m ecca once during lifetime if one is physically and fi nancially able islamic jurisprudence the basic sources for islamic jurisprudence be it sunni or shiite are the quran the sunna customs of the prophet m uhammad as relayed in the hadith qiyas analogy ijma consensus and ijtihad individual reasoning the primary function of the learned religious leaders is the interpretation of islamic law sharia there are codified laws in either sunni or shiite islam rather there are sources for the interpretation of law and these sources are similar among shiites and sunnis shiite hadith differ from sunni hadith mainly in that they include the sayings of the shiite imams who are considered to have been divinely inspired shiite legal interpretation also allows more space for hum an reasoning than sunni interpretation does sunni islam development and basic tenets religious practices and beliefs the majority of muslims today are sunnis they accept the first four caliphs including ali as the rightly guided rulers who followed the prophet in theory sunnis believe that the leader imam of the muslim community should be selected on the basi s of communal consensus on the existing political order and on leaders individual merits this premise has been inconsistently practiced within the sunni muslim community throughout history sunni muslims do not bestow upon human beings the exalted status given only to prophets in the quran in contrast to the shiite venera tion of imams sunnis have ss elaborate and arguably less powerful religious hierarchy than shiites in contrast to shiites sunni religious teachers historically have been under st ate control at the same time sunni islam tends to be more flexible in allowing lay persons to serve as prayer leaders and preachers in their dayto day practices sunnis and shiites exhibit subtle differences in the performance of their obligatory prayers both groups share s imilar understanding of ba sic islamic beliefs islamic law within sunni islam there are four schools of jurisprudence that offer alternative interpretations of legal decisions affecting the lives of muslims the four schools of jurisprudence rely mostly on analog as way to formulate legal rulings and they also give different weight to the sayi ngs of the prophet and his companions hadith within their decisions in some secular count ries such as turkey the opinions issued by religious scholars represent mo ral and social guidelines fo r how muslims should practice their religion and are not considered legally bindinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21745crs4 1 see crs report rs21695 the islamic traditions of wahhabism and salafiyya by christopher m blanchardthe four legal schools which vary on certa in issues from strict to broad legal interpretations are the 1 hanafi this is the oldest school of law it was founded in iraq by abu hanifa d 767 ad it is prevalent in turkey central asia the balkans iraq syria lebanon jordan afghanistan pa kistan india and bangladesh 2 maliki this was founded in the arabian peni nsula by malik ibn anas d 795 ad it is prevalent in north africa mauritania kuwait and bahrain 3 shafi this school was founded by muhammad ibn idris alshafii d 819 ad it is prevalent in egypt sudan ethiopia somalia parts of ye men indonesia and malaysia and 4 hanbali this was founded by ahmad hanbal d 855 it is prevalent in sa udi arabia qatar pa rts of oman and the united arab emirates sectarian divisions sunni islam has had less pro minent sectarian divisions than shiite islam the ibadi sect which is centered mostly in oman east africa and in parts of algeria libya and tunisia has been sometimes misrepresented as sunni sect ibadi religious and political dogma generally resembles basic s unni doctrine although the ibadis are neither sunni nor sh iite ibadis believe strongly in the existence of just muslim society and argue that religious leader s should be chosen by community leaders for their knowledge and piety w ithout regard to race or lineage the sunni puritanical movement called wahhabism has become well known in recent years and is arguably the most pervasive revivalist movement in the islamic world1 this movement founded in arabia by the scholar muhammad ibn abd alwahhab 17031791 ad is considered to be an offs hoot of the hanbali school of law abd alwahhab encouraged return to the ort hodox practice of the f undamentals of islam as embodied in the quran and in the life of the prophet muhammad in the eighteenth century muhammad ibn saud f ounder of the modernday saudi dynasty formed an alliance with abd alwahhab and unified the disparate tribes in the arabian peninsula from that point forward there has been close relationship between the saudi ruling family and the wahhabi religious establishment the most conservative interpretations of wahhabi islam view shiite s and other nonwahhabi mus lims as dissident heretics following the 1979 soviet invasion of afghanis tan and shiite islamic revolution in iran saudi arabias ruling sunni royal family began more actively promoting wahhabi religious doctrine abroad and has since fina nced the construction of wahhabioriented mosques religious schools and isla mic centers in dozens of countries shiite islam development and basic tenets initially the shiite movement gained wide following in areas that now include iraq iran yemen and parts of central and south asia in most of the world shiites would continue as minority today according to some timates shiite islam is practiced among approximately 10 to 15 of the worlds muslim population leadership of the community for shiites the first true leader of the muslim community is ali who is considered an imam term used among shiites not only to indicate leadership abilities but also to si gnify blood relations to the prophet muhammad as alis descendants took over leadership of the shiite community the functions of anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21745crs5 2 roy parviz mottahedeh keeping the shiites straight religion in the news 6 2 2003imam became more clearly defined each ima m chose successor and according to shiite beliefs he passed down type of spiritual knowledge to the next leader imams served as both spiritual and political leaders but as shiites increasingly lost their political battles with sunni muslim rulers imams focused on veloping spirituality that would serve as the core of shiite religious practices and beliefs shiites believe that when the line of imams descended from ali ended religious leaders known as mujtahid s gained the right to interpret religious mystical and legal knowledge to the broader community the most learned among these teachers are known as ayatollah s lit the sign of god shiite practices and core beliefs shiite religious practice centers around the remembrance of alis younger hussein w ho was martyred near the town of karbala in iraq by sunni forces in 680 his death is commemorated each year on the tenth day of the islamic month of muharram in somber and sometimes violent ritualistic remembrance known as ashura marked am ong some shiites by the ritual of self flagellation as minority that was often persecuted by sunnis shiites found solace in the ashura ritual the telling of the martyr dom of hussein and the moral lessons to be learned from it which reinforced shiite religious traditions and practices twelver shiism twelver shiism the most common form of shiism today is pervasive in iran iraq lebanon and bahrain twelvers accept line of twelve infallible imams descendent fro m ali and believe them to ve been divinely appointed from birth the twelve imams are viewed as harbors of the faith and as the designated interpreters of law and theology twelvers believe that the twelfth and last of these imams disappeared in the late ninth century this hidden imam is expected to return to lead the community following the twelfth imams disappearance as one scholar notes pacifist trend emerged among twelvers who chose to withdraw from politics and quietly await his coming2 in the twentieth century changes in the political landscape of the middle east led to new competing activist trend among twelver groups in iran and lebanon typified by the late iranian religious leader ayatollah khomeini ismaili or sevener shiism although most shiites agree on the basic premise that ali was the first rightful imam they disagree on his successors the ismailis who are the second largest shiite sect broke off in the eighth century reco gnizing only the first seven imams the seventh was named ismail hence the names ismaili and sevener historically and at least until the sixteenth century the ismailis were far more disposed than the twelvers to pursuing military and territorial power in the past they established powerful ruling states which played significant roles in the development of islamic history today ismailis ar scattered throughout the world but are prominent in afghanistan under the naderi clan in indi and in pakistan there are also ismaili communities in east and south africa other shiite sects the zaydis who acknowledge the firs t five imams and differ over the identity of the fifth are minority s ect of shiite islam mostly found in yemen the zaydis reject the concepts of the imams infallibility and of hidden imam other sects such as the alawites and druzes are generally considered to be derived from shiite islam although their religious practices ar secretive and some do not regard theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21745crs6 adherents as muslims alawites exist mostly in syria and lebanon the assad family that effectively has ruled syria since 1971 are awite many alawites interpret the pillars duties of islam as symbo lic rather than applied and celebrate an eclectic group of christian and islamic holidays in turkey the alevi s are an offshoot group of shiite islam that has been often confused with syrian alawites or other shiites not much is known about their religious practices most alevis are wellintegrated into turkish society and speak both turkish and kurdish the druze community was an eleventhcentury offshoot of ismaili shiite islam nd is concentrated in lebanon jord an syria and israel today the druze faith differs considerably from mainstream shiite islam demographic distribution estimates notes figures in this map indicate the percenta ges of sunni and shiite muslims in the citizen population some figures do not total 100 as they exclude christians and other minorities in many countries particularly where shiites constitute significant religious minority there are reliable or exact statistics of the percentage of these groups in the broader population noncitizen workers of nonmuslim faiths are common in the persian gulf states and are not reflected in these figures existing indicators of religious affiliation in iraq as reported by the us central intelligence agency cia are only estimates in lebanon census has been conducted since 1932 these complications in addition to general shortcomings in the gathering of reliable statistical information about the region must be considered when examining this map statistics
