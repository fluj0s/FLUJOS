according to some estimates 60 of children born during the 1990s will spend significant portion of their childhood in home without their father research indicates that children raised in singleparent families are more likely than children raised in two parent families with both biological parents to do poorly in school have emotional and behavioral problems become teenage parents and have povertylevel incomes in hopes of improving the longterm outlook for children in singleparent families federal state and local governments along with public and private organizations are supporting programs and activities that promote the financial and personal responsibility of noncustodial fathers to their children and increase the participation of fathers in the lives of their children these programs have come to be known as responsible fatherhood programs sources of federal funding for fatherhood programs include the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program tanf state maintenanceofeffort moe funding welfaretowork funds child support enforcement cse funds and social services block grant title xx funds beginning with the 106th congress the house but not the senate passed bills containing specific funding for responsible fatherhood initiatives in the 107th and 108th congresses as part of welfare reauthorization bills moreover from the start president bush has been supporter of responsible fatherhood programs each of his budgets has included funding for such programs in the 109th congress pl 109171 the deficit reduction act of 2005 was enacted it included provision that provides up to 50 million per year fy2006fy2010 in competitive grants to states territories indian tribes and tribal organizations and public and nonprofit community groups including

families with children under age 18 were maintained by one parent1 this figure is up from 11 in 1970 most of the children in these single parent families were being raised by their mothers in 2005 23 were in motheronly families and 5 in fatheronly families according to some estimates 60 of children born during the 1990s will spend significant portion of their childhood in home without their biological father research indicates that children raised in singleparent families are more likely than children raised in twoparent families with both biological parents to do poorly in school have emotional and behavioral problems become teenage parents and have povertylevel incomes as adults2 nonetheless it is widely acknowledged that most of these mothers despite the added stress of being single parent do good job raising their children that is although children with absent fathers are at greater risk of having the aforementioned problems most do not experience them in hopes of improving the longterm outlook for children in singleparent families federal state and local governments along with public and private organizations are supporting programs and activities that promote the financial and personal responsibility of noncustodial fathers to their children and reduce the incidence of father absence in the lives of children the third finding of the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 states promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherhood is integral to successful child rearing and the wellbeing of children moreover three of the four goals of the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program are consistent with the components of most fatherhood programs the three fatherhoodrelated goals are ending welfare dependence by employment and marriage reducing outofwedlock pregnancies and encouraging the formation and maintenance of twoparent families thus states may spend tanf and tanf state maintenance of effort moe funds on fatherhood programs further any services that are directed to the goal of reducing nonmarital births or the goal of encouraging twoparent families are free of income eligibility rules 1 us census bureau family and living

rebecca maynard ed kids having kids robin hood foundation special report on the costs of adolescent childbearing new york 1996 crs2 with the exception of the federal child support enforcement cse program fathers historically have been ignored with regard to their input or participation in welfare programs moreover it was not until 1996 that congress broadened its view to acknowledge the noneconomic contributions that fathers make to their children by authorizing the use of cse funds to promote access and visitation programs with the enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law which helped reduce the welfare rolls increase the employment of lowincome mothers and strengthen the cse program congress began focusing its attention on the emotional wellbeing of children historically congress had treated visitation and child support as legally separate issues with only child support enforcement activities under the purview of the federal government the 1996 law authorized an annual 10 million entitlement of cse funds to states to establish and operate access and visitation programs3 it appears that consensus while fathers must fulfill their financial has occurred regarding the need commitments they must also fulfill their emotional to connect or reconnect commitments dads play indispensable roles that noncustodial parents to their cannot be measured in dollars

in welfare reform we must find way to help children by providing them with more than working mother and sporadic child support she noted that many lowincome fathers have problems similar to those of mothers on welfare namely they are likely to have dropped out of high school to have little work experience and to have significant barriers that lessen their ability to find andor keep job she also asserted that in many cases these men are dead broke rather than dead beats and that the federal government should help these noncustodial fathers meet both their financial and emotional obligations to their children during the 106th 107th and 108th congresses legislation was passed by the house but not by the senate that would have established categorical competitive grants to community and faithbased organizations for responsible fatherhood programs moreover each of president bushs budgets has included grant programs 3 the child access and visitation program section 391 of pl 104193 funded the following activities in fy2005 mediation counseling parental education development of parenting plans visitation enforcement monitored visitation neutral dropoff and pickup supervised visitation and development of guidelines for visitation and custody in fy2005 about 69000 individuals received services the most common services were parenting education supervised visitation and

by the house were part of welfare reauthorization legislation the 109th congress introduced several welfare reauthorization bills that included funding for responsible fatherhood grant programs pl 109171 the deficit reduction act of 2005 s 1932 hrept 109362 which was enacted on february 8 2006 included provision that provides up to 50 million per year fy2006fy2010 for competitive responsible fatherhood grants for more detailed legislative history of fatherhood initiatives see the discussion of legislative action later in this report what are fatherhood initiatives the realization that one parent especially lowincome parent often cannot meet the financial needs of her or his children is not new in 1975 congress viewed the cse program as way to make noncustodial parents responsible for the financial support of their children in more recent years congress has viewed the cse program as the link that could enable single parents who are lowwage earners to become selfsupporting with the advent of welfare reform in 1996 congress agreed that many noncustodial parents were in the same financial straits as the mothers of their children who were receiving cash welfare thus the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 requires states to have laws under which the state has the authority to issue an order or request that court or administrative process issue an order that requires noncustodial parents who were unable to pay their child support obligation for child receiving tanf benefits to participate in tanf work activities as noted earlier the 1996 law also provided funding for states to develop programs that supported the noncustodial parents right and responsibility to visit and interact with his or her children to help fathers and mothers meet their parental responsibilities many policy analysts and observers support broadbased collaborative strategies that go beyond welfare and child support agencies and include schools work programs prison systems churches community organizations and the health care system although congress only recently authorized federal funding specifically earmarked for responsible fatherhood programs many states and localities private organizations and nonprofit agencies have been operating fatherhood programs for several years4 most fatherhood programs include media campaigns that emphasize the importance of emotional physical psychological and financial connections of fathers to their children to counterbalance some of the procedural psychological emotional and physical barriers to paternal involvement most fatherhood programs include many of the following components 4 national governors association promoting responsible fatherhood an update washington august 3 1998 crs4 parenting education course that describes the responsibilities of parents to their children it discusses the need for affection gentle guidance financial support the need to be proud example and respectful of the childs mother and the need to recognize developmentally appropriate behavior for children of different ages and respond appropriately to childrens developmental needs responsible decisionmaking with regard to sexuality establishment of paternity and financial support mentoring relationships with successful fathers and successful couples mediation services communicating with the other parent supervised visitation discipline of children etc providing an understanding of the cse program conflict resolution coping with stress problemsolving skills developing values in children appropriate discipline participation in childrearing understanding malefemale relationships peer support practical tasks to stimulate involvement discussing ways to increase parentchild interactions such as fixing dinner for children taking children to the park playing game helping children with school work listening to childrens concerns setting firm limits on behavior and job training opportunities skills development interviewing skills job search job retention skills job advancement skills etc although most people refer to programs that seek to help fathers initiate or maintain contact with their children and become emotionally involved in their lives as fatherhood programs the programs generally are genderneutral their underlying goal is participation of the noncustodial parent in the lives of his or her children funding for fy2001 congress appropriated 3 million for nongovernmental national fatherhood organization named the national fatherhood initiative pl 106553 and an additional 500000 for the national fatherhood initiative and 500000 for another nongovernmental organization called the institute for responsible fatherhood and family revitalization pl 106554 however the house and senate failed to reach agreement on hr 4678 in the 106th congress bill that included funding for nationwide fatherhood grants program 140 million over four years similarly during the 107th and 108th congress the house and the senate did not reach agreement on legislation that included responsible fatherhood grant program nevertheless several sources of federal funding for fatherhood programs already existed and continue to exist they include the tanf program tanf state maintenanceofeffort moe funding welfaretowork funds cse funds and crs5 social services block grant title xx funds5 according to hhs about half of all states use tanf funds for responsible fatherhood programs6 in addition many private foundations are providing financial support for fatherhood programs as mentioned earlier states can use tanf block grant funds and state moe funds on programs or services that accomplish the broad purposes of the tanf program these sources of funding are potentially the largest sources of funding for fatherhood initiatives7 pursuant to pl109171 the tanf block grant program to states was reauthorized through fy2010 at funding level of 165 billion annually in addition the state funding or moe requirement at the 75 level is about 104 billion8 the cash welfare caseload declined from peak of 50 million aid to families with dependent children afdc families in 1995 to 19 million tanf families in 2005 the 62 reduction in the cash welfare caseload together with the fixed block grant funding means that funds that otherwise would have been spent for cash assistance are now available for other purposes these other purposes could include fatherhood initiatives which are allowable uses of tanf and state moe funds moreover fatherhood initiatives are not subject to the requirements that apply to spending for ongoing cash assistance such as work requirements and time limits9 pl 109171 the deficit reduction act of 2005 s 1932 hrept 109362 was enacted during the 109th congress it included provision that provides up to 50 million per year for each of the five fiscal years 2006 through 2010 for competitive responsible fatherhood grants to states territories indian tribes and tribal organizations and public and nonprofit community organizations including religious organizations for responsible fatherhood initiatives according to data from the administration for children and families acf in the us department of health and human services hhs 99 grantees were 5 funding sources for fatherhood programs welfare information network vol 5 2 january 2001 6 us department of health and human services hhs fact sheet promoting responsible fatherhood washington april 26 2002 7 in addition to longterm welfare recipients the 27 billion in welfaretowork funds appropriated for fy1998 and fy1999 could have been used to provide services for certain noncustodial parents who were unemployed underemployed or having difficulty making their child support payments states and localities were allowed to continue to spend their welfaretowork funds through fy2004 8 the tanf block grant program also has moe requirement that states continue to spend at least 75 80 if they fail to meet tanf work requirements of what they spent under prior law cash welfarerelated programs in fy1994 on families that meet tanf eligibility requirements 9 dana reichert broke but not deadbeat reconnecting lowincome fathers and children washington national conference of state legislatures july 1999 crs6 awarded fiveyear contracts to implement responsible fatherhood programs the contracts in aggregate amounted to 41 million per year10 research and evaluation research findings indicate that father absence affects outcomes for children in terms of schooling emotional and behavioral maturity labor force participation and nonmarital childbearing these findings hold when income is taken into account so the negative effects of father absence are not limited to those created by reduced family income11 both advocates and critics of the cse program agree that parents should be responsible for the economic and emotional wellbeing of their children they agree that many lowincome noncustodial parents are unable to meet their financial responsibility to their children and are barely able or unable to support themselves they also agree that some noncustodial parents do not know how to be responsible parents because they were not taught that knowledge or were not exposed to enough positive role models that they could emulate below are several examples of demonstration programs that seek to or sought to help lowincome men become responsible fathers by helping them to gain employment or job mobility and by teaching them life skills so that they might reconnect with their children in positive sustained manner mdrc parents fair share demonstration project the parents fair share pfs demonstration was national demonstration project that combined job training and placement peer support groups and other services with the goal of increasing the earnings and child support payments of unemployed noncustodial parents generally fathers of children on welfare improving their parenting and communication skills and providing an opportunity for them to participate more fully and effectively in the lives of their children12 between 1994 and 1996 over 5000 noncustodial parents who were eligible to participate in the sevensite pfs demonstration were randomly assigned to either program experiment group that would receive pfs services or control group that 10 information on the responsible fatherhood grants in each of the 10 hhs regions is available at httpwwwacfhhsgovprogramsofahmabstractsindexhtm 11 meeting the challenge what the federal government can do to support responsible fatherhood efforts report to the president washington january 2001 http fatherhoodhhsgovguidance01 12 the parents fair share pfs demonstration was funded by consortium of private foundations the pew charitable trusts the ford foundation the att foundation the mcknight foundation and the northwest area foundation and federal agencies the us department of human services and the us department of laborthe pfs demonstration was conducted in seven cities dayton ohio grand rapids michigan jacksonville florida angeles california memphis tennessee springfield massachusetts and trenton new jersey crs7 would not receive pfs services the interim report on the pfs demonstration which was designed by mdrc and conducted and funded by public and private organizations found that parents who received pfs services were more likely to pay child support through the cse system than those who remained in the control group in all seven sites the proportion of parents who paid child support during the 18 month followup period increased significantly but the amount of child support paid over the 18 months increased by statistically significant amount in only two of the seven sites the final report on the pfs demonstration concluded that the program did not significantly increase employment or earnings among the full sample of pfs participants during the two years after they entered the program however the program did increase earnings among subgroup of men who were characterized as less employable ie those without high school diploma and with little recent work experience13 in addition another of the final reports found that although pfs did not affect the frequency of fathers visits with their children it did increase the level of disagreement between parents about childrearing according to the researchers this finding might suggest that some noncustodial parents were becoming more involved in new areas of decisionmaking about the child which the researchers viewed as positive development the report noted that the increased level of disagreements between the parents was not accompanied by an increased level of aggressive forms of conflict or domestic violence which researchers surmise might indicate that the parents were able to distinguish between legitimate parental differences of opinion versus latent animosity in their malefemale relationship14 one of the reports noted the following as lessons learned from the pfs demonstration lowincome noncustodial fathers are disadvantaged group many live on the edge of poverty and face severe barriers to finding jobs while those who can find work typically hold lowwage or temporary jobs despite their low irregular income many of these fathers are quite involved in their childrens lives and when they can provide financial and other kinds of support some services such as peer support proved to be very important and valuable to the men and became the focal point of the program other services such as skillbuilding were hard to implement because the providers had little experience working with such disadvantaged group it was difficult to find employers willing to hire the men and the providers were not equipped to deal with the circumstances of men who often were simply trying to make it from one day to the next finally we learned about the challenges of implementing program like pfs which involves the partnership of various agencies with different goals and about the difficulty of recruiting lowincome fathers into such program15 13 john m martinez and cynthia miller working and earning the impact of parents fair share on lowincome fathers employment new york mdrc october 2000 14 virginia knox and cindy redcross parenting and providing the impact of parents fair share on paternal involvement new york mdrc october 2000 15 cynthia miller and virginia knox the challenge of helping lowincome fathers support their children final lessons from parents fair share new york mdrc continued crs8 some of the recommendations for future programs included structure the program to encourage longerterm participation and to include job retention services provide fathers who cannot find private sector employment with community service jobs earmark adequate funding for employment services involve custodial mothers in the program and provide fathers with legal services to help them gain visitation rights and encourage partnerships between cse agencies and fatherhood programs16 some researchers of the pfs approach contend that broader array of intensive employment services such as skills training combined with parttime work and community service employment for persons who were unable to get job might have improved the outcomes of the program other analysts maintain that most of the fathers who participated in the pfs demonstration were estranged from their children when they entered the program and that some of them participated in lieu of serving time in jail they assert that new unwed fathers are generally very attached to their children around the time of the childs birth and probably are more motivated than fathers of older children to take advantage of the opportunities andor services offered by fatherhood programs17 fragile families and child wellbeing study fragile family consists of lowincome children born outside of marriage whose two natural parents are working together to raise them either by living together or frequent visitation according to the 1997 national survey of americas families nsaf 25 of poor children under the age of two who were born outside of marriage lived with both of their biological parents another 35 lived with their mother and saw their father at least every week18 the fragile families and child wellbeing study is following group of 4700 children who were born in 20 large us cities19 the total sample size is 4700 families including 3600 unmarried couples and 1100 married couples the data were intended to be representative of nonmarital births in each of the 20 cities and also representative of all nonmarital births in us cities with populations over 200000 both parents were interviewed at the childs birth and again when the child was age 1 2 and 5 in addition inhome assessments of the children and their home environments were performed when the children were ages 3 and 5 the parent interviews provided information on attitudes relationships parenting behavior 15 continued november 2001 pp vvi 16 ibid p v 17 sara mclanahan

are involved in stable longterm relationships how many expect to marry how many experience high levels of conflict or domestic violence what factors push new unwed parents together what factors pull them apart how do public policies affect parents behaviors and living arrangements what are the long term consequences for parents children and society of new welfare regulations stronger paternity establishment and stricter child support enforcement what roles do child care and health care policies play how do these policies play out in different labor market environments20 initial analysis of the baseline data collected in 16 of the 20 cities from april 1998 through august 2000 indicated that 51 of unmarried parents live together ie are cohabiting and another 31 are romantically involved with each other further 74 of the participant mothers said that they expect to marry the babys father the data also indicated that 30 of fathers had earnings of less than 10500 per year and 62 of mothers had earnings of less than 10000 per year about 43 of the mothers and 38 of the fathers lacked high school degree although the data indicated that 85 of mothers and 98 of fathers worked at some point during the past year 20 of fathers said that they were out of work during the week before the interview the initial analysis also showed that 39 of the mothers drank alcohol used drugs or smoked during their pregnancies21 2007 report that examined data pertaining to the surveyed children at age 5 found that 16 of participant mothers were married to the father at the time of the fiveyear interview despite not marrying about 40 of the parents were still romantically involved at the fiveyear interview in cases where the couple were longer romantically involved 43 of the fathers had seen their children in the month previous to the interview according to the report 20 irwin garfinkel and sara mclanahan fragile families and child wellbeing survey of new parents focus university of

nineyear followup the purpose of this project is to combine the core telephone surveys inhome study and teacher surveys into one larger project data collection began in 2007 and will continue through 200923 office of child support enforcement ocse responsible fatherhood programs the federal office of child support enforcement ocse provided 20 million to fund responsible fatherhood demonstrations under section 1115 of the social security act the programs operated in eight states between september 1997 and december 2002 the following eight states received section 1115 grants or waivers from ocseadministration for children and families acf to implement and test responsible fatherhood programs california colorado maryland massachusetts missouri new hampshire washington and wisconsin these projects attempted to improve the employment and earnings of under and unemployed noncustodial parents and to motivate them to become more financially and emotionally involved in the lives of their children although the projects shared common goals they varied with respect to service components and service delivery ocse also provided about 500000 for an evaluation of the demonstration projects report on the implementation of the programs from initial startup in late 1997 through december 1999 noted the following the success of the responsible fatherhood demonstration projects appears to be tied to the commitment of the staff reaching alienated and disenfranchised populations and convincing them to change their attitudes and behaviors is hard work it takes time persistence repeated contacts fast action patience firmness and endless resourcefulness programs need to recruit key program staff who are inspired and inspiring they also need to be knowledgeable about community services in order to maximize opportunities for participants firsthand knowledge is key the best referrals are not made out of directories but result from longstanding familiarity with community services

can better counsel and steer parents into course of action that makes them more financially and emotionally responsible for their children24 second outcome report on the programs found that 1 lowincome noncustodial fathers are difficult population to recruit and serve 2 many of the participants found jobs with the programs help but they were lowpaying jobs and relatively few of the participants were able to increase earnings enough to meet their financial needs and those of their children 3 child access problems were hard to define and resolve and that mediation should be used more extensively 4 child support guidelines result in orders for lowincome noncustodial parents that are unrealistically high 5 cse agencies should collaborate with fatherhood programs and pursue routine enforcement activities as well as adopt policies and incentives that are responsive to lowincome fathers and 6 criminal history was the norm rather than the exception among the program participants many participants faced ongoing alcohol and substance abuse problems many did not have reliable transportation and many lacked courtordered visitation arrangement25 on more positive note the outcome report found that employment rates and earnings increased significantly especially for noncustodial parents who were previously unemployed in addition child support compliance rates increased significantly especially for those who had not been paying previously moreover the report found that 27 of the fathers reported seeing their children more often after completion of the program partners for fragile families demonstration hhs has an ongoing partnership with the privatesector initiative called partners for fragile families pff the partners for fragile families project is an initiative of the national center for strategic nonprofit planning and community leadership npcl nonprofit organization based in washington dc the pff was designed to help poor single fathers pull themselves out of poverty and build stronger links to their children and their childrens mothers the pff was established in 1996 to provide support for these fragile families which are defined as lowincome nevermarried parents and their children research indicated that although many of the fathers in these families are involved with their children during the early childhood years this involvement tends to diminish over time often with negative consequences for the children the pff initiative is aimed at helping fathers work 24 jessica pearson and nancy thoennes with david price and

families pff demonstration projects the purpose of the demonstration projects was to develop new ways for cse agencies and communitybased nonprofit and faithbased organizations to work together to help young noncustodial fathers age 16 to 25 who had not yet established paternity and who had little or involvement with the cse program obtain employment health and social services make child support payments to their children learn parenting skills and enable then to work with the mothers of their children to build stronger parenting partnerships the pff demonstration operated from 2000 to 2003 in 13 projects in 9 states26 the demonstration project sites were located in california colorado indiana maryland massachusetts minnesota new york pennsylvania and wisconsin27 according to hhs of the 97 million in federal funding budgeted for the projects 71 million was spent an additional 14 million was spent for an evaluation of the projects the underlying theory of the pff demonstration projects was that by targeting new fathers at point when they had little or previous involvement with the cse system and when they still had an opportunity to develop positive relationship with the mother of their children and the children themselves the projects could better assist these young parents to become strong financial and emotional resources for their children recent evaluation of the implementation of the pff projects included the following statement although the concept of pff was unique when it was developed in 1996 by the time the demonstration was fully implemented other responsible fatherhood programs had started in many communities nationwide independent of pff the child support enforcement system was already incorporating more father friendly approaches to service delivery at about the same time pff was in its developmental stages the child support system had begun to absorb the lessons learned from earlier fatherhood initiatives such as the parents fair share project and the responsible fatherhood demonstration by the time pff was operational some may have viewed it as less pioneering than when it was conceived several years earlier in addition the number of young fathers who had not established paternity for their children decreased in the mid to late 1990s as result of the success of inhospital paternity establishment initiatives across the country that established paternity at the time of childs birth the pool of young fathers without paternity established for their children had diminished in the pff sites by the time the projects were implemented28 the department of health and human services hhs has sponsored several other evaluations of the pff demonstration projects according to hhs subsequent 26 the chicago illinois project withdrew from the demonstration 27 see httpfatherhoodhhsgovindexshtml and httpwwwnpclorgprogrampffhtm 28 the urban institute the implementation of the partners for fragile families demonstration

their families and an analysis of economic and child support outcomes issues an underlying tension in the debate on fatherhood initiatives is the concern of some womens and mothers rights groups such as the national womens law center and the national organization for women now that an emphasis on the importance of fathers may lead to undervaluing singleparent families maintained by mothers that services for fathers may be at the expense of services for mothers and that the profatherhood discourse might give fathers rights groups some leverage in challenging child custody child support and visitation arrangements some analysts contend that the policy debate on fatherhood initiatives must be based on the view that the welfare of fathers mothers and children are intertwined and interdependent otherwise the debate will be very divisive and unproductive29 many issues are associated with the federal governments support of fatherhood initiatives few examples are is the goal of federal policy to promote and support the involvement of fathers in their childrens lives regardless of the fathers relationship with the childrens mother what if the father has children by more than one woman what is the federal policy with regard to incarcerated parents and parents recently released from prison does the federal government support counseling education and supervised visitation for abusive fathers so that they can reconnect with their children the discussion below examines two issues that will likely impact the success of congressional fatherhood initiatives the first deals with the role of the cse agency in fatherhood programs presently the cse program is the starting place for many fatherhood programs some analysts contend that since many noncustodial parents have negative view of the cse program the use of the cse program to recruit fathers does not bode well for the success of such programs several of the fatherhood bills would make competitive grants available to community organizations and other groups that have experience in working with lowincome men many of the fatherhood bills introduced in recent congresses included evaluation components the second issue examines father involvement in the context of the fathers relationship to the childs mother the second issue is based on the premise that formal marital relationships last longer and are more conducive to longterm interaction between fathers and children than other types of relationships 29 william j doherty edward f kouneski and martha farrell erickson responsible fathering an overview and conceptual framework final report washington us department of health and human services administration for children and families center for policy research and policy studies hhs100930012 september 1996 crs14 cse system and noncustodial parents often at odds during the period fy1978fy2006 child support payments collected by the cse agencies increased from 1 billion to 239 billion moreover the program has made significant improvements in other program measures as well such as the number of parents located paternities established and child support orders established advocates of the cse program say that this dramatic program performance is aside from the indirect and intangible benefits of the program such as increased personal responsibility and welfare costavoidance critics of the cse program contend that even with an unprecedented array of big brother enforcement tools such as license professional drivers recreational and passport revocation seizure of banking accounts retirement funds and lottery winnings and automatic income withholding from pay checks the program still collects only 19 of child support obligations for which it has responsibility and collects payments for only 54 of its caseload although the cse program has historically been the policy answer to the problem of father absence because its focus until recently was exclusively on financial support it has had the practical effect of alienating many lowincome fathers who are unable to meet their child support obligations some policy analysts maintain that fathers are in effect devalued when their role in their childrens lives is based solely on their cash contributions they argue that public policies are needed to support the fathers role as nurturer disciplinarian mentor and moral instructor30 information obtained from noncustodial fathers for various surveys and studies consistently tells the same story not surprisingly noncustodial parents especially lowincome fathers prefer informal child support agreements between themselves and the childs mother wherein they contribute cash support when they can and provide noncash aid such as taking care of the children from time to time and buying food clothing presents etc as often as they can many noncustodial fathers maintain that the cse system is dismissive of their financial condition and continues to pursue child support payments current as well as arrearages even when it knows that many of them can barely support themselves they argue that for welfare families the cse program generally does not improve their childs wellbeing because their child support payments are used to benefit the state and federal government ie welfare reimbursement rather than their child they contend that the cse program causes conflicts between them and their childs mother because the women often use it as leverage by threatening to report them to cse authorities take them back to court have more of their wages garnished or have them arrested31 30 wade f horn and isabel v sawhill making room for daddy fathers marriage and welfare reform brookings institution working paper washington april 26 2001 p 4 31 maureen waller and robert

family ties improving paternity establishment practices and procedures for lowincome mothers fathers and children washington national womens law center and center continued crs15 many observers maintain that noncustodial parents and the cse program have irreconcilable differences and that the most that should be expected is for the noncustodial parent to clearly understand the purposes of the cse program the requirements imposed on the custodial parent the noncustodial parents rights to have their child support payments modified if they incur financial change in circumstances and that they as noncustodial parents have moral and societal responsibility to have to build loving relationship with their children32 if the cse program continues to be the entrance to fatherhood programs most observers contend that the fact that the cse program has not been effective in gaining the cooperation and trust of many noncustodial parents must be acknowledged and addressed several analysts suggest that to be successful fatherhood programs may need to operate independently of the formal cse system others assert that more than any other agency of state government the cse program has the responsibility and is in the position to reach out to fathers who need supportive services they state that cse agencies are already involved in forging relationships with fathers through partnerships with communitybased organizations they also note that cse agencies provide natural link to coordinate with tanf agencies to help families achieve selfsufficiency33 although we do not have any evaluations on the effectiveness of fatherhood programs delivered through cse framework versus fatherhood programs that place little emphasis on the formal cse system all of the fatherhood bills introduced in the 107th and 108th congresses included funding for evaluation and so did many of the fatherhood bills in the 109th congress readers should note that pl 109171 does not include funding for the evaluation of responsible fatherhood grant programs noncustodial father involvement vs promotion of marriage vs maintenance of fragile families the first finding included in the 1996 welfare reform law is that marriage is the foundation of successful society the second finding is that marriage is an essential institution of successful society which promotes the interests of children34 however some child welfare advocates argue that marriage is not necessarily the best alternative for all women and their children it is generally agreed that single 31 continued on fathers families

on july 29 2000 httpwwwncseaorgfiles 2000_fatherhood_resolfinalpdf 34 the majority of pretanf evaluations of welfare initiatives that examine family formation decisions have found little if any impact of state policies on decisions to marry one recent exception is an evaluation of the minnesota family investment program mfip in this program compared to those who were subject to the afdc requirements more singleparent participants subject to new policies under mfip got married and fewer of the twoparent participants had divorced within three years after the program began crs16 parent families are better alternative for children than living with an abusive father many observers caution that government must be careful about supporting programs that provide cash incentives to induce people to marry or that coerce people into marrying they note the problems associated with childbride marriages and the shortterm and often unhappy nature of the socalled shotgun marriage others respond that many longlasting marriages were based on financial alliances eg to increase economic status family wealth status in the community etc they also point out that most government programs are sensitive to the issues of domestic violence and include supports to prevent or end such actions many young children live with both of their parents who are not married but who are cohabiting noting this some analysts argue that coercive policies designed to promote certain types of family structures eg nuclear families at the expense of others may undermine nontraditional family relationships they contend that more emphasis should be placed on trying to meet the needs of these fragile families to enable them to stay together for longer periods of time they maintain that if these parents wanted to be married they would be married35 they also point out that because of the complexity of many family relationships there are easy answers from their perspective singlefocus policy matter whether it aims to support traditional family relationships or fragile families can place children in less desirable situations for instance promoting marriage of biological parents may result in supporting situations where some children in the household have stepparent if all the children are not from the same union similarly promoting fragile families also could result in supporting situations where biological parent is absent if all of the children in the household are not all from the same union some promarriage analysts point out that about 75 of children born to cohabiting parents will see their parents separate before they reach age 16 compared to about 33 of those born to married parents some observers note that even with supports it is unlikely that fragile families unmarried couple will remain together as long as married families thus they argue that the promotion of marriage should be incorporated into fatherhood programs if the goal is lifetime involvement of fathers in the lives of their children in contrast fatherhood initiatives are sometimes viewed as incompatible with initiatives that encourage the formation and maintenance of twoparent families and with initiatives that promote marriage in fact many observers argue that the focus should be the participation of fathers in their childrens lives regardless of the marital status of the parents as mentioned earlier the tanf law states that the second purpose of the block grant is to end the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation work and marriage the fourth purpose of the tanf block grant is to encourage the formation and maintenance of twoparent families there has been some discussion about whether the fourth purpose means marriedcouple families or just two parents who are involved in their childrens lives regardless of whether they are married or even living together in late 1999 the clinton administration issued guide on funding for children and 35 see is marriage viable objective for fragile families fragile families research brief 9 princeton bendheimthoman center for research on child wellbeing july 2002 crs17 families through the tanf program which broadly interpreted twoparent families to mean not only marriedcouple families but also nevermarried separated and divorced parents whether living together or not thus many states classify their fatherhood programs and programs that encourage visitation by noncustodial parents under the rubric of fulfilling the purposes of the tanf program36 in addition it should be noted that some research indicates that there may be racial component in the marriage promotion versus fatherhood involvement debate in 2005 695 of black births were to unmarried women whereas only 254 of white births were to unmarried women given this demographic reality of black and white families in the us the authors of the study37 contend that proposals that earmark five times as much money for marriage promotion as for responsible fatherhood promotion38 seem racially insensitive readers should note that pl 109171 funds marriage promotion grants at twice the amount of responsible fatherhood grants ie 100 million per year for five years versus 50 million per year for five years legislative action during the 106th congress president clintons fy2001 budget included 255 million for the first year of proposed fathers workfamilies win initiative to help lowincome noncustodial parents and lowincome working families work and support their children the fathers workfamilies win initiative would have been administered by the department of labor dol the fathers work component 125 million would have been limited to noncustodial parents primarily fathers and the families win component 130 million would have been targeted more generally to lowincome families the proposed fathers work grant program was designed to help lowincome noncustodial parents who were not living with their children carry out their financial and emotional responsibilities to their children the proposed families win grant program was designed to help hardpressed working families obtain the supports and skills they need to get job and succeed in the job and avoid tanf assistance these funds were intended to leverage existing resources to help families retain jobs and upgrade skills and get
