prime ministers office in jerusalem their discussion covered netanyahus meeting with president obama the previous week netanyahus interest in resuming negotiations with the palestinians the iranian nuclear program and options for tougher sanctions possible negotiations with syria usisraeli cooperation on missile defense and israels objections to the goldstone report netanyahu said his meeting with the president was the best meeting that they have had he stressed that he had told the president that he is ready to negotiate with abu mazen now and contrasted israels position with the pas setting of preconditions for negotiations netanyahu listed steps the goi has taken to support abu mazen noting that the pa is doing good job on security nuclear iran however would wash away all progress as well as undermining israels peace agreements with egypt and jordan netanyahu said that iran is vulnerable to sanctions and urged the us to increase the pressure on iran with likeminded countries if russia and china will not support new sanctions in the security council netanyahu commented that there is broader arab and european support for tough sanctions than in the past although the arabs may not say so publicly netanyahu praised president obamas commitment to missile defense and commented that usisraeli cooperation on missile defense sends strong signal to israels enemies he thanked the codel for the congress support netanyahu said israel faces three main threats irans nuclear program the buildup of rockets and missiles in lebanon syria and gaza and the goldstone report which condemned israel for defending its civilian population from years of rocket attacks netanyahu said israel will need to ensure that future palestinian state cannot launch rockets at israels international airport or critical facilities end summary lets get on with negotiations 2 u codel skelton consisting of house armed services committee chairman ike skelton d mo and mrs skelton representative steve israel dny representative tim murphy r pa congressional staff members phil mcnaughton michael casey and john wason military aides colonel jeff koch and polcouns met with prime minister binyamin netanyahu november 16 netanyahu was joined by deputy national security adviser rear admiral reserve avriel bar josef media adviser mark regev policy adviser ari harrow and congressional liaison officer from the israeli embassy in washington 3 c netanyahu began the meeting by noting his appreciation for his meeting with president obama at the white house the previous week netanyahu described his conversation with the president as the best weve had so far he said that regarding negotiations with the palestinians he told the president lets get on with it netanyahu stated that his government had removed hundreds of obstacles and roadblocks in the west bank helping the west bank economy achieve seven percent growth rate adding and we can kick it up to ten percent growth netanyahu said his bar ilan address last june had been difficult for him but it had united israelis in support of accepting demilitarized palestinian state the current goi had also restrainted construction in settlements more than its past several predecessors 4 c netanyahu then contrasted his efforts with the pa which he said is maintaining political and economic boycott of israel setting preconditions for negotiations supporting the goldstone report in the and is now talking about unilateral declaration of independence israel wants to engage but the palestinians do not netanyahu quoted palestinian official as saying that the pa had exhausted the negotiating process then noted that the palestinians have not even started to talk to his government the real difference he pointed out is that abu mazen is facing elections while israel has already conducted its elections netanyahu also commented that the palestinians had initially expected the us to deliver israel on all of their demands but are now realizing that this will not happen president obama understands he stated that israel is ready to move forward the alternatives to negotiations are bad for everyone netanyahu said that if abu mazen would engage they would confront all the issues the process would not be easy but it has to get started 5 c netanyahu said the west bank had remained quiet during operation cast lead because the palestinians do not tel aviv 00002777 002 of 003 want to live under hamas rule he asserted that according to recent polls abu mazen and fatah would easily win an election even in gaza netanyahu stressed that he was not pushing for the palestinians to hold elections but was instead focused on promoting the expansion of the west bank economy by removing both physical and bureaucratic obstacles he acknowledged that the pa is doing good job on security though he added that pa leaders are not aware of everything israel is doing to support the pas security if we could add political process to the cooperation that currently exists we could get security economic development and peace netanyahu warned however that if iran gets nuclear bomb the peace process would be washed away even israels peace agreements with egypt and jordan would come under enormous pressure iran sanctions 6 c chairman skelton noted that his committee is following iran closely netanyahu said he had advised the president to stick to the deadline on the trr offer adding that it is also important to ask iran to stop its enrichment activities netanyahu commented that there is new mood in the major european capitals in support of sanctions the us does not need to depend on the security council but can work with likeminded countries sanctions should focus on irans importation of gasoline while also focusing on opening up the information networks the us should lead the world toward tougher sanctions or more of the arab states will start appeasing iran as qatar is doing netanyahu summed up his advice as stick to the deadline be firm on the terms and apply sanctions if iran does not comply he thought russia may be more inclined than in the past but it would be best not to count on the security council having set deadline the p5 1 should stick to it the western powers at least will go along we should close the gap between understanding the problem and acting on it he said netanyahu said israels problems with iran are not limited to its nuclear program even without nuclear umbrella iran is sending hundreds of tons of weapons to syria hamas and hizballah the ship seized november 3 by the israeli navy had on board two thirds of the amount of rockets fired at israel during the 2006 lebanon war 7 c representative israel asked netanyahu about the timetable for iran to achieve nuclear weapon netanyahu responded that iran has the capability now to make one bomb or they could wait and make several bombs in year or two it is important to bear in mind that the iranian regime was exposed as fraud during their presidential elections the iranian people detest the regime and have shown great courage in the streets the exposure of the qom facility also helped convince doubters in the international community that iran has weapons program iran has weak economy and fractured political system so it is vulnerable to sanctions the time to act diplomatically is now netanyahu said adding that we still have year or two to stop the iranian program netanyahu said he thought president obama understands iran perfectly the arab leaders hope iran will be stopped there is broad arab and european support for vigorous steps chairman skelton asked whether the arabs would state their support publicly netanyahu replied they might not but it would not make large difference since the arab street will not rise up in support of the iranian regime ready to talk to syria 8 c regarding syria netanyahu urged the us to press damascus to stop supplying arms to hizballah noting that he had stopped in paris to meet president sarkozy on his way back to israel from washington netanyahu confirmed media reports that sarkozy had offered to mediate between israel and syria netanyahu said he would prefer direct negotiations with the syrians but added that he would accept france as mediator president asad however still wants turkey as the mediator noting that turkish pm erdogan had recently stated that he would prefer to meet with sudanese president omar bashir than with netanyahu netanyahu asked how the turks could be fair mediators working together on missile defense 9 c netanyahu said that in addition to peace with the palestinians and iran he and the president had discussed joint usisraeli efforts on missile defense netanyahu tel aviv 00002777 003 of 003 commented that he had personally visited the juniper cobra joint military exercise the program has reached phase at which it is possible to monitor incoming missiles with good leadtime but it is still very expensive to intercept crude rockets such as those fired from gaza the information shield is moving ahead nicely but the physical shield is lagging behind netanyahu observed that it is very important for the us and its allies to be able to defend themselves against missile attack chairman skelton noted that us personnel who briefed the codel were very optimistic about the program netanyahu said only the us and israel are currently working on missile defense this cooperation sends powerful message to israels enemies he noted and thanked the codel and the congress for their support goldstone report key threat 10 c netanyahu commented that israel currently faces three principal threats irans nuclear program missile proliferation and the goldstone report goldstone gave terrorists immunity to attack israel if they fire from populated areas during cast lead the idf send thousands and flyers text messages and phone calls to civilians warning them to get out of the way yet israel was accused of war crimes hamas and other terrorists fired 12000 rockets into israel from gaza netanyahu said noting that israel is the only country in the world faced with threats to annihilate it netanyahu asked the codel to imagine situation in which israeli air force pilots must consult with lawyers before they can travel abroad former pm olmert former fonmin livni and defmin barak could be hauled before the international criminal court netanyahu said he could not accept that idf soldiers could be charged with war crimes for protecting their country from constant attack the deaths of several hundred civilians in gaza was tragic netanyahu said but there was deliberate targeting of civilians by israel deliberate targeting of civilians is war crime but what should israel do when terrorists deliberately target israeli civilians and then hide within their civilian population 11 u codel skelton did not clear this cable cunningham
