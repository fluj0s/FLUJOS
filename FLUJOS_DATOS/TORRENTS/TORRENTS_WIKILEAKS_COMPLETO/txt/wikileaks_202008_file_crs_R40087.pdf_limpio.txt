welltrained militants came ashore from the arabian sea on small boats and attacked numerous highprofile targets in mumbai india with automatic weapons and explosives by the time the episode ended some 62 hours later about 165 people along with nine terrorists had been killed and hundreds more injured among the multiple sites attacked in the peninsular city known as indias business and entertainment capital were two luxury hotelsthe taj mahal palace and the oberoitridentalong with the main railway terminal jewish cultural center café frequented by foreigners cinema house and two hospitals six american citizens were among the 26 foreigners reported dead indian officials have concluded that the attackers numbered only ten one of whom was captured the investigation into the attacks is still in preliminary stages but press reporting and statements from us and indian authorities strongly suggest that the attackers came to india from neighboring pakistan and that the perpetrators likely were members and acting under the orchestration of the pakistanbased lashkaretaiba let terrorist group the let is believed to have past links with pakistans military and intelligence services by some accounts these links are ongoing leading to suspicions but know n evidence of involvement in the attack by pakistani state elements the islamabad government has strongly condemned the mumbai terrorism and offered new delhi its full cooperation with the ongoing investigation but mutual acrimony clouds such an effort and the attacks have brought into question the viability of nearly fiveyearold bilateral peace process between india and pakistan three warsin 194748 1965 and 1971and constant state of military preparedness on both sides of the border have marked six decades of bitter rivalry between india and pakistan such bilateral discord between two nucleararmed countries thus has major implications for regional security and for us interests the administration of presidentelect barack obama may seek to increase us diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving conflict between these two countries the mumbai attacks have brought even more intense international attention to the increasingly deadly and destabilizing incidence of islamist extremism in south asia and they may affect the course of us policy toward pakistan especially the episode also has major domestic implications for india in both the political and security realms indian counterterrorism capabilities have come under intense scrutiny and the united states may further expand bilateral cooperation with and assistance to india in this realm for broader discussion see crs report rl33529 indiaus relations and crs report rl33498 pakistanus relations this report will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40087

dayslong november terrorist attack on indias most populous city mumbai has deeply affected the indian people and their government because the attackers appear to have come from and received training and equipment in neighboring pakistan the episode has led to renewed tensions between two nucleararmed south asian states with history of war and mutual animosity seemingly incompatible national identities contributed both to several wars and to the nuclearization of the asian subcontinent with the nuclear weapons capabilities of both countries becoming overt in 1998 in 2004 new delhi and islamabad launched their most recent comprehensive effort to reduce tensions and resolve outstanding disputes an effort that has to date resulted in modest but still meaningful successes new delhi acknowledges that stable pakistan is in indias interests at the same time however indian leaders are convinced that pakistan has long been and remains the main source indias significant domestic terrorism problems they continue to blame islamabad for maintaining an infrastructure of terror that launches attacks inside india central aspect of us policy in south asia is prevention of interstate conflict that could destabilize the region and lead to nuclear war since 2001 the united states has also been directly engaged in efforts foster stability in afghanistan many analysts view this goal as being intimately linked with the indiapakistan peace process the administration of president george w bush made pakistan key ally in the global war on terrorism while simultaneously deepening

security agencies will honor the promises of cooperation being made by islamabads civilian leaders17 the let has been implicated in past multipletarget attacks involving coordinated movements by wellarmed gunmen who took hostages the level of sophistication and training required to undertake the recent mumbai attacks spurred many indian and american analysts to name the let as likely suspect 18 such suspicions appeared validated when indian government officials announced that the sole attacker captured alive had confessed to being pakistani national trained in let camps the 21yearold

major attacks on indian muslim communities at ayodhya uttar pradesh in 1992 and at godhra gujarat in 200230 some observers see evidence that the attackers were inspired if not directed by qaedas brand of global jihadi ideology31 white house spokeswoman said the attack on jewish center adds another layer of complexity to the episode32 secretary rice has speculated that the goal of the attackers was probably to stir up trouble between pakistan and india33 early reporting suggested that westerners especially americans and britons were being singled out by the attackers but subsequent eyewitness accounts did not appear to support the conclusion34 former bush state department official and south asia specialist views the mumbai attacks as an escalation of what he calls the war for pakistan an ongoing and essentially civillevel battle to determine whether pakistan will be moderate or an extremist state35 at least one former senior us counterterrorism official sees the attacks as part of goaloriented effort to advance an overall strategy to in proximate terms defeat the us military and restore taliban rule in afghanistan this strategy is assumed to be shared by qaeda and the taliban in both afghanistan and pakistan as well as by the let36 another expert agrees that let goals transcend the kashmiri separatism that has been its primary motivation and they are aimed at crippling the

dialogue process has to date resulted in modest but still meaningful successes new delhi acknowledges that stable pakistan is in indias interests at the same time however many top indian leaders are convinced that pakistan has long been and remains the main source of indias significant domestic terrorism problems they continue to blame islamabad for maintaining an infrastructure of terror and for actively supporting terrorist groups that are held responsible for attacks inside india 41 the latter half of 2008 saw deterioration of indiapakistan relations especially after us indian and afghan

agencies which historically have acted independent of civilian oversight43 in december 2001 the united states designated the lashkaretaiba as foreign terrorist organization shortly after it was publically implicated by new delhi for gun and grenade attack on the indian parliament complex that killed nine people this assault triggered full indian military mobilization along the indiapakistan frontier an ensuing tenmonthlong standoff in 2002 involved one million indian and pakistani soldiers and was viewed as the closest the two countries had come to fullscale war since 1971 causing the us government to become deeply concerned that conventional war could escalate into nuclear confrontation 44 further lethal attacks on indian civilians spurred indian leaders to call for decisive war but

unemotional approach toward pakistan with the recognition that islamabad too faces serious terrorist threat and that public pressure for decisive action may only exacerbate the situation from this perspective the mumbai attacks could even serve as catalyst for genuine progress in efforts to end the pakistani militarys alleged patronage of islamist extremist groups67 however skeptical indian analysts insist that the pakistani actions to date have been tactical moves aimed at creating breathing space for islamabad they remain convinced that the pakistani military has yet to relinquish its the use of islamist militant groups as instruments of state policy 68 others conclude that the interests of the pakistani military pakistans conservative political parties and islamist extremists converge in ways that marginalize islamabads current civilian leaders forcing the ruling political coalition there to take dolittle if not donothing stance69 dubious experts have long asserted that

intensifying pressure on the us government to facilitate regional conflict resolution one result could be growing and increasingly sophisticated insurgency in afghanistan and western pakistan 98 any highvisibility us government focus on the kashmir issue specifically would likely evoke indian resistance it also would risk fueling pakistani expectations of future settlement favoring pakistan thus in turn providing motive for islamabad to sustain pressure by ramping up support for kashmiri separatists some analysts point to this potent ial risk in encouraging presidentelect obama to appoint special envoy who would deal with south asia regional issues more broadly 99 one unnamed senior pakistani security official reportedly said pakistan would respond to any indian military mobilization by withdrawing all troops from its border with afghanistan and redeploying them along the frontier with india as was done during the 2002 crisis some view such messages from islamabad as form of extortion and to argue that pakistani leaders use such leverage to elicit us pressure on new delhi and to continue what may be an ongoing low intensity proxy war against india 100 some analysts

been pursuing strategic partnership based on shared values such as democracy pluralism and rule of law one facet of the emerging partnership is greatly increased counterterrorism cooperation the us state departments country reports on terrorism 2007 identified india as being among the worlds most terror afflicted countries and counted more than 2300 indian deaths due to terrorism in 2007 alone 103 this number is set to be equaled or exceeded in 2008 in late 2001 president bush and then indian prime minster atal vajpayee agreed that terrorism threatens not only the security of the united states and india but also our efforts to build freedom democracy and international security and stability around the world 104 2006 session of the usindia joint working group on counterterrorism ended with statement of determination from both countries to further advance bilateral cooperation and information sharing on such areas of common concern as bioterrorism aviation security advances in biometrics cybersecurity and terrorism wmd terrorism and terrorist financing105 the working group has met total of nine times since its 2000 creation most recently in august 2008 joint chiefs chairman adm mullen was in new delhi in early december to meet with senior indian leaders where he reiterated the us militarys commitment to work closely with indian armed forces on counterterrorism 106 the mumbai incident elicited more vocal calls for deepening usindia counterterrorism cooperation that could benefit both countries such cooperation has been hampered by sometimes divergent geopolitical perceptions and by us reluctance to embarrass its pakistani allies by conveying alleged evidence of official pakistani links to terrorists especially those waging separatist war in kashmir mutual distrust between washington and new delhi also has been exacerbated by some recent clandestine us efforts to penetrate indian intelligence agencies despite lingering problems the scale of the threat posed by islamist militants spurs observers to encourage more robust bilateral intelligence sharing and other official exchanges including on maritime and cyber security among many more potential issueareas 107 us law enforcement agencies possess specialized equipment that can trace voiceoverinternet calls along with other expertise for examining the global position and satellite phone systems

militant groups lauding them as important and great steps still some reporting suggests that us officials are thus far unsatisfied with the antiterrorism measures taken by islamabad government109 secretary rice also bucked widelyheld perceptions when she claimed to have heard nothing in pakistan suggesting any divisions between the army and the civilian government while pakistani officials are likely to have tailored their message to rice to foster us confidence it is not clear if those officials can deliver on their promises and some observers saw rices emergency diplomacy achieving nothing concrete 110 in seeming response to president zardaris repeated reference to the nonstate status of the let and other pakistanbased militant groups secretary rice told the pakistani leader that islamabad has responsibility to deal with those who used pakistani territory even if they are nonstate actors rice added that she continues to believe pakistan is very committed to this war on terror following december visit to islamabad foreign relations committee chairman designate senator john kerry reported feeling confident that pakistani authorities recognize the need for serious and harsh crackdown on religious extremist groups 111 in seeking to revamp us south asia policy presidentelect obama and his advisors may face key central question are conflictual relations between the regions two largest states primarily an indiapakistan problem or are they mainly pakistan problem alone 112 among the options available to presidentelect obama when he takes office would be designating pakistan as state sponsor of terrorism under us law drastic measure with regard to major nonnato ally that would have major implications but one that is favored by some observers especially in india113 many independent analysts strongly urge the us government to energetically support pakistani leaders and work diplomatically to bolster international support for them if they choose the dangerous path of standing firmly against extremism114 many hardline indian analysts long convinced that the us government coddles the pakistani security establishment with major and largely unconditioned aid assert that meaningful improvement will not come so long as washington implicitly condones islamabads alleged doublegame by propping up the pakistani military even former
