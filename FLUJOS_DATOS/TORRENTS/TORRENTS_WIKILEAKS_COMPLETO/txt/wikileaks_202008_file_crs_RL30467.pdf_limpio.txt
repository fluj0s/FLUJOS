major programs to help russia and the asian countries counter their economic crises and to promote basic economic reform during this period the world bank lent russia some 118 billion it also lent to korea thailand and indonesia to help them respond to the asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998 the imf lent 3745 billion sdr 275 billion to the same three asian countries meanwhile the imf lent 182 billion sdr 132 billion to russia of which 77 billion sdr 58 billion had been disbursed by the time the imf loan program was cancelled the bank and fund generated wealth of material analyzing and explaining their efforts they claim that their programs in asia and russia were quite successful overall they acknowledge that they encountered unprecedented challenges and they had to learn and adapt their programs in response to changing conditions they admit that the results sometimes fell short of their original expectations nevertheless the bank and fund reject any suggestion that the depth and severity of the asian and russian crises were caused by terms and conditions of their programs any shortcomings are attributable they say to the fact that governments sometimes failed to fulfill their agreements or took steps which made the crises in their countries more intense and difficult than would have otherwise been the case many analysts have been critical of the way the international agencies dealt with the russian and asian crises this report focuses on the views of joseph stiglitz jeffrey sachs and to lesser extent nicholas stern and bruno pinto they argue that the imf put too little emphasis on programs to reform the basic economic institutions and the economic framework in its borrower countries they claim the international financial institutions ifis have made conditions worse in many of the countries they have sought to help often they argue the ifis original perceptions and predictions are wrong when they first address an economic crisis and they prescribe the wrong economic medicine they maintain that the ifis should be more accountable for their mistakes ifi spokesmen respond that most of the comments by the critics are unfunded or based on only partial understanding of the russian and asian contexts the bank and fund maintain that they have incorporated many of the lessons they learned in russia and asian into their current programs in these and other countries on march 8 2000 by the international financial institutions advisory commission released its report discussing future policy towards the imf and the multilateral banks the present crs

jonathan sanford specialist in international political economyimf and world bank activities in russia and asia some conflicting perspectives introduction1 there has been considerable discussion in the past few years about possible changes in the architecture of the international financial system in this context the term architecture refers to the policies and programs of the international financial institutions ifis the relative division of labor among them the prevailing norms for exchange rate systems and country economic policies and the way the ifis relate to the private sector many analysts believe that the ways the world bank and international monetary fund imf responded to the recent economic crises in russia and asia cast considerable light on these issues some argue that the bank and funds programs in russia and asia were deeply flawed they find evidence justifying major changes in the international agencies future operations and policies others insist that the bank and fund performed creditably in russia and asia they maintain that the record demonstrates the efficacy of the agencies work they also say the record illustrates the problems that international agencies often face when they deal with governments that are reluctant to implement needed reforms this report discusses the roles the international monetary fund and the world bank have played during the recent economic and financial crises in russia and east asia it does not purport to be comprehensive discussion of the issues rather it provides the reader with some conflicting views regarding the efficacy and success of ifi programs in these regions first based solely on ifi documents it presents the bank and funds description and assessment of their programs in russia and their responses to the asia financial crisis second it presents some critiques of the ifis by several prominent analysts joseph stiglitz was until recently chief economist at the world bank former chairman of president clintons council of economic advisors and professor of economics at stanford university jeffrey sachs is professor of economics and director of the institute for international development at harvard university nicholas stern is the new chief economist at the world bank brian pinto is senior economist at the same international agency the selection of critics was influenced by congressional inquiries the individuals included in this report have not only criticized the performance of the ifis but also suggested remedial actions to improve their performance number of crs studies already address the russian and asian crises and the operations or functions of the international financial institutions ifis the present report is supplement to those reports list of relevant crs products and chronological list of articles by the ifis and these critics is provided at the end of this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30467crs2 the first section of this report summarize the world bank and imfs own assessments of their activities including description of their programs and post hoc evaluations regarding what worked and what did not between 1997 and 1999 the international agencies funded major programs to help russia and the asian countries counter their economic crises and to promote basic economic reform they also generated wealth of material analyzing and explaining their efforts the bank and fund claim that overall their programs in asia and russia were quite successful they acknowledge that they encountered unprecedented challenges and they had to learn and adapt their programs in response to changing conditions they admit that the results sometimes fell short of their original expectations nevertheless they reject any suggestion that the depth and severity of the asian and russian crises were caused by terms and conditions of their programs any shortcomings are attributable they say to the fact that governments sometimes failed to fulfill their agreements or took steps which made the crises in their countries more intense and difficult than otherwise would have been the case stiglitz and sachs have been sharply critical of the way the international agencies dealt with the russian and asian crises stiglitz argues that the imfs programs in russia and asia were based on obsolete economic concepts they put too much emphasis he says on the old washington consensus package of policy measures adopted in 1991 for russia and followed by russian reformers this emphasized the need for strong macroeconomic measures and policies aimed at promoting liberalization exchange rate stabilization and privatization the imf should have put more emphasis he argues on programs that seek to change the way that enterprises and economic institutions operate this approach has come to be called the postwashington consensus it underscores the need for change in the basic institutional infrastructure in particular it says that countries need to adopt marketoriented reforms in their banking budgeting and administrative systems the goal should be the development of an incentive system based on profitseeking and competition to replace the old norms that hampered growth and innovation unless there is fundamental change in the incentive system the postwashington consensus insists the reform programs embodied in the earlier consensus liberalization stabilization privatization will be ineffective or perhaps even counterproductive sachs maintains that the imf failed to take adequate steps to promote successful reform in russia specifically he says it failed to prevent crony privatization corruption capital flight and poor donor oversight and it failed to promote growth in the russian economy however sachs did not call for change in the washington consensus nor did he agree that he may have been mistaken in his support for the so called shock therapy policy earlier in the decade shock therapy involves the adoption of macroeconomic policies that seek to achieve rapid stabilization and adjustment of countrys economy in asia sachs argues the imf made the situation worse in the countries it sought to assist he says it made the economic crisis in these countries more severe and most of its predictions and initial remedies were wrong he maintains that the imf has not been held accountable for its poor performance in asia also sachs affirms the imfs programs in asia were influenced too much by the preference ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30467crs3 2 joseph stiglitz more instruments and broader goals moving toward the

union some strategic lessons from the experience of 25 countries over six years ebrd working paper 18 april 1997the united states and other major countries developing countries have too little influence he maintain s over the shape of imf policy even though they comprise much of the worlds population and substantial majority of the imf membership it is difficult to discern from the bank and funds analyses of the russian and asian crises and their descriptions of their activities in response to those crises what the two agencies may have learned from their experiences the bank and fund both say their institutions were not at fault and that greater attention should be placed in the future on structural concerns and the strength and stability of national economic institutions however their reviews are quite different when they seek to answer the questions what did we learn what needs to be changed the international monetary fund appears to accept the necessity of developing an institutional infrastructure the current imf russian program has section of structural change jointly crafted with the world bank moreover the imf delayed the allocation of the current funding to russia on grounds that russia was not making the required structural changes the imf has not acknowledged however that this was change of policy nor did they accept responsibility for any past policy mistakes that may have led to poor russian performance the world bank chief economists joseph stiglitz and his successor nicholas stern2 have both been articulate proponents of the postwashington consensus stressing changes in the institutional infrastructure stiglitz continues criticize imf policy from his position at the world bank and to articulate the more detailed structural changes he believes are necessary for effective reform his world bank colleague brian pinto has been more specific about the detailed changes needed in the nonpayment system impeding sustained growth in russia it is uncertain how the two agencies envision their future interrelationship during the asian crisis the imf took the lead in negotiating strategies with the borrower countries structural reform was the centerpiece of these strategies yet the world bank and the asian developmen t bank were responsible for the design and implementation of the projects which sought to effect those structural reforms the ifis have not indicated whether they believe the imf should continue to play the predominant role in future crises with the multilateral development banks serving mainly to implement parts of the imfapproved plan an alternative case might be made in the light of recent experience that the mdbs might play larger role perhaps even leading role in the formulation of plans to deal with future crises in developing countries it is worth mentioning that most of the critiques of ifi activity in russia and asia have focused on the imf the multilateral development banks have come in for relatively little criticism and prescriptions for policy change many of the comments about the imf are criticism of the performance of the recipient countries on thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30467crs4

wwwworldbankorg for the appropriate menu select regions and countries and then russian federation these include russian federation country assistance strategy public information notice cpin december 22 1999 russian federation country assistance strategy casprogress report december 1999 ifc operations and the banks country brief titled russian federation august 1999assumption that the imf could have promoted better performance if it had managed its operations differently it is interesting to note that some of the sharpest criticisms of imf performance have come from analysts based in sister international agencies this is unusual their principal concerns relate to the developm ent of institutional infrastructure they believe the imf should have been more attentive to this aspect of its programs in russia and asia nevertheless institutional development seems to be more developmental than monetary issue as such it would seem to fall within the purview of the multilateral development banks the mdbs could have moved earlier before the russian and asian crises to address questions of institutional development this would seem natural issue for them to bring to the table when they meet to coordinate plans and programs with the imf the imfs evident preference for macroeconomic programs focusing on liberalization stabilization and privatization would seem consistent with its organizational focus if institutional issues are not being sufficiently addressed in imf programs then perhaps more attention ought to be paid to the mechanisms through which the imf and the multilateral banks coordinate their operation s perhaps the leading role that the imf traditionally plays in framing country programs does not leave sufficient room for other agencies to press consideration of developmental issues such as institutional reform alternatively the ifis may have been too attuned to the formulation and implementation of their own programs in this regard further improvements might be needed in the ways they coordinate their policy goals and operational plans in individual countries the crises from the perspective of the ifis3 the world bank in russia through calendar year 1999 the world bank approved 44 projects for russia totaling 1182 billion in addition it is implementing three projects for 83 million approved by the global environmental fund gef all of the world banks projects in russia are being financed through its nearmarket rate loan facility the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd the world bank remarks4 that russia has been difficult place to do development lending economic and political instability and an uncertain policy environment complicate the banks efforts to identify good projects and to implement them effectively the bank says it has been seeking to build longterm relationshiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30467crs5 5 policybased loans are loans that require the borrower to effect specified changes in economic policy or operational procedures before the proceeds of the loan may be disbursedwith russia this suggests that the bank believes it may need to overlook aspects of the current situation that might otherwise give it pause in other countries the banks strategy in russia has several main emphases encourage reductions in the institutional barriers to growth particularly in areas such as governance institutional reform improved effectiveness of public institutions and better public sector resource management reduce poverty and limit the suffering associated with the current process of transition by encouraging economic growth and strengthening the social safety net maintain or improve the effectiveness of the banks existing portfolio of projects the bank says the environment in russia has been uncertain regarding the future prospects of bankfunded projects and the realization of the banks country strategy the economic fundamentals remain unstable corruption and ineffective public institutions hinder implementation and political instability and changes in leadership have made it difficult for the bank to pursue its longterm strategy in particular the bank reports the dumas rejection of fiscal and institutional changes raises questions about the governments ability to achieve the goals of its reform program in the interim the bank says it should pursue more limited agenda which does not appear to require major allocations of resources this agenda includes continuing efforts to provide advice on policy reform public resource management and technical assistance to help strengthen the financial sector emphasizing programs that address social issues and respond to the countrys emergency needs implementing the existing portfolio of bankfunded projects in order to assure their effectiveness in the face of current difficulties reviewing the policybased loan programs5 for russia that the bank has already approved with the possible suspension of future disbursements if russian compliance with the agreed terms of the loans does not improve the world bank has substantially reduced its levels of lending to russia in calendar year 1997 it lent russia 3444 million in calendar 1998 it lent an additional 1900 million in calendar 1999 by contrast the bank approved two technical reform projects totaling 60 million most of the banks loans to russia in recent years 3700 million of the total approved in 1997 and 1998 for instance have been policybased loans substantial portion of the funds associated with these loans has not been disbursed as yet because of compliance problemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30467crs6 6 imfs camdessus reviews status of russian programs imf news brief 9981 december 7 1999 copy obtained from the imf web site wwwimforg 7

agreed to loan russia sdr 132 billion 182 billion of this amount sdr 74 billion 1046 billion had not yet been disbursed when the imf cancelled its russian loan program in 1998 the imf says that the goals of its program in russia have been achieved or exceeded any failures or shortcomings in its program were not the fault of the imf the funds spokesmen argue but were caused by insufficient or inadequate russian compliance with the terms of its imfapproved economic reform program michel camdessus the managing director of the imf reported to the imf executive board in december 19996 that important progress had been made in russia in the implementation of its macroeconomic program program expectations had been exceeded he said regarding economic growth the containment of inflation the fiscal balance and international reserves he said there had also been some progress realized on the structural side he noted that number of the structural benchmarks set for the end of september 1999 had not yet been met but he implied that he believed these would be met in the near future in newspaper commentary7 published in september 1999 camdessus explained the imfs relationship with russia he said that engagement is better than isolation when it comes to major countries experiencing serious economic difficulties he said there is reason to hope that economic reform will succeed in russia and other countries making the transition from communism however he also said the transition from the black hole of the soviet command economy will take years and progress will not be linear and any achievements will fade into impossibilities if we walk away from russia the loss of confidence and inward turning that would come from our abandonment of the russian people he said are in the interests neither of russia or the rest of the world the previous month john odlingsmee director of the office responsible for imf operations in russia wrote an article8 explaining the funds decision to resume lending to russia in july 1999 russia has made major progress since 1992 he said moving from centrally planned to marketoriented economy it has been reform effort whose scale and ambition have few parallels and whose outcome is of vital importance to the people of russia and the rest of the world the funds resumption in lending is justified he maintains important progress has been made

coordination by countries of their financial regulation and exchange rate policies improvements in countries regulatory environment and reporting procedures limits on foreign borrowing by banks and nonbank entities and reductions in the financial safety net so that more of the risk from private international financial transactions is borne by the parties involved disappointments the imf understands the complexity of the transition process he argues where the economic and political dimensions are intertwined most observers have made the same errors that the imf is being accused by its critics of having made if the economic programs the imf has supported in recent years had been fully implemented odlingsmee says the russian economy would look very different today maintenance of continual dialogue between the russian government and the imf is crucial and the prospects for economic reform are greatest in those areas where departure from agreedupon policies can halt imf lending in the future he says the imf membership will require greater implementation of programs before funds are disbursed looking at specific issues odlingsmee found there is evidence to support the charge that imf funds had been stolen or diverted to improper uses other imf officials have noted however that the russian authorities lied to them about the fimaco case capital flight is major problem in russia odlingsmee acknowledged but he said it is not caused by imf policies rather it is caused by the lack of implementa tion by the russian government of the programs the imf loans sought to support the imf and the asian crisis the fund says that the asian financial crisis of 19979 was unusual it said in 1998 report9 that the crisis was structural in origin unlike most countries that come to the imf suffering from balance of payments and currency crises the asian countries had had relatively strong macroeconomic fundamentals beforehand and except for thailand real balance of payments problems the crisis was proceeded by surge of capital inflows which the asian countries handled poorly their banking and finance systems were fragile weakened by imprudent practices and inadequate regulatory systems and the imf reported foreign lenders often provided money without due regard for the structural weaknesses of the countries financial systems the combination of weak banking system and an open capital account in these countries was the imf concluded an accident waiting to happen in august 1997 the imf agreed to lend thailand sdr 29 billion 39 billion the following december it agreed to lend sdr 155 billion 209 billion to korea the imf had more difficulty with its program for indonesia in november 1997 the imf approved loan of sdr 7338 billion 99 billion of this amount sdr 47 billion 657 billion had been drawn by august 1998 the imf then cancelled the original loan to indonesia and replaced it with an sdr 54 billion 76 billion loan from its extended fund facility which is repayable

fund 1999 80p both are available from the imf web sitein 1999 the imf released an assessment10 of its response to the asian crisis the report says that the immediate problem in asia was liquidity crisis which led to rapid decline in currency values the larger problem however was the weakness of their financial institutions and negligent regulatory environments that exacerbated the problem large financing packages were also arranged to restore market confidence tight monetary and interest rate policies were prescribed to staunch the outflow of capital and stabilize currency values budget cuts were prescribed to help support the external adjustment process and to allow room in national budgets for noninflationary expenditures aimed at restructuring the banking system however the study reports the centerpiece of the imf strategy in asia was broad longterm program of fundamental reform of the countries economic and policy institutions these sought to address the root causes of the crisis improve market confidence and set the stage for resumption of growth when the asian programs were being formulated the study reports the underlying causes of the economic crisis were less evident than they are now with the benefit of hindsight the imfs initial programs in thailand korea and indonesia did not succeed in restoring confidence or lessening the outflow of capital the report finds that the task was complicated by the limited state of the countries reserves by market volatility and by the array of structural problems it was also hampered by hesitant program implementation political uncertainties and other factors that cast doubt on the authorities commitment to the program other complications included revelations of marketsensitive information uncertainty about the financial packages and the difficulty making needed arrangements for government guarantees the imf believed initially that the asian crisis would have only modest impact on the countries rate of growth the interest and credit policies of the imf programs sought to prevent destructive inflationdepreciation spiral from occurring rather than seeking to stabilize exchange rates at any particular level the imf study says that monetary policy in korea and thailand tightened as planned and by the following summer interest rates had returned to their prior levels and half the depreciation in exchange rates had been reversed this is not to deny of course the study observes that monetary tightening had cost for the real economy but the alternative would have been more costly in indonesia by contrast monetary policy was not tightened as planned and the recovery stumbled the imf study reports that the indonesian authorities lost control of money and credit the banking system collapsed the money supply expanded and the underlying real interest rates remained negative while nominal interest and exchange rates bore major market risk premiums fiscal policy in the three countries was also based on an assumption that the slowdown in growth would be modest the imf analysts say that if the fiscal policies prescribed in the original programs had been implemented as plannedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30467crs9 11 stanley fischer on the need for an international lender of last resort paper prepared for delivery to joint session of the american economic association and american finance association new york january 3 1999 available from the imf web siteeconomic growth in the three countries would have declined quite substantially however they report fiscal policy in the countries relaxed in 1998 as the recession deepened and current account surpluses emerged governments made room in their budgets even to the point of deficit financing in order to assure funding for social safetynet programs and to accommodate spending for programs the automatic stabilizers designed to stimulate spending and slow the contraction of the economy unfortunately the study indicates korea and indonesia were unable to increase their spending rapidly enough to have the desired stimulative effect the study indicates that the fund failed to anticipate the severity of the downturn in the borrower countries the steps taken by the imfapproved programs were both too severe and also insufficient to meet the requirements of the crisis this hurt the credibility of the programs and limited their effectiveness still at the time the analysts report few people foresaw the severity of the economic downturn in the asian countries in hindsight they say it is clear that the imf should have supported fiscal policies that were less restrictive and monetary policies that sought to accommodate faster growth it was not so clear at the time however the analysts report that these would be the appropriate measures the imf study says that the programs it supported in asia did not have enough funding to be successful in an environment where the crucial effort to restore confidence had failed the decision to float the countries exchange rates led to period of continuous market depreciation however imf analysts maintain there was practical alternative especially in korea and thailand after the governments efforts to defend specific exchange rates had exhausted their reserves the imf analysts believe the asian countries might have avoided any need for floating their currencies if their foreign exchange reserves had been larger and they had enjoyed more market confidence still they report the asian countries would have had to adopt interest rates that were punishingly tight if they wanted to keep the value of their currencies at specified rates furthermore there was guarantee that this strategy would have enabled them to weather the pressure for devaluation as it was the analysts conclude in their 1999 report the reluctan ce of the governments to tighten monetary policy in the early stages of the crisis made the later task of stabilizing the value of their national currencies much more difficult stanley fischer deputy managing director of the imf argues11 that in recent years the imf has been playing increasingly the role of lender of last resort it has also been the crisis leader negotiating with the countries in crisis and mobilizing international support for financing packages backed by many countries and multilateral agencies the international financial system needs fundamental reform he says many factors may shape countrys choice of exchange rate regimes both countries with flexible and countries with fixed rate systems have run into trouble nevertheless he observes it is striking that the major external crises of the last two years in thailand korea indonesia and russia have affected countries with more or less

responsible for asian programs summarized on one page the nature of the asian crisis and the imfs response to it12 the crisis was caused he said by excessive investment financed by excessive short term borrowing economic overheating delays in policy adjustment and other structural factors such as prolonged dollar peg it was characterized by sudden loss of confidence in exchange markets and the banking system unprecedently large pressures on markets and rapid and excessive contagion to other countries in response he said the imf mobilized unprecedently large financing packages and processed them within 2to3 week period it also supported major stabilization and reform programs that required countries to adopt sound macroeconomic policies to restructure the financial sector to improve corporate governance and to adopt other reform measures the world bank and the asian crisis the world bank and imf have worked closely in response to the challenges posed by the asian financial crisis sven sandström managing director of the world bank told conference in 199813 though they have tackled the problem in different ways the bank has focused on structural and sectoral issues he said while the fund has focused on macroeconomic aggregates the bank has focused on longterm issues though he said the shortterm clearly matters finally he said the bank has focused on broad array of developmental issues facing the asian countries not just on economic and financial issues the asian crisis threatened to undercut the remarkable record of economic growth that asia had achieved in recent decades and to throw back into poverty huge numbers of people who had recently escaped that condition the banks core mandate is poverty reduction sandström argued therefore it needed to be actively involved in the international effort to restore confidence and growth in order to prevent serious resurgence of poverty in the region the world bank says the asian crisis brought to the fore some of the structural and institutional challenges posed by globalization it also revealed unexpected weaknesses in the financial and corporate sectors in the asian countries that required correction

planned for 200018 the world bank also approved 300 million loan for thailand in 1999 to help fund emergency employment programs and assure the continued availability and expansion of essential social service programs in indonesia during 1998 because of uncertainties about the political situation and the governments degree of commitment to fundamental reform the world bank focused most of its lending on the types of development projects it had sponsored in the past in fiscal 1998 it approved loans totaling 496 million for regional development projects and regional roads and 146 million for education or social projects december 1997 loan of 20 million was the only loan that year that was clearly directly towards the broader issue of reform the bank focused additional resources that year however on social concerns roughly 300 million in previously approved funds were reprogrammed for immediate disbursement on social safetynet activities particularly laborintensive employment programs and health and education services benefitting the poor in fiscal 1999 the bank found that the indonesian governments attitude towards reform was more encouraging in july 1998 it approved structural adjustment loan which promised to disburse 1 billion in balanceofpayments support as soon as the government demonstrated that it had taken specified steps in four areas 1 increasing increase the efficiency and transparency of its public sector operations 2 reforming the financial sector and laying the groundwork for future restructuring of corporate debt 3 implementing range of structural and policy reforms aimed at improving governance productivity and environmental sustainability and 4 taking actions to protect the poor and continuing investments in education and health the bank determined soon after loan approval that the government had complied with the conditions and it disbursed the full sum of the loan the bank also approved 100 million urban renewal project and several projects totaling 170 million for social safetynet activities in the health and education sectorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30467crs13 19 world bank project information documents for indonesiasocial

id62715 interview with world bank official available from the bank web sitein may 1999 the bank approved three additional loans totaling 14 billion to support additional policy reform activities like the 1 billion policy reform loan approved earlier the proceeds from the loans were to be used for balance of payments support the funds would be disbursed however only after the government adopted certain specified reforms the 500 million policy reform loan required the government to take steps towards further improvements in its fiscal and monetary policies it identified several major initiatives particularly the resolution of bad loans the consolidation or closure of unsound banks and changes in the rules on corporate governance and investment that were needed in the banking and corporate sectors it specified particular steps needed to improve governance and the transparency and efficiency of public and private sector organizations it also identified particular actions necessary to improve environmental policy and its implementation the bank determined soon after the second policy reform loan was approved that the government had complied with the specified conditions and it disbursed the balance of the loan the two other policy reform loans approved in may 1999 have not yet been fully disbursed the 600 million committed for the social safety net adjustment loan would be available as balance of payments support when the government demonstrated that it had budgeted an adequate amount for social and safetynet programs when it demonstrated that it had adopted procedures to assure effective implementation of those programs and when it had created system of monitoring and control sufficient to safeguard the programs from delay leakage and corruption in february 2000 the world bank determined that the indonesian government had made sufficient progress in these areas to merit disbursement of the first half of the funds19 similarly the 300 million water sector adjustment loan seeks to improve the national institutional framework for water resources development and management it aims in particular to improve the policies and procedures for river basin management and irrigation among other things it requires that more authority be transferred to autonomous farmer organizations small portion of the proceeds of the loan was disbursed upon approval in february 2000 world bank officials believed that enough of the specified reforms may have been adopted to justify disbursement of the second tranche comprising major share of the proceeds in the near future20 in sum the world bank says of its activities during the asian financial crisis that it is helping build new east asia it will be region the bank says with stronger

as the fruits of labor january 2000the views of some prominent critics as the asian financial crisis spread to other parts of the world and as the russian financial crisis of august 1999 led to default and the collapse of the ruble many analysts voiced sharp criticism of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the ifis policies promoting asian and russian reform prominent among these are joseph stiglitz of the world bank and jeffrey sachs of harvards institute for international development their views and the views of several colleagues are summarized below critiques of the ifi programs in russia21 stiglitzs criticism focused22 on the policy differences between the washington consensus and the postwashington consensus the latter policy accepted the importance of the key macro economic pillars of the washington consensus such as liberalization stabilization and privatization but called for priority changes at the enterprise level and in economic institutions both stiglitz and sachs faulted the imf for failures in russian reform resulting from moscow following the washington consensus policy adopted by the imf in 1991 stiglitz is leading architect of the postwashington consensus policy sachs consistently held the international financial institution responsible for failures he perceived in russian reform the present discussion and the attached chronology highlight the recent criticisms by stiglitz and sachs of the imf in russia and note the public responses by officials in the imf the us treasury and the world bank to the criticisms of imfrussian reform policy and performance stiglitz described and criticized the washington consensus followed by the imf in the following statement the dictums of liberalization stabilization and privatizationwer evidently not enough an economy needs an institutional infrastructure23 by highlighting institutional infrastructure stiglitz emphasized developing marketfriendly institutions such as performing private commercial banks and efficient enterprises growth in gross domestic product from more comprehensive reform was not enough successful reform also required enhancement in the quality of life to attain this performance stiglitz called for reform to promote democratic equitable and sustainable development 24 sachss critique of the imf russian program focused mainly on reform failures without calling for the specific policy changes recommended by stiglitz sachs listed five failures in russian reforms crony privatization official corruption flight capital poor donor

very much in line with the imf and the washington consensus although sachs welcomed the post washington consensus as articulated by stiglitz he viewed success in poland and slovenia and failure in russia as more heavily influenced by geography ie proximity to the european union than the history of pluralism or authoritarianism for countries in transition26 responses to stiglitzs and sachss criticisms of imf russian policy were made by key officials in the imf treasury and the world bank such as stanley fischer lawrence summers and james wolfenson these official rejoinders did not criticize the postwashington consensus but questioned the critical interpretation of imf responsibility and culpability for russian reform failures they say that everyone had gone through learning process27 implementation of the imf programs was limited by what was politically possible28 james wolfenson world bank president criticized stiglitz for his public criticism of sister agency and also allowed that it was easier to have 2020 hindsight it was announced that stiglitz would leave the world bank on january 1 2000 before expiration of his term in office29 however he did not leave and his office at the world bank reported on january 18 that he would be staying on for another six months as special advisor to the president of the world bank up to the august 1998 crisis the imf had not publicly accepted the post washington consensus30 the postwashington consensus was largely adopted in the current imf russian program of july 1999 in the structural reform section jointly drafted by the imf and the world bank some observers suggest that an agreement of the imf and its critics on the adoption of the postwashington consensus policy may be step forward but is still not sufficient for successful reform these critics believe that missing piece in the critique may be administrative and military reform from their perspective the bloated and counterproductive civilian bureaucracy and military forces foster corruption and impede efficient transition31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30467crs16 32 ibid 33 prepared by dick k nanto specialist in industry and trade 34 international financial institution advisory commission report of the international financial institution advisory commission march 8 2000 124 pthe world bank has been more specific in their diagnosis of the poor russian economic performance and their prescriptions for remedial change in developing an institutional infrastructure the critical problem the world bank addresses is that of breaking up the nonpayment system in russia32 without an efficient tax code working banking system and bureaucratic system that regulates enterprises russia will not be able to gather taxes manage debt pay wages and pensions and otherwise make the system solvent these changes would positively influence the russian economic incentive system the present system is viewed as persistently undermining economic growth critiques of ifi programs in asia33 jeffrey sachs is harvard university professor and director of the harvard institute for international development he also was member of the international financial institution advisory commission which issued its report on march 8 200034 the sachs criticism of the imf seems to arise partly from his background as director of the harvard university institute for international development which is to be closed and partly from his work advising governments of former communist states in transition such as poland slovenia and russia the harvard institute focuses on alleviating poverty in developing countries while dr sachs has advised transitional economies to adopt economic policies that include privatizing industries and maintaining flexible exchange rate regimes sachs also plays the role of the independent professorial advisor who can advocate policies without coping with the difficulties of changing bureaucratic inertia or actually implementing them he has long criticized imf programs in various countries and the way that the imf operates the policies he advocates generally stem from principles of free markets privatization debt restructuringrelief and transparency in imf operations although he also appears sympathetic to the east asian reliance on stateled industrialization with respect to the role and operations of the imf in the asian financial crisis sachs has made the following statements the imf deepened the sense of panic in thailand indonesia and south korea by undermining foreign investor and lender confidence by its dire public pronouncements and proposed austerity programs the imfs approach to asia was patterned after its approach to problems in latin america and elsewhere focus on restraining government spending and raising interest rates to stabilize currency values rather than on containing privatesector financial panichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30467crs17 35 sachs jeffrey fixing the imf remedy

regulatory standards worsened the crisis by drying up lending in thailand south korea and indonesia35 almost every imf prediction about the asian financial crisis and its own bailout programs has been proven wrong the imf is not being held accountable for its actions its failed forecasts and the details of the advice it imposes on the developing world imf program documents are not open to public debate and critical scrutiny the imf is dominated by the united states european union and japan developing countries have little influence in imf decision making despite their large populations36 sachs criticisms of the imf appear to have some validity and have been heard from other quarters also some of them have been bolstered by benefit of hindsight but others were made during the crisis and before the negative effects of the imf prescriptions were felt in the countries in question the imf has been reviewing its own programs as well as responding to criticisms from sachs and others it has modified its operating methods and pursued policies oriented toward alleviating poverty in addition to their traditional purpose of stabilizing exchange rates did the imf worsen the crisis the core of sachs criticism is that the imf worsened the asian financial crisis rather than easing it by its dire public pronouncements and the fiscal austerity and high interest rate policies tight monetary and fiscal policies it required of borrowing countries as condition for loans sachs views the asian financial crisis as being caused more by investorlender panic than structural financial problems and governmental economic policies for him the solution should have been more to stop the panic rather than to perform major surgery on frail economic systems he admits that the asian countries had allowed themselves to become too dependent on shortterm borrowing in foreign currencies for longterm domestic projects and had maintained their exchange rates fixed at excessively high values despite clear market signals that devaluation would have been prudent he points out however that just months before the onset of the financial turmoil the imf and other organizations were praising the economic performance growth rates of the very asian nations hit by the crisis according to sachs since the shortterm borrowing was private the solution should have been to work out deal with private foreign creditors in order to stem the panic and to provide some shortterm liquidity rather than for the imf to rely on high interest rates and fiscal austerity to try to keep capital from fleeing the countries in question the high interest rates in particular plunged the economies into deep recessionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30467crs18 37 fischer stanley learning the lessons of

reforms reflections and new challenges remarks to the imf conference on second generation reforms washington november 8 1999the imf maintain s however that the high interest rates were shortterm emergency measure the rates came down as the economies were stabilized in south korea and somewhat less so in thailand the recessions were relatively short lived given the severity of the initial crises according to most observers the political turmoil in indonesia that accompanie d the financial crisis made return to normalcy nearly impossible regardless of what the imf did or did not do much of the capital flight converting liquid assets into foreign currency moreover was by investors in stock markets and by local wealthholders who were trying to protect their wealth by converting assets into dollars as their home currency values plummeted reassuring these investors would have been much more formidable task than gathering small number of creditor bankers in new york to discuss rolling over their loans in other words sachs may have good point but in the midst of financial panic working out deal with enough private foreign creditors and investors to stem the capital flight would have been extremely difficult or impossible at any rate the imf appears to have been affected by its experience in the asian financial panic and is taking more preventive measures to try to keep panics from occurring the imf also shares the conclusion of many observers that the efficient operation of the international system requires more private sector involvement in the prevention and resolution of financial crises37 in other words the imf feels that foreign banks and other lenders rather than investors and local citizens need to bear more of the costs of financial crises the imf maintains moreover that the monetary and fiscal restraints on the countries in crisis were eased as economies stabilized or dropped into recession and regulations were revised as appropriate the imf also states that it recognizes that macroeconomic stability alone cannot solve financial crises during most of its existence the imf has focused on firstgeneration reforms intended to make markets work more efficiently to ensure stability these included reforms in pricing exchange rates taxes and government expenditures and by establishing rudimentary market institutions these actions proved particularly important for eastern european countries as they dropped their failing systems based on central planning and control the imf now recognizes that financial stability also relies on secondgeneration reforms that is reforms and institutionbuilding that is needed for country to attain sustained highquality growth the scope of these reforms is now being defined and would include sound economic social and political institutions38 closing weak financial institutions sachs also criticizes the imf for insisting that weak financial institutions be closed and their regulatory standards be tightened he claims that this worsened the crisis by drying up lending lending activity by banks and other financial institutions certainly did drop and for time dried up during the financial crises in thailand south korea and indonesia the sachs criticism however raises the ageold problem of moral hazard does one bailhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30467crs19 39 engelen klaus c shootout at the basel

will encourage further unsound lending in the future should banks that cannot meet minimum capital adequacy standards be allowed to continue lending particularly if their source of funds is quasigovernmental bank even though the threat of massive bank closings causes such crisis of confidence in the banking system that it has major negative effects on the economy these questions are not easy to answer and future policies to contain financial panic probably will have to include delicate mix of actions that include both harsh and supportive policies toward financial institutions with respect to the international capital adequacy standards for banks the basel switzerla nd committee on banking supervision in june 1999 proposed that the existing standard be overhauled this issue now is being debated in international financial circles the new standard would address problems of risk management more completely39 poor forecasts further criticism by sachs of the imf is that almost every prediction it has made about the asian financial crisis and its own bailout programs have been proven wrong specifically sachs points out that imf projections of economic recovery were too optimistic and that economies were harder hit than anticipated in retrospect not only imf economists but few other economists or observers foresaw the severity of the asian financial crisis the crisis was outside the range of immediately probable events still the imf could have benefitted from the experience of experts from the world bank asian development bank and other asian institutions during the early stages of the crisis who voiced opinions that the imf requirements appeared too stringent in the south korean case recovery is proceeding faster than anticipated at the beginning of the crisis imf accountability sachs states that the imf is not being held accountable for its actions and the details of the advice it imposes on the developing world he points out that the imf is loath to disclose information to the public who need it to protect their investments and to evaluate imf policies imf program documents have not been open to public debate and critical scrutiny the imf counters that by disclosing certain sensitive financial information about countries it would run the risk of causing the very financial panics it was trying to prevent during the asian financial crisis however several imf documents related to the south korean support program were posted on various korean internet sites the imf with the permission of the countries involved therefore is making public on its internet home page documents that deal with imfsupported programs of reform and adjustment the imf also is now having external evaluations conducted of its surveillance and economic research imf not attuned to needs of poor nations sachs also claims that the imf is dominated by the united states europe and japan and is not attuned to the special needs of developing nations such as alleviating poverty the imf and it supporters respond that problems of economic development and poverty have been the purviewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30467crs20 40 fisher stanley the road to

million people into poverty and certain officials of the world bank publicly expressed dissatisfaction with imf actions the imf has been shifting its policies more toward poverty alleviation in 1999 speech stanley fisher the first deputy managing director of the imf said that the asian financial crisis had been terrible and had taken high toll on many people especially the poorest and most vulnerable in society40 the imf has joined with the world bank in joint strategy to make poverty reduction the centerpiece of their joint strategies in the 75 poorest countries of the world41 other analysts fault both the sachs criticism and the imf defense by arguing that poverty alleviation aid reflects old thinking and that sound marketfriendly economic and fiscal policies are still the best way to promote development as for the large influence of the united states europe and japan in the imf voting power in the imf is based primarily on subscriptions to the imfs capital base currently the united states holds about 18 of the votes since decisions require an 85 majority of the imfs total voting power the us effectively holds veto rights in the organization this of course gives it considerable authority in determining imf policies despite the fact that traditionally the imf is headed by an european in summary many of the criticisms by jeffrey sachs of the imf with respect to the asian financial crisis have been incorporated to certain extent into the operations of the institution whether the changes in imf operations and policies come from its own internal thinking and policy reviews or from the criticism of outsiders like sachs however is unclear most likely the changes resulted from combination of policy failures outside criticism and internal institutional thought even with the changes the imf has made however it still has encountered problems in attempting to assist countries such as russia and brazil as they have been confronted with financial crises as imf programs have hit snags sachs continues to critique the institution and its policies and will probably continue to do so into the futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30467crs21 42 prepared by robert
