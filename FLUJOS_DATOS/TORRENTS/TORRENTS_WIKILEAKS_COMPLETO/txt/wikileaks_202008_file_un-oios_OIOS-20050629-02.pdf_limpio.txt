the same period gtz did not always evidence the competitive bidding for its procurement and the documentation supporting the expenditure was sometimes inadequate payments of some us 110000 were made to single contractor for transport services without competitive bidding gtz underperformance in the area of workshop led the unhcr representation t discontinue using the gtz workshop in the capital city and to outsource the repair and maint enance services to various private garages oios assessed that project financial monitoring was carried out though some improvement was required project verification reports were not alw ays available unspent project balances often not reimbursed by partners with evidence of any fol lowup by the representation the representation explained that during 2004 the offic was seriously constrained with the lack of senior programme officer for most of the year whic h had led the project control officer to assume the functions of programme officer thus affecting programme monitoring supply management due to technical difficulties assettrak had not be updated since mid2003 consequently the procurement transfer and disposal of assets had t been reflected in the system the representation has now fixed the technical obstacle s and physical inventory is being undertaken to update assettrak the private use of unhcr assets had not been proper ly monitored with reimbursement by staff for their private use of unhcr vehicles or for the use of generators the representation has now initiated recoveries security and safety oios assessed that the representation did not fully comply with minimum operational security standards moss as none of the unhcr offices was equipped with metal detectors surveillance cameras smoke detectors and alarm sy stem the representation has indicated that smoke detectors and demarcated fire escape routes re being installed and that moss requirements would be fully complied by september 2 005 administration in

internal controls were required outstanding value added tax vat of some us 05 m illion identified in the 2002 audit had still not been refunded by the government of guinea gog despite tremendous efforts by the representation in the meantime the outstanding v at has increased to over us 15 million and it has become even more unlikely that the gog will mak refund the representation together with other agencies have set up special team to loo k at the vat issues and come up with practical recommendations the representation also indicated that approval has been obtained from gog with effect from april 2005 to procure fuel and lu bricants locally under special custom arrangement which should allow unhcr to receive re imbursement of vat on oil products on quarterly basis internal controls over medical evacuations medevac needed to be strengthened there were significant and unusual number of medevac cases wh ich had triggered an investigation from special mission from the unhcr medical service oi found that incorrect application of dsa rates in connection with some medevac cases had res ulted in an overpayment of at least us 11000 the representation confirmed the overpayment

in 2002 oios had assessed the unhcr operation in guinea as seriously deficient for the period under audit the lack of adequate programme monitor ing and flawed procurement procedures by implementing partners had resulted in unhcr suff ering exchange losses estimated at over us 06 million also due to the lack of proper p rocedures the branch office failed to timely claim the reimbursement of vat exceeding us 05 million 3 guinea was still vulnerable to security ditions in neighbouring countries compounded with complex political situation soci tensions and economic recession in 2003 unhcr provided basic assistance to 185000 ref ugees in guinea of whom over 111000 89000 liberians 15000 sierra leoneans nd 7000 ivorians received basic assistance and services in camps in addition clos to

subagreements 2 iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit focused on 2003 and 2004 programm activities under projects 03 04abguirp351 03 04abguicm200 03 04ab guicm202 04abguicm203 and 03abguiem130 with expendi ture of us 206 million our review concentrated on the activities implemented b gesellshaft fur technische zusammenarbeit gtz expenditure of us 38 milli on international federation of red crescent ifrc expenditure of us 11 million bureau national coordination pour refugies bncr expenditure of us 08 million international rescue committee irc expenditure of us 23 million action by churches together act expenditure of us 17 million and american refugee committee rc expenditure of us 08 million we also reviewed activities directly impl emented by unhcr with expenditure of us 41 million 8 the audit reviewed the administration of th representation so nzerekore and fo kissidougou with administrative expenditure totalli ng us 45 million for the years 2003 and 2004 and assets with an acquisition value of us 26 1 million and current value of us 72 million the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in guinea was 190 against 221 approved posts this included staff on regular posts united nations volunteers and staff on mission 9 the audit also followed up on findings and recommendations made in the 2002 oios audit regarding outstanding valued added tax vat of some us 560000 over us 12 million as at 31 january 2005 and unsupported exp enditure by implementing partner irc totalling some us 91000 10 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of the implementing partners 11 for the six partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accord ance with the subagreements except for bncr the governmental partner and act an interna tional ngo for bncr the final spmr did not reconcile to their books of accounts and was overstated by some us 46000 acts books of account also did not reconcile to th final spmrs and were overstated by some us 15000 for these two partners assura nce could be taken that unhcr funds were properly controlled managed and reported on oios assessed that internal controls of the other partners reviewed were generally in place and operating effectively 12 audit certificates had not been received f rom any of the international ngos for the years 2003 and 2004 while for the year 2003 copy of their global audit certificates would suffice the representation still needed to follow up and obtain them for those projects implemented in 2004 onwards given that their value was over us 300000 the representation should have engaged an audit firm ea rly on to carry out the audit in 3 accordance with iom61fom61 dated 8 december 2003 for bncr an audit certificate was available for 2003 with however qualified op inion due to the unreliability of their accounting system the representation indicated that international ngo s have been requested to provide their 2003 audit certificates and that an audit firm has been selected for the audit of 2004 subprojects implemented by both local and international implementing partners which would commence by the end of june 2 005 gtz 13 the accounting systems and internal contro ls established by gtz were satisfactory the final spmrs were satisfactorily reconciled to g tz summary records improvement in the documentation supporting local and internationa l procurement was however necessary 14 in 2003 and 2004 gtz procured spare parts internationally for total of some us 830000 oios found that payment documents were available locally to support these payments the charges made to unhcr were sole ly based on journal entries made at gtz headquarters with evidence that the cost of spare parts actually received matched the amounts charged in the spmrs in one instance oio s noted that gtz had charged some us 60000 to the spmr with basis since their hq s journal entries had not been received the gtz finance officer indicated that this was an estimate and that adjusting entries would be made when the actual figure is obt ained from their headquarters 15 oios reviewed the automated inventory cont rol system called pms to ensure that the cost of spare parts charged to unhcr can be rel ated to the cost of spare parts actually received by gtz we found significant discrepancie s between the costs charged to the financial reports and the value of spare parts actu ally received for example in 2004 the purchase costs of spare parts included in the final spmr were us 470000 but according to the stock records the value of the spare parts rec eived in 2004 was only some us 10662 for 2003 the stock records showed that the cost of spare parts received was us 672034 while only us 358000 was reported in the spmrs overall for both years 2003 and 2004 total of us 828000 was charged to the fi nal spmrs while the actual receipt per the pms system was only us 682696 discrepancy of u s 145304 which could possibly have arisen due to different cutoff between financ ial periods gtz has not yet given explanations on the reason for the discrepancy 16 similarly oios found that the transfers f spare parts by gtz main office in conakry did not reconcile with the records maintain ed by their field offices in kissidougou and nzerekore for example according to the pms system spare parts worth some us 454000 were transferred to the two field offic while the pms system maintained by those field offices kissidougou and nzerekore on ly showed spare part receipts of some us 446000 discrepancy of us 8000 this mean t that gtz tracking of receipts stockholding and use of spare parts was inadequate and could not be relied upon oios recommended that gtz ensure that spare part receipt s and onward transfers are properly and timely reconciled the unhcr representation indicated that gtz has bee n requested to consolidate and reconcile their receipts of spare p arts and that evidence of the action taken would be forwarded to oios 17 gtz did not always use competitive bidding for its procurement and the documentation supporting the payments was often inc omplete in kissidougou gtz procured goods and services totalling some us 200 000 out of which some us 110000 4 was paid to single supplier without competitive b idding also under the 2003 subprojects us 80000 was paid to two contractors on the basis of contracts only there were invoices and certification that the services we re satisfactorily rendered or delivered was available the unhcr representation explained that gtz has bee n formally requested to implement the competitive bidding process and that this issue would be followed up to ensure compliance 18 in the area of workshop oios found tota l of 44 vehicles grounded in kissidougou and nzerekore alone mainly due to the lack of spa re parts according to gtz the lack of spare parts originated from the fact that the relev ant budget line was initially meant for servicing programme vehicles only but that unhcr l ater instructed that administrative vehicles be serviced as well without however incre asing the budget for this purpose 19 in the area of warehousing of nonfood ite ms nfis oios found that although segregation of duties was achieved supervisory controls were in place as evidenced by several shortages of nfi items with noticeable att empts to conceal stock entries and the relevant bills of lading gtz indicated that they would look into the matter and that appropriate disciplinary measures would be taken b ifrc 20 while ifrc had an automated accounting sys tem called field return regrettably the system was not put in use for various reasons incl uding the accountants inability to operate the system instead summary ledgers were obtained from lotus tables which served as basis for the preparation of the financial reports the final 2003 spmrs were satisfactorily reconciled to ifrcs records 21 oios found that the banking arrangements w ere inadequate with unhcr instalments sent to ifrcs head office in conakry now relocated in senegal which in turn would send signed cheques based on monthly require ments to their field offices the main reason was to exercise better fund controls but th is was actually not achieved and might unnecessarily delay project implementation oios n oted that cash verification was carried out and that cash disbursements were not recorded i n the cashbook on daily basis in some instances the cashbook showed negative balances w hich the accountant attributed to ifrcs prefinancing of unhcr activities the unhcr representation explained that ifrc has been requested to establish panel of bank signatories in kissidougou and nze rekore and to strengthen their internal control systems the r epresentation also indicated that they would followup closely to ensure compliance c irc 22 irc uses wellestablished accounting sys tem called sunsystem which provides for adequate control mechanisms and allows the identif ication of unhcr projects through unique identifier the 2003 and 2004 final spmrs we re satisfactorily reconciled to ircs ledgers 23 oios found that transfer of an instalmen t of us 7000 to ircs headquarters in new york was not reflected in ircs records the representation indicated that irc has managed to trace the us7000 which had been wrong ly transferred to irc burundi 5 24 oios followed up on an outstanding 2002 au dit recommendation which pertained to unsupported expenditure incurred by ircs headquart er in new york and totalling us 91000 the justifications subsequently provi ded to the representation included staff travel costs totalling some us 35000 with discre pancies with regard to both the individuals who travelled and the nature of the travel it was not evident that it was for unhcrfunded activities the representation confirmed that further review of some of the supporting documentation provided by irc showed that part of them were not related to unhcr projects on this basis the representation question ed the full amount of us 91000 identified by oios in 2002 and recommended full recovery the representation also indicated that this issue is being taken up with the head of deskdirec tor of the africa bureau for further action recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for africa should request irc to refund total of us 91000 representing unsubstan tiated irc headquarters charges to unhcr projects in guin ea rec 01 d bncr 25 oios found that the 2004 spmr submitted by bncr was overstated by some us 46000 of which some us 41000 pertained to sa laries internal controls were weak with bncrs director being the sole bank account si gnatory cash custodian and authorizingapproving officer budget monitoring wa s also weak with significant budgetary overruns of over 60 percent at the budget line leve l with authorization from unhcr oios recommended that bncr refund the amount overst ated in the final spmr and that adequate internal controls be put in place 26 the representation indicated that number of actio ns have been taken to correct the deficiencies noted including stronger internal trols computers and accounting software and capacity building for finance staff the repres entation also explained that bncr has been requested to submit corrected final spmr and t provide comments on the overstatement and recovery of us 46000 and that intervention would be sought from the ministry of foreign affairs if reply is received by july 2005 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in guinea should ensure th at corrected final spmr is submitted by bncr and that the amount overstated under subproject 03abguicm20 1 b and totalling some us 46000 is recovered rec 02 actlwf 27 act maintained its accounting system in ex cel tables until 2004 at which time new accounting software accpac was introduced with t he 2003 records converted to the new system each unhcr subproject was assigned uniqu identifier however oios found that for 2004 trial balance was prepared and th at several of the larger expenditures were obtained from manual calculations for 2003 sum mary listing was available hence although the documentation supporting the expenditu re was available these could not be 6 related to the spmrs hence these could not be reco nciled 28 oios found that the 2004 spmrs were overst ated by some us 15000 stemming from unsupported expenditures most of which relate d to salaries oios recommended that these amounts be recovered the representation indicated that actlwf has been requested to justify the overstatement and that recovery wou ld be made through deduction from 2005 instalment payments to the partner if proper jus tifications is provided by september 2005 29 procurement by actlwf lacked transparency as its director was solely responsible for selecting suppliers with evidence of any co mpetitive bidding in one instance payment of some us 6000 to governmental agency dnef was not supported by any documentation the representation explained that actlwf has been requested to ensure that adequate procurement procedures are implemente d the representation further explained that the partner would be requested to re imburse their payment of us 6000 if the relevant supporting documentation cannot be provide d by september 2005 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in guinea should unless proper supporting documentation can be produced recover from actlwf some us 15000 representing overstatement of salary and maintenance costs under sub project 04abguicm202 203 in addition so us 6000 should be recovered representing an unsupported payment to dnef rec 03 b other programme issues 30 oios assessed that project financial monit oring was carried out though some improvement was required project verification repo rts were not always available subproject unspent balances often not reimbursed by partners with evidence of any followup by the branch office 31 the representation explained that during 2004 the ffice was seriously constrained with inadequate programme staff and that for most of the year there was senior programme officer or programme officer they also explained that the situation had led the project control officer to assume the functions of programme officer which had consequently affected programme monitoring the rep resentation further indicated that following centralization of programme management and the filling of the posts of senior programme officer and programme officer programme financial monitoring has been intensified and improved significantly 32 oios found that in 2003 the suboffice nz erekore had directly undertaken several construction related activities which involved sub stantial procurement such direct implementation should and could have been avoided g iven that partners with more expertise and cost effectiveness were also implementing simil ar activities in relation with the construction oios noted several instances of nonc ompliance to unhcr procurement procedures such as not adhering to the delegated t hreshold competitive bidding not evidenced lack of transparency in the selection pr ocess inadequate supporting documentation etc oios recommended that in futur direct implementation be limited to 7 activities for which viable implementing partner can be found the representation explained that with the envisaged centralization of programme management self implementation had been significantly reduced espec ially at the suboffice level and that the branch office was strictly monitoring the very limi ted cases of selfimplementation c supply management procurement 33 unhcr procurement procedures were generall adhered to though some improvement was still warranted for example the f iling system was inadequate with permanent lcc file maintained formal minutes of meetings systematically prepared etc also internal requests of goods or services were s ometimes made informally oios pointed out that written and signed requisition forms were essential in ensuring the authenticity and validity of the requests and proper authorization and recommended that the form be used for future requests 34 the representation explained that filing system h as now been established to keep the minutes of the meetings of the local contract c ommittee and that files have been duplicated with one set kept at the committee secr etariat and the other at the supply section they further indicated that the purchase request fo rm has been established for all purchases above us 2500 and that these would be filed toge ther with the completed purchase order form for record purposes 35 with regards to procurement of services i mprovement was also required for example the lcc delegated threshold for local proc urement us 100000 was disregarded when contracting for travel services with travel agency to whom total of some us 447000 was paid in 2003 and 2004 in addition oios noted that the travel agency had not been selected on competitive basis the representation explained that in september 2004 undp acting on behalf of united nations agenc ies in guinea recommended the use of the same travel agency in oios view however given the significant paym ents involved the matter should still be formally submitted to th headquarters committee on contracts the representation indicated that actions were bein g taken accordingly 36 there was also need to establish and imp lement harmonized approach for procurement by field offices with clearly defined c eilings for local procurement oios found that in 2003 and 2004 the ceiling for presentation to the lcc was us 20000 at the branch office and at the suboffice nzerekore while it w as only us 10000 at the suboffice kissidougou with clear reasons for this b fleet management 37 the performance of gtz in the area of work shop was assessed as less than satisfactory in 2002 gtz underperformance led t he representation to discontinue the use gtz workshop in the capital city and to outsource the repair and maintenance services to various private garages however oios assessed th at the main garage being actually used not only lacked the formal structure and capacity t maintain the unhcr fleet but also did not keep records of vehicle maintenance history th us making difficult any cost analysis further while parts were sourced from gtz to lim ited extent in most cases the parts were procured directly from the local market often of i nferior quality the use of these locally 8 acquired spare parts might drastically increase the frequency and cost of repairs 38 the representation explained that the lack of adequ ateefficient private workshops in conakry is compelling to consider discussions with gtz to establish another workshop in conakry to service unhcr vehicles as already done at sub and field offices they also indicated that the discussion being held with gtz t establish garage in conakry was still at its initial stages and would be considered more seriously before the end of 2005 39 oios found that as many as 75 vehicles wer grounded at gtz workshops for years for some of them due to the lack of spare parts p ointing out to poor planning for spare part requirement and procurement there was evidence that an inventory control system was in place with predetermined reordering levels to mee t the fleet requirements also the review of the job cards showed that many vehicles had been repaired very frequently which raised questions about the quality of the work done the representation indicated that many of the grounded vehicles are old and depreciated and that following recommendations by the lambhamb these are being disposed of 40 although workshop common to the is be ing envisaged oios believes that more should be done to strengthen the capacity of the gt z workshop given their experience and performance in other countries in the region oios recommended that the representation consider hiring consultant to carry out an indep th and critical review of gtz workshops and to come up with practical solutions the representation explained that unv mechanical engineer had been recruited and has alre ady started work and it is expected that this would improve on the management of the fleet f vehicles c asset management 41 oios found that the assettrak system had n ot been updated since june 2003 due to technical difficulties consequently several asset s were procured disposed of or transferred to partners without being reflected in the records the representation explained that the technical problems encountered with the assettrak s ystem had been solved and that physical inventory would be immediately conducted w ith the system updated accordingly 42 oios reviewed recent lamb submission to the headquarters asset management board hamb with recommendation to dispose of 1 0 vehicles whose repair costs were found too high five of these vehicles were not ful ly depreciated hence the hamb had requested that additional justification be given on the reasons for disposal oios noted that those five vehicles were in fact accident vehicles and that the required gs46 had not been completed and submitted except for one vehicle ios recommended that cases of loss or damage of unhcr property be properly followedup an d reported on the gs46s and gs45s the representation explained that followup was b eing made to have the gs46gs45 forms completed for the vehicles involved in accidents 43 oios found that the private use of unhcr ssets was not properly monitored and paid for while local staff were paying flat mon thly fee of some us 13 for transportation provided to and from work several international st aff members were using unhcr vehicles regularly for commuting from office to their privat residences since taking up their assignment from five to seven months with rei mbursements made nor was this private use properly accounted for in the vehicle logbooks also many of the international staff having generator sets at their disposal had not pai d the required monthly rental fee of us 80 9 44 the representation explained that monthly reimbur sement rate has been calculated for the private use of unhcr vehicles with staff i nformed accordingly they further indicated that international staff in receipt of hcr generators had been requested to pay the stipulated rental fee of us 80 and that the mount is being deducted from their salary with immediate effect including retroactive unpaid rental fees d security and safety 45 guinea currently has different security ph ases for its offices countrywide the branch office in conakry is under security phase i whereas the suboffice nzerekore and field office kissidougou are under security phase iii ea ch office having separate security plan last updated in december 2004 according to miss ion report from the director and deputy united nations security coordinator on 28 july 2004 unhcr is fully moss compliant in the areas of telecommunications security plan ind ividual staff building securityaccess and vehicles 46 however oios assessed that improvement wa s still needed in all three unhcr offices at the branch office in conakry there were surveillance cameras smoke detectors or any alarm system the suboffice in nzerekore and field office in kissidougou had metal detectors to screen visitors in kissidougou the division of the two office blocks causes security concern given that public road s eparated the two blocks and that the road was being used as parking space the representation indicated that oios recommendati on on this issue was noted with appreciation and that efforts would be made to ensure full moss compliance before 30 september 2005 administration 47 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr offices in guinea generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures there was need however to strengthen certain controls financial management 48 vat was still an unresolved issue despite commendable documented efforts from the branch office to obtain the reimbursement as at ja nuary 2005 some us 12 million was outstanding in the vf accounts oios discussions wi th unicef however revealed that vat reimbursements can actually be secured as long the claim is lodged in timely manner in accordance with the procedures which requires t hat the exemption be requested well in advance and on quarterly basis based on supplier s pro forma invoices and allocated quotas 49 the issue of vat was also raised during th meeting of representatives of the system in conakry to which oios was invited held on 4 february 2005 at the branch office it was felt that concerted effort by all the gencies had yet to be made the unhcr representative raised the issue of outstanding vat on fuel over us 15 million other representatives felt that it is very unlikely that the government of guinea would reimburse such significant amount given their current budg etary constraints and the lack of assistance from the donor community 50 reference was also made to letter dated 15 june 2004 from the ministry of finance and addressed to the unhcr representation in conakr which had stated that article 34 of 10 the vienna convention does not requireanticipate v at exemption for taxes levied on local purchases and denied the vat reimbursement to unhc r while at the same time granting it to unicef and undp it was decided that the omt wo uld immediately be tasked to further look into the vat issue and to inform oios accordi ngly 51 the representation indicated that the omt special v at team report would be shared with oios as soon as it is made available they fur ther explained that despite their numerous attempts the office could not get the government of guinea gog to commit itself to reimburse the outstanding vat to unhcr the repres entation indicated however that approval has been obtained from gog with effect fr om april 2005 to procure fuel and lubricants locally under special custom arrangeme nt which should allow unhcr to receive reimbursement of vat on oil products on q uarterly basis b receivables 52 the receivable accounts had not been monit ored since at least 2002 and this had resulted in many outstanding amounts this pertain ed to undue solar payments unsettled travel claims salary advances not recovered etc for example oios had identified during the 2002 audit some us 22000 for undue solar paym ents and recommended recovery but the review showed that there was remaining ba lance of some us 6000 that still needed to be recovered also travel advances some which originated from 1997 and totalling some us 28000 had still not been settled there w ere also number of salary advances made at field offices since 2002 which were never recovered from the concerned staff 53 the representation indicated that headquarters had been requested to provide the latest situation on advances paid under their suspe nse account however while awaiting the latest status of receivables for proper actions oi believes that the undue solar payments on any portion thereof identified in the 2002 aud it report should be deducted from the concerned staff members without any further delay the representation explained the concerned staff were being identified and that dhrm would be requested to take action accordingly c medical evacuation medevac 54 oios found that significant number of dical evacuations had taken place about 25 per cent of staff with costs totalling some us 385000 in 2003 and 2004 with steep increase of cases in 2004 over 80 per cent compar ed to 2003 there were apparent reasons for this sudden increase oios noted that m ost of the medevac cases were attributable to local staff members with some of t hem having several evacuations during the period under review in connection with this situat ion oios was informed of an investigation from special mission from the unhcr medical servi ce in may 2004 the result of which had not been released at the time of the audit the representation informed that the jms mission report has now been released with confirma tion that medical facilities in guinea are inadequate 55 oios noted that the representation did

screening of medical claims submitted by unhcr staff was carried out by the undp medical doctor for accuracy and reasonableness while compliance with the mip rules and procedures was verified at the representation oios assessed that the screening was satisfactorily carried out however neither the r epresentation nor the undp medical doctor had compiled list of hospitals physicians pharmacies nor as list of typical services and prices which should have been distrib uted to staff this is particularly important as many local staffs travelled from the field to th capital city to attend hospitalsphysicians oios recommended that list of recommended hospita ls and pharmacies be established with favourable financial arrangements that would serve as benchmark for the maximum reimbursable amount for each claim the representation explained that the united nation s medical system has been contacted to assist in blishing list of recommended hospitals and pharmacies and that the financial arrangements negotiated would be used as benchmark for the reimbursement of claims staff management 58 although guinea is unhcrs largest operat ion in west africa with by far the highest number of staff approximately 200 filled p osts the human resources officer post was cut in 2004 after the last hro had been reassig ned to geneva in july 2004 as result human resources assistant is performing the functio ns of human resources officer there was proper handover from the outgoing hro in oi view this situation constitutes major weakness which could have negative effect on human resources management 59 the representative explained that until 2003 the of fice was well structured but towards the end of 2003 key positions were downgra ded for example from assistant representatives to senior posts and that the progr amme was decentralized in 20032004 which in his view was not quite good idea as thi s did not provide for proper overview the representative also explained that the office was f acing two challenges one of which was the winding up of the operation with further reduction of staff expected in 2006 12 f communications 60 the controls over the use of telecommunica tion equipment were assessed as inadequate oios noted that headquarter telephone pin codes had been assigned to local staff unvs consultants etc which allowed them t access the pama system and to make direct international calls with billings and recov eries by headquarters in oios view there were serious risks of misuse we found that severa l of the concerned local staff were actually longer working for unhcr and that actions d been taken to cancel the pin codes according to the finance officer local staff d ever made any payments under this scheme and indeed oios did not find any such payme nts in the records given that the telephone invoices were sent directly to the pin co holders we could not exclude that the relevant bills remained unsettled 61 the representation explained that an email message was forwarded to the telecom section in geneva to cancel pin codes allocated to local staff and that the bills for the period january 2003 to january 2005 have now been received the concerned staff members have been requested to identify their private calls and make payments accordingly the representation further said that billing machine has been installed and that an additional control measure is being introduced v acknowledgement 62 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of unhcr and its implementing
