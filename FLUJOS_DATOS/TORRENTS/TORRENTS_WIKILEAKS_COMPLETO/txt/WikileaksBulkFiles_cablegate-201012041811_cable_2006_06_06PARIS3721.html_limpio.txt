party international affairs secretary pierre moscovici classified by acting political counselor bruce turner for reasons 14 b d 1 c summary and comment pierre moscovici the socialist partys national secretary for international relations met may 29 with visiting ambassador to nato nuland to discuss transatlantic relations in the context of frances 2007 presidential elections moscovici insisted that ps administration under candidate yet to be selected would be more usfriendly than chirac notwithstanding the greater emphasis the ps would place on europeanizing french foreign policy france and the us should strive for agreement whenever possible he asserted even if france can never be like the uk what he described as neither chirac nor blair and should continue talking even when they dont agree he welcomed the warming in transatlantic relations since president bushs visit to brussels in 2005 but insisted that divisions between the us and europe would remain given continuing french concerns about us unilateralist tendencies the meeting sent useful signal that the us is eager to engage both sides of the political aisle on nato issues even if moscovici tended to see the transatlantic relationship in terms of the us and the eu end summary and comment 2 c in may 29 meeting with visiting ambassador to nato victoria nuland socialist party ps national secretary for international affairs pierre moscovici discussed the likely positions of ps administration on transatlantic relations if the socialist candidate wins the 2007 presidential elections while making clear that he could not speak authoritatively for the eventual ps presidential candidate acknowledging at the outset that he was personally close to former finance minister dominique strausskahn moscovici described the candidate selection in november to be determined through vote among the partys rank and file as contest between popular frontrunner segolene royal an outsider former prime minister lionel jospin and two insiders in particular strausskahn and former prime minister laurent fabius moscovici judged that the ps had 5050 chance of winning the elections 3 c moscovici noted the first anniversary of frances rejection of the eu constitutional treaty while he rejected the notion that the french was the cause of the current crisis in europe it had nonetheless deepened an already existing crisis he did not expect renegotiation of the treaty until after the 2007 elections explaining that president chiracs lameduck status and damaged credibility precluded meaningful initiatives in the interim moscovici attributed french unease with eu enlargement as perhaps the major factor in the treatys rejection saying that enlargement had proceeded too quickly and without sufficient debate even if one argued that enlargement was good it could not substitute for the absence of tangible project as vicepresident in the european parliament he felt he could nonetheless state with relative certainty that romania and bulgaria would join the eu in 2007 although this would not occur without some difficult debate 4 c turning to useu relations moscovici regretted what he called wrong us decision to invade iraq but he welcomed the us stress on renewed partnership since 2005 that said he believed that unilateral strains in us thinking combined with divisiveness among the europeans meant that some frictions in the transatlantic relationship would continue the eu was more regionally focused he judged as compared with the more global vision of the us all that said it was important for all to understand that the us and europe had better allies than each other so it was important to make the best of the relationship there was other real choice 5 c moscovici asserted that the ps leadership was favorably disposed toward the us and described the ps as ultimately less antiamerican than chirac while it was likely to be tougher on questions of principle he judged that the ps would be more flexible in practice he described chirac as dogmatist who had pandered too much to domestic opinion and accused chirac of actively working against the us in the runup to the iraq war and threatening veto too early before the had had an opportunity to explore all possible avenues although the ps was also opposed to the iraq war he contended that unlike chirac it also would not have broken off dialogue with the us moscovici claimed that historically frenchus relations had been strongest when the left was in power primarily because the ps did not hold certain negative attitudes toward the us the ps he said would base its relations with the us on coolheaded analysis rather than emotion taking into account the bedrock values the europe and america share paris 00003721 002 of 002 6 c moscovici asserted that france under ps administration would be neither blair nor chirac france viewed itself as fully european and unlike the uk not as bridge between the us and europe but it was incumbent on the us and france despite certain differences to maintain at all times constructive dialogue they should strive to find agreement whenever possible he continued citing specifically darfur iran afghanistan and kosovo as well as frances membership in nato of course france would sometimes oppose us policy such as on iraq even then however it would be important to keep talking without lies and dissimulation the us should also understand that ps administration would want more than the centerright to europeanize frances foreign policy while proud of frances status as unsc permanent member the ps understood that it could not act on its own and therefore needed esdp in that regard speaking personally moscovici said he hoped france would not only maintain but increase current defense expenditure levels ambassador nuland welcomed french leadership in that regard adding that europe also needed french leadership she urged moscovici to view nato not as usowned vehicle but one in which france was also large stakeholder 7 c asked about the weight of security policy issues in the upcoming elections moscovici said that french voters were more motivated by domestic concerns he noted that that us emphasis on antiterrorism was not shared by the french public which did not view itself as target moreover there was currently great skepticism toward the eu as well as the us whereby ps voters were generally much more negative than the party leadership and would need to be led toward more positive attitudes toward the eu and the us moscovici assured ambassador nuland that all the main socialist candidates jospin strausskahn and even former culture minister jack lang were reasonable and realistic on this count he indicated however that he could not speak for segolene royal given that her positions on the issues were still largely unknown comment moscovici is not segolene royal supporter end comment 8 c ambassador nuland concluded the meeting by extending an invitation to the ps presidential candidates foreign policy advisor to visit brussels and become more personally familiar with nato moscovici pledged to remain in touch cautioning that an election team probably would not be formed until the end of the year after the selection of the partys candidate 9 c comment in discussing transatlantic relations moscovici tended to speak in terms of the us and the europe the meeting nonetheless served useful purpose in sensitizing ps officials to nato issues and through ambassador nulands active pursuit of meeting with party officials on both sides of the aisle demonstrated us willingness to engage them on nato in the runup to the presidential elections and beyond end comment 10 u this message was cleared by ambassador nuland please visit
