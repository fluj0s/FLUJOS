certain exclusive rights of ownership in their creative works however the fair use doctrine in copyright law allows under certain circumsta nces the unauthorized use of copyrighted works originating under common law the fair use doctrine was codified in the copyright act of 1976 under the fair use doctrine four criteria are considered in the determination of whether the unauthorized use of work is fair use or whether it is an infringing use 1 the amount and character of the use 2 the nature of the copyrighted work 3 the amount copied in relation to the whole copyrighted work and 4 the effect of the copying on the potential market for the copyrighted work the courts have scrutinized the factual circumstances and applied these criteria on casebycase basis the internet is cooperative network

internet as result of the use of copyrighted materials placed on the internet various questions concerning the control ownership and fair use of copyrighted materials on the internet have arisen copyright owners have pursued their ownership rights against the unauthorized use of their works by service providers corporate users individual users and others generally speaking the american courts

copyrighted work 17 usc 411the copyright doctrine of fair use and the internet caselaw domestic case law has been developing which examines the copyright doctrine of fair use within the context of copyrighted works placed on the internet without the permission of the copyright owner various efforts are being undertaken by the courts congress and the industry to divide enforcement responsibilities and protection rights among the various interested parties the copyright owners the access providers web site operators and internet consumers1 generally speaking american courts have considered the placement or publication of copyrighted materials on the internet to be another form of expression or communication hence the courts have applied fair use legal analysis in internet cases similar to that applied with respect to more traditional forms of communication the report examines the statutory background and developmen t of the fair use doctrine in copyright law and its application to works placed on the internet background the copyright owner possesses various exclusive ownership rights in the work2 however the fair use doctrine permits under certain circumstances the unauthorized use of copyrighted works the doctrine which has its origins in common law was first codified in the copyright act of 19763 the statute provides four criteria for the determination of whether the unauthorized use of work is fair use or whether it is an infringing use4 these are 1 the amount and character of the use 2 the nature of the copryighted work 3 the amount copied in

their organizations such as universities national laboratories corporations and governments8 other individuals pay subscription fees to internet service providers like american online or compuserve which provide links to the internet9 the world wide web is the internets most popular application the growing number of web sites and bulletin boards10 provides great distribution capabilities for all types of material since computers can reproduce virtually perfect copies of copyrighted works including text audio and video the internet provides the potential for distributing and redistributing replicas of copyrighted material to large numbers of internet users the technological achievements of the internet have greatly increased the possibilities for copyright infringement11 internet users who view information and download that information are copying if the material that is being copied is copyrighted the possibility of infringement may rest upon an application of the fair use doctrine to the circumstances surrounding the unauthorized use of the material12 by viewing materials on the internet there is fixation of materials on computers random access memory ram this fixation in the

that the owner would expect other internet users to read and download the copyrighted work legal complications arise when persons other than the copyright owner publish the copyrighted works on the internet case law and the internet american courts have been seeking equitable resolutions to copyright infringement actions over the unauthorized use of copyrighted works on the internet court decisions applying the fair use principles to internet use provide some legal guidance however case law precedent is still developing and certain issues remain unresolved still the most recent cases have continued the traditional application of the fair use principles to internet use of copyrighted materials an early case that dealt with the fair use principles and online services involved an electronic bulletin board which was open to the public14 the scheme involved the electronic exchange of copyrighted sega video games through the bulletin board the bulletin board operators asserted fair use defense which was based upon the argument that the operators themselves did not download or retain copies of any sega video games the court applied the four fair use factors to this situation and rejected the defendants fair use defense the court determined that the use was for commercial purposeto download the copyrighted games so as to avoid their purchase from the copyright owner considering the nature of the copyrighted work the court observed that the work involved creativity fiction and fantasy since the entire work was copied the third factorthe amount of the work used favored the plaintiffs claim in considering the fourth factor the effect of copying on the potentia l market the court concluded that the unauthorized copying of the copyrighted works would adversely impact the potential market as few persons would purchase the copyrighted works if they were available through the bulletin board hence the court concluded that all four factors favored the plaintiff and that the defendants unauthorized use of the copyrighted works was an infringing use another subsequent decision which dealt with the fair use doctrine and internet use involved the same parties and similar factual situation15 the court applied the four fair use factors to the facts at hand16 after balancing all of the factors the court reached the same conclusion as in the earlier decision finding that the fair use doctrine did not apply17 several online cases have involved the unauthorized use of certain written works of l ron hubbard founder of scientology the simplified factual situation concern ing these cases follows in unrelated litigation the religious technology center rtc attempted to seal an affidavit concerning church ideology lermaahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30495crs4

oct 4 1996former follower of hubbardobtained the affidavit and published it on the internet through his internet access providerdigital gateway systems dgs the rtc brought an infringement action against lerma dgs the washington post and others another series of cases involved the rtc bringing an action for copyright infringem ent against former ministererlichfor posting on an internet bulletin board certain materials containing hubbards published and unpublished works the rtc also named as defendants the bulletin board operator klemesrud and the internet access providernetcom these cases are summarized below in religious technology center v lerma18 the court dealt primarily with rtcs infringement action against the post certain reporters and lerma this case did not deal chiefly with the internet or online aspects of fair use the action was based primarily upon the unauthorized dissemination of information owned by the rtc and did not address the substantive copyright issues19 in another case involving the rtcs infringement action the same defendants moved for summary judgment and the district court concluded that the fair use doctrine was applicable to the post and its reporters20 in reaching this conclusion the court examined the four fair use factors and applied them in traditional copyright analysis the court concluded that the purpose and character of the use of the material was for news gathering and this favored the defendants in evaluating the nature of the work the court deemed it to be informational rather than creative and that broader fair use approach was appropriate the court determined that the amount of the work used in relation to its entirety was not significant finally the court found that the unauthorized use did not adversely impact the market value of the material the court concluded that the unauthorized use of the copyrighted material by the post and by its reporters was fair use in an unpublished opinion the court subsequently examined the copyright infringement claim against lerma21 lerma first argued that the disputed works were not copyrightable the court rejected this argument he next raised the fair use defense for his unauthorized use of the copyrighted works after examining each of the four fair use factors the court concluded that lermas use could not be construed as fair use finally lerma argued that the rtc misused the copyright the court concluded that the rtc had not misused its copyright and that lermas unauthorized use of the material was an infringing use the rtc was awarded 2500 in statutory damages in another series of cases the rtc brought actions against erlich the former minister the bulletin board operator and the internet access provider in two separate opinions the district court for the northern district of california addressedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30495crs5 22 the court examined other issues such as trade secret and tort claims which are not discussed in

therefore the court did not utilize the fair use analysisvarious copyright issues including fair use22 erlich did not dispute that he copied the works he advanced fair use defense23 the court granted in part the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction against erlich and concluded that his use of the rtcs materials was unlikely to qualify as fair use in evaluating erlichs purpose and character of the use the court determined that it was for criticism or comment and was thus for noncommerc ial use therefore the fair use factor was held to be slightly in erlichs favor24 in looking at the nature of the copyrighted work the court considered that some of the works were published while others were unpublished the court determined that the unauthorized use of the unpublished works favored the plaintiffs in assessing the third factor the court favored the plaintiffs as for the potential market for the work the court concluded that erlichs use would not have an adverse effect on the market the court engaged in an equitable balancing of the factors and found that erlich could not assert fair use defense for his copying25 in religious technology center v netcom online commu26 another action involving the rtc and erlichs access provider and the bulletin board the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings and denied the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction the district court applied the fair use analysis to the action of the internet access provider netcom the court determined that the access provider was not liable for direct infringement rather the court examined it as case of contributory infringement on the part of netcom and determined that the plaintiffs raised genuine issue of fact concerning netcoms contributory infringement27 although netcom was commercial enterprise the court found that its use of copyrighted work was of different nature than the plaintiffs use in looking at the nature of the copyrighted works the court determined that netcoms use of the works was merely to facilitate their posting to the bulletin boardan entirely different use from the use of plaintiffs and therefore favored netcom regarding the amount of the copyrighted work copied the court determined that netcom copied more of the plaintiffs work than was necessary to function thus this factor did not favor the plaintiffs the court concluded that the postings on the internet by netcom raised genuine factual issue as to whether the market for plaintiffs works was diminished because the court was not able to make determination concerning the fourth fair use factorthe market harmthe court decided that the fair use defense was not available to netcom on motion for summary judgment28 in conclusion the court determined that there were issues of fact to be determined in the case and that fair use defense was not available for netcom on summary

illinois ruled that an internet service provider was not liable for direct copyright infringement despite the fact that materials were directly copied on web site that the service provider maintained for subscriber29 however the internet subscriber was found to have infringed certain copyrighted clip art images by using them on the internet the court concluded that the subscribers use of the clip art was primarily for commercial uses for promoting his organization and for generating revenue hence the fair use defense was not available for the defendant and the unauthorized use of the clip art on the internet was found to be an infringing use in 1998 the same courtthe us district court for the northern district of illinoisreached finding of infringement in similar case involving the use of shareware copyrighted software which is loaned to potential purchasers under certain conditions30 the court went through an extensive fair use analysis within the context of shareware31 in another case concerning fair use and the internet still images taken from copyrighted videotape of celebrity couple engaging in sexual activity were placed on the internet without the couples permission applying the fair use doctrine to rather complex factual situation the us district court for the central district of california held that the unauthorized placement on the internet of still images from copyrighted videotape was not fair use32 the court considered each fair use factor within the context of the factual situation33 the us district court for the eastern district of texas examined unique case where the plaintiffs copyrighted worksmodel legal codeshad been adopted as municipal laws by various communities34 the defendant then posted these copyrighted works on the internet and was sued for infringement the court applied the fair use analysis to the factual situation at hand and determined that the fair use defense was not applicable in this situation35 hence the posting of certain copyrighted model codes even when they had been adopted as municipal laws or ordinances did not lose their copyright protection and could not be posted on the internet without the permission of the copyright owner in kelly v arriba soft corp 36 the court examined the fair use doctrine within the context of visual search engine on the internet the defendants visual search engine allows

inc v shawn c reimerdes 82 fsupp 2d 211 sdny 2000inquiry37 the plaintiff argued that the use of the thumbnail copyrighted pictures obtained through the visual search was an infringement of his copyright interest the court undertook an extensive fair use evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the visual search engine and the unauthorized use of the copyrighted photographs38 the court weighed all of the fair use factors together and determined that the defendants use of the copyrighted photographs as part of their visual search engine was fair use of the plaintiffs images39 the posting of copyrighted news articles on the internet has been the subject of recent litigation40 the defendant posted copyrighted articles from newspapers on an internet bulletin board website so that visitors to the site could comment and criticize the articles applying the fair use factors to the instant case the court determined that the defendants posting of full length copyrighted articles on the internet was not fair use of the copyrighted material the court noted that the website operator could have avoided infringement if summaries of the articles had been posted or if hyperlinks to the articles on the newspapers own websites had been provided the practice of streamingthe visual transmission of copyrighted television programmingon the internet was the subject of recent action the defendant was transmitting portions of the plaintiffs copyrighted programming on the internet the plaintiff sought and received temporary restraining order41 the us district court for the western district of pennsylvania did not examine the fair use doctrine or any other copyright defenses in its opinion in recent litigation several motion picture studios brought an action to prevent the defendants from providing computer program on their web sites that allowed users to decrypt and copy the plaintiffs copyrighted motion pictures from digital versatile disks42 although the defendants argued that their activities were within the fair use exception the court rejected this defense and granted the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction conclusion these cases have illustrated the judicial processthe equitable balancingthat courts undertake in their evaluation of fair use claims it appears that the courts are using the same analysis and criteria for internet litigation as they have with other intellectual property determinations the courts have examined in detail the factual situation surrounding the litigation and they have applied each of the fair use criteriahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30495crs8 to the casebycase circumstances the courts then evaluate or weigh the statutory criteria and determine whether on balance the evidence favors finding of fair use of the copyrighted material or not while these cases provide judicial precedent the use of copyrighted materials on the internet is not entirely resolved factual circumstances may change the judicial outcome in various situations in addition various areas of fair use litigation and the internet may still be developing among these subject areas are possible liability for internet server and bulletin board providers whether online use is legally distinguishable from the use of the printed form unintended or unintentional use of copyrighted materials use of materials by schools and libraries and other issues
