control and w enforcement act amended the higher education act hea to exclude individuals w ho were incarcerated in state or federal penal institution from receivi ng federal pell grants since the

of 1972 pl 92318 the pell grant is awarded to undergraduate students on need basis and is intended to serve as the foundation of all federal student aid awarded the size of the award is primarily based upon the individual students and where appli cable their familys ability to contribute to the costs of their education1 students who are incarcerated in state or federal penal institution are

general accounting office gao pell grants for prison inmates hehs94224r letter of aug 5 1994 7 ibidbackground prior to 1992 individuals who were in carcerated and pursuing postsecondary education were eligible to receive pell grant in the 1992 amendments to the higher education act hea pl 102325 congre ss prohibited persons who were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of pa role and those who were sentenced to death from receiving pell grant persons who were incarcerated and not serving life sentences without the possibility of parole or sentenced to death remained eligible for pell grants however the only permissible expenses were tuition fees books and supplies room and board could not be covered several proponents of the ne w provisions maintained that prisoners who were sentenced to death or life without the possibility of parole would never reenter society thus there was need to educate them in addition the oppositions argument that education reduced r ecidivism was not applicable to individuals with life sentences or those who had received the death penalty in 1994 the violent crime control and law enforcement act pl 103322 amended the hea and completely eliminated pell grant eligibility for persons incarcerated in state or federal penal institution3 during the passage of the 1994 violent crime control and law enforcement act many argued that providing pell grants to prisoners was displacing more deserving students from the program but in fact in any given award year funds are available to ensure that all elig ible students attending eligible institutions receive pell grant4 therefore the number of prisoners receiving grant does not affect the number of gran ts available to nonincarcerated students nevertheless an overall increase in pell grant recipients does increase the total costs of the program and would increase the cost of raising the size of the maximum grant5 previous participation prior to the enactment of the 1994 violen t crime control and law enforcement act prisoner participation in the pell grant program was very minimal it is estimated that in the 19931994 program award year approx imately 23000 prisoners out of 4 million total pell grant recipients partic ipated in the pell grant program6 furthermore the general accounting office gao estimated that during this same program year inmates received 35 million of the 6 billion awarded in grants this represented less than 1 most inmates who participated in the pell grant program were enrolled in programs of at least two years but less than four ears in duration conducte d by public postsecondary institutions7 for example local community college might conduct program in prisonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21785crs3 8 the bill was introduced in the house on oct 29 2003 and referred to the subcommittee on 21st century competitiveness in nov 2003 there has been further action since 9 according to representative keller this past year 54 violent sexual predators in florida obtained over 200000 in pell grants at taxpayers xpense they got free ride by exploiting loophole that is they were involuntarily c onfined in something called civil

additional information regarding civil commitment see crs report rl30890 sex offender registration issues and legislation by alison m siskin and david teasleyprior legislative action since the initial enactment of the prohibition of pell grants for prisoners policy makers have continued to bate some issues for exam ple opponents contend that the elimination of pell grants has resulted in an increase in recidivism because inmates longer have the means to pay for their education the proponents of the prohibition maintain that education is luxury and pris oners should not be eligible to receive pell grant especially considering funds for th program are limited si nce the initial passage of the prohibition various members have introduced legislation to amend andor liminate this provision this section presents br ief discussion of prio r legislative activity during the 108th congress representative ric keller introduced the financial aid for sex offenders act hr 33858 which prohibited sex offe nders confined to civil commitment facilities from r eceiving pell grants or federal student loans9 at present the hea does not define either imprisonment or penal institution as result of the absence of definition it is not clear how to apply the current provisions of the hea to civil commitment facilities thes facilities present an unusual set of circumstances with regard to the inmates who enroll in pos tsecondary institution and apply for pell grant10 these facilities are considered mental health facilities by the states and courts and are usually managed by the states health or social rvice agency as opposed to corrections department because the pers on being treated in the facility has been sentenced to reside in the facility and cannot leave until he is permitted to do so many argue that civil commitment centers function as prisons
