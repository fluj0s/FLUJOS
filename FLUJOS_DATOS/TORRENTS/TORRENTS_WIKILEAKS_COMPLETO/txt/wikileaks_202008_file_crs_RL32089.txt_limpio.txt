friend of the recipient serves as the representative payee other individuals and organizations that may serve as representative payees include members of community organizations public agencies or nonprofit institutions that have custody of the recipient noncustodial federal institutions and private forprofit organizations licensed under state law that have custody of the recipient8 ssa is required to reissue benefits misused by an individual or organizational representative payee if the commissioner of social security hereafter referred to as the commissioner finds that ssa negligently failed to investigate or monitor the payee pl 108203 eliminates the requirement that reissuance be subject to finding of negligence on the part of ssa under the new law ssa is required to reissue any payments misused by an organizational payee or by an individual payee representing 15 or more recipients such payments may be reissued directly to the recipient or to an alternative representative payee the misuse of benefits occurs when payments are used by the representative payee for purposes other than the use and benefit of the recipient the commissioner is authorized to prescribe by regulation the meaning of the term use and benefit before enactment of pl 108203 representative payees were not liable for misused funds pl 108203 makes individual payees and nongovernmental organizational payees those other than federal state and local government agencies liable for the reimbursement of misused funds such funds are treated as overpayments to the representative payee not the recipient making them subject to overpayment recovery procedures specified in the social security act 8 for more information see ssa office of the inspector general organizational representative payee program testimony by inspector general james g huse jr before the senate special committee on aging may 2 2000 and testimony by susan daniels deputy commissioner disability and income security programs before the house committee on ways and means subcommittee on social security may 4 2000 crs4 although an individual may not charge fee for serving as representative payee certain organizations such as department of veterans affairs hospitals nursing homes and nonprofit agencies may charge fee for serving in this capacity the fee is based on statutory formula and deducted from the recipients benefit payment pl 108203 requires such organizations to forfeit fee payments for any month for which the commissioner or court of jurisdiction finds that the organization misused all or part of recipients benefit the commissioner may impose civil monetary penalty and an assessment on persons who knowingly provide false information or knowingly withhold information to obtain social security benefits the civil monetary penalty may be up to 5000 for each violation and the assessment may be up to twice the amount of benefits wrongfully paid to the individual pl 108203 clarifies that such penalties may be imposed on persons who withhold information that they know or should have known affects their eligibility status or benefit amount in addition it requires the commissioner to issue receipt to recipients upon notification of changes in recipients work or earnings status until ssa has implemented centralized computer file to record when such changes are reported the new law imposes the same penalties on representative payees who misuse benefits ie civil monetary penalty of up to 5000 for each violation and an assessment of up to twice the amount of misused benefits before enactment of pl 108203 nongovernmental feeforservice organizational payees were required to be bonded or licensed but they were not required to submit proof of such certification pl 108203 requires such representative payees to be bonded and licensed if licensing is available in the state and to submit proof of such certification annually along with copy of any independent audit performed on the organization since the previous certification in addition to existing periodic onsite reviews of state institutions the new law requires periodic onsite reviews of individual representative payees who serve 15 or more recipients nongovernmental feeforservice organizational payees and any other agency that serves as representative payee for 50 or more recipients it also requires the commissioner to submit an annual report to congress on the findings of such reviews including problems identified and any action taken or planned to correct them individuals are disqualified from serving as representative payee if they have been convicted of fraudulent conduct involving social security programs pl 108 203 extends the restriction to individuals convicted of an offense under federal or state law that results in imprisonment for more than 1 year unless the commissioner determines that the individuals designation as representative payee would be appropriate despite the conviction and to individuals fleeing prosecution custody or confinement for felony the new law requires the commissioner to prepare report on the adequacy of existing procedures and reviews representative payees are required to complete an annual accounting report that describes how recipients benefits have been used if misuse is suspected report may be requested by the commissioner at any time pl 108203 authorizes the commissioner to require representative payee to collect the recipients benefits in person at local ssa office if heshe fails to submit annual accounting reports crs5 claimant representatives social security and ssi disability claimants may choose to have an attorney or other qualified individual represent them in proceedings before ssa the representative may charge fee for hisher services but the fee must be authorized by ssa under the fee petition process or the fee agreement process under the fee petition process the representative must file fee petition with ssa after work on claim is completed copy must be sent to the claimant ssa determines the amount of the fee which is limited to 25 of past due benefits awarded based on factors that include the complexity of the case and the type of services performed by the representative under the more simplified fee agreement process the representative and the claimant must file written fee agreement with ssa before decision on the claim is made the representatives fee is limited to the lesser of 25 of pastdue benefits awarded or 5300 if social security claimant is awarded pastdue benefits and hisher representative is an attorney ssa withholds the attorneys fee from the benefit award and pays the attorney directly to cover administrative costs associated with the direct fee payment process ssa charges an assessment equal to 63 of the attorneys fee and deducts that amount from the attorneys fee payment9 before enactment of pl 108203 if the representative was not an attorney or the claim was for ssi benefits ssa would pay the total benefit award to the claimant and the representative would collect hisher fee from the recipient pl 108203 temporarily extends the attorney fee payment process to certain nonattorney representatives10 and to ssi claims caps the assessment on direct fee payment at 75 increased each year thereafter with the rate of inflation and requires gao to study the fee payment process for claimant representatives11 before enactment of pl 108203 ssa was required to recognize as claimant representative any attorney currently licensed to
