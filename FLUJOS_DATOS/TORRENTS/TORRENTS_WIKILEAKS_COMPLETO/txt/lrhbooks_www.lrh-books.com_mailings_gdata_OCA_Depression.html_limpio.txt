120 million people according to the world health organization who the symptoms of depression include feeling sad or down losing interest in usual activities feeling guilty worthless or hopeless or having sleeplessness and lack of energy this means that practically every person on this planet suffers at one point or another from depression harvard university psychiatrist joseph glenmullen says the questionnaire of symptoms used to diagnose depression may look scientific but when one examines the questions asked and the scales used they are utterly subjective measures the depression screening in the general community has undoubtedly influenced the 60 million prescriptions for antidepressants written in the us about 10 of the american population including 15 million children allen j frances professor of psychiatry at duke university medical center writes psychiatrys claim that mental illnesses are brain diseasesis not true there are objective diagnostic tests to confirm or disconfirm the diagnosis of depressionthere is blood or other biological test to ascertain the presence or absence of mental illness as there is for most bodily diseases if such test were developedthen the condition would cease to be mental illness and would be classified instead as symptom of bodily disease while there has been shortage of biochemical explanations for psychiatric conditions glenmullen is emphatic not one has been proven quite the contrary in every instance where such an imbalance was thought to have been found it was later proven false according to elliot s valenstein phd and author of blaming the brain the theories are held onto not only because there is nothing else to take their place but also because they are useful in promoting drug treatment as with any condition treating only the symptoms not the cause has real longterm benefits with the current mainstream treatments it seems therefore that safe effective therapy exists however it is not
