wellsuited to adjust to the evolving correlates of power in asia the region is now facing an array of changes deepening trade links the formation of new regional institutions and increased attention to the threat of islamic terrorism some analysts have questioned whether us security interests are best served by the existing framework of bilateral alliances while others believe the basic architecture is sound and may only require some relatively minor changes andor additions to meet emerging challenges calls for revision of americas security architecture in asia may be reaction to the development of new regional groups that exclude the united states the goals of americas strategic architecture in asia have traditionally included preventing the dominance of asia by any single power or coalition of powers maintaining system of alliances to facilitate the projection of american power when needed and securing sea lanes of communication to facilitate american commercial access and the free ﬂow of trade in the region american power can also be used to promote american values such as democratic governments or provision of humanitarian and disaster

attracting regional states with its economic power and is offering competing vision to the uscentric hub and spoke system of alliances in essence chinas increasing economic diplomatic and military strength is compelling countries to rethink existing security arrangements and take initial steps that may lead to the formation of regional groupings of nations with common interests and values at the same time the bush administration has pursued stronger defense relations with australia japan and india bilateral defense ties have also developed between canberra tokyo and new delhi with varying degrees of engagement fledgling initiatives for trilateral efforts among the nations have emerged some defense planners see these efforts as building on existing security cooperation to further us goals in the region by combining forces among partners and allies as trilateral initiatives have taken shape some officials have begun promoting quadrilateral grouping which would tie together the united states japan austra lia and india although formal quadrilateral groupings exist the malabar 07 military exercises among the four countries in september 2007 provided an opportunity to test naval cooperation some observers caution that moving forward too fast with such grouping could trigger negative response from china pursuit of multilateral security arrangements holds number of potential challenges and opportunities for the united states of the four leaders who championed the trilateral and quadrilateral groupings two left office in 2007 and two face significant political challenges japans constitutional restraints on military involvement may limit the scope of its cooperation and both australia and india have some degree of reluctance to fully engage in any forum that might alienate beijing increasing capabilities among likeminded nations could enhance stability and provide platform for responding to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies in the region or to potential aggression by other countries but it also risks threatening china potentially spurring dangerous countermeasures finally there is the risk that other asian allies such as south korea thailand and the philippines could feel excluded from multilateral initiatives among the united states japan australia andor india this report may not be updated

accommodated in way that preserves us interests and values in the region in essence chinas increasing economic diplomatic and military strength is compelling countries to rethink existing security arrangements and take initial steps that may lead to the formation of regional groupings of nations with common interests and values the impetus behind these initiatives stems from three sources first economic forces of trade and investment in asia have largely been generated by private business interests in an increasingly globalized world national governments have widened the paths already established by trade and investment flows by concluding freetrade and other regional economic agreements second diplomatic initiatives to increase political cooperation among states are generated by national governments seeking to protect their national interests and achieve national goals the resulting regional organizations have provided venue for facetoface meetings and dialogue but harmonizing political interests among asian nations has been considerably more complicated than reducing trade and investment barriers through freetrade agreements third security and military cooperation stems primarily from national perceptions of security threatsboth current and future much of this military cooperation can be conducted under the radar using the guise of military exercises to test interoperability and communications there are signs that regional states anticipate fading of american influence in the region relative to the rise of china 6 this is partially driven by negative opinions of us foreign policy despite recent american initiatives some analysts beli eve that asia is turning away from the united states and that while the us retains great influence in the region this will not last given current trends7 fundamental restructuring of american foreign policy priorities and mechanisms may in the view of some be necessary in order for americas poor public perception in the region to be changed g17g157g145g142g155g561g9g142g152g153g152g149g146g157g146g140g138g149g561g5g145g138g149g149g142g151g144g142g156g561 beyond rising

democratic states of asia in early 2007 vice president dick cheney proposed the idea that india join the trilateral group to make quadrilateral group of likeminded democratic states9 in may 2007 representatives from the united states india japan and australia reportedly met on the margins of the asean regional forum meeting in the first exploratory meeting to discuss quadrilateral ties10 beijing is thought to be suspicious of such developments an d fears that they are aimed at the containment of china china issued formal diplomatic protests to australia japan and india out of concern that they were forming security alliance with the united states against china11 the us force structure is shifting to adapt to regional developments in the asia pacific us forces have been shifted to guam as plans have moved forward to reposition and reduce the us military posture in japan and in south korea12 the us military buildup on guam can serve to maintain us military deterrence and warfighting capabilities for number of potential conflict scenarios in the asiapacific region g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g20g152g149g142g561 currently the congressional role is primarily in oversight and monitoring of developments in asia and in ensuring that us interests are protected as the new asian security architecture evolves the policy questions revolve mainly around intensity how much effort and budget to devote to asia compared with that going to other regions of the world and inclusiveness which countries to include the intensity question seems particularly pertinent now since much of asia perceives that us attention is overly focused on iraq and terrorism while china is quietly using its economic muscle and diplomatic charm to draw asian nations more into its sphere of influence the inclusiveness issue also seems pertinent given the historical us reliance on the hub and spoke system of military alliances the fear by china of encirclement and the widely held precept that more democratic nations are less likely to pose security threat to the united states other relevant congressional involvement includes the passage of bill in 2006 that calls for the appointment of an overall us ambassador to asean as well as the need for senate ratification of the usaustralia treaty on defense trade cooperation

arrangement facilitates practical cooperation and provides substance to memorandum of understanding on defence cooperation signed during prime minister howards visit to india in 2006 37 such an initiative can be viewed as part of indias desire to play larger role in asian affairs beyond south asia and the northern reaches of the indian ocean and to begin to shape its geopolitical environment within larger asian context38 it also appears to be part of an indian strategy to balance the rise of china in asia by drawing others in39 while australia has sought greater cooperation with new delhi

forward thinking and open to active and engaged partnerships and cooperation with key regional states while not pushing such cooperation to the point that it is destabilizing or unattractive to regional states such cooperation could better position the united states and likeminded countries to look after their shared interests through focus on capacity building wh ile not being formalized in way that such cooperation appears to be aimed at containing china an agenda aimed at the containment of china is not likely to attract regional states and could create hostile security environment in asia that would likely undermine us and others interests the united states must be particularly careful not to isolate other existing allies such as south korea the philippines and thailand as it pursues new partnerships in asia some observers think that the election of lee myungbak as south korean president who is considered likely to improve relations with both the united states and japan
