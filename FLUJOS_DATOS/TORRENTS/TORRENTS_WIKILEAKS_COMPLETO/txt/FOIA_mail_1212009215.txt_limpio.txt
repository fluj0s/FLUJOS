from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to tosbornueaacukpalmer dave mr lib davidpalmerueaacuk subject re fw your ref foi_0823 ipcc 2007 wgi chapter 6 assessment process foi_0823 date wed 28 may 2008 171335 0100 cc briffa keith prof kbriffaueaacuk mcgarvie michael mr mmcgarvieueaacuk dave although requests 1 and 2 are for the ipcc so irrelevant to uea keith or you dave could say that for 1 keith didnt get any additional comments in the drafts other than those supplied by ipcc on 2 keith should say that he didnt get any papers through the ipcc processeither i was doing different chapter from keith and i didnt get any what we did get were papers sent to us directly so not through ipcc asking us to refer to them in the ipcc chapters if only holland knew how the process really worked every faculty member in env and all the post docs and most phds do but seemingly not holland so the answers to both 1 and 2 should be directed to ipcc but keith should say that he didnt get anything extra that wasnt in the ipcc comments as for 3 tim has asked caspar but caspar is one of the worse responders to emails known i doubt either he emailed keith or keith emailed him related to ipcc i think this will be quite easy to respond to once keith is back from looking at these questions and the climate audit web site this all relates to two papers in the journal climatic change i know how keith and tim got access to these papers and it was nothing to do with ipcc cheers phil at 2347 27052008 tim osborn wrote dear dave re david hollands followup requests these followup questions appear directed more towards keith than to but keith may be unavailable for few days due to family illness so ill attempt brief response in case keith doesnt get chance to items 1 and 2 concern requests that were made by the ipcc technical support unit hosted by ucar in the usa and any responses would have been sent direct to the ipcc technical support unit to the email address specified in the quote included in item 2 these requests are therefore irrelevant to uea item 3 well send the same enquiry to ammann as we sent to our other colleagues and let you know his response item 3 also asks for emails from the journal climatic change that discuss any matters in relation to the ipcc assessment process i can confirm that i have not received any such emails or other documents i expect that similar answer will hold for keith since i cannot imagine that the editor of journal would be contacting us about the ipcc process best wishes tim on tue may 27 2008 630 pm palmer dave mr lib wrote gents please note the response received today from mr holland could you provide input as to his additional questions 1 and 2 and check with mr ammann in question 3 as to whether he believes his correspondence with us to be confidential although i fearanticipate the response i believe that i should inform the requester that his request will be over the appropriate limit and ask him to limit it the ico guidance states 12 if an authority estimates that complying with request will exceed the cost limit can advice and assistance be offered with view to the applicant refocusing the request in such cases the authority is not obliged to comply with the request and will issue refusal notice included within the notice which must state the reason for refusing the request provide details of complaints procedure and contain particulars of section 50 rights could be advice and assistance relating to the refocusing of the request together with an indication of the information that would be available within the cost limit as required by the access code this should not preclude other verbal contact with the applicant whereby the authority can ascertain the requirements of the applicant and the normal customer service standards that the authority usually adopts and our own code of practice states annex c point 5 5 where the uea is not obliged to supply the information requested because the cost of doing so would exceed the appropriate limit ie cost threshold and where the uea is not prepared to meet the additional costs itself it should nevertheless provide an indication of what information could be provided within the cost ceiling this is based on the lord chancellors code of practice which contains virtually identical provision in effect we have to help the requester phrase the request in such way as to bring it within the appropriate limit if the requester disregards that advice then we dont provide the information and allow them to proceed as they wish i just wish to ensure that we do as much as possible by the book in this instance as i am certain that this will end up in an appeal with the statutory potential to end up with the ico cheers dave
