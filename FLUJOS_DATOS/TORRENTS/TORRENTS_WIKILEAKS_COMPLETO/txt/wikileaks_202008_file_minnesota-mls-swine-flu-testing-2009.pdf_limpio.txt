were identified through routine influenza surveilla nce seven cases had self limited febrile respiratory illness and were seen on an outpatient basis only one case was hospitalized but for other reasons three were adu lts and 5 were children none d significant exposure to swine all 8 had viruses with identical genetic sequences that contain unique combination of gene segments previously not seen in humans or swine in the us th viruses that were tested were found to be resistant to amantadine and rimandatine and sen sitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir clinicians in minnesota evaluating patients with resp iratory symptoms who have traveled recently 7 days to or had contact with ill pers ons from san diego or imperial c ounties in california san antonio texas or mexico should consider
