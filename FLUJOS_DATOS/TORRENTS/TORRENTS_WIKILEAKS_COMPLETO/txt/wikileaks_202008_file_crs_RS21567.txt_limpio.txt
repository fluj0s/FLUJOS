home mortgages announced in january 2003 that its financial reports for the past three years would have to be restated the reaction was mild the markets assumed that interpretations of complex accounting rules were at issue rather than fundamental economic problems at freddie mac on june 9 2003 without providing any new information about the nature of the accounting issues freddie dismissed its top three executives including ceo leland brendsel this action raised the specter of an enronlike financial scandal and freddies stock price plunged by nearly 20 subsequent report to freddies board of directors found that accounting controls had been weak and that certain accounting decisions and market transactions had been implemented to smooth out or reduce volatility in reported earnings on august 21 2003 the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo recommended that crs2 freddies replacement ceo be fired on the grounds that he had been involved in the accounting problems greg parseghian was removed by freddies board and was replaced in december 2003 by richard f syron on november 21 2003 the restatement of past accounting results was released1 as summarized in the table below it is noteworthy that while the net effect of the restatement was to increase reported earnings restated net income for 2001 was almost 1 billion less than originally reported

28990 5198 24629 31330 6701 source freddie mac press release november 21 2003 the restatement does not end the companys accounting uncertainties freddie mac which is exempt from the registration and disclosure requirements that apply to other companies that sell stock to the public committed itself in 2002 to voluntary compliance with securities and exchange commission sec disclosure standards in its restatement freddie announced that it would begin voluntary sec reporting as soon as possible after the companys return to timely reporting this has not happened yet but the current projection is to begin filing timely quarterly reports by the end of 2007 freddie filed its 2006 annual report on march 23 2007 in timely fashion background freddie mac is gse that plays an important role in the secondary mortgage market like fannie mae2 its rival gse freddie buys mortgages from lenders and repackages them in the form of securities which it may hold or sell to public investors freddie finances its purchases of mortgage loans by selling bonds either bonds backed by its own financial resources called straight debt or mortgagebacked securities where interest 1 see httpwwwfreddiemaccomnewsarchivesinvestors2003restatement_112103html 2 freddie mac was formally chartered as the federal home loan mortgage corporation and fannie mae as the federal national mortgage association the abbreviated forms are now the official corporate names crs3 and principal payments made by homeowners are passed through to holders of the bonds as gses fannie and freddie are exempt from state and local taxes from certain regulatory requirements and have line of credit with the us treasury their most significant advantage however is what is called the implicit guarantee although the bonds they sell are not formally backed by the full faith and credit of the us government market participants behave as though they are because the markets do not believe that the treasury would allow fannie or freddie to default the gses are able to sell bonds at lower interest rates than other financial institutions more than 60 of all single family mortgage debt has been sold in the secondary market or securitized as the leading players in this market the housing gses represent an extraordinary concentration of financial risk because there is strong public interest in ensuring that freddie and fannie remain financially strong congress in 1992 created ofheo safety and soundness regulator dedicated exclusively to these two institutions the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s illustrated the riskiness of the mortgage market if interest rates rise financial institutions may find that their cost of funds httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21567 exceeds their income from longterm fixedrate mortgages if rates fall homeowners refinance their mortgages and reduce income streams to institutions which must still pay off debt previously issued at higher interest rates protection from interest rate risk is critical to the soundness of the gses and it appears that strategies to avoid or hedge risk were partly responsible for freddies recent accounting problems freddie macs accounting problems appendix ii to freddie macs november 21 2003 restatement discusses the accounting errors that made revision necessary the basic factors underlying the accounting errors were lack of sufficient accounting expertise and internal control and management weaknesses in addition certain transactions and accounting policies were implemented to achieve steady growth in reported earnings the two accounting policies that appear to have been most important in this regard yielding 88 of the upward revision in pretax net income are the classification of securities and accounting for derivatives instruments3 how these issues affect net earnings is discussed below between 2000 and 2003 interest rates fell dramatically mortgage rates from over 8 to as low as 52 the fall in rates had two major impacts on freddie macs financial statements both freddies bond portfolio and the derivatives contracts freddie had purchased to hedge the risk of falling interest rates4 increased sharply in value under 3 appendix ii p 2 available online at httpwwwfreddiemaccomnewsarchivesinvestors 2003restatement_112103html 4 derivatives are financial instruments whose value is linked to changes in some price or variable in this case interest rates to hedge against falling rates freddie purchased interest rate swaps in which freddie agreed to pay floatingrate interest to the swap dealer while the swap dealer agreed to pay freddie fixed rate of interest the size of the payments is calculated by reference to notional principal amount that does not actually change hands as rates fell continued crs4 generally accepted accounting principles gaap these gains in asset value should have been reported as current income however freddie chose accounting treatments for these asset gains that deferred recognition of income until later years thus smoothing out the effects of falling interest rates the restatement of earnings is based upon freddies and its new auditors decision that these accounting policies were incorrect much of freddies bond portfolio was held in an accounting category called held to maturity htm this meant that the bonds would not be sold and that therefore day today fluctuations in their market value were irrelevant all that mattered was the amount of principal and interest payments which was fixed and known in advance these bonds were carried on freddies balance sheet at historical cost which meant that increases in the bonds market value as interest rates fell after 2000 were essentially ignored and did not appear as current earnings however during the 20002002 period some of the bonds classified as htm were sold as result the restatement reclassifies much of the entire bond portfolio as available for sale afs and changes in market value are recognized gains in the bonds value over the period appear in the restated earnings as either current earnings or stockholders equity5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21567 derivatives accounting is governed by fas 133 of the financial accounting standards board fasb under fas 133 the fair value of all financial derivatives must be calculated markedtomarket at the end of each accounting period changes in fair value from the previous accounting period must be reported as current income unless the derivatives are used for hedging if derivative is used to hedge an asset the value of that asset the hedged item will move in the opposite direction to the derivatives value thus fall in the price of the hedged asset will be offset by gain in the derivative or vice versa under fas 133 the firm can recognize as earnings both the change in the derivatives value and the offsetting change in the hedged items if the gains and losses are closely correlated the net effect on reported earnings will be very small or zero there is another form of hedge accounting under fas 133 covering derivatives held to hedge future transaction or cash flow since the hedged item in this case does not yet exist it cannot be marked to market and used to offset gains in the derivatives fair value however fas 133 allows the gain or loss in derivative used to hedge future event to be assigned to comprehensive income subcategory of stockholders equity when the future transaction or cash flow occurs the derivative is marked to market and changes in fair value are recognized as current income but presumably gains or losses in the derivative will be offset by the hedged item either form of hedge accounting has the effect of reducing the impact of changes in derivatives fair value on current earnings and the bottom line to qualify for this accounting treatment however fasb requires that there be close relationship between changes in the value of the derivative and the hedged item derivatives that do not meet fasbs hedge test are considered speculative trading instruments and changes in fair value from period to period must be recognized and reported as current earnings 4 continued freddies floating rate obligation diminished while it continued to receive the fixed payment 5 stockholders equity is separate from current earnings it represents the proprietary interests of the owners stockholders of corporation or the goingconcern value of assets over liabilities crs5 freddie mac like most us corporations that use derivatives states in its annual reports that it does not use derivatives for speculative purposes in its restatement however freddie concludes that most of its derivatives in 2001 and 2002 did not qualify as accounting hedges this means that from gaap perspective these were speculative positions recognition of fair value gains and losses in derivatives positions resulted in an upward revision of pretax net earnings by 50 billion based on the november 21 2003 restatement the accounting treatments of derivatives and bond portfolios were the major factors in the restatement in both cases the drop in interest rates to 1950s levels produced unexpected windfall gains in the value of financial instruments freddie chose not to recognize these gains to avoid creating an impression of earnings volatility knowing that these gains would be reversed if the trend in interest rates turned upwards according to the june 25 statement accounting policies were designed with view to their effect on earnings in the context of freddie macs goal of achieving steady earnings growth in other words freddie sought to smooth out reported earnings and reduce volatility by deferring to future years earnings that should have been recognized under gaap as current income httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21567 an internal report to freddies board of directors issued in july 2003 provides further detail on specific transactions designed to defer earnings and produce the desired accounting results6 the report concludes that these transactions and the accompanying accounting policies indicated serious deficiencies in freddie macs internal controls disclosure practices and in the governance policy of former management the report notes however that these transactions do not appear to have been made at the expense of the companys risk management policies and practices7 in the november 21 2003 restatement freddie mac stated that it accepts the reports conclusions in november 2005 freddie announced that its reported income for the first half of 2005 would have to be restated and reduced by about 200 million because of problems in legacy computer system the june 25 2003 release noted several actions taken to fix weaknesses in accounting and management controls these include the expansion of senior accounting staff creation of an operating risk oversight unit and strengthening the review of accounting and other critical business operations in conjunction with ofheo freddie has embarked on comprehensive remediation program to effect broad changes in the finance function in 2006 freddie reported that its remediation effort had proved to be much more difficult and complex than expected among the areas where work continued were mitigation of identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies strengthening of the financial close process implementing critical systems initiatives and completion of review of the companys system of internal controls related to the processing and recording of the companys financial transactions in march 2007 the company filed its 6 baker botts llp report to the board of directors of the federal home loan mortgage corporation internal investigation of certain accounting matters december 10 2002 july 21 2003 107 p 7 ibid p iii crs6 2006 annual report and thus resumed timely annual reporting timely quarterly reporting was expected to resume by the end of 2007 freddie macs management and regulatory problems the smoothing out of reported earnings through questionable interpretations of gaap is normally regarded as violation of accounting rules the secs view is that if firm deals in volatile financial instruments that volatility should be fully reflected on its accounting statements in august 2004 freddie announced that an sec investigation was continuing involving possible violations of regulations involving fraud deceptive practices and insider trading in december 2003 ofheo settled its investigation with consent agreement freddie admitted to wrongdoing but agreed to pay 125 million fine in april 2006 freddie paid 410 million to settle class action suit brought by pension funds and other investors as result of stock losses stemming from the scandal in september 2005 freddie agreed to help federal investigators pursue former ceo httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21567 leland breindsel and former cfo vaughn clarke who were forced out in 2003 freddie also agreed to seek recovery of their severance pay and stock awards which totaled tens of millions of dollars if the regulators determine that misconduct was involved in the accounting scandal clarke and david glenn the former chairman settled ofheo charges by paying fines of 125000 in november 2007 ofheo announced settlement with brendsel he agreed to pay 25 fine to the government and to return to freddie mac 105 million in salary and bonuses there have been proposals to reform regulation of the housing gses two bills in the 110th congress hr 1427 passed by the house on may 22 2007 and s 1100 propose to restructure gse regulation8 the bills would replace ofheo with an independent agency with authority over fannie freddie and the federal home loan banks they would enhance the safety and soundness tools available to the gse regulator by giving it more flexibility to establish and enforce risk management operational and capital standards and authority to put gse into receivership if necessary the accounting scandal at freddie mac was followed by similar scandal at fannie mae in 2005 given the importance of fannie and freddie to housing finance and the financial system at large these deficiencies in accounting are troubling if freddies management cut corners with accounting rules to conceal an inconvenient excess of earnings how might it respond to shortfall in earnings that presaged serious trouble in the company an announcement that either fannie or freddie faced unexpected and undisclosed problems could trigger wide instability in debt markets the size of the housing gses and the volume of their debt securities held by other financial institutions make management and regulatory reform important public policy issues 8 for summary of the provisions of these bills see crs report rl33940 hr 1427 and s 1100 reforming the regulation of governmentsponsored enterprises by mark jickling edward vincent murphy and n eric weiss
