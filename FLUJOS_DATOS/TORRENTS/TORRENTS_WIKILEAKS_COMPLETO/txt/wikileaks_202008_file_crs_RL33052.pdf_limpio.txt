of the new regulations including those concerned with pay administration and performance management were not challenged the district court concluded that subpart of the new regulations which includes all of the labor management sections and section 9701706k6 which restricts the mspbs ability to modify penalties imposed by dhs must be enjoined the court maintained as currently proposed those provisions would violate certain specific requirements established by congress in the homeland security act they would not ensure collective bargaining would fundamentally alter federal labor

authority to develop new personnel system it indicates that the system must meet certain conditions for example the new system has to be flexible contemporary and may not waive modify or otherwise affect various provisions of law9 the act identifies specific chapters of title 5 us code that may not be waived by the new system10 while chapter 71 of such title which governs collective bargaining and labormanagement relations for most federal employees is not identified and thus can be waived by the new system the act includes other language that preserves some form of collective bargaining for dhs employees the new system shall ensure that employees may organize bargain collectively and participate through labor organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them subject to any exclusion from coverage or limitation on negotiability established by law11 congress did not define the term collective bargaining for purposes of the act and the unions maintained that the personnel system established by the agencies lacked the core elements of collective bargaining12 the new regulations recognize that each employee has the right to form join or assist any labor organization13 at the same time however the regulations limit the subjects that may be negotiated by the parties restrict the powers and duties of the federal labor relations authority flra and create homeland security labor relations board hslrb that will assume many of the flras functions14 in addition the regulations allow dhs to issue binding agency wide opinions without regard to the terms of collective bargaining agreement and permit dhs managers to take whatever other actions may be necessary to carry out the departments mission15 in their complaint the unions argued under the new regime management possesses an unlimited unilateral right to issue agencywide directives to take what few matters remain negotiable off the bargaining table andor to invalidate provisions of existing collective bargaining agreements 16 nevertheless in response to the unions concerns dhs and opm insisted that the regulations are necessary to ensure maximum flexibility and accountability17 9 see 5 usc 9701b13 10 see 5 usc 9701c2 11 5 usc 9701b4 12 see nteu 385 fsupp2d at 25 the plaintiff unions argue that every system of collective bargaining ever established by congress has had three critical components 1 requirement that labor and management bargain in good faith over conditions of employment for purposes of r eaching an agreement 2 provision that the agreements reached as result of bargaining are binding on both parties equally and 3 the establishment of neutral forum for resolving disputes 13 5 cfr 9701507 14 see crs report rl32255 homeland security final regulations for th

aside formal agency action if it is arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law18 in general court will review such action in accordan ce with twopart test established by the us supreme court in chevron usa v nrdc19 first the court will consider whether congress has spoken directly to the precise question at issue if congress has spoken directly to the question at issue the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress 20 second the court will analyze the reasonableness of the agencys interpretation if congress has failed to speak directly to the question at issue and the statute is silent or ambiguous the court will attempt to determine if the agencys actions are based on permissible construction of the statute21 if the agencys interpretation is reasonable the court may not substitute its own construction of the statutory provision however deference is not owed to the agencys actions if they construe statute in way that is contrary to congressional intent or that frustrates congressional policy 22 citing congressional understanding of what constitutes collective bargaining as evidenced by the federal sector labor management relations act23 and general contract principles the district court determined that the absence of an unmistakably enforceable contract rendered the regulations impermissible the sine qua non of goodfaith bargaining is an enfo rceable contract once the parties reach agreement the hr system does not lead to forceable contracts and thus fails to comply with the directions of congress to ensure employee collectivebargaining rights the regulations fail because any collective bargaining negotiations pursuant to its terms are illusory the secretary retains numerous avenues by which she can unilaterally declare contract terms null and void without prior notice to the unions or employees and without bargaining or recourse 24 the district court concluded that system of collective bargaining that permits the unilateral repudiation of agreements by one party is not collective bargaining at all25 consequently the district court maintained that chevron deference was due to dhs and opm because congress spoke directly to the issue of collective bargaining and directed the agencies to ensure collective bargaining for dhs employees the dc circuit citing the definition of collective bargaining in the federal sector labor management relations act affirmed the district courts holding that the regulations failed to comply with the mandate in the homeland security act codified at 5 usc 9701b4 that 18 5 usc 7062a 19 467 us 837 1984 20 id at 843 21 chevron 467 us at 84243 22 see id at 843 n9 the judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear cong ressional intent if court employing traditional tools of statutory construction ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise

collectively26 it agreed with the district court that the departments atte mpt to reserve to itself the right unilaterally to abrogate lawfully negotiated and executed agreements was plainly unlawful because abrogating them would nullify the acts specific guarantee of collective bargaining rights27 the dc circuit emphasized that its holding related only to the power of dhs to abrogate collectively bargained contracts that were executed pursuant to the human resources management system its holding did nothing to undercut the departments authority to supersede labor contracts inherited from the previously independent agencies that now constitute dhs 28 although the district court found that the new regulations failed adequately to allow collective bargaining it nevertheless maintained that limitations on the subjects that could be bargained were permissible acknowledging the broad authority granted to dhs and opm by the homeland security act the court reasoned that the agencies were entitled to chevron deference for their decisions that identified subjects for collective bargaining 29 the dc circuit reversed this holding insofar as it limited the scope of bargaining to employee specific personnel matters such as those that affect discipline discharge and promotion30 the district court erred the dc circuit maintained by giving precedence to the departments authority granted in the homeland security act to modify the provisions of chapter 71 of title 5 of the us code which relates to labormanagement relations over the command in another provision of the act codified in 5 usc 9701b4 which ensures the right of employees to bargain collectively 31 because the final regulations render meaningless collective bargaining which the homeland security act mandates that the department must observe the appeals court held that they are not entitled to deference32

of new entity the hslrb that will adjudicate disputes concerning the scope of bargaining and the duty to bargain in good faith conduct hearings and resolve complaints of specified unfair labor practices resolve exceptions to arbitration awards and resolve negotiation impasses 33 the unions argued that the hslrb was inconsistent with the traditional concept of collective bargaining34 in particular the unions questioned the independence of the hslrb whose members are to be selected by the secretary of homeland security the district court concluded that the unions concerns with the hslrb were based on policy choices made by dhs and opm rather than the agencies failure to appropriately implement the 26 nteu 452 f3d at 844 27 id see also 452 f3d at 85860 28 nteu 452 f3d at 860 29

and their ability to establish new personnel system that includes new labor relations entity by deliberately and clearly giving the agencies the authority to establish an hr system for dhs without reference to the flra or any other adjudicative system for labormanagement disputes congress left it to the executive branch to formulate that system35 unlike the district court the dc circuit did not defer to the judgment of dhs and opm but ruled that adjudicating the matter of the hslrb at this time would be premature it said that decision on the boards role would have to wait until dhs revises its board regulation in light of the decisions of the district court and the court of appeals relating to the role of the flra36

provide that the flra may conduct hearings and resolve complaints of specified unfair labor practices 37 in addition the regulations require the flra to review hslrb decisions and issue final decisions38 under the regulations the flra must defer to the findings of fact and interpretations made by the hslrb and sustain the hslrbs decision unless the party requesting review shows that the decision was either 1 arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law 2 based on error in applying the hslrbs procedures or 3 unsupported by substantial evidence 39 the unions argued that dhs and opm exceeded their statutory authority by dictating to the flra an independent agency the kinds of disputes it will or will not adjudicate and how it will do so40 the unions emphasized that the flras jurisdiction is established by statute and that its role and functions are not subject to the control of other executive branch agencies moreover congress did not confer additional jurisdiction upon the flra in the homeland security act although the district court acknowledged that dhs and opm could have waived the application of chapter 71 of title 5 us code and were not required to use the flra it concluded that the agencies could not commandeer the resources of an independent agency and fundamentally transform its functions absent clearer indication of congressional intent 41 the district court found that the regulations impose an appellate role that is foreign to the flra and require deferential standard of review that is at odds wi th the flras status as an independent agency42 the district court noted that an agencys interpretation of statute is not entitled to deference when it goes beyond the meaning that the statute can bear43 here the

agencies statutory authority under the homeland security act to modify or affect chapter 71 of title 5 us code the dc circuit affirmed this holding saying that nothing in the homeland security act authorizes the department to regulate the jurisdiction and activities of an independent agency44

the unions challenged the authority of dhs and op m in jointly issuing final dhs regulations to change the standard by which the mspb might mitigate the penalty for employee misconduct one of those regulations codified at 5 cfr 9701706k6 provides that the board may not modify penalty imposed by dhs unless it is so disproportionate to the basis for the action as to be wholly without justification and that when penalty is mitigated the maximum justifiable penalty must be applied the unions asserted that this regulation violates 5 usc 9701f2c provision of the homeland security act which provides that any regulations issued pursuant to section 9701 shall modify procedures under chapter 77 of title 5 of the us code entitled appeals only insofar as such modifications are designed to further the fair efficient and expeditious resolution of matters involving the employees of the department45 dhs and opm countered that they were not constrained by the requirement in section 9701f2 because they alleged the mitigation standard is not derived from chapter 77 of title 5 us code which relates to appeals but instead from chapter 75 adverse actions which states that an agency may take an adverse action against an employee only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the civil service 46 they argued in the alternative that modifying the mitigation authority of the board fully comports with statutory requirements as interpreted by the court that reviews mspb decisions the court of appeals for the federal circuit47 the district court rejected both contentions the district court found that the mitigation standard is derived from chapter 77 the appeals chapter of title 5 not chapter 75 the adverse actions chapter and consequently that any modification of chapter 77 procedures to comply with section 9701f2c of title 5 had to be fair efficient and expeditious the district court also observed that the contention by dhs and opm that the modification of the boards mitigation authority fully meets statutory requirements as interpreted by the court of appeals for the federal circuit was seriously flawed and that the cases cited by these agencies did not support this contention the district court said that the mitigation standard in the final regulation violates the congressional requirement in 5 usc 9701f2c because that standard modifies chapter 77 procedures in manner that is not fair the district court indicated that when congress insisted on fairness it did not intend that dhs could discipline or discharge employees without effective recourse the

wholly without justification would render mspb review almost nullity48 because the decision of the mspb rather than the decision of the employing agency is subject to judicial review the court maintained that this mitigation standard could effectively insulate dhs adverse actions from review49 the district court stated that this standard fails to measure up to the sense of congress that employees of the department are entitled to fair treatment in any appeals 5 usc 9701f1a or congresss express requirement that any modifications to chapter 77 procedures further the fair resolution of matters involving the employees of the department 50 the district court concluded that because the agencies failed to apply the plain meaning of section 9701f of title 5 us code section 9701706 of their regulations was not entitled to chevron deference and enjoined it51 this holding was reversed by the dc circuit adjudicating the fairness of the boards penalty mitigation procedures would be premature at this time ie the matter was not ripe for review better time to review the fairness of these procedures would be after the dhs has disciplined an employee and the penalty has been appealed52 g15g142g155g146g157g561g21g162g156g157g142g150g156g561g18g155g152g157g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g4g152g138g155g141g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g156g561 the unions alleged that dhs and opm exceeded authority granted by the homeland security act at section 9701f2 of title 5 us code when they modified the boards procedural regulations for dhs employees they challenged specifically the following regulations section 9701706k1 which shortens the time for appeal to the board section 9701k3 which limits discovery in mspb appeals and section 9701706k5 which authorizes summary judgment procedure when there are facts in dispute the district court found that congress in section 9701f2 of title 5 us code clearly authorized dhs and opm to waive or modify provisions within the purview of chapter 77of title 5 appeals and that there could be doubt that the agencies acted within their authority when they adopted these procedural regulations their interpretation of the section was found to be reasonable and consistent with the statutory purpose and consequently was entitled to deference under step two of the chevron case the unions also asserted that dhs and opm exceeded authority granted in the homeland security act when they assigned an appellate role to mspb to review decisions of the mandatory review panel in 5 cfr 9701707c this regulation provides that an employee who is discharged for mandatory removal offense will receive advance notice an opportunity to respond and written decision from dhs 53 the dhs decision would be subject to review by the

9701707c1i the board would sustain panel decision unless the board finds it to be arbitrary and capricious the board is more likely to sustain panel decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard than under the one that the board uses in typical removal case in which an agency must establish its case by preponderance of evidence 55 the district court concluded that dhs and opm were entitled to chevron deference in their interpretation of the broad authority granted by the homeland security act to issue this regulation the district court granted the motion by the agencies to dismiss th count relating to mspb procedures and denied the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on it56 the dc circuit affirmed this holding it found that the homeland security act clearly

limited the authority of the mspb to mitigate penalties imposed by dhs on the ground that this limitation did not comply with provision of the homeland security act which required that procedures must

district court declined to alter or amend its injunction of all of subpart finding that the provisions that the agencies proposed to separate were too closely intertwined with those that were not63 dhs and opm appealed the district courts denial of their motion to modify the injunction they asserted that enjoining subpart in its entirety swept too broadly the dc circuit rejected this assertion because its decision invalidated more of subpart than did the district courts decision the district court had upheld limitations on the subjects of collective bargaining but the dc circuit reversed that holding on the ground that the homeland security act does not authorize limiting them the appeals court said that fashioning the scope of the injunction should be left to the parties and the district court when the case is remanded 64 on october 17 2006 after dhs and opm declined to appeal the dc circuits decision to the supreme court the district court modified its order of august 12
