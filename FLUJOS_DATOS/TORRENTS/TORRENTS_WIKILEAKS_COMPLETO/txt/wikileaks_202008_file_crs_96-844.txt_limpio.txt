1996 richard best jr analyst in national defense foreign affairs and national defense division congressional research service the library of congress abstract covert action is the most controversial responsibility of the central intelligence agency cia this report addresses the statutory basis for covert actions criteria for their use in the postcold war world and procedures for their planning conducting and funding it discusses the evolution of congressional oversight of cover actions it analyses proposals for transferring responsibilities for covert actions outside the cia it also describes major post world war ii covert actions undertaken in western europe iran guatemala indonesia vietnam laos angola and nicaragua an appendix describes the role of the defense department in supporting covert actions the report will be updated as major developments warrant covert action an effective instrument of u s foreign policy summary of all the functions of the united states intelligence community covert actions tend to receive the greatest attention even though they consume only small proportion of intelligence budgets they are often controversial and have on several occasions figured prominently in major political scandals almost inevitably they intrude upon another countrys internal affairs and can result in the loss of human life they are by definition secret and thus do not undergo the public review and debate that is hallmark of democratic society most covert actions undertaken in the four decades after world war ii were part of larger policies designed to contain the soviet union and other communist countries with the end of the cold war the role of covert actions is being reassessed some observers have called for halt to such efforts while others have advocated different types of covert capabilities to counter the designs of rogue states international terrorist groups and narcotics smugglers for many years covert actions were often undertaken by the central intelligence agency cia without congressional approval or notification but since the mid1970s the executive branch has been required to provide increasingly detailed information to congressional intelligence committees on planned and ongoing covert actions some members have sought to require congressional notification prior to the initiation of any covert action or in emergencies within 48 hours of initiation but presidents have thus far successfully resisted such requirement congress can nonetheless use the power of the purse to halt covert actions and on several occasions has done so number of proposals have been offered to improve us capabilities to plan and undertake covert actions in the postcold war world most address the complicated relationship between cias directorate of operations and the rest of the intelligence community attention is also being given to the difficulties involved in maintaining capabilities for conducting covert actions against myriad targets in disparate locales at present however clearcut consensus for changes has emerged review of covert actions suggests that most were not isolated initiatives but components of larger us policies the extent to which they contributed to making those policies effective is subject to debate in almost all cases some observers continue to be concerned that covert actions are not adequately considered in the context of their place within larger policy framework covert actions are usually undertaken in peacetime by the cia but the defense department and the military services often provide important support covert actions by law enforcement agencies such as the federal bureau of investigation and the drug enforcement agency are excluded from this discussion the line between special operations conducted by military personnel and covert actions is not always clear and potential exists for misunderstandings between congress and the executive branch regarding reporting requirements

introduction of all the functions of the us intelligence community by far the most controversial is the planning and conduct of covert actions ranging from supplying financial subsidies to foreign journal to extensive paramilitary operations covert actions typify intelligence activities to many in the public who know little of the information gathering analysis and dissemination efforts that actually constitute the core functions of intelligence agencies many illinformed members of the public believe that the bulk of the multibillion dollar intelligence budget goes to covert actions when in fact they absorb only small percentage of the total the end of the cold war raises new questions about us covert action capabilities most covert actions in the past were aimed at resisting soviet and communist gains throughout the world the controversies surrounding them were often reflection of disputes over larger policies aimed at impeding communist advances without the need to counter communist threat based on an expansive great power with nuclear capabilities observers ask does the united states need covert action capability is there any justification for secretly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries in the absence of credible threat from another superpower how effective can covert actions be in dealing with likely postcold war threats underlying the discussion of the need for future covert actions will be an assessment however tentative of the international environment and the extent and nature of us interests such an assessment is notoriously difficult to make at time of global instability and of an uncertain sense of the international responsibilities that the us public is prepared to accept these broader concerns are fundamental the need for covert actions is contingent upon them nonetheless those in intelligence agencies responsible for planning must determine the nature of covert action capabilities that should be created or maintained levels of funding and organizational relationships the structure that is established in 1996 or 1997 may well influence the types of covert actions that can be undertaken for years to come the roles and missions of the postcold war intelligence community including covert actions are currently undergoing review by the clinton administration and by the two congressional intelligence committees the independent commission on the roles and capabilities of the us intelligence community in its march 1996 report addressed covert action although the emphasis of its recommendations lay in crs2 other areas proposals to curtail covert actions to make them the responsibility of an organization other than the central intelligence agency cia or to alter current congressional oversight procedures are receiving close consideration decisions on changes in covert action policies will be predicated upon some understanding of the range variety costs and uses of covert actions what they have accomplished in the past and the criticisms that have been directed against them this paper largely concentrates on covert actions undertaken for national security purposes by the cia covert operations by special forces and other defense department entities are briefly described in the appendix covert efforts by law enforcement organizations such as the federal bureau of investigation and the drug enforcement agency are excluded from this discussion although the growing international role of these agencies may lead some to conclude that some of their efforts should in the future be considered as covert actions definition what is covert action the national security act of 1947 pl 80253 which established the position of the director of central intelligence dci and the cia made mention of covert actions stating only that the dci shall perform such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the president or the national security council may direct1 it has been argued that the legislative history relating to the national security act did not support basing the conduct of covert action on this section and the cia was initially reluctant to become involved in view of the absence of legislative provisions specifically authorizing covert actions2 in december 1947 however the national security council nsc in its directive 4a told the dci to initiate and conduct within the limit of available funds covert psychological operations designed to counteract soviet and sovietinspired activities 3 it is 1 50 usc 4033d5 2 see

phrase special activities has been used in series of executive orders beginning with the ford administrations eo 11905 of february 18 1976 and continuing in the carter administrations eo 12036 of january 24 1978 the most recent version appears in eo 12333 of december 4 1981 united states intelligence activities that continues to serve as the executive branch charter for intelligence agencies special activities mean activities conducted in support of national foreign policy objectives abroad which are planned and executed so that the role of the united states government is not apparent or acknowledged publicly and functions in support of such activities but which are not intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media and do not include diplomatic activities or the collection and production of intelligence or related support functions section 34h the intelligence authorization act for fy1991 pl 10288 enacted august 14 1991 provided for the first time statutory definition of covert actions an activity of the united states government to influence political economic or military conditions abroad where it is intended that the role of the united states government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly but does not include 1 activities the primary purpose of which is to acquire intelligence traditional counterintelligence activities traditional activities to improve or maintain the operational security of united states government programs or administrative activities 2 traditional diplomatic or military activities or routine support to such activities 3 continued meeting secretary of defense james forrestal also stated that it is not clearly legal for cia to conduct these activities ibid p 698 4 an extensive discussion of congressional authorization for the conduct of covert actions by the cia was included in the final report of the church committee us congress 94th congress 2d session senate select committee to study governmental operations with respect to intelligence activities hereafter cited as church committee report foreign and military intelligence final report book i s rept 94755 april 26 1976 pp 475509 the report argued that congress did not specifically authorize the cia to undertake covert actions in the national security act of 1947 or the cia act of 1949 acknowledging the fact that congress had subsequent to 1947 provided funds for covert actions it maintained that providing funds per and especially in the absence of detailed knowledge of the program by congress as whole did not constitute authorization the committee recognized however that situation had changed in the future the failure by congress to prohibit funds from being used for covert action by the cia would clearly constitute congressional ratification of the cias authority eliminating any ambiguity church committee report i p 501 crs4 3 traditional law enforcement activities conducted by united states government law enforcement agencies or routine support to such activities or 4 activities to provide routine support to the overt activities other than activities described in paragraph 1 2 or 3 of other united states government agencies abroad5 the accompanying conference report h rept 102166 discussed this definition at some length in an effort to distinguish covert actions from other secret governmental activities it noted that the new definition is meant to clarify the understanding of intelligence activities that require presidential approval and reporting to congress not to relax or go beyond previous understandings6 use of such terms reflects an unwillingness to spell out in statutory law the types of projects that the government may intend to undertake these definitions reflect general understanding of what constitutes covert action but there remains sufficient ambiguity to ensure that disputes over interpretation may emerge in the future especially when there are sharp partisan differences over us foreign policies in practice covert actions have included propaganda efforts to influence political campaigns economic efforts and large and small paramilitary operations by far the most numerous efforts have been in the first two categories covertly spreading information and occasionally disinformation and attempting to gain support from influential persons in foreign countries by financial subsidies if necessary are the most frequent types of covert action employed these types of covert action require personnel with skills in languages media relations diplomacy political campaigns etc in many cases covert actions of this nature will complement overt efforts of the state department and various information agencies covert efforts to affect economic conditions in other countries violent direct action and covert paramilitary operations are options that are more rarely chosen skills required 5 105 stat 444 the definition included in the fy1991 intelligence authorization act is an amendment to the national security act of 1947 it is to be noted that despite having made provision for the conduct and reporting of covert actionsalong with authorizing and appropriating funds for specific onescongress has not passed legislation authorizing the undertaking of covert actions in more clearcut language than that contained in the 1947 act observers suggest that this derives from concern not to risk diplomatic embarrassments and in part from continued opposition to covert actions by some members the intelligence authorization act for fy1993 pl 102496 did not include covert actions among the enumerated responsibilities of the dci as head of the cia but the accompanying conference report noted that the conferees believe that it would be disingenuous for congress not to acknowledge its awareness that covert actions remain an instrument of us policy and function which may be assigned to the cia us congress house of representatives 102d congress 2d

1st session intelligence authorization act fiscal year 1991 house report 102166 july 25 1991 p 28 crs5 may be much different and personnel with military backgrounds in special operations may be required7 questions regarding the future of covert actions the most basic question is whether the united states should ever undertake covert actions covert actions can result in the loss of human life and almost invariably represent some sort of interference in the domestic affairs of other countries some critics charge that covert actions are fundamentally undemocratic inasmuch as they must be undertaken in secrecy and that there is possibility for the influence of informed public opinion and for approval by officials whom the public can hold responsible although there is considerable publicity about some covert actions by definition the process has to be cloaked in secrecy since 1974 the president has been required by statute to approve covert actions personally and congress has taken on an increasingly important role in reviewing them nonetheless these approval and oversight processes also take place in secret and public awarenessusually not detailed awarenessoccurs only after the fact covert actions in many if not most cases violate the domestic laws of the countries where they are implemented that of course can also be true of diplomatic commercial and other activities of us government representatives and us citizens in totalitarian countries whose laws preclude almost any activity not directly supporting the regime in power the extent to which covert actions violate international law in large measure depends according to some authorities upon an analysis of context rather than upon applications of textual authorities that are not in any event considered universally valid8 covert actions are undertaken in ways fundamentally different than almost all other functions of the federal government they inevitably complicateor according to critics compromisedemocratic processes democratic governments on the other hand both in this country and abroad have historically coexisted with covert action capability albeit with recurring controversies and scandals while the steps taken by congress and the executive branch to regularize the approval and conduct of covert actions continue to cloak the process in secrecy those charged with planning and conducting covert actions are directly accountable to democratically elected officials great efforts over several decades have been made to align procedures for planning and undertaking covert actions as far as practicable with democratic processes 7 descriptions of various types of covert actions are provided in w michael reisman and james baker regulating covert action practices contexts

american journal of international law vol 86 april 1992 these discussions however include certain types of intelligence collection operations that are beyond the scope of this paper 8 see reisman and baker regulating covert action especially pp 25 141142 crs6 arguments in favor of authorizing covert actions typically are covert action can allow the us to exert influence and support friends without acknowledging its role in many cases obvious american support could undermine foreign leaders among population that may resent western influence in some instances it might lead hostile neighbors to attempt to counteract american interests covert actions include wide range of initiatives between diplomatic note and sending in the marines the careful expenditure of funds for instance can arguably exert influence without jeopardizing lives or committing american prestige covert actions can achieve ends disproportionate to costs averting wars saving lives and money procedures for approving covert actions can limit the extent of congressional scrutiny and public knowledge of us involvement in sensitive operations that could be rendered impossible by extensive public knowledge covert actions by the cia can avoid embarrassment and save the government money since initiatives can be undertaken utilizing an established administrative structure instead of attempting ad hoc initiatives with inexperienced persons paramilitary operations can be conducted on occasions when the introduction of official us military personnel is impossible because of international political consequences arguments against covert actions usually fall into one of several categories covert actions can all too easily result in the loss of human life they can jeopardize the inherent values in us democracy and undermine the nations commitment to international law covert actions undertaken without informed debate in congress undermine the checks and balances built into the constitution covert actions in the current social legal and political milieu will probably not remain secret and their promise of controlled low cost low risk results are deceptively attractive covert actions reflect decisionmaking in secret without public accountability potentially undercutting larger goals of us national security policy covert actions undermine international law by allowing the us to surreptitiously influence developments in foreign countries perhaps contrary to the interests of the affected countries paramilitary operations managed by the cia are inefficient bypassing the capabilities of the defense department crs7 most observers expect that the united states will retain capability to plan and conduct covert actionsfew members of congress have ever advocated the termination of such capability if so policymakers and intelligence community officials will prudently take into account the reality that there exists significant body of opinion that opposes them in virtually all situations9 approval of covert action would normally be made with an understanding that it will never have universal support and will be inherently suspect by many observers with keen interests in foreign policy questions under what conditions should covert actions be considered in the postcold war world attempting to estimate likely requirements for us covert actions in the coming decade is an uncertain proposition some covert actions will probably be necessary as adjuncts to military operations there will according to most observers be need for capabilities to counteract the efforts of international terrorist organizations that target americans and us interests this line of reasoning holds that some movements or activities directly hostile to us interests can be most effectively countered by covert means there may be role for covert actions in the effort against international narcotics production and transport covert actions could be part of efforts to return suspected criminals to us territory for legal prosecution in general however requirements for covert actions are likely to be determined by decisions on larger national security goals made by the executive branch and congress some policies will require covert components in other areas covert actions will be perceived as logical and necessary the experience of the bush and clinton administrations indicates that requirements may change rapidly and will probably not resemble those that prevailed through much of the cold war period to serve effectively under such conditions most observers believe that the intelligence community will have to be more flexible and innovative while not enjoying all the financial and personnel resources previously available in some areas the united states has moved away from an earlier reliance on covert action although once supported semisecretly by intelligence agencies us international radio broadcasting eg radio free europe radio liberty is now publicly funded the national endowment for democracy ned established in 1983 serves to provide us funds to political groups in foreign countries where democracy is weak threatened or nonexistent10 ned grants are openly made through four private organizations and in some cases provide assistance where any role by us intelligence agency could be counterproductive public support for international radio and for the ned reflects nonetheless willingness to accept responsibility for sponsoring activities that may cause resentment by foreign governments it puts the us government behind efforts to spread 9 see for instance kenneth sharpe intelligence vs covert action the cia and democracy world politics winter 1989 10 see abram n shulsky silent warfare understanding the world of intelligence washington brasseys 1991 pp 9495 also susan b epstein national endowment for democracy policy and funding issues crs report 96222f march 7 1996 crs8 information and promote democracy in countries or regions where such activities are distinctly not welcomed by local governments deniability is much more limited than is the case with covert actions washington has to take responsibility for its instrumentalities proponents of covert action argue however that ned grants cannot be tailored to specific policy goals in short time frame and are not likely to replace covert actions in certain crucial areas similarly observers suggest that there may be occasions when it is important to provide support to journals or other media that have official connection with the us government covert actions are often controversial while some oppose covert actions under virtually any circumstances in the past divisions over covert actions were in many cases byproducts of profound divisions over cold war security policies especially in the years after the end of american involvement in vietnam11 these divisions have healed somewhat with the end of the soviet union although lingering concern about the role of the cia in guatemala haiti iraq and elsewhere reflects disagreement about current policy goals analysis of the differing perspectives on covert actions in such individual cases lie beyond the scope of this report ultimately covert actions have to be justified on the basis that they can help achieve important national objectives that can be attained by other way or that they can assist in achieving them at less cost than would be the case with any other option the cost criteria would encompass not merely financial investment but conceivably commitment of diplomatic support or armed force some observers are concerned that the complex reporting procedures currently surrounding covert actions and an inability to ensure plausible deniability can encourage an undesirable tendency to try to accomplish covert efforts outside the intelligence community the effort to supply the nicaraguan contras through private contributions is one example another is the clinton administrations determination to avoid involving the intelligence agencies in training or equipping bosnian and croatian armed forces even as it provided tacit support to resupply from iranian sources or allowed private organization composed of retired senior us military officers to contract for training programs critical observers suggest that efforts to undertake what might be considered covert actions without involving intelligence agencies are in reality driven by narrow considerations of domestic politics determination not to confide in members of congress that an administration suspects are hostile to the policy being pursued critics of such efforts argue that even if they are completely within the law they do not permit the extensive and expensively acquired expertise of the intelligence community to be utilized nor do such expedients permit the tight control by the us government that is inherent in covert action undertaken by the cia or dod further they suggest the deniability achieved by pursuing secret initiative while avoiding involvement of us intelligence agencies may be wholly unpersuasive to cynical foreign observers in any event 11 opposition to covert actions has not been invariable some opponents of the reagan administrations policy towards nicaragua in the 1980s fought covert support to the contras even as they supported covert actions in afghanistan crs9 changes in criteria are there useful criteria by which the wisdom of covert action can be weighed number of observers suggest that covert action should be undertaken only if it is consistent with publicly proclaimed policies is consistent with democratic values and would not unduly embarrass the us government if it were compromised as rules of thumb these guidelines are useful but they do not necessarily provide definitive guidance for all occasions covert actions may after all be considered in the most difficult cases not just to fund worthy journals of democratic opinion in need of subsidy in some cases covert action may serve as way of testing the possibility of change in policy or to initiate change in policy in such situations covert action would not necessarily be consistent with current policy in other cases such as hostage release or the interdiction of terrorist act the goal of covert action may be thoroughly consistent with democratic values but the action may be implemented only with the assistance of undemocratic elements and through the use of bribery blackmail or various forms of coercion in still other cases the action might meet the previous criteria but still embarrass the us government if it were required that assistance be provided to an ostensibly hostile government or group in the 1960s when it was revealed that the cia had subsidized the national student association then somewhat liberal organization there was embarrassment all around ultimately however some observers concluded that cia support enabled the national student association to reflect us values and interests effectively in international fora where they could well have been outmaneuvered and outnumbered by the wellsubsidized communist youth groups some observers argue that covert actions should be undertaken only under exceptional circumstances and that they should never become routine instruments of policy this argument is based largely on concern that covert actions are planned and undertaken in secrecy and lack the accountability that characterizes other governmental initiatives covert action should never be viewed as routine support for policy but rather as an exceptional response to compelling national interest lesser level of significance justifies abridgement of the democratic process12 other observers argue however that covert actions can be most effective when they are component of larger policy that is supported by us diplomacy the defense department and economic initiatives they suggest that covert actions attempted when all else has failed are almost always doomed in part this argument turns on questions of what types of covert actions are under consideration most probably would acknowledge that certain nonviolent covert actions eg subsidizing foreign political party or journal would effectively serve as part of larger policy on the other hand some more ambitious covert actions would probably be chosen only if other option were available and these are usually the ones that are the most likely to end in disaster formalizing criteria for covert actions would provide guidance to planners but in many if not most cases the decision to undertake covert action is likely to remain heavily dependent upon specific circumstances it is not difficult to find some policy rationale to justify given covert action even the most controversial covert actions in the past did have at least some relationship to shoring up anticommunists or freeing 12 the need to know the report of the twentieth century fund task force on covert action and american democracy new york twentieth century fund 1992 p 13 crs10 hostages covert action virtually by definition contravenes some publicly espoused policy of noninterference in other countries affairs as of course do many efforts to promote human rights given past experience however future administrations will at least have the benefit of knowing the harsh reactionand the political price paid in congress and among the american public of covert actions that were implemented in contradiction to democratic values and publicly avowed policies given record of public disclosure of highly sensitive covert actions every proposal has to be considered in light of the potential ramifications of public exposure some suggest that perhaps the best criteria is consideration of the effect of unauthorized public disclosure should the united states reorganize its covert action bureaucracy and procedures assuming that the us government retains capability to plan and undertake covert actions number of fundamental questions arise should covert actions be the exclusive province of the operations directorate of the cia should the operations directorate remain an integral part of cia or should it be established as an independent agency clandestine services agency under the operational control of the director of central intelligence b the secretary of defense or c another official should the role of the defense department in covert actions be expanded should legislation be enacted that would establish criteria for initiating covert actions should there be statutory requirement that at least certain specified members of congress be notified prior to the initiation of covert action or in emergency situations at least within fortyeight hours detaching the operations directorate from cia as noted at the beginning of this report covert action capability is not necessarily an inherent part of an intelligence agency responsible for the collection analysis and dissemination of secret information most of the major intelligence agencies in the us government have little or connection with covert actions and the cia was itself not originally organized to undertake covert actions but acquired the function as the united states gradually became committed to resisting communist political gains in western europe and elsewhere in recent years dcis have been increasingly expected to oversee the nations multibillion dollar intelligence effort to the extent that they must concentrate on complex reconnaissance systems and coordinating with intelligence agencies within the defense department they must necessarily rely on their deputies and senior cia officials to manage covert actions some observers argue that highly sensitive projects may now be receiving less attention from senior policymakers appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate particular concerns have been raised that crs11 daytoday management decisions lay in the hands of officials who have not made their careers in the operations directorate some critics have advocated splitting out the parts of the cia responsible for covert actions and human intelligence collection now known as the directorate of operations or the clandestine service and making it an independent agency admiral bobby ray inman who served as deputy dci in the reagan administration suggested such an approach as an appropriate response to new postcold war realities13 this concept was also proposed in the intelligence community in the 21st century ic21 study undertaken in 19951996 by the house permanent select committee on intelligence although it was not included in legislation reported by the committee14 advantages separate clandestine service directly under the dci would ensure that the nations chief intelligence officer take direct responsibility for planning management and oversight of covert actions as well as humint collection the cia shorn of its covert action tasks could concentrate on its intelligence collection and analysis responsibilities the cia would be less likely to serve as lightning rod for opponents of an administration pursuing risky foreign policy initiatives it could also improve the cias relations with an academicresearch community often opposed to covert action and with those in government who are skeptical that analysis can be kept independent of parochial need to justify ongoing covert actions it would remove longstanding rivalries and bureaucratic competition between analysts and operators in the cia given the postcold war environment analysts at cia as in other agencies have to make greater use of open source materials and work openly with other government agencies and outside experts on topics far removed from many of the highly sensitive security concerns of the cold war period it is not just that academic and media experts may have distaste for covert actions in principle but rather that the world of information acquisition storage and retrieval technology has grown enormously and that the extent of postcold war interests have broadened to such an extent that from management perspective informationrelated activities require greater emphasis and managerial attention than is possible in an organization whose managers must supervise sensitive covert actions that can result in the loss of american lives in summary those who hold this view argue that cias involvement in covert actions complicates its analytical efforts because there may be tendency to provide evidence supporting the policies calling for covert actions 13 inman urges creating single agency outside cia for humint aerospace daily january 22 1996 pp 9899 14 see us congress 104th congress house of representatives permanent select committee on intelligence ic21 intelligence community in the 21st century staff study 1996 pp 181 222 crs12 cias role in covert actions also complicates its efforts to work with area specialists and other outside scholars in view of the widespread hostility to covert actions that exists in the academic community the leadership role of the intelligence community in acquiring and managing information technology and in supporting government agencies outside the national security arena is constantly undermined by inevitable controversies over covert actions disadvantages responsibilities for covert action have been given to the cia since the 1940s because of disinclination to incorporate them into either the state or defense department the passage of time has not made alternatives more attractive removing covert action capabilities from the cia would be major innovation and would engender strong opposition and perhaps partisan political controversy the advantages would have to be clearly demonstrated and the disadvantages acceptable many observers believe that the case has not yet been made those who would retain covert action capabilities within cia argue as did their predecessors in the late 1940s and early 1950s that the dci is the logical official to be assigned the responsibility for covert actions although separate covert action office outside the cia could report to the dci this did not work in the 1940s it would add significant administrative overhead and potentially overlapping responsibilities in the field some would argue that creating separate organization outside cia but still subordinate to the dci would be separation in fiction more than fact cia analysts benefit from close working relationships with operations directorate officials and the latter need close access to analysts in planning covert actions considerable efforts have been made in recent years to encourage closer working relationships between analysts and operations directorate officers this cooperation would be jeopardized if separate organizations were established detaching covert action but not humint collection capabilities from cia covert action capabilities but not human intelligence collection capabilities could be located outside the ciaessentially the situation that existed prior to 1952 responsibility for covert actions especially those that are paramilitary in nature could be given to specialized military units as is reportedly the case in britain15 to certain extent such capabilities already exist designed for use in time of war by the military services under the direction of the joint chiefs of staff jcs16 15 arguments for this approach are made by david charters the role of intelligence services in the direction of covert paramilitary operations in alfred c maurer marion d tunstall and james m keagle eds intelligence policy and process boulder co westview press 1985 especially pp 338 341346 16 see john m collins special operations forces an assessment 19861993 crs report 93697s july 30 1993 also the appendix to this paper crs13 advantages this proposal would remove from cia its most controversial function and place covert actions in smaller and hopefully obscure organization cia would become solely an information gathering and analytical institution with greater legitimacy in the eyes of those especially in the media and academic profession who have been traditionally opposed to covert action it is argued that although human intelligence collectors belong in the same organization as analysts covert operators do not for its part the covert action agency would be smaller its esprit corps would be enhanced and it could work more closely with the armed services disadvantages considerable administrative overhead would have to be duplicated human intelligence sources in foreign countries are useful in some covert action efforts in the early years of the cia administrative separation of covert action and intelligence collection led to competing efforts by us officials in the field that were clearly counterproductive the possibility exists that separate offices would bid against each other for the services of foreign sources greater use of nonofficial cover in the postcold war world the cia will likely require different types of approaches to covert actions in the past emphasis was given to recruiting soviet and other communist officials serving in embassies abroad for intelligence collection purposes it was hoped that these officials could be encouraged to supply accurate information about their own countries to the united states and supply disinformation about the united states back to their seniors it was notoriously difficult to obtain access to individuals within communist countries outside of official circles in many cases the embassy circuit was the only means of approach the cold warera emphasis on developing contacts on the diplomatic circuit had certain advantages us embassies provided security for cia personnel as well as extensive logistical support cia officials ostensibly filling nonintelligence positions could still devote most of their energies to their cia duties they were usually covered by diplomatic immunity and thus could usually be brought home if their safety was jeopardized their assignments often focused on contacts with other members of the diplomatic corps or hostnation officials all of whom they could contact in the context of their position in the embassy in the postcold war environment operations directorate personnel may be given assignments that involve contacts with elements far removed from embassy social circles in such cases diplomatic cover may be counterproductive and operations directorate officers may be sent abroad under commercial or other cover there are however major challenges to be overcome not all us corporations are prepared to cooperate with the cia in providing such cover and strong opposition exists to providing cia officials cover as journalists academicians or members of the clergy without official cover logistical and administrative difficulties become much greater the official will probably have to be engaged in nearfull time work in his cover capacity routine health care retirement and other personnel issues are much more complicated security risks are far higher such agents do not enjoy diplomatic immunity and there is far less that the us government can do to protect them if they fall afoul of local authorities or criminal elements inevitably also there is higher crs14 risk that the us government will become associated with parties who have embarrassing financial or political entanglements with local interests in early 1996 there was renewed consideration of the use of journalists and clergymen by the cia or having cia officers ostensibly serving as journalists or clergymen based on recommendation by task force of the council on foreign relations17 subsequently it was revealed that there had been few exceptions to the policy precluding the employment of journalists that had been established by george bush in february 1976 when he was dci and subsequently amplified the following year by his successor stansfield turner18 in april 1996 dci john deutch essentially reaffirmed the earlier policy disclaiming any intention to use american journalists as agents or american news organizations for cover but reserving the possibility to do so in genuinely extraordinary circumstances19 the intelligence authorization act for fy1997 pl 104293 essentially places this policy into statutory law permitting use of us journalists as intelligence agents only on an exceptional basis and requiring notification of the two intelligence committees in each instance many journalists and leaders of religious organizations are naturally concerned that their representatives not be perceived as agents of an intelligence service such perceptions at home and abroad valid or not at least complicate their efforts to perform their duties and in extreme situations could lead to hostile actions taken against them by foreign governments or groups intelligence sources indicate that exceptions have been rare and made only when important interests such as american hostages in iran were at stake and reasonable alternatives were available drawing hard and fast policy will be resisted by intelligence leaders it might be difficult in any event to draft precise definition of journalist or clergyman the planning conduct and oversight of covert actions the management of covert actions presents significant challenges to any government but especially to democratic government that operates on the basis of openness and public accountability inherently covert actions must be planned and undertaken in secret funding arrangementsthe normal focus of accountability in the us governmentmust also be made secretly secrecy also hinders the ability of government officials or the public to evaluate the contribution that covert actions make to the achievement of national security goals 17 the task

actions has evolved incrementally over the years through executive branch initiatives but with increasing congressional guidance funding mechanisms for covert actions as well as the broader range of cia activities were at one time handled by cia and dod officials working with very small group of members of congress since the 1970s procedures have become much more formal and congress has funded or withheld funds from specific covert actions usually this has been done in classified annexes to committee reports that are incorporated into legislation but on several occasions funding provisions have been directly included in statutes covert actions are reviewed by congressional committees two select committees in 19751976 usually referred to as the church and pike committees after the two chairmen senator frank church and representative otis pike looked at covert actions under highly publicized conditions subsequently the two intelligence oversight committees have conducted investigations of covert actions but mostly on classified basis the irancontra investigation in 1987 provided mass of documentation on covert action practices nonetheless analysts working from the basis of materials released during the churchpike and irancontra investigations inevitably center their assessments on highly controversial covert actions rather than on the entire spectrum sufficient information is however becoming available from documents gradually being released by the cia and other intelligence agencies and from the memoirs and biographies of participants to indicate the nature and scope of covert actions undertaken since the truman administration although not complete analysis of this body of material provides framework to understand the importance covert actions have played and continue to play and suggests options for future consideration organizing for covert actions americans have conducted covert actions of various types since the eighteenth centuryand developed expertise in such efforts during world war ii by the office of strategic services oss20 after the end of world war ii the responsibilities of the oss were initially divided among the military services and the state department in 1947 central intelligence agency was established as part of the national security act that also created the independent air force and the national security council little attention was given to covert action the focus was on providing better analysis to ensure that surprise on the order of pearl harbor could occur with the beginnings of the cold war in 1946 and 1947 state and military planners sought ways to support resistance to communist advances in western europe and as noted above program of psychological operations was launched given limited resources the program was necessarily limited in scope george kennan then the head of the state departments policy planning staff argued for much more ambitious programs of political warfare

publications of america 1981 crs16 as then constituted kennans goal was also to ensure close ties between the state department and those responsible for covert actions at his urging at the time of the beginning of the berlin blockade the national security council established by directive 102 which superseded nsc4a new office located for administrative purposes in the cia but headed by an official nominated by the secretary of state and supervised by the state and defense departments21 the office which came to be known as the office of policy coordination opc was charged with the planning and conduct of covert operations specifically including propaganda economic warfare preventive direct action including sabotage antisabotage demolition and evacuation measures subversion against hostile states including assistance to underground resistance movements guerrillas and refugee liberation groups and support of indigenous anticommunist elements in threatened countries of the free world22 under the energetic leadership of frank wisner an oss veteran who had subsequently worked in the state department opc launched wide variety of projects wisner was allowed considerable flexibility in developing covert action projects and the close relationship of opc with the state department that kennan had envisioned did not emerge23 wisners initiatives were reflected in growing budgets and personnel levels in 1949 opc had 302 people and budget of some 47 million by 1952 it employed 2812 in addition to 3142 overseas contract personnel with budget of 82 million24 with the establishment of opc in the summer of 1948 the dci had two clandestine services opc devoted to covert activities and cias office of special operations oso devoted to human intelligence collection it was not an easy relationship opc operated largely independently of the rest of the cia had more funds at its disposal and cultivated cando attitude oso was more methodical in its approach and more constrained in its

within nsc50 were being considered the international atmosphere continued to deteriorate by 1948 most of eastern europe had been absorbed within the soviet sphere in 1949 the communists were victorious in china and the west learned that the soviet union had acquired its own atomic weapon in june 1950 communist north korea launched an attack designed to gain control of the whole peninsula the truman administration quickly endorsed comprehensive anticommunist policy described in another nsc document nsc 68 according to an official cia history with the outbreak of the korean war opcs budget expanded dramatically and its focus shifted from essentially defensive psychological operations to active economic political and even military actions26 the new dci lieutenant general walter bedell smith made opc regular office of the cia upon taking up his duties in october 1950 in august 1952 opc and oso were finally formally consolidated smith did have considerable hesitation in taking this step out of concern that covert actions including paramilitary operations in support of us forces in korea were overwhelming its intelligence collection and analytical functions given the imperatives of wartime situation he nonetheless acceded to recommendation of the nsc nsc105 that cia continue its anti communist covert action program in the eisenhower administration smiths successor dci allen dulles gave even greater emphasis to covert actions having served as head of the oss in switzerland during world war ii dulles took personal interest in wide variety of specific covert actions he was heavily involved in efforts intended to prevent communist or leftist takeovers in iran and guatemala although there has been intense historical controversy regarding whether or not these covert actions ultimately served us interests at the time they were considered major successes by the cia in implementing the policies the eisenhower administration allen dulles described as the great white case officer because of his affinity for covert actions was retained as dci at the beginning of the kennedy administration he would preside over one of the great failures of us policy the

their ethic were cias in 1969 they ran the agency bureaucratically and dominated it psychologically and few questioned the rightness of that28 between 1961 and 1976 cia conducted some 900 major or sensitive covert action projects in addition to several thousand smaller ones29 the carter administration took office in 1977 with an apparent lack of enthusiasm for covert actions in part reaction to the abuses that had been revealed by the church and pike committees vice president walter mondale having been member of the former dci stansfield turner instituted sizable personnel reductions in the operations directorate believing that the possibility of major increases in covert actions should be closed off as he did not foresee that as being something that the country would need or want30 even though it was widely agreed that the number of agents needed to be reduced the reduction in force came as shock to officials who had assumed that they could rely on job security perceived by opponents as reflective of vacillating national security policy the initiative became political issue as opponents of the administration charged that turner was denigrating the need for human intelligence and covert actions nevertheless as noted below determination to promote anticommunist elements in eastern europe and to limit soviet military initiatives in the third world led with the encouragement of the national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski to an increasing number of covert actions during the carter administration the advent of the reagan administration in 1981 brought strong and public emphasis on rebuilding covert action capability the new administration was willing even eager to conduct covert actions in key areas where it perceived threats from the soviet union and its surrogates or opportunities to injure communist regimes and movements under the leadership of dci william casey the cias operations directorate once again increased in size and importance casey who had served in the oss during world war ii took personal interest in expanding covert actions to support the administrations determination to counter soviet influence throughout the world but especially in afghanistan and central america some of these efforts were widely known even if not officially acknowledged covert action efforts came under great criticism during congressional hearings concerning the irancontra affair when many concluded that the reagan administration had undercut its publicly announced policy of isolating iran reagan subordinates made covert arms transfers to iranian

undertake in the aftermath of the hearings new policies were issued regarding the administration of clandestine activities the policy specifically precluded nsc staff from participating in the conduct of special activities in addition procedures were established to ensure that any covert action would support national foreign policy objectives abroad further to the extent possible they should be conducted only when we are confident that if they are revealed the american public would find them sensible31 with the end of the cold war during the bush administration the intelligence community faced significant reductions in budgets and personnel even though dod and other agencies have faced deeper cuts the directorate of operations was not exempted especially as many of the former targets of clandestine intelligence collection have disappeared reportedly the number of deployed officially covered case officers has been declining at an average rate of almost ten percent year over the last several years large numbers of stations and bases have been closed and those that remain have been reduced in size these reductions have encouraged shift from global presencea station in every country that could reasonably be of interestto global reachwithdrawing from many countries but attempting to maintain some sort of access along with capability to reconstitute and expand presence if necessary although the immediate effect may be in the area of clandestine intelligence collection covert action capabilities are often affected by these drawdowns32 covert actions have been utilized by both the bush and clinton administrations dcis william webster robert gates r james woolsey and john deutch have not shared caseys emphasis on covert action capabilities revelations of the treachery of operations directorate official aldrich ames seriously compromised the reputation of the operations directorate where he was assigned throughout most of his cia career on the other hand covert actions played part in us military operations in panama and in desert storm and desert shield the clinton administrations efforts at peacekeeping in somalia haiti and bosnia have been assisted by covert efforts by cia press accounts indicate that cia provided support to kurdish groups opposed to saddam hussein and to some dissident iranian elements although these efforts have been effectively countered by the iraqis the effort to bring together intelligence analysts in cias directorate of intelligence and clandestine officials in the operations directorate has been accelerated

context of policy has varied in some cases planning has been restricted to small group directed by the president or the national security adviser in others planning has been much more formal involving extensive coordination among the major agencies involved in national security policy the extent of coordination depends on given presidents managerial style and the perceived sensitivity of the covert action under consideration given statutory requirements for findings that must be provided to congress the process has become increasingly formal in recent years34 funding of covert actions as might be expected in recent years congress has closely overseen funds available for covert actions the law currently requires that funds be expended on covert action until the president has made finding ie formal determination that covert action should be carried out findings include provisions indicating funding requirements intelligence authorization actsand related appropriations measuresinclude funding for the reserve for contingencies of the cia budgetary account originally established in 1952 to provide funding for unanticipated intelligence activities including covert actions the dci must notify congressional intelligence committees when he intends to transfer funds from the reserve for contingencies to undertake covert action35 transfers from budgetary accounts other than the reserve for contingencies require more extensive congressional notification congressional committees cannot prevent the executive branch from making use of funds from the reserve for contingencies but funds may not be spent on any activity for which funding was denied by congress36 on number of occasions legislation has specifically precluded the dci from using funds available to him in the contingency reserve fund for covert actions in specified area congress and covert actions for many years it appeared that congress had little interest in being involved in approving or overseeing covert actions congress has in fact never asserted an absolute right to approve covert actions37 the initiation of covert actions like 34 see church committee report iv pp 5051 mark m lowenthal us intelligence

authorization bill would have required prior approval of covert actions by the intelligence committees although in emergency situations covert action could proceed for 48 hours but continued crs21 decisions to deploy military forces or conclude executive agreements being at least arguably presidential prerogative until the mid1970s covert actions were routinely conducted without notification to congress38 although procedures were always in place to allow congress to review intelligence budgets it is much less certain that congressional committees or even key members were apprised of specific covert actions in the wake of the southeast asian war the watergate scandal and president nixons resignation legislation known as the hughesryan act was enacted in 1974 requiring that funds might be used except in wartime by cia for activities other than intelligence collection unless and until the president finds that each such operation is important to the national security of the united states and reports in timely fashion description and scope of such operation to the appropriate committees of the congress39 the legislation thus established requirement for an official finding term that has since become an important part of the literature of covert actions without knowledge of covert actions it was maintained congress could not carry out its constitutional responsibilities of providing funds and oversight the fact that those responsible for planning covert actions had envisioned assassinations abroad and domestic surveillance gave impetus to the demand for congressional notification presidents thereafter could longer maintain plausible deniability of actions allegedly initiated by subordinates even though covert actions would continue to be designed to avoid revealing the us role this requirement meant that the us government must take official responsibility for covert actions40 although the potential disadvantages of having to acknowledge the fact that covert action had been approved by the president were recognized at the time they were outweighed by determination to prevent subordinate officials from undertaking operations so 37 continued then cease unless the two committees approved the amendment failed on 70341 vote congressional record october 17 1990 p h10084 38 according to the church committee of the 33 covert action projects undertaken in chile between

assistance act of 1974 the reports it was specified were to go to appropriate committees of congress including the senate foreign relations committee and the house foreign affairs committee 40 many observers believed that when president eisenhower in 1960 accepted responsibility for u2 overflights of the soviet union he made reaching agreements with moscow much more difficult had he blamed the flights on the pentagon or the cia khrushchev arguably might not have felt forced to react so strongly even though he might not believe the denials such reasoning while constrained is hardly unusual it is easier for president to deal with foreign leaders who are known to have committed violent acts but have never admitted having done so than to meet formally with those who have acknowledged unacceptable behavior crs22 outrageous such as assassinations that president could ever publicly associate himself with comprehensive investigations of intelligence activities undertaken by the church and pike select committees in 19751976 focused in large measure on covert actions highly publicized hearings revealed efforts to topple the castro regime in cuba support for political assassinations in zaire and other projects that appeared inconsistent with democratic principles some with dubious prospects for success and severely damaged the nations reputation both abroad and at home revelations that intelligence agencies had undertaken surveillance of domestic political groups and systematically opened mail led to greater determination to reform an intelligence bureaucracy that was perceived by many as out of control41 the pike committees recommendations were published as congressional document even though the house did not consent to the publication of the entire report42 after recommending that direct or indirect attempts to assassinate any individual be prohibited except in time of war the committee urged that within 48 hours of initial approval of any covert action the dci should provide congress with details of the initiative and the president should certify that the action is required to protect the nations security along with duplicate originals of the recommendations of administration officials involved in approving the action finally covert actions should be terminated within twelve months of initial approval the church committee for its part found that covert action operations have not been an exceptional instrument used only in rare instances when the vital interests of the united states have been at stake on the contrary presidents and administrations have made excessive and at times selfdefeating use of covert action in addition covert action has become routine program with bureaucratic momentum of its own43 the committee argued however that although it considered total ban on covert actions the united states should maintain the capability to react through covert action when other means will suffice to meet extraordinary circumstances involving grave threats to us national security nevertheless covert action should be considered as an exception to the 41 see loch k johnson season of inquiry the senate intelligence

committee report i p 425 crs23 normal process of government action abroad rather than parallel but invisible system in which covert operations are routine44 it proposed restructuring of executive branch procedures for approving covert actions and recommended that by statute the dci should be required to notify congress of covert actions prior to initiation and that funds should be expended on an action until the president certifies that it is required by extraordinary circumstances to deal with grave threats to the national security45 the church committee further recommended that the cia be given more complete legislative charter including the mission of conducting foreign covert actions that political assassinations be prohibited along with efforts to subvert democratic governments and support for police or other internal security forces which engage in the systematic violations of human rights46 congress would exert control over covert actions through actions it would take on an annual budget submission for covert action funds could be taken from the contingency reserve fund of the cia for covert actions only with the concurrence of appropriate congressional committees47 the committee also recommended that covert paid relationships between the cia and any american clergyman or missionary should be precluded by law48 for two decades the recommendations of the church committee have provided basic agenda for intelligence reform and reorganization not only in terms of covert action but in wide variety of intelligence activities most notably they led directly to the establishment of permanent oversight committees in both houses of congress the senate select committee on intelligence was established in may 1976 the house permanent select committee on intelligence in july 1977 in ensuing years congress working for the most part through the two intelligence committees has repeatedly addressed the concerns of the church and pike committees regarding covert actions congress has not moved to enact all their recommendations in some cases because actions by the executive branch have been deemed adequate49 in other cases it would appear that subsequent congresses did not agree with the thrust of certain recommendations virtually all observers would now agree that there is consensus that covert actions are legitimate function of government and that both the executive and legislative branches must take definite responsibility for them 44 ibid pp 446447 45 ibid p 430 46 ibid pp 441 448 47 ibid p 449 48 ibid p 456 49 assassinations have been

congress considered charter legislation for all intelligence agencies devoting extensive attention to the role of cia in undertaking covert actions given conflicting concerns within both congress and the executive branch charter was not enacted during the carter administration the intelligence oversight act of 1980 section 407 of the intelligence authorization act for fy1981 pl 96450 did however revise the provisions of the 1974 legislation the 1980 act required that the dci and others with responsibilities for intelligence activities should keep the two intelligence committees rather than the eight committees fully and currently informed of all intelligence activities including any significant anticipated intelligence activity the act thus required prior notification to congress but expressly stipulated that approval by intelligence committees would not be condition precedent to the initiation of any such anticipated intelligence activity further the act provided that if the president believes that extraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the united states exist notice shall be limited to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the two intelligence committees the speaker and minority leader of the house and the majority and minority leaders of the senate this group came to be known as the gang of eight50 in enacting the 1980 legislation both congress and the executive branch recognized that there was degree of ambiguity surrounding the requirement for timely notice of covert actions the ambiguity would be severely tested few years later when the reagan administration launched covert action to provide arms to elements in iran who it hoped might encourage more moderate government in tehran and further the release of american hostages in beirut the issue came to public notice in the investigations of the irancontra affair when it became known that president reagan had signed finding on december 5 1985 authorizing cia to provide assistance to private parties attempting to obtain the 50 in addition the 1980 act contains preamble stating that these reporting responsibilities should be carried out to the extent consistent with all applicable authorities and duties including those conferred by the constitution upon the executive and legislative branches of the government and by the need to protect sources and methods some maintained that this preambular statement recognized the presidents constitutional authority to initiate covert actions and that it might permit withholding of prior notice the senate select committee on intelligence had taken cognizance of this position prior to approval of this language and acknowledged that those powers concerning national security and foreign policy are in zone of twilight in which the president and congress share authority whose distribution is uncertain us congress senate 96th congress 2d session select committee on intelligence intelligence oversight act of 1980 s rept 96730 p 9 the report did state further however that the requirement to fully and currently inform the oversight committees of any significant anticipated intelligence activity is intended to mean that the committees shall be informed at the time of the presidential finding that authorizes initiation of such activity arrangements for notice are to be made forthwith without delay ibid the report subsequently acknowledged the possibility that the president might withhold prior notice in rare extraordinary circumstances but in accordance with an understanding reached between the senate select committee and the executive branch he is obliged to inform the two oversight committees in timely fashion of the action and the reasons for withholding such prior notice p 12 crs25 release of americans held hostage in the middle east but at the same time directing that the finding not be briefed to congress until such time as i may direct otherwise51 earlier in the carter administration efforts to rescue several americans hiding in the canadian embassy in tehran had also been withheld from congress52 the majority of the irancontra committees took strong exception to this practice viewing it as deliberate effort to usurp congressional prerogatives they recommended as had their predecessors on the church committee that the law be changed to require that congress be notified prior to the commencement of covert action except in certain rare instances and in event later than 48 hours after finding is approved53 in the aftermath of irancontra the two intelligence committees gave extensive consideration to tightening covert action reporting requirements legislation s1721 100th congress introduced in september 1987 required that findings be in writing and could not be made retroactive an exception was made for emergency actions but in such cases the presidents finding was to be made in writing within 48 hours findings were to identify which agencies were involved and congress was to be notified prior to the initiation of covert action or at least within 48 hours of its commencement s 1721 eventually passed the senate in march 1988 but was never acted on by the house both the reagan and bush administrations strongly opposed an approach that they perceived as encroaching on the presidents independent constitutional authority 51 copy of the finding the

agency of the federal government that the attorney general be provided copy of proposed findings for purposes of legal review and that findings be operative for only one year unless the president recertifies them ibid pp 423424 crs26 in the intelligence field54 opponents of the legislation maintained that presidents had sufficient constitutional authority to undertake covert actions without notifying congress and that because covert actions require secrecy opponents could use leaks to undercut the presidents policies55 in the first year of the bush administration and the 101st congress efforts were made to reach compromise on the requirement for prior or 48hour notification on october 30 1989 president bush wrote to the senate intelligence committee i intend to provide notice in fashion sensitive to congressional concerns the 1980 statute then in force requires prior notice or when prior notice is given timely notice i anticipate that in almost all instances prior notice will be possible in those rare instances where prior notice is not provided i anticipate that notice will be provided within few days any withholding beyond this period would be based upon my assertion of the authorities granted this office by the constitution56 legislation dealing with covert action was reintroduced in the 101st congress but at the request of the house intelligence committee action was deferred until the second session in 1990 both houses of congress passed an intelligence authorization bill s 2834 for fy 1991 that incorporated changes in requirements for reporting findings authorizing covert actions findings would have to be in writing and signed by the president they could not except in emergencies be retroactive they would have to specify which agencies are involved they would have to be forwarded to the congressional intelligence committees as soon as possible after such approval the bill further added that any request to foreign country or to private citizen to conduct covert action be itself deemed covert action despite earlier assurances by some administration representatives president bush did not approve the legislation he argued that provisions regarding requests for assistance from foreign countries intruded on his constitutional authorities more pointedly he complained of statement in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on the bill that construed the bill to require notification not merely in timely manner but within few days57 president bush 54 message to the congress transmitting the directive

retirement and disability system and for other purposes report 101358 p 21 57 the conferees state unequivocally that the timely fashion provision of the conference report means that in exigent circumstances where the president needs to implement covert action immediately to protect united states interests the president may do so without first notifying the intelligence committees but then must notify the committees within few days continued crs27 wrote such an interpretation would unconstitutionally infringe on the authority of the president and impair any administrations effective implementation of covert action programs58 the presidents action served as pocket veto and another fy1991 intelligence authorization bill was considered in the next congress in the revised intelligence authorization bill for fy1991 relatively minor changes in the provisions relating to providing congress with notice of covert actions went some way to meet the administrations concern it required that whenever finding is not reported the president shall fully inform the intelligence committees in timely fashion and shall provide statement of the reasons for not giving prior notice59 the accompanying conference report noted that neither intelligence committee has ever accepted the claim that the constitution permits president to withhold timely notice for an indefinite period however the conferees recognize that this is question that neither they nor the congress itself can resolve congress cannot diminish by statute powers that are granted by the constitution nor can either the legislative or executive branch authoritatively interpret the constitution which is the exclusive province of the judicial branch60 the bush administration accepted this position the bill became public law 10288 on august 15 1991 and there the matter has rested according to media reports the bush administration was careful to notify the intelligence committees in timely manner of covert actions policy followed by the clinton administration although questions have been raised regarding possible involvement in shipments of iranian arms to bosnia in 19931994 the process has been assisted by the absence in recent years of raging disputes over foreign policy on the scale of vietnam or central america the potential remains however that 57 continued us congress house of

conference 102d congress 1st session intelligence authorization act fiscal year 1991 house report 102166 july 25 1991 p 28 crs28 president may launch highly controversial covert action of which he will be reluctant to advise congress for an indefinite period many observers believe that the requirement to notify congress of covert actions has been beneficial to the intelligence community covert actions that have been explained to leading members of congress will receive degree and variety of scrutiny likely to demonstrate inherent flaws in the proposal furthermore there are the undoubted advantages of hearing the reactions of senior members of both parties strongly expressed opposition to covert action especially from intelligence committee chairmen and ranking members will inevitably carry considerable weight their comments at least prepare the administration for the political fallout should the action go awry in at least two instances it has been reported that congressional objections were effective in encouraging the cancellation of plans for covert actions in 1979 the carter administration proposed supporting resistance to the marxist government in grenada but the senate intelligence committee raised strong objections and the project was dropped61 in 1983 plans to assist elements opposed to the government of surinam were halted after members of both intelligence committees remained unconvinced that significant us interests were involved62 leaving aside the possibility of shortcircuiting covert action by an opportunistic leak congress always retains the power of persuasion and ultimately of the purse beyond proffering advice congress has as instanced in the series of boland amendments regarding assistance to the nicaraguan contras and in halting involvement in the angolan civil wars in the 1970s prevented the expenditure of funds for specified actions whether it could mandate expenditures for covert action against the contrary determination of president is much less clear there will undoubtedly continue to be controversies over the scope of specific findings and the details required to be included in finding eg how many different activities could be covered in general finding authorizing actions to counter subversion in country x questions may also arise regarding specialized military activities conducted by the department of defense that are essentially similar to those that could be undertaken by cia another major influence that congress has had on the conduct of specific covert actions is through floor debates covert actions in angola afghanistan and most importantly central america have been discussed extensively by both the house and the senate most hearings and deliberations of the two intelligence committees have been closed except for intelligence organization matters and votes on intelligence authorization legislation are taken in secret those who oppose the decisions reached by intelligence committees have however number of vehicles to attack them the most direct way is to propose floor amendment to the intelligence authorization bill but efforts to change funding levels can also be made through the appropriations process 61 gates from the shadows p 143 62 see philip taubman cia reported blocked in plot on surinamese new york times june 1 1983 p a1 crs29 although members are enjoined to avoid discussing classified information in public debates about covert actions can make additional information public that intelligence agencies consider sensitive63 debates can be lengthy and heated if usually short on specific details the chairman of the house intelligence committee representative edward boland described covert action during floor debate the intelligence committee developed its view of this covert action over period of 18 months it first learned of the covert action in december 1981 it was told the effort would involve small number of paramilitary fighters who would be trained and armed to conduct raids against the sandinistas supply of arms to the salvadoran guerrillas gradually however the scope of the program was broadened by the administration they wanted internal political changes in nicaragua today the number of troops supported by the program is in the thousands they are engaged not in efforts to intercept arms shipments but in fighting nicaraguan military units64 debates in the house on covert assistance to the nicaraguan contras on december 8 1982 and july 2728 1983 were among the most contentious in recent history the 1982 debate ultimately resulted in an amendment requiring that funds be provided to groups known to have the intent of overthrowing the government of nicaragua chairman boland defended his committees prerogatives arguing that we ought not to legislate in an area such as this without the benefit of all the facts that is why the intelligence committee was established and its effectiveness depends on its ability to keep the nations secrets and exercise sensible and prudent oversight65 aid had become an important political issue that few members would delegate to the intelligence committee members on all sides found it important to take public position and record their votes thus secrecy requirements and even normal inclination to avoid advertising covert operations were passed over seven months after asking that the house defer to its intelligence committee chairman boland acknowledged that aid to the contras had become major political issue longer just matter for the 14 members of the intelligence committee it is an action that must be justified in the full light of american values american responsibilities and future american involvement66 the house subsequently voted to end aid to the contras but ultimately yielded to the senate in approving some 24 million in the fy1984 defense appropriation act pl 98212 63 some members have reportedly avoided classified briefings in order to avoid the danger of inadvertently revealing secret information in subsequent public discussions 64 congressional record july 27 1983 p h21171 65 congressional record december 8 1982 p h29466 66 congressional record july 27 1983 p h21172 crs30 information obtained from congressional documents and in floor debates was cited by the international court of justice in its june 27 1986 judgment that the united states by training arming equipping financing and supplying the forces or otherwise encouraging supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities in and against nicaragua has acted against the republic of nicaragua in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another state67 it should be noted that the united states did not acknowledge the international courts jurisdiction in this case nor was it represented in the courts proceedings although an analysis of the courts decision lies beyond the scope of this report it is noteworthy that the court made use of official public us documents including congressional documents and floor debates regarding covert actions in central america this usage illustrates the complications arising from open discussion of an operation where it is intended that the role of the united states government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly in summary since the early 1970s congress has asserted significant power to oversee the planning and conduct of covert actions and has demonstrated the capability of denying funds to ongoing covert actions that it does not approve of there is today genuinely shared responsibility for covert actions although some would want to enact stricter reporting requirements profound policy disagreements in the future might however serve to undermine this shared responsibility the clinton administration for its part was reportedly careful to avoid any cia involvement in the supply of weapons for bosnian forces being undertaken by various countries in contravention of embargo furthermore widelyreported training programs of croatian and bosnian military forces have been conducted not under dod or cia auspices but by private us consulting firm military professional resources inc critical observers acknowledge that although privatization of covert efforts provides deniability for us officials the efforts may not be as responsive to us policy direction or standards of accountability as would an undertaking by the cia or dod some even suggest that privatization may be encouraged precisely to avoid notification to congressional committees close congressional scrutiny has become fact of life for intelligence community in planning and undertaking covert actions although few observers seriously propose returning to the looser practices of the 1950s and 1960s some critics charge that the extensive oversight of covert actions and associated requirements for close scrutiny by legal staffs have made the intelligence community as well as the defense department riskadverse they argue that the nation faces wide variety of threats not only from hostile nation states but also from terrorist and criminal organizations operating internationally and that innovative approaches including covert actions need to be attempted even if considerable risks exist 67 international legal materials vol 25 september 1986 pp 10441047 1089 crs31 some observers also express concern that the careful secrecy involved in oversight of covert actions by the two intelligence committees can make it difficult for members to evaluate proposed covert action finding in the context of larger issues of foreign policy for given region if covert action findings are handled on an exceptional basis rather than as one element of larger policy larger goals may be undermined such concerns are not however limited to issues of legislative oversight in the executive branch as well covert actions especially those that are very sensitive may not be thoroughly reviewed by those responsible for related policies outside the intelligence community such difficulties are inherent but may not according to some observers be adequately understood covert actions in practice expectably some covert actions have accomplished their intended purposes and others have failed in some instances covert actions have been considered important adjuncts to policies in other cases they are seen as having undermined important us goals there is unlikely to be widespread agreement on the contribution of covert actions to the accomplishment of us policy goals but sense of the utility of covert actions may however be gained from brief survey of several instances in which they were prominently employed68 in particular the contributions positive and negative of covert actions to us policy goals in italy in the years 19471949 the philippines during the early 1950s and in indonesia zaire cuba vietnam and laos and afghanistan in the 1960s and 1970s should be acknowledged this selection is arbitrary but nonetheless illustrative the irancontra affair in the mid1980s encompassed several covert actions but also included several efforts undertaken outside the customary covert action process in large measure precisely to avoid the consultative procedures that were built into that process western europe the beginnings of the cold war in 19471948 saw senior us officials moving to shore up west european governments against sovietinfluenced communist parties unions and other organized groups in italy the collapse of fascism had provided opportunities for electoral successes by the communist party against conservative and centrist rivals and as the 1948 national elections approached it appeared that communist or communistdominated government could come to power in rome the truman administration put together wideranging program of support to anticommunist elements69 much of this effort such as encouraging italian americans to contact relatives in italy to urge support of noncommunist candidates was public but there was perceived need to give assistance to democratic parties support that could not be provided publicly without endangering the credibility of the recipients special secret funding measures were established another major goal 68 this approach does not address the concerns of those who oppose all covert action on priori principle 69 see sallie pisani the cia and the marshall plan lawrence ks university press of kansas 1991 also james edward miller the united states and italy 19401950 the politics and diplomacy of stabilization chapel hill nc university of north carolina press 1986 crs32 was to ensure that democratic elements were able to get their message across to the italian electorate here again funds were secretly provided to newspapers and other journals the effort succeeded in the crucial april 1948 elections conservative and centrist parties won enough seats to form government even though the communist party garnered significant number of parliamentary seats similar covert efforts were undertaken in other western european countries as prodemocratic forces struggled to establish stable governments in the aftermath of devastating war and ceaseless communist agitation emphasis was placed on financial support and advice to politicians and political and intellectual groups with noncommunist credentials it is difficult if not impossible to separate the contribution made by covert support to such elements from the overall financial and psychological support provided by the united states through the marshall plan and the creation of the north american treaty organization these policies had bipartisan support in the united states at the time although there was significant political opposition to the permanent stationing of us forces in western europe covert support to democratic forces to the extent that it became known did not become source of domestic criticism other covert efforts were aimed at eastern europe and the soviet union itself even within the soviet union networks of resistance fighters were supported although these were gradually suppressed by communist authorities in non communist countries networks were established that were to be activated in the event of feared soviet invasion70 major initiative was the establishment of radio free europe rfe and radio liberty rl to broadcast into eastern europe and the soviet union respectively rfe began broadcasting in 1950 rl in 1953

involve significant numbers of paramilitary operations by cia elements and the efforts that were undertaken in support of military operations were not considered especially successful72 the korean war did however lead to global anticommunist policy that included not only major increase in us treaty commitments worldwide greatly enlarged defense budgets but also an expanded covert action component as the cold war spread far beyond western europe and into the underdeveloped world then emerging from colonial status the emphasis on covert action grew not least because there were limits as to how many american troops could be deployed the effort to support democratic and anticommunist forces was pursued through financial subsidies to friendly foreign leaders journals non communist unions and other organizations it was one element of larger policies aimed at preventing the spread of communist rule and influence to avoid being entirely dependent on conservative and centrist elements that were unreceptive to innovations that the us considered vital cia covert actions were often designed to provide democratic forces on the political left with sufficient resources that they could provide credible alternative to the communists among voters seeking change73 outside europe american officials in both the truman and eisenhower administrations often attempted to avoid tying the us too closely with receding european empires and with the narrow elites that sometimes assumed power immediately after decolonization nevertheless american interests were often seen as requiring cooperation with authoritarian regimes and reformers were often viewed as potentially sympathetic to communists philippines an important instance of the contribution of us covert support occurred in the philippines in the early 1950s the country had received independence from american administration in 1946 but the governing party many of whose members had worked with the occupying japanese was widely perceived as inefficient and corrupt with quiet support from an american officer lt col edward g lansdale working on behalf of the cia the defense minister ramon magsaysay former guerilla fighter against the japanese strove to expose corruption and build competent military force that would not be viewed as part of an oppressive power structure with impressive success in this endeavor magsaysay was chosen president of the philippines in honest elections held in 1953 his tenure 71 continued radio liberty new york praeger 1983 pp 129156 for the subsequent history of the radios see

philippinesstamping out official corruption creating more professional army encouraging rural development through and reform and access to credit and willingness to reintegrate former guerrillas into

problematical for the local populations and even for longrange us interests in iran 1953 and in guatemala 1954 the cia was heavily involved in implementing eisenhower administration policies designed to remove leaders in the two counties who were perceived as sympathetic to communists and hostile to us interests in the wake of postworld war ii tensions over the role of the britishowned company

the cia in covert action known as operation success to provide support to antiarbenz elements in the military the operation culminated in june 1954 coup in which arbenz and his wife left the country as new leadership took office that improved relations with washington and with american commercial interests in guatemala77 indonesia less well known is the cias role in indonesia where the eisenhower administration and its successors were determined to shore up anticommunist elements in opposition to an influential communist party that apparently was gaining influence over president sukarno in the 1950s this effort centered around extensive covert support to separatist elements in various islands of the archipelago after indonesian government forces captured an american pilot engaged in bombing attack in may 1958 however this support was curtailed subsequently support was provided by the cia and other parts of the us government along with other countries to anticommunist elements in the indonesian military after an attempted coup in 1965 by number of leftist military officers alleged to have had chinese support anticommunist officers took control of the government and massive wave of disorder and killing followed throughout the country78 the communist setback in indonesia some have claimed served as counterpart to the subsequent collapse of south vietnam in these cases covert actions were parts of larger policies that also involved the defense and state departments and agencies responsible for international economic policies the cia nonetheless used its influence in limited but tactically effective ways that involved us personnel in little actual violence proamerican regimes in iran guatemala and indonesia emerged critics have charged that in all three cases us

followed by lansdale and magsaysay in the philippines the cia was an integral part of largescale program aimed at building governmental infrastructure within south vietnam although this effort especially prior to 1968 was given much less emphasis than building capability for largescale combat operations considerable portion of the cias responsibilities in south vietnamin program known as phoenixwas directed towards the identification of members of the communist infrastructure william colby subsequent dci who was in charge of the effort in south vietnam for much of the period credited the agency with helping to improve the stability of the south vietnamese government from 1968 to the military invasion by north vietnamese forces in 197580 critical observers charge that the cia effort led to or was part of program for assassinating civilians some of whom were not part of the communist infrastructure but were victimized by corrupt local enemies81 beyond the pacification effort cia undertook considerable work with the hill tribesmen known as montagnards and cia personnel served alongside the militarys special forces the cia also supported the infiltration of agents into north vietnam program administered by the defense department after 1963 that was effectively neutralized by the north vietnamese82 in laos the cia was heavily involved in training and supplying tribesmen that disrupted and attacked north vietnamese forces transiting to south vietnam and in other ground and air operations operating under the direction of the american ambassador in vientiane cia officers assumed paramilitary functions directly supporting combat operations in vietnam so large and complex were these operationsinvolving some 400 cia personnel in laos at certain timesthat

for the cia in southeast asia84 cuba us relations with fidel castro who lead an insurgency that took power in cuba in january 1959 quickly became complex and hostile castros embrace of communism and cultivation of ties to moscow were recognized as direct challenge to us interests the eisenhower and kennedy administrations undertook series of covert actions designed to remove castro including farfetched efforts to provide him with exploding cigars the effort included sponsorship of military expedition to initiate an anticommunist insurgency that came to humiliating failure at the bay of pigs in april 1961 the incompetent effort there may in turn have contributed to the soviet unions willingness to locate surfacetosurface missiles on cuban territory precipitating the missile crisis of 1962 during this period according to the church committee there were at least eight plots to assassinate fidel castro from 1960 to 1965 involving highpowered rifles poison pills poison pens deadly bacterial powders and other devices which strain the imagination85 in these projects the cia worked not only with cuban enemies of castro but also with american underworld figures relations with sovietsupported marxist government in cuba would undoubtedly have been difficult under any circumstances but ciasponsored covert actions especially the bay of pigs invasion and various assassination attempts that became known to castro not only failed to achieve their objectives but according to some observers accelerated cuban dependence on the soviet union other observers point out that all the blame cannot be laid on the cia since crucial decisions were made by senior officials of the kennedy and johnson administrations the full record of covert actions in the complicated us policy towards

of the cia in the early 1970s in supporting elements in chile opposed to the leftist but democratically elected regime of salvador allende was also widely and severely criticized by outside observers and by congressional committees87 according to congressional study the chilean effort involved propagandaplanting articles in local newspapers and journals supporting media friendly to the united states gaining influence in chilean institutions and groups aiding friendly political parties and factions and in specific instances supporting officers involved in planning coup the cia was not directly involved in the final coup against allende that resulted in his death in september 1973 some members of congress were concerned that certain covert efforts in chile had been undertaken without the knowledge of the state and defense departments and that only few had been briefed to congressional oversight committees at time when arguably there was not statutory requirement that congress be informed of covert actions beyond this few members were highly skeptical that the threat posed by an allende government was sufficiently serious to warrant the extensive and expensive covert interventionand to justify the possibility of damaging revelations which in this case occurred88 in large measure the criticisms were directed at the nixon administrations overall policies regarding chile including the application of economic pressures through international financial institutions which were not the responsibility of the intelligence community covert action under attack

1974 floor amendment to foreign assistance bill was introduced by senator james abourezk to halt funding for any activity by us agency in foreign country which would violate the laws of that country although the amendment was defeated by vote of 1768 the exposure of previous abuses led directly to deemphasis on covert actions as well as increased congressional oversight of the operations directorate that had previously operated with minimal outside interference in retrospect it is apparent that the emphasis placed on covert actions in the latter years of the 1950s and the early 1960s was not matched by an equal determination to ensure effective oversight the extent of presidential knowledge of some covert actions remains uncertain plausible deniability often meant in practice according to critics an excessive secrecy and compartmentation resulting in plans made and implemented by intelligence agencies that might not have been approved had they received systematic review by senior policymakers number of other factors also contributed to the bad reputation that covert action had acquired by the 1970s some illjudged projects may have resulted from the fact that dci dulles and others remained in their positions overlong some observers suggest that the mistakes in covert actions in the early 1960s derive from relatively unstructured decisionmaking in the kennedy administration the nixon and ford administrations beset by increasing opposition to us policies in vietnam conducted their policies with an unprecedented degree of secrecy attacks on secret government including intelligence operations were components of generalized opposition to policies that were viewed as focusing narrowly on anticommunism without due appreciation for conditions in disparate

government as noted above the carter administration came into office initially determined to downplay covert actions nonetheless as dci stansfield turner subsequently wrote despite its dedication to human rights and its considerable reservations about the morality of covert actions the carter administration turned easily and quickly to covert devices to respond to some of the despotic acts of cuban and soviet interventions89 beginning in march 1977 the carter administration launched program of covert actions designed to support dissident groups within the soviet union that some observers credit with making substantial contribution to the ultimate dissolution of the regime90 covert actions were also used to counter soviet and cuban initiatives in the third world especially in afghanistan where the us provided various types of assistance to the mujahedin resistance forces even before the soviet invasion of december 1979 91 in central 89 turner secrecy and democracy p 87 90 see especially gates from the shadows pp 135169 91 gates also notes carter proposal for covert action to head off marxist advances supported by cuba on the caribbean island of grenada that received highly unfavorable review by the senate intelligence committee in july 1979 as result cia ceased covert actions relating to grenada gates argues carters effort to respond covertly to the cuban continued crs40 america the carter administration began covert effort to publicize the nature of the sandinista regime that took power in nicaragua in midsummer 1979 and to assist salvadors government in dealing with an insurgency the cia was also involved with the illfated desert one effort in 1980 to rescue us embassy officials being held hostage in tehran these steps not widely advertised at the time arguably reflect willingness to employ covert actions as foreign policy tool at time when most believed that the carter administration was fundamentally hostile to covert operations and an interventionist foreign policy the reagan administration building on earlier covert action programs the reagan administration moved in 1985 to provide the afghan resistance with sophisticated arms intelligence and training to assist them in their struggle against soviet occupation much of the us assistance was provided through pakistan whose government was deeply concerned about soviet military forces in afghanistan this program which included the transfer of shoulderfired antiair missiles which soon became publicly known and was openly debated in congress has been credited with providing the mujahedin with the crucial edge ultimately to force out the soviet occupiers few observers however have maintained that some us covert support to the afghans was subsequently funneled to islamic fundamentalists elsewhere or stolen nonetheless the soviets withdrew from afghanistan in 1989 an event that many observers have regarded as key factor in the unfolding collapse of the soviet system in eastern europe the reagan administration also built upon covert actions initiated earlier although few observers would argue that covert actions had decisive role in the breakup of the warsaw pact support to solidarity in poland and other dissident groups journals and independent trade unions throughout the region led to the advancement of an antisoviet anticommunist agenda at time when moscows grip on its satellite states was loosening angola although not as controversial as support to the nicaraguan contras congressional actions on assistance to the angolan resistance were undertaken in public to an unusual extent in some cases covert actions were widely discussed in the media with reports based on discussions with informed administration sources and leaks from various sources there were also congressional floor debates and even presidential comments92 at one point members of the house intelligence committee complained that of those concerned with covert efforts in afghanistan they were far more constrained than others by secrecy restraints from participating publicly in the debate93 91 continued encroachment on grenada was thwarted by congress now the problem would fester until president reagans use of military force four years later from the shadows p 143 92 president reagan in press conference referred obliquely to covert assistance to unita see interview with representatives of the wire services november 6 1985 public papers of the presidents of the united states ronald reagan 1985 book ii washington government printing office 1988 p 1354 93 see for instance the remarks of representatives hyde and mccurdy congressional record october 17 1990 p h 10046 crs41 covert support to the noncommunist national union for the total independence of angola unita initiated by the ford administration in the aftermath of the collapse of portugals dictatorship and the portuguese empire had been ended in 1976 by congressional initiative94 growing concern about soviet involvement in the third world and especially the continued presence of cuban troops in angola eventually led to the repeal of restrictions imposed earlier95 covert effort to support unita was launched according to media reports at an initial level of 15 million annually and subsequently expanded possibly up to 60 million annually on october 17 1990 the house debated the covert action program in angola at length in the course of considering the fy1991 intelligence authorization bill after defeating one proposed amendment to cut off covert support to angolan parties the house did amend the bill to limit covert support to unita by onevote margin some members opposed all assistance to unita some argued that assistance to unita should be provided openly while others suggested that keeping the us role secret was necessary if other african countries were to facilitate aid deliveries the language on angola was modified in the subsequent conference the bill however never became law the debate served to demonstrate concern with reliance on covert action in that instance and probably intensified the bush administrations efforts to obtain negotiated settlement proponents nevertheless argued that support provided through covert action had given unita the wherewithal to maintain its position and thus it was covert action that provided the basis for negotiated settlement in any event with the collapse of the soviet union and the withdrawal of cuban forces from angola us concerns were significantly diminished by 1990 the bush administration was negotiating with more accommodating soviet leadership to reduce tensions in angola afghanistan as well as cambodia and thus reducing the need for covert actions in those area96 nicaragua and the contras promoting human rights in eastern europe and assisting afghan freedom fighters had bipartisan support and complemented publicly announced policies widespread bipartisan support was however distinctly not present for the reagan administrations most controversial covert actionsassistance to the democratic resistance popularly termed contras in nicaragua who were battling the leftist sandinista government that had come to power in 1979 although as noted above covert support to antisandinista elements had actually begun under president carter the incoming administration substantially increased the size and scope of the effort after 1981 armed opponents of the sandinista regime grew in numbers and were being provided with weapons equipment and training from us sources 94 section 404 of the international security assistance authorization act of 1976 pl 94 329 this was the first congressional initiative to stop covert action through legislation 95 section 811 of the foreign assistance authorization act of 1985 96 see raymond w copson and robert g sutter angola afghanistan and cambodia priorities in support for third world resistance movements crs report 91882f december 5 1991 crs42 opposition to this program arose from concern that many of the contras were adherents of the deposed somoza dictatorship and from fears that us combat forces would at some point be sent to nicaragua combination of additional factorsan atmosphere of distrust between the thendci william casey and congressional oversight committees revelations of an effort in 1984 to mine nicaraguan ports that was to be almost universally condemned in congress and provocative us military exercises in the regionserved to harden opposition to the covert action program especially in the house of representatives over the next few years by extremely narrow margins congress approved halted and then conditionally renewed covert assistance to the nicaraguan resistance series of statutory restrictions was imposed on support provided by the cia and other intelligence agencies to the contras they were popularly known as boland amendments after their sponsor representative edward boland chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence from 1977 to 1984 during the period when the most stringent boland amendment was in effect from october 1984 to december 1985 the cia was forbidden to provide any support to military or paramilitary operations by the contras97 the administration hoped to reverse this legislation but in the meaeaime was determined to keep the contras alive body and soul and sought assistance for the contras from private citizens and from foreign governments in early 1986 the reagan administration decided to press for 100 million in aid for the contras without limitations on the cia or the defense department opinion had shifted to the extent that the proposal gained approval in the house in june after further consideration congress voted for the 100 million as part of an omnibus continuing resolution pl 99591 that president reagan signed on october 30 1986 in resuming aid to the contras congress did not prohibit cia involvement98 but included provisions bitterly resented by cia personnel working with the contras forbidding the provision of training and support in honduras and costa rica within twenty miles of the nicaraguan bordersprecisely the areas where bases were established99 97 this prohibition was however modified by the passage of the international security and development cooperation act pl 9983 and supplemental appropriations act pl 99 88 in august 1985 they provided 27 million in humanitarian assistance to the contras by department or agency other than cia or dod 99 stat 254 324 the appropriations act further specified that nothing prohibited the united states from exchanging information with the nicaraguan democratic resistance 99 stat 325 the intelligence authorization act for fy1986 pl 99169 enacted the following december reportedly allowed in language in the classified schedule of authorizations the cia to provide the contras with training in communications see kagan twilight struggle pp 390391 98 the fy1987 intelligence authorization act pl 99569 did preclude the use of cias contingency fund for assistance beyond the 100 million 99 100 stat 3341307 one writer notes that this provision created crazy quilt of confusing and paradoxical rules cia planes could fly for hours deep inside nicaragua braving sandinista antiaircraft missiles to drop supplies but they couldnt make the quick and comparatively safe hop inside honduras to the bases at the border where thousands of men were waiting for equipment glenn garvin everybody had his own gringo the continued crs43 the efforts to supply the contras had become linked with another covert action designed to encourage through the transfer of sophisticated weapons better relationship with iranian factions who could it was hoped assist in the liberation of american hostages in lebanon funds generated by arms sales to the iranians were to be transferred to the contras when this linkage became public in late 1986 two congressional select committees launched massive investigation that focused in large measure on covert action procedures utilized by the reagan administration separate executive branch investigation headed by former senator john tower also assessed the administrations covert action machinery100 an independent counsel was appointed to investigate allegation of illegal activity and bring prosecutions if necessary the irancontra revelations did not however result in an immediate end of support to the contras funds for the contras continued to be approved albeit in decreasing amounts and were restricted to humanitarian or nonlethal purposes in april 1988 legislation pl 100276 the program was placed under the agency for international development aid with assistance to be delivered through private international relief organizations in the defense appropriations act for fy1989 pl 199463 provisions were set forth for future consideration of providing military assistance to the contras these provisions envisioned role for the cia101 although the cia was not responsible for transferring humanitarian support to the contras press reports in 1988 indicated that the cia was involved in supporting anti sandinista political forces inside nicaragua102 the whole episode led to the most thorough reappraisal of the role of covert actions since the church and pike committee investigations decade earlier the two select committees concluded as had the church committee that covert actions were legitimate function of government but they recommended that findings be in writing that they be made available to congress that they stipulate which agencies are to be involved that they identify participants that the attorney general review them for legality that they should be reassessed after year and recertified if necessary and that requests to foreign countries to undertake covert action on behalf of the united states be treated as covert action the independent counsel investigating the whole irancontra affair concluded that the reagan administration had issued two foreign policy directives that skirted the law and veered off into criminality103 there was widespread criticism of dci casey who had died few 99 continued cia the contras washington brasseys 1992 p 204 100 the tower board was critical of the reagan administrations procedures for planning and implementing covert actions but it made recommendations for legislative initiatives in this area report of the presidents special review board february 26 1987 101 102 stat 227051 102 see congressional quarterly almanac vol 94 1988

report of the independent counsel for irancontra matters vol i investigations and prosecutions washington 1993 p 562 crs44 months after the story became public number of cia operations directorate officials were charged with and convicted of various offenses virtually all observers would probably agree however that the cias performance during the irancontra period with acknowledged shortcomings was preferable to situation in which nsc staff officers worked on an ad hoc basis with private donors and an assortment of arms dealers and middlemen if covert actions are to be undertaken by the us government most observers agree that the experience in nicaragua demonstrates that there are substantial advantages to be secured by having wellorganized and experienced agency in charge the cia is moreover far more accountable to congress than the nsc staff the extent to which covert support to the contras aided the eventual return to democracy in nicaragua remains in dispute clearly the presence of forces in nicaragua was major concern to the sandinista leadership and provided an inducement to the regime to hold free elections in 1990 despite previous reluctance equally clearly the contras were kept in being at several points because of support provided by the united states at the same time other observers point out that the growing weakness of the soviet union meant that the sandinistas could not look to foreign superpower for protection and thus had to accede to international pressure for elections covert action continued as an important policy tool of the reagan and bush administrations support to the solidarity movement in poland and to other democratic movements in eastern europe was provided in part covertly aid to the afghan resistance was undoubtedly significant factor in enabling the resistance eventually to mount effective attacks on soviet forces aid provided to cambodian elements was intended to counteract the influence of soviet chinese and vietnamese support to nondemocratic factions similar motivations applied in angola as described above during the persian gulf war covert actions some undertaken by cia some by military forces were component of the allied war effort that contributed to the defeat of the iraqi army the clinton administration in the clinton administration dcis woolsey and deutch have spoken of covert actions with neither the enthusiasm of allen dulles nor with the skepticism of stansfield turner in september 1995 dci deutch suggested that the us needs to maintain and perhaps even expand covert action as policy tool104 reliable reports have suggested that covert actions have been initiated by the cia in recent years without the appropriate notice to congress revelations in april 1996 that the clinton administration was officially aware of iranian arms transfers to bosnia have led to number of investigations by congressional committees the administration denied that us intelligence personnel in any way assisted in these arms transfers and thus there was us covert action105 the 104 r jeffrey smith expansion of covert action eyed washington post september 13 1995 p a7 105 see ken katzman julie kim

states role in iranian continued crs45 iraqi armys attacks on kurdish elements in late summer 1996 led to reports that the cia had been supporting groups opposed to saddam hussein committing some 100 million since 1991106 there is comparative wealth of evidence that has been published on few covert operations such as those in chile zaire cuba and the irancontra affair but much less is known on others that may or may not have been more successful there is little public sense of the role of more routine and less dramatic covert efforts to influence opinion in foreign countries over span of almost five decades the available record does show the effectiveness and limitations of some covert actions it suggests at the least that covert actions should be viewed in larger policy contexts few if any observers would suggest that covert action program matter how well executed can save doomed policy most would also agree that at least some policies can be effectively supported with prudent covert initiatives 105 continued arms transfers to croatia and bosnia concluded that while the us ambassador to croatia may have overstepped the bounds of traditional diplomatic activity and engaged in covert activity cia officers at several levels correctly refused to participate in the implementation of what the subcommittee termed green light policy towards iranian arms shipments in public statement it argued further that because cia officials rightly insisted on proper legal authorization for the change in us policy to the green light policy and if required notification of congress the

1996 p a1 crs46 conclusion covert action has been significant component of us foreign policy in the postworld war ii world the reports of the church pike and irancontra committees provided wealth of detailed information about the history of covert actions undertaken by the united states but that information is far from comprehensive good deal was left out and much has happened since the reports were completed the considerable amount of information currently available has not yielded consensus on the value of covert action programs to the country the question remains controversial but as additional information is gradually declassified it will be possible to gain better appreciation for the importance of the programs that are known if the united states were to deny itself the covert action option it would be forced to rely more heavily on other military diplomatic and economic instruments of power some opportunities would have to be foregone and some temptations foreclosed this is an option with few influential supporters among policymakers and informed observers even though covert actions continue to have controversial reverberations the planning and conduct of covert actions has become regularized within the government increasingly they have become shared responsibility of the executive and legislative branches substantial body of statutory law and precedent has come to govern the planning and conduct of covert actions covert actions cannot legally be initiated without presidential approval unless the president is prepared to risk bitter constitutional dispute notice of covert actions must also be given to appropriate members of congress congress tacitly endorses or withholds approval from covert actions in authorizing legislation it can also selectively deny them funds current laws and procedures appear to have fairly deep bipartisan support there are few observers especially at times when congress and the white house are under the control of different political parties who would advocate removal of the guidelines and restrictions that have been developed over the past quartercentury there are however more than few who argue that once covert actions are underway legislative micromanagement should be sharply curtailed the desirable size of the intelligence community and its budget are disputed and covert capabilities will presumably be affected even though they are not central in this dispute questions currently do exist regarding the organizational arrangements for planning and conducting covert actions despite the unwillingness of the 104th congress to readjust the role of cias operations directorate some informed observers continue to urge consideration of various differing proposals most informed observers acknowledge the complexity of the issue as well as the substantial merits of opposing arguments there are clear advantages in having officials responsible for covert actions closely associated with human intelligence collectors and with analysts there would also be clear advantages in removing analysts and perhaps collectors from the inherently secretive and potentially violent environment of covert actions designing covert action capability continues to be hampered by the absence of an overriding national security policy this may become the normal state of affairs crs47 single event such as the berlin blockade of 1948 may galvanize washington policymakers and the american public around new policy framework at the same time there are indeed geopolitical concerns in europe and asia that could become very serious further possession of weapons of mass destruction could allow even an obscure terrorist group to pose an extraordinary threat to vital us interests the line between national security and law enforcement has become blurred with narcotics smuggling and countermeasures being the most important example some observers in addition to novelist tom clancy have envisioned using intelligence operatives to destroy narcotics production and transport facilities in 1989 presidentially appointed commission on aviation security and terrorism recommended use of covert actions in certain situations to preempt disrupt or respond to terrorist actions107 in the absence of an overarching national security policy capabilities for covert action will probably be maintained with one eye on potential threats and opportunities and the other on costs and uncertain domestic backing those in the cia responsible for planning and undertaking covert actions as well as their executive branch and congressional overseers will probably move with caution and undoubtedly in the view of some critics with excessive caution 107 report of the presidents commission on aviation security and terrorism august 4 1989 p 115 crs48 appendix dod and covert action eo 12333 specifically authorizes the cia to conduct special activities approved by the president and adds in section 18e that agency except the cia or the armed forces of the united states in time of war declared by congress or during any period covered by report from the president to the congress under the war powers resolution 87 stat 855 may conduct any special activity unless the president determines that another agency is more likely to achieve particular objective the extent to which presidents have made such determinations is not publicly known but this provision suggests that the defense department may be assigned responsibilities for certain types of covert action even in peacetime in some areas an official dod presence could provide cover for covert operators and when combat or peacekeeping operations are underway it may be more logical for the military commanders to conduct covert actions or special operations requiring degree of deniability and thus fairly described as covert actions in direct support of operating forces in the past the navy has acted covertly to protect its ships and installations ground and air forces have also employed agents for certain operations the defense humint service dhs established in 1995 centralizes most dod capabilities for human intelligence collection it incorporates defense attaches who undertake open collection of information as part of their regular duties and other civilian and military humint collectors the dhs may also according to press reports have some capability for covert actions although other dod components outside the intelligence community might also be involved especially in paramilitary operations deployments of military intelligence personnel serving in clandestine intelligence collection units have been recognized as falling within the national security acts definition of intelligence activity about which congress must be kept fully and currently informed in accordance with the national security act of 1947 as amended108 in the intelligence authorization act for fy1991 pl 10288 the defense department was given authority to establish commercial enterprises that would provide security ie cover for intelligence collection activities undertaken overseas by dod personnel similar to arrangements previously approved for the cia and the fbi such cover usually consists of civilian business which can shelter intelligence collectors in areas where us embassy officials would be suspect the house report accompanying the fy1991 legislation stipulated that the department of defense may not engage in the commercial activities authorized by this legislation 108 see us congress house of representatives 103d congress 1st session committee of conference intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 1994 house report 103377 november 18 1993 pp 2829 crs49 to provide cover for covert action109 this authority was extended for an additional three years in the intelligence authorization act for fy1996 pl 10493 given the involvement of dod units in human intelligence collection and related activities there is inevitably potential for duplication of effort or failures of coordination with other parts of the intelligence community and with congressional oversight committees110 the term special operations as used by the defense department covers multitude of functions some of which are functionally equivalent to covert actions including some of those undertaken by the cia111 special operations by military units are ordinarily related to other military missions or hostage rescue operations normally they would not extend to efforts to influence foreign public opinion or political policies nonetheless the dividing line is not necessarily sharp and the possibility exists that special operations might at some point be undertaken by dod to avoid complications arising out of compliance with laws that regulate covert actions both the commission on the roles and capabilities of the intelligence community the aspinbrown commission and the house intelligence committees ic21 study have recommended that humint collection be consolidated in the cia and such step presumably might constrain dods ability to undertake at least certain types of covert action the ic21 study advocated the creation of clandestine service under the dci that would include military personnel engaged in humint operations this step might constrain the ability of military attaches to conduct their overt collection activities by appearing to tie them to the cia in some cases however covert actions are undertaken by cia in direct support of military operations conducted by the defense department they can become necessary when it is imprudent for diplomatic or other reasons to insert us military personnel into given area this was especially the case during the vietnam war in 109 us
