close proximity to cranes garnered congressional attention after tower cranes were involved in multiple fatalities at buildings under construction in 2008 eg nine deaths in two incidents in new york city additional cranerelated fatalities occurred since the house education and labor committee held hearing on construction worker safety in june 2008 including four employees of louisianabased construction firm who died when the contractors mobile crane fell at houston refinery construction historically has been the most hazardous industry as measured by number of fatalities with 1178 out of 4956 onthejob fatalities in the private sector in 2007 other industry ranks higher than construction the majority of construction deaths usually result from falls and transportation accidents eg 38 and 24 respectively in 2007 according to the classification system of the us bureau of labor statistics census of fatal occupational injuries in contrast most construction fatalities involving cranes are caused by contact with objects and equipment eg struck by falling crane in 2007 contact with objects and equipment accounted for 71 of cranerelated deaths of workers in the construction industry an analysis of the occupational safety and health administrations osha files of construction fatalities involving cranes most frequently found violations of the following federal construction safety standard 29 cfr 1926 subpart ncranes derricks hoists elevators and escalators oshas crane and derrick standard has been virtually unchanged since its promulgation in 1971 in july 2002 notice of intent to create negotiated rulemaking committee osha acknowledged that industry consensus standards had been updated and crane technology had changed considerably over three decades the crane and derrick negotiated rulemaking advisory committee cdac voted favorably on an extensive revision to the standard and submitted draft regulatory language to osha in july 2004 after proceeding through the rulemaking process for four years osha submitted draft proposed rule for review to the office of management and budget omb omb completed its review on august 28 2008 the proposed rule was published in the federal register on october 9 2008 it appears to largely reflect cdacs recommendations eg operator certification public comments and hearing requests about the proposed rule initially were due by december 8 2008 the comment period was extended to january 22 2009 although most of the 21 states that operate their own safety and health programs for private sector workers have adopted oshas standards some have set more stringent regulations for specific hazards in certain industries for example many of these states require certification of crane operators california connecticut hawaii minnesota nevada new jersey new mexico new york oregon utah and washington to protect the safety and property of their residents other jurisdictions have promulgated regulations requiring operator certification as well massachusetts montana rhode island west virginia washington dc miamidade county chicago angeles new orleans new york city and omaha

source created b the congre ssional research service from t h census of fatal occu pational in juries fairly similar picture of the leading causes of construction fatalities emerges from analyses prepared annually by the university of tennessees construction industry research and policy center cirpc for osha6 historically fall fromthrough roof has been the most frequent cause of fatalities in the construction industry and fall fromwith structure other than roof has been the second leading cause this is borne out in the cirpcs analysis of osha inspection records of 780 fatal events and 800 fatally injured workers in the construction industry in 2006 falls fromthrough roof caused almost 13 of all fatal events 98 events and 99 deaths and falls fromwith structures caused about 9 of all fatal events 72 events and deaths 7 the third leading cause in 2006 was crushedrunover of nonoperator by operating construction equipment which produced 8 of the industrys fatal events 63 events and

fourthleading cause in 2005 but in 2006 it dipped to fifth place with 57 fatal events and deaths or about 7 of the total on the basis of oshas inspection data and cirpcs classification system large minority of fatal events in the construction industry usually are due to these five factors in 2006 they accounted for 45 of fatal events

trades contractors another 13 workers who died in cranerelated construction accidents were employed by firms erecting buildings in that year primarily nonresidential buildings cranes played role in five fatalities at companies engaged in heavy and civil engineering construction eg highways and bridges in 2007 over the years the second highest annual incidence of cranerelated fatalities occurred in one or the other of these two subsectors of construction firms the cpwrcenter for construction research and training of the building and construction trades department of the aflcio utilized the

injured in cranerelated incidents over the 19922006 period the cirpc decided to reanalyze osha inspection data over the 19912002 period focusing on fatalities that involved cranes or derricks because of the increased importance of cranes to the construction industry and activity to update oshas crane and derrick standard13 cirpc conservatively estimated that the machinery played role in 600 fatal events or 8 of all fatal events 7479 in the construction industry investigated by osha compliance officers between 1991 and 2002 the cirpc researchers also read 125 case files of osha investigations of construction fatalities involving cranes between 1997 and 200314 regarding the types of cranes involved in fatal incidents mobile cranes represented 884 percent of the fatalities15 tower cranes

subpart l scaffolds subpart r steel erection and subpart k electrical followed because most of the construction workers who died in cranerelated events were riggers17 and laborers the cirpc reports authors suggested that persons working in these occupations should receive training in the hazards of working in proximity to cranes in contrast the cpwrthe center for construction research and training reports authors recommended that the qualifications of riggers be certified the cirpc researchers asserted that several types of crane related construction fatalities will not be reduced until crane operators are required to be qualified andor certified 18 the cpwr researchers further recommended that crane operators be certified by nationally accredited testing organization the cpwr would have crane inspectors be certified as well the cirpc report additionally proposed having diligent competent person responsible for lifting operations because oftentimes competent person was present at the site of cranerelated fatality but did not act in diligent manner in assuring safety at the work 13 construction industry research and policy center university of tennessee cranerelated

inspectioncertification records verification criteria for the structural adequacy of crane components and stability testing requirements in july 2004 the members who had been appointed to the crane and derrick negotiated rulemaking advisory committee cdac year earlier voted favorably on an extensive revision of the safety standard one of the most difficult and last issues to be resolved concerned verification of the skills of crane operators23 under the existing standard the qualifications of operators need not be validated the cdac draft regulatory language requires certification of crane operators and provides procedural options for doing so eg certification by an accredited operator testing organization24 the cdac consensus document contains language that is much more comprehensive and precise than the existing standard25 for example to supplement the 1971 rule having the employer follow the manufacturers instructi ons when assembling and disassembling ad cranes the cdac draft regulations include detailed list of hazards an ad supervisor must address in order to protect employees the draft language also focuses much more than the existing standard on the specific hazard of operating crane near power lines in addition the c dac consensus document addresses such other key issues as adequacy of ground conditions for crane setup to help prevent tipovers qualification requirements for signal persons updated requirements for cranes located on barges and safety devices operational aids signals specific types of equipment such as derricks and tower cranes inspections wire rope prototype design and testing crushing and overhead hazards fall protection and equipment modification 26 cdac submitted the consensus regulatory language to osha in

highlighted concerns of small businesses about fall protection inspections and ground conditions among other things it urged osha to address these matters also in october 2006 oshas advisory committee on construction safety and health accsh unanimously approved the draft rule in its then current form and encouraged the agency to quickly move it forward through the rulemaking process 29 at january 2008 meeting of accsh some memb ers expressed frustration at the yearslong delay in issuing proposed rule the director of oshas office of construction standards and guidance explained to the accsh that the cdac proposal was very detailed which made writing history explanation and justification in the preamble very timeconsuming the director also noted that other standards moving through the agencys rulemaking process competed for his offices limited resources 30 in may 2008 the director of oshas office of construction standards and guidance again appeared at meeting of the accsh and informed it that an economic impact analysis of the draft standard had been completed31 the labor departments policy planning board completed its review and the proposed rule was submitted to omb in june for up to 90 days of review individuals met with omb in summer 2008 about the proposed standard among those at the four meetings were representatives of organized labor eg international union of operating engineers international association of bridge structural ornamental and reinforcing iron workers and management eg specialized carriers rigging association steel erectors association of america as well as other interested parties eg nations builders insurance national commission for the certification of crane operators most of these groups reportedly want the updated standard to move forward with the national association of home builders urging differentiation between light mobile cranes and large industrial cranes so that the rule can properly address the needs and safety requirements for residential and light commercial crane use 32 on august 28 2008 omb completed its review of the draft proposed standard the proposed rule was published in the federal register on october 8 2008 pp 5971459954 it appears to largely reflect the regulatory language approved by cdac members in 2004 and requests comment on those issues raised by the sbrefa panel public comments and

ground conditions sets out requirements at proposed sections 19261403 through 19261406 to ensure worker safety while equipment is being assembled and disassembled for example supervision of the processincluding erecting and dismantling tower cranesmust be done by an assemblyd isassembly ad supervisor who is defined as both competent and qualified individual proposed section 19261435 addresses itself to tower cranes alone although subpart n addresses power line hazards by specifying minimum distance that must be maintained between the equipment and an energized power line there is only one preventive measure to help operators not breach that distance implementation of various croachment prevention measures are required eg use of dedicated spotter to communicate with the crane operator about distance from power lines power line safety is addressed in proposed sections 19261407 through 19261411 cdac members proposed that an individual conducting certain types of inspections eg shift and monthly equipment inspections be competent person and other types of inspections eg annualcomprehensive equipment inspection qualified personwho by definition has higher level of expertise than competent person but like subpart n proposed section 19261412 does not require testingevaluation of an equipment inspectors qualifications the proposed rule does specify procedure to ensure that signal persons have qualifications sufficient to perform their jobs however 33 referring to the increase in cranerelated accidents since the cdac document issued osha requests public comment on whether similar protocol is needed for those who inspect cranes at the behest of the sbrefa panel the agency also requests comment on the required documentation associated with inspections to ensure that operators are qualified cdac offered employers four options 1 operator certification by an accredited independent cranederrick testing organization 2 qualification by an employers own audited testing program 3 qualification by the us military of its civilian federal employees and 4 licensing by government entity that follows the same test content administration and related criteria required under the first option this requirement at section 19261427 would not go into effect until four years after the final rules effective date as cdac had proposed in addition to asking that osha request public comment about the certificationqualification of operators 34 the sbrefa panel also recommended the agency request comment about issues related to the training of operators proposed section 19261430 33 under proposed section 19261428 signal persons qualifications the employer has two methods to ensure the competence of these individuals 1 the signal person would have documentation from third party qualified evaluator showing that the evaluator had determined that the signal person meets the sections requirements and 2 an employers own qualified evaluator would have determined that signal person meets the qualifications requirements 34 the sbrefa panel expressed concern that there would be enough accredited crane operator testing entities and that many employers would be unable to set up and maintain an audited employer program under option 2 consequently it recommended osha ask for public comment on whether option 1 should be expanded to allow an accredited educational institution to administer tests to operators the panel raised other related issues eg continued

operation who instructs all personnel involved cdac members additionally call for the development of plan by qualified person before beginning such an operation if the qualified person concludes that engineering knowledge is necessary for planning purposes the employer must make certain it is provided further implementation of the plan must be supervised by competent and qualified person lastly

programs for private or public sector workers have adopted oshas standards 35 some have developed their own regulations concerning specific hazards in certain industries for example according to osha s 2001 report on stateplan activities36 oregon requires certification for operators of cranes that are five tons or more the california division of occupational safety and health dosh inspects tower cranes twice year dosh must be notified 24 hours in advance whenever tower crane begins operation is climbed or dismantledand when mobile tower crane begins operation subsequently california required certification of crane operators and made other changes to its standard 37 hawaii nevada and new mexico among others also are identified by osha in its 2001 report as being among stateplan states having their own crane regulations both hawaii and new mexico require that hoist machine operators be certified for example 38 nevada instituted stricter crane regulations in 1997 after crane collapse in laughlin resulted in three fatalities the regulations require nevadas occupational safety and health administration oversight when cranes are erected or taken down and require contractors to cordon off areas around cranes carrying particul arly heavy loads the law also requires cranes to undergo continued accommodations for operators with low literacy levels and limited eng lish proficiency bout which osha is requesting public comment 35 section 18 of the occupational safety and health act encourages states to develop and operate their own programs which must be deemed by osha to be at least as effective as comparable federal standards osha provides up to 50 of the operating costs of an approved plan alaska arizona california connecticut hawaii indiana iowa kentucky maryland michigan
