of north koreas inclusion on the us list of terrorismsupporting countries has been major issue in usnorth korean diplomacy since 2000 particularly in connection with negotiations over north koreas nuclear program north korea has demanded that the clinton and bush administration remove north korea from the terrorism support list on june 26 2008 president bush announced that he was officially notifying congress of his intent to remove north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism after the 45 calenderday notification period to congress as required by us law the white house stated an intention to remove north korea on august 11 2008 this announcement was part of the measures the bush administration took on june 26 to implement nuclear agreement that it negotiated with north korea in september 2007 and finalized details of in april 2008 at usnorth korean meeting in singapore the president also announced that he was immediately lifting sanctions on north korea under the us trading with the enemy act north koreas obligations under this nuclear agreement are to allow the disabling of its plutonium facility at yongbyon and present to the united states and other government in the six party talks declaration of its nuclear programs north korea submitted its declaration on june 26 2008 however in july 2008 the bush administration proposed system of intrusive international inspections of north korean nuclear facilities or suspected nuclear facilities north korea rejected the proposal suspended the disablement of yongbyon and threatened to resume operations of its nuclear facilities in october 2008 the administration negotiated more limited verificationinspection system with north korea on october 11 2008 the administration removed north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism the bush administration increasingly took the position that the issue of north koreas kidnapping of japanese citizens was not linked to removing north korea from the terrorism list from the standpoint of us law or policy the japanese government objected to the removal of north korea the state department continued to declare that north korea had not committed terrorist act since 1987 however reports from french japanese south korean and israeli sources described recent north korean programs to provide arms and training to hezbollah in lebanon and the tamil tigers in sri lanka two groups on the us list of international terrorist organizations moreover large body of reports describe longstanding collaborative relationship between north korea and the

sponsors of terrorism the removal came as part of usnorth korean agreement on establishing mechanisms for verifying north koreas declaration of elements of its plutonium nuclear program north korea had issued the declaration on june 26 2008 president bush announced that he had sent to congress notification of his intent to remove north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism after 45 calendar days under us law the president is required to notify congress 45 days before removing country from the list if congress did not approve legislation to block north koreas removal during the 45day period the president would have been free to remove north korea any congressional legislation to block removal would have had to be signed by the president and could have been subjected to presidential veto the white house said that the presidents intention was to remove north korea on august 11 2008 at the end of the 45day notification period 1 the usnorth korean nuclear agreement embodied in the measures of june 26 2008 consists of two obligations each that north korea and the bush administration have agreed to fulfill north korea is to allow process of disablement of its plutonium nuclear facilities at yongbyon the disablement process began in october 2007 the bush administration claimed that eight of eleven components of the disablement process had been completed and that close to 50 of nuclear fuel rods in the yongbyon nuclear reactor had been removed 2 north koreas second obligation is to provide the united states and other members of the six party talks on north koreas nuclear program with complete and correct declaration of nuclear programs the united states two obligations under the agreement are to terminate economic sanctions on north korea under the us trading with the enemy act and remove north korea from us list of state sponsors of terrorism however in the white house statement of june 26 president bush stated that removal of north korea from the terrorism support list was dependent on north korea agreeing to verification system to verify the contents of its declaration the administration reportedly submitted to north korea in july 2008 plan for verification system that would have allowed inspectors to visit nearly any site throughout north korea north korea rejected the us proposal and the bush administration did not re move north korea on august 11 2008 when the 45day congressional notification period ended north korea then announced cessation of the disablement program at yongbyon and an intention to resume operation of its plutonium reprocessing plant at yongbyon 3 assistant secretary of state christopher hill went to pyongyang in early october 2008 and negotiated verification deal reportedly of more limited scope concentrating inspections on only yongbyon4 north korea agreed and announced resumption of disablement secretary of state condolee zza rice announced on october 11 2008 that north korea was removed

north koreas inclusion on the us list of state sponsors of terrorism has been in usnorth korean diplomacy since 2000 but three stages are of particular importance the first in 2000 in clinton administrationnorth korean negotiations the second during the 20032004 six party negotiations over the north korean nuc lear issue and the third in the diplomacy around the six party nuclear agreement of february 2007 until 2000 the core element of usnorth korean diplomacy was the agreed framework which washington and pyongyang signed in october 1994 it dealt primarily with north koreas nuclear program but us obligations specified in the agreed framework included ec onomic and diplomatic measures however the issue of removal of north korea from the us terrorism list was omitted from the agreement the issue appears not to have been major object of the negotiations in 1994 in october 1999 the clinton administration unveiled the perry initiative toward north korea formulated under the direction of william perry former secretary of defense the perry initiative primarily sought new round of usnorth ko rean negotiations over north koreas missile program the perry initiative report of october 1999 stated that if north korea agreed to verifiable cessation of its missile program the united states would provide series of economic and diplomatic benefits to north korea leading to normalization of usnorth korean relations 6 the clinton administration sought an early visit of high level north korean official to washington to obtain substantive negotiations7 north korea however began to demand several preconditions for high level visit beginning in february 2000 one of these was removal of north korea from the us list of terrorismsupporting countries north korea reportedly persisted in this demand well into the summer of 2000 before finally relenting the high level envoy visited washington in october 2000 the terrorism list issue receded until 2003 when new round of usnorth korean diplomacy ensued this round was precipitated by the bush administrations assertion that north korea admitted in october 2002 to us diplomats that it was operating secret uranium enrichment program the administration declared the secret program violation of the agreed framework and began to end us obligations under the agreed framework north korea retaliated by reopening nuclear facilities that had been frozen under the agreed framework expelling 5 aso expresses dissatisfaction over us delisting of n korea october 14 2008 6 review of united states policy toward north

japan at six party talks in august 2003 north korea demanded that in return for north korean concessions on the nuclear issue the united states agree to number of us concessions including removing north korea from the us list of terrorismsupporting countries north korea made its demand more specific in december 2003 when it issued revised proposal centered on freeze of north koreas plutonium nuclear programs but not the uranium enrichment program this proposal restated north korean demands for multiple concessions in return for freeze removal from the terrorism support list was near the top of the list 8 north korea reiterated its demand at the six party meetings in february and june 2004 in the context of its freeze proposal the third stage began after north koreas test of an atomic

longer is engaged in terrorism 2 provide evidence that it has not engaged in any terrorist act in the past six months 3 join international antiterrorism agreements and 4 address issues of past support of terrorism 9 in consulting us allies south korea stated that the united states need not consider north korean terrorism against south korea in responding to north koreas demand and that the kim daejung administration in seoul favored removal of north korea from the us list of terrorismsupporting countries 10 japan however strongly urged the clinton administration to make redre ss of north korean terrorist acts against japan conditions for removing north korea from the list japan specifically cited north koreas kidnapping of at least ten japanese citizens and north koreas harboring of japanese red army terrorists since the 1970s11 the us state department had cited north koreas harboring of japanese red army terrorists as reason for north koreas inclusion on the us list of terrorism

officials began to raise the kidnapping issue with the north korea in negotiations over the terrorism list japan intensified diplomacy on the terrorism issue in september and october 2000 as the united states prepared to receive the high ranking north korean official and as japan prepared for bilateral normalization talks with north korea japan urged the clinton administration to raise japans concerns over terrorism in the high level usnorth korean exchanges of october 2000 and not to remove north korea from the terrorism list 13 the visit to washington of north korean military leader jo myongrok on october 912 2000 produced two general usnorth korean statements opposing terrorism however the stat departments north korea policy coordinator wendy sherman said on october 12 that secretary albrights planned visit to pyongyang did not mean that the clinton administration would remove north korea from the terrorism list north korea she said knows what it needs to do 14 the impact of japans entreaties were demonstrated during albrights visit to north korea in the first ever meeting between an american official and north korean leader kim jongil albright raised the issue of the kidnapped japanese she reported to japanese foreign minister kono yohei that in her meetings with kim jongil i brought up the abduction issue time and again i told him that this issue was important not only to japan but also to the united states as well kono reportedly expressed satisfaction saying she seems to have thought about japan15 the clinton administration thus decided in late 2000 to give japans concerns over terrorism higher priority in us negotiations with north korea over the us terrorism list this in effect lowered the priority of south koreas position in us policy

there were at least three components to the bush administrations policy regarding north koreas inclusion on the terrorismsupporting list after the agreed framework collapsed and the six party talks began in 2003 the first was the us response to north koreas demand at the six party talks for removal from the list second was the raising by us officials of the danger that north korea would provide nuclear biological or chemical weapons to terrorist groups like qaeda the third was the emphasis given to the japanese kidnapping in state department statements on north koreas inclusion on the list of terrorismsupporting countries until june 2004 the bush administration took the position that it would not discuss issues in usnorth korean relations including the terrorismsupport list until north korea agreed to and took concrete steps to dismantle it nuclear programs in line with this stance the administration refused to submit any comprehensive us proposal at the six party talks the administrations position changed in june 2004 apparently because of pressure from us allies japan and south korea and heightened criticism of the administrations position from china at the six party meeting in june 2004 the administration proposed detailed plan in which north korea would freeze its nuclear programs and submit to international verification during threemonth 12 us department of

full dismantlement of all nuclear programs once north korea had met the requirements of the preparatory period the united states would begin negotiations with north korea on other issues including the terrorismsupport list16 the bush administration has linked north koreas kidnapping of japanese citizens to the six party talks and to the terrorismsupport list when the bush administration took office in 2001 it reportedly assured japan including the families of suspected kidnapping victims that the united states would continue to raise the kidnapping issue with north korea and would not remove north korea from the us list of terrorismsupporting countries 17 in the six party talks us assistant secretary of state james kelly stated several times to the north korean delegates that north korea should settle the kidnapping issue with japan in april 2004 the state department emphasized the kidnapping of japanese in its justification for north koreans inclusion on the us list of terrorismsupporting countries as part of the departments annual report on international terrorism18 the state departments patterns of global terrorism 2003 described kim jongils admission of north korean kidnapping during his meeting with japanese prime minister koizumi in september 2002 and that japannorth korea negotiations over the issue were continuing coffer black the state departments top counterterrorism official stated upon the release of the report that the kidnapping issue was key factor in the reports designation of north korea as state sponsor of terrorism19 during this period president bush vice president cheney and national security adviser condoleezza rice made public statements pledging to support japan at his summit meeting with prime minister koizumi in may 2003 president bush stated abduction is an abominable act the united states supports japan completely until we find out the whereabouts of each and every japanese citizen who has been abducted by north korea20 condoleezza rice described the kidnapping issue as priority also for the united states that we abhor what the north koreans have done21 in april 2004 vice president cheney said in tokyo that

in may 2004 koizumi again traveled to pyongyang and secured the release of 6 children of the 5 japanese however the issue quickly reached an impasse japan harbored doubts about the truthfulness of

identification in 2006 the japanese government added 3 other missing japanese citizens to its list of japanese kidnapped by north korea in japan publicized claims also emerged that north korea had kidnapped up to several hundred japanese the bush administration supported koizumis efforts but reportedly pressed the japanese government not to reciprocate with financial aid to north korea before the nuclear and missile issues with north korea were resolved the administration urged koizumi prior to each visit to press north korea for policy changes on the nuclear issue japan reportedly complied with the us urgings 23 these urgings pointed up the overall importance of japan to us policy toward north korea and thus the broader influence of the kidnapping issue as participant in the six party talks japan was viewed as crucial in any settlement of the nuclear or missile issues that involved reciprocal economic or financial benefits to north korea as far back as the perry initiative in 19992000 us officials acted on the assumption that any settlement of the nuclear and missile issues with north korea would require major japanese financial contribution 24 japan promised north korea billions of dollars in aid as part of normalization of relations but japan specified that normalization depends on settlement of the nuclear missile and kidnapping issues25 the bush administration pressed japan to condition aid first to the nuclear issue at the six party talks in june 2004 the bush administration put forth detailed settlement proposal under which north korea would receive heavy oil in the initial stage of settlement process financed by japan and south korea the united states also offered north korea negotiations on resolving north koreas broader energy and electricity needs which also undoubtedly would require substantial japanese financial input on the other hand the bush administration discussed with japan the imposition of economic sanctions on north korea japan joined the proliferation security initiative in 2003 which president bush proposed to stifle the proliferation activities of states like north korea in 2006 japan imposed strong economic sanctions on north korea when the united nations security council approved sanctions in response to north koreas missile tests of july 2006 and atomic bomb test of october 2006

implications for the terrorism list issue tactically the administration abandoned its opposition to bilateral talks with north korea and actively sought bilateral meetings with pyongyang moreover assistant secretary of state christopher hill used these meetings in late november 2006 and midjanuary 2007 to negotiate actively the details of the six party agreement that was announced on february 13 2007 the second change under the ricehill strategy has been in the us policy objective toward north koreas nuclear programs and weapons dismantlement of pyongyangs nuclear programs and weapons remains as the official bush administration policy goal but the february 2007 six party agreement says little about dismantlement the two phases outlined in the agreement focus on freezing north korean nuclear facilities in the first phase to be completed in 60 days then disablement of all existing nuclear facilities and disclosure by north korea of all nuclear programs in the second phase that has time deadline the february 2007 agreement thus signals an apparent policy objective of containment of north koreas nuclear programs and nuclear weapons development limiting their size and scope the bush administration continues to cite full nuclear dismantlement as its goal for 2008 however in the limited number of months left of an actively functioning bush administration prior to the us presidential election campaign starting in september 2008 the most realistic prospect of success is negotiating and implementing the two phases of this six party agreement or at least partial implementation the dismantlement issue likely will be left for the us administration that comes into office in january 2009 consequently this scenario appears to have influenced the bush administration to delink total dismantlement as primary condition for removal of north korea from the terrorism list and to link removal with lesser north korean steps in the february 2007 agreement particularly disablement of the yongbyon plutonium nuclear facilities and declaration of its nuclear programs thus the third change under the ricehill strategy has been to link removal from the terrorism exclusively to successful north korean implementation of its obligations under phase two of the february 2007 nuclear agreement beginning with the hillkim kyegwan meeting of november 2829 2006 and especially in their meeting in berlin in january 2007 hill reportedly said that the bush administration would remove north korea from the us list of state sponsors of terrorism if north korea dismantled its nuclear programs 26 in the february 2007 agreement the administration agreed to begin the process of removing the dprk from the list27 north korea also may have increased the incentive for the bush administration to strengthen this linkage the south korean newspaper jongang ilbo quoted diplomatic source knowledgeable on the new york talks between hill and kim kyegwan on march 56 2007 that kim asserted that if the united states took steps to normalize relations north korea could disable the yongbyon nuclear installations within year ie march 2008 kim specifically mentioned as key step the removal of north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism28 kim repeated this during the six party meeting in july 2007 26 what new ideas did washington offer pyongyang chosun

to separate the japanese kidnapping issue from the terrorismsupport list during japanese prime minister abes visit to the white house in may 2007 secretary of state rice told him that the bush administration had legal obligation to link the kidnapping and terrorism list issues29 state department officials subsequently emphasized this legal obligation position but also that hill had urged north korea to negotiate progress on the kidnapping issue with japan30 in press conference with foreign correspondents on august 30 2007 president bush evaded direct answer to reporters question whether progress on the kidnapping issue was condition for north koreas removal bush instead repeated his concern over the kidnappings and his feelings when he received the families of kidnapped japanese at the white house31 in september 2007 meetings between assistant secretary of state hill and north korean negotiator kim gyegwan they agreed to complete the implementation of phase two of the february 2007 nuclear agreement by december 31 2007 including north koreas obligations to disable the yongbyon installations and declare its nuclear programs kim gyegwan and north koreas foreign ministry asserted that hill had stated that part of this implementation would be the removal of north korea from the terrorism list32 hill did not confirm this but it has been reported widely and believed by many observers that he made specific commitment to kim gyegwan regarding the terrorism list33 on october 3 2007 the six parties issued statement on the implementation of phase two which included target deadline of december 31 2007 the statement implied us commitment to remove north korea as part of the implementation process referencing the us commitments in the february 2007 nuclear agreement to begin the process of removing north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and the trading with the enemy act the statement read that the united states will fulfill its commitments to the dprk in parallel with the dprks actions based on consensus reached at the meetings on the working group on normalization of dprkus relations christopher hill stated at an october 25 congressional hearing that fulfilling these commitments wil l depend on the dprks fulfillment of its second phase commitments on providing complete and correct declaration and disabling its nuclear facilities as well as on satisfaction of legal requirements set forth in us law 34 the october 3 2007 six party statement represented what might be termed two for two deal between the bush

complete and correct declaration of its nuclear programs the bush administration agreed to reciprocate by removing north korea from the us list of state sponsors of terrorism and from the sanctions provisions of the us trading with the enemy act that have been applied to north korea since the korean war the two sides then negotiated the implementation of this deal they reached an important agreement in singapore in april 2008 the bush administration has expressed satisfaction that north korea has allowed significant disabling of the yongbyon installations however implementation of the complete and correct declaration of nuclear programs has been held up by north koreas unwillingness to disclose elements of its plutonium program its uranium enrichment program and its proliferation activities with syria the syria issue arose when israel bombed facility in syria that the bush administration and most informed experts concluded was nuclear reactor under construction with north korean assistance 35 the bush administration has dealt with the declaration issue by lowering the requirements for the information that north korea must supply in the declaration limiting the requirements to certain elements of north koreas plutonium program36 the bush administration reaffirmed its intension to proceed with its two obligations including removal of north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism once its reaches an agreement on declaration with north korea and the six parties approve the declaration 37 the state departments annual country reports on terrorism issued in april 2008 stated as part of the sixparty talks process the united states reaffirmed its intent to fulfill its commitments regarding the removal of the designation of the dprk as state sponsor of terrorism in parallel with the dprks actions on denuclearization and in accordance with criteria set forth in us law on january 22 2008 the state departments coordinator for counterterrorism stated that it appears that north korea has complied with those criteria for removal from the terrorism support list because north korea had not committed an act of terrorism for the past six months he added that despite the unresolved japanese kidnapping issue w think that even with that on the table that they still comply with the delisting criteria 38 president bushs announcement of june 26 2008 seemed to fulfill this intention but the emergence of the verification issue delayed the actual removal of north korea until october 11 2008 potential obstacle to the administrations plan is provision of hr 5916 the security assistance and arms export control reform act of 2008 passed by the house of representatives in may 2008 it provided that north korea shall not be removed from the list until the president certifies to congress that north korea is longer engaged in the transfer of nuclear technology to iran syria or any country that is state sponsor of

the degree of support for or involvement in terrorist activ ities typically varies dramatically from nation to nation for 2005 and 2006 of the five on the us terrorism list iran continued to be characterized on one extreme of the spectrum of terrorist list states as an active supporter of terrorism nation that uses terrorism as an instrument of policy or warfare beyond its borders closer to the middle of the spectrum is syria although not formally detected in an active role since 1986 country reports asserts that the assad regime reportedly uses groups in syria and lebanon to export terror into israel and allows groups to train in territory under its control on the less active end of the spectrum one might place c ountries such as cuba or north korea which at the height of the cold war were more active but in recent years have seemed to settle for more passive role of granting ongoing safe haven to previously admitted terrorists also at the less active end of the spect rum and arguably falling off it is sudan which reportedly has stepped up counterterrorism cooperation with the united states an area of concern for some observers is the impact dprk removal from the state

is resolved hr 3650 bill introduced in the house of representatives in september 2007 with 27 sponsors as of december 10 2007 would continue to designate north korea as state sponsor of terrorism until north korea met number of conditions related to cessation of nuclear and missile proliferation arms and training to terrorist groups the counterfeiting of us currency and the release of kidnapped japanese and kim dongshik and south korean prisoners of war from the korean war complex challenge facing those charged with compiling and maintaining the list is the degree to which diminution of hard evidence of governments active involvement indicates real change in behavior particularly when past history of active support or use of terrorism as an instrument of foreign policy has been well established for example iraq which was removed in 1982 was again placed on the list in 1990 to be again removed in 2004 some observers suggest that one reason that countries have not been dropped from the list is the reluctance of the executive branch to confront congress on the issue

however continued to maintain their ties to terrorist groups iran and syria routinely provide unique safe haven substantial resources and guidance to terrorist organizations state sponsors of terrorism provide critical pport to nonstate terrorist groups without state sponsors terrorist groups would have much more difficulty obtaining the funds weapons materials and secure areas they require to plan and conduct operations most worrisome is that some of these countries also have the capability to m anufacture wmd and other destabilizing technologies t hat can get into the hands of

introduction the patterns 1999 report cites north korea as possible candidate for removal from the list of state sponsors of terrorism the patterns 1999 report states the designation of state sponsors is not permanent however in fact primary focus of us counterterrorist policy is to move state sponsors off the list by delineating clearly what steps these countries must take to end their support for terrorism and by urging them to take these steps there have been some encouraging signs recently suggesting that some countries are considering taking steps to distance themselves from terrorism north korea has made some positive statements condemning terrorism in all its forms we have outlined clearly to the government of north korea the steps it must take to be removed from the list all of which are consistent with its stated policies the report states that if state sponsor meets the criteria for being dropped from the terrorism list it will be removednotwithstanding other differences we may

committee michael sheehan the state department coordinator for counterterrorism testified that we need to take into account all relevant cons iderations in connection with moving states onto or off of the list and we also need to explore whether it would be appropriate in any cases to identify states as not fully cooperating rather than as state sponsors of terrorism if doing so was warranted by the facts and would advance us counterterrorism objectives i have been considering what intermediate steps could be taken to give state sponsors clearer look at how they might graduate off the list it may be possible that in appropriate cases state sponsors could step off the state sponsor list and be left only on the not fully cooperating list with an eye towards stepping off of that list when they fully c ooperate with us antiterrorism efforts similarly in july 12 testimony before the house international relations committee ambassador sheehan confirmed that his earlier statements were intended as clear signal to terrorist supporting countries that the united states would consider taking them off the list if they take the necessary steps to cease their support for terrorism

changed the tone it does state that the department of state is engaged in ongoing discussion with north korea and sudan with the object of getting those governments completely out of the terrorism business and off the terrorism list it cites the north korean statement in the usnorth korean joint statement of october 12 2000 in which the dprk reiterated its opposition to terrorism and agreed to support international actions against such activity however as stated previously patterns 2000 was more specific in citing evidence of north korean support of other terrorist groups particularly in the philippines the report also asserts that the us has long memory and will not simply expunge terrorists record because time has passed patterns 2001 and patterns 2002 arguably softened language to designed to provide rationale for retaining the dprk on the terror list for example patterns 2002 although noting that pyongyang continued to sell ballistic missile technology to countries designated by the united states as state sponsors of terrorism includin g syria and libya concluded with the statement that north korea is party to six of the twelve international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism 50 contrast such language to patterns 2003 although it is party to six international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism pyongyang has not taken any substantial steps to cooperate in efforts to combat international terrorism italics provided51 patterns 2003 which covers the year north korea was designated member of the axis of evil by president bush in his 2003 state of the union address appears to take somewhat more confrontational position52 the 2003 report begins with text to the effect that the dprk is not 50 patterns 2002 p 81 on the other hand the section covering north korea begins with text characterizing the dprks response to international efforts to combat terrorism as disappointing throughout 2002 51 patterns 2003 p 92 52 see text in preceding paragraph regarding lack of international cooperation note that arguably factor that may affect whether the dprk is removed from the terrorism list is whether any other nationsnotably libya and possibly sudanare removed first in the wake of one or two successful cases of removal political climate may well be continued

notes however that north korea continued to give sanctuary to hijackers affiliated with the japanese red army although patterns 2003 arguably indicates that north koreas support for international

longstanding claim that north korea was not known to have sponsored any terrorist acts since 1987 was particularly important in 2007 in view of the clear goal of the ricehill strategy to remove north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism however questions about the accuracy of the claim are relevant in view of two types of reported information one is from the state department itself in the departments country reports 2005 the section on north korea discusses the japanese kidnapping issue and then states that there is credible reports that other nationals were abducted from locations abroad the state department does not appear to have provided clarification or details regarding these credible reports this assertion in country reports 2005 could be seen as contradicting the assertion that north korea has not sponsored any terrorist acts since 1987 the second type of reports coming from several diverse sources asserts that north korea has provided arms and possibly training to hezbollah in lebanon and the tamil tigers in sri lanka and that it maintains an intimate relationship with the iranian revolutionary guard hezbollah and the tamil tigers are two of the most active terrorist groups on the us list of international terrorist groups the iranian revolutionary guard has been designated by the state department as supporter of terrorism g10g142g163g139g152g149g149g138g145g561 there have been several reports of north korean support for hezbollah from europebased sources that report regularly on the middle east us media publications

the south korean newspaper joongang ilbo in november 2007 the author of this report was professor moon chungin professor at south koreas yonsei university61 professor moon is specialist on korean security issues and was close adviser to the south korean government of former president roh moohyun this advisory role has given him access to the us government and other foreign governments he is wellknown to american experts on korean issues and he has advocated policies to improve relations with north korea it is noteworthy that professor moon cited mossad the israeli governments main intelligence agency as the source of an assessment that vital missile components of hezbollah missiles fired into israel during the 2006 war came from north korea dr moon stated that mossad believes that the missiles with north korean components were assembled in iran and were transported to hezbollah in lebanon via syria north korea also has sold syria an assortme nt of missiles since the 1980s according to professor moon mossad partially blames north korea for the effectiveness of hezbollahs missile strikes into israel in 2008 the israeli government reported that hezbollah has received new missiles from iran with longer ranges than the missiles that hezbollah used in the 2006 war these include 10000 long range missiles with range up to 185 miles compared to maximum range of 45 miles during the 2006 war 62 hezbollah leaders reportedly admit that their missile arsenal has increased since the 2006 war63 the intelligence online report of april 20 2007 asserted that top hezbollah leaders including hassan nasrallah visited tehran in early april 2007 where iran pledged to deliver new mediumrange missiles to hezbollah64 if the israeli estimate is correct and if the reported mossad assessment of north koreas role in providing components to missiles supplied to hezbollah prior to the 2006 war is correct it would appear highly possible the missiles that iran is supplying to hezbollah continue to have north korean components the intelligence online report of april 20 2007 asserted that north korea and hezbollah were strengthening their relationship in the aftermat h of the israelhezbollah war citing sources in the pasadaran iranian revolutionary guard lead ership the report stated that iran and north korea had reached an agreement under which about 100 hezbollah field commanders would receive training in north korea from north koreas elite commando infiltration units and also training on intelligencegathering and counterespionage 65 this apparently was part of broader iranian program after the israelhezbollah war to bring hezbollah cadre to iran for advanced military training66 this report suggests the possibility that hezbollah has sought training in infiltration tactics from north korean military units that us commanders in south korea have described as trained to infiltrate deeply into south korea in time of war through tunnels by air and by sea to attack bases command centers and transportation and communication facilities the object of such training could be to give hezbollah the capability to infiltrate troops into israel in another war another possible element of continued north korean support for hezbollah came in statement from lebanese government official in early 2008 that hezbollah was constructing 61 moon chungin the syrian

tamil tigers appeared in the japanese newspaper sankei shimbun in september 200768 sankei shimbun is japans fifth largest national newspaper with circulation of two million daily it is considered to be right of center politically and generally is critical of north korea two reports described several north korean attempts in late 2006 through the spring of 2007 to smuggle conventional arms including machine guns automatic rifles and antitank rocket launchers to the tamil tigers in sri lanka the sri lankan navy intercepted and attacked three north korean ships carrying arms in october 2006 february 2007 and march 2007 it sunk two of the vessels seized some of the north korean arms and may have captured several north korean crewmen sankei shimbun published photographs of the north korean weapons it says were seized by the sri lankan navy according to sankei shimbun the sri lankan government filed an official protest with the north korean government us intelligence agencies using spy satellites may have conveyed information about the north korean ships to the sri lankan government according to the reports press reports in september 2006 february 2007 and march 2007 cited incidents of the sri lankan navy intercepting and attacking large unidentified cargo ships which according to the sri lankan navy were attempting to smuggle arms into sri lanka for the tamil tigers 69 the sri lankan navy cited four such ships with flags or other indentifying markerstwo on march 18 2007 in each incident the sri lankan navy contacted the ships which gave false identifications and refused to allow search when the ships fired on sri lankan naval vessels the navy attacked the sri lankan navy claimed to have seized weapons aboard the ship in the incident of february 28 2007 however neither the sri lankan navy nor the sri lankan government made public any subsequent information on the identity of the ships the crewmen or the origins of the weapons aboard the ships moreover the reported arms supply link between north korea and the tamil tigers appears to be one of long duration in 2000 the far eastern economic review reported that according to foreign intelligence sources in bangkok the tamil tigers had received sizeable portion of its weapons from north korea 70 in its patterns of global terrorism reports for 2001 2002 and 2003 the state

departments fact sheet of october 25 2007 on iranian entities involved in proliferation and terrorism support activities asserted that the iranian revolutionary guard irg was providing material support for the taliban hezbollah hamas iraqi shia militants and other terrorist groups 72 in 2006 us district judge royce lambert issued ruling that the irg recruited people who attacked the us military facility in saudi arabia khobar towers in 1996 and manufactured the bombs used in the attack general david petraeus and us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker testified to congress in 2008 that the irg was directing and supporting the attacks of the iraqi shia special groups against us and iraqi military and government targets73 many reports describe close relationship between the irg and hezbollah the state departments fact sheet stated that the irg has long history of supporting hezbollah with guidance funding weapons intelligence and logistical support other reports describe irg training of hezbollah personnel in both iran and lebanon the supply of missiles to hezbollah by the irg irg cadre in southern lebanon directing hezbollahs development of military facilities including missile sites and irg coordination of missile attacks against israel during the 2006 israelhezbollah war74 the state departments fact sheet asserted that the irg has assisted hizballah hezbollah in rearming since the 2006 war presumably including the supply of new longerrange missiles described by the 2008 israeli intelligence estimate the state departments october 2007 fact sheet also described the irg as heavily involved in irans program to develop ballistic missiles it said that the irg is one of the primary organizations tied to developing and testing the shahab 3 missile the iranian version of north koreas nodong missile and that as recently as 2006 the irg was procuring sophisticated and costly equipment that could be used to support irans ballistic missile and nuclear programs the iranian announcement of its tests of shahabclass missiles including the shahab 3 on july 910 2007 came from commanders of the irg north koreas relationship with the irg appears to be in two areas 1 coordination in support for hezbollah and 2 cooperation in ballistic missile development reports also suggest that north korea cooperates with the irg and other iranian entities in the development of nuclear capabilities or nuclear weapons given the close relationship between the irg and hezbollah the irg could have facilitated the north korean training of hezbollah personnel by north korea in the late 1980s and 1990s as 71 roger davies sea tigers stealth technology and the north korean connection janes intelligence review march 2001 p 23 72 us department of state fact sheet designation of

2006 describing the role of north korean instructors in the construction of hezbollahs underground military installations in southern lebanon in the period before the 2006 war asserts that irg general mir faysal baqer zadah supervised the construction of the underground facilities75 other reports describe irg cadre in southern lebanon prior to the 2006 war as assisting in the building of underground military bases including missile bases76 the irg reportedly has been the main supplier of missiles to hezbollah77 thus the reported utilization of north korean components on these missiles prior to the 2006 war undoubtedly would have been coordinated between the irg and north korea as well as any north korean components in the large number of missiles the irg has supplied to hezbollah since the war cooperation between north korea and the irg in the development of ballistic missiles appears to be of long standing north korea supplied iran with scud b and scud c missiles after 1987 in 1993 the overall commander of the irg major general mohsen rezaei and irg brigadier general hossein mantiqi visited north korea heading iranian delegations78another delegation headed by irans defense minister and reportedly including irg officials visited pyongyang in december 1993 press reports citing statements by central intelligence agency officials described the goal of these missions as arranging for irans purchase of up to 150 newly developed north korean nodong intermediate range missiles79 north korea first tested the missile in 1993 paul beaver military expert for the janes publications said in an interview that the delegations negotiated an agreement with north korea to establish plant in iran to produce the nodongs80 at that time there reportedly were north korean missile experts in iran helping iran to manufacture scud missiles based on north korean technology81 beavers assessment appears to have been correct by 1997 there reportedly were north korean missile experts in iran working on the construction of shahab 3 and shahab 4 missiles iranian versions of the nodong like the state depa rtments october 2007 fact sheet 1997 london daily telegraph report stated that the irg was directing the shahab program82 in november 1997 the irg announced that it had conducted successful test launch of shahab 3 prototype83 fully successful test flight of the

iran85 one report of march 2006 was issued by the national council of resistance of iran an exile opposition group in 2002 the national council had revealed correctly the existence of secret iranian nuclear facilities at natanz and irak several subsequent claims of the national council have not been verified but the iranian government places severe obstacles on the international atomic energy agency and other international groups that could engage in verification work the national councils march 2006 report asserted that north korean experts were working at the memot missile industries complex in iran in the development of an intermediate range missile with range of 1900 miles and in the continuing development of the shahab 4 missile 86 later in 2006 it was reported that north korea had made an initial shipment to iran of its new musudan intermediate range missile us secretary of defense robert gates stated in november 2007 that north korea had supplied iran with missiles with range of 1562 miles87 probably the musudan north korea and iran reportedly carried out joint tests of the musudan88 in april 2008 several publications reported the existence of new iranian missile research and development site that had the same appearance as north koreas taepodong missile assembly facility inside north korea89 in short these reports and the state departments characterization of the irg as major player in irans missile program point to likely continuing relationship between north korea and the irg including kind of joint venture partnership to develop missiles inside iran the state departments 2007 fact sheet asserted that the irgc attempted as recently as 2006 to procure sophisticated and costly equipment that could be used to support irans ballistic missile and nuclear program the national council of resistance of iran asserted in 2006 report that the irg was directing the nuclear program other recent reports have alluded to irg leadership in at least some elements of irans nuclear program90 the irg reportedly directs irans nuclear control center which supervises the nuclear program and reports directly to irans supreme leader ayatollah ali khomeini91 thus north koreas apparent main interlocutor in missile development was in position to bring north korea into the iranian nuclear program numerous public reports have appeared since 1993 describing elements of north koreaniranian collaboration in the development of nuclear capabilities some cite the central intelligence agency or western intelligence sources as sources of information other reports seem to be based at least in part on israeli intelligence sources specific events or factors in the alleged north koreaniranian nuclear collaboration are described in multiple reports 85 douglas frantz iran

negotiated with the irg for cooperation in developing and manufacturing nodong missiles in iran the first reports in 1993 and 1994 said that north korea and iran had signed an initial agreement for nuclear cooperation an economist foreign report cited cia sources that iran was helping to finance north koreas nuclear program and that north korea would supply iran with nuclear technology and equipment92 report of the us house republican research committee claimed that iran would provide 500 million to north korea for the joint development of nuclear weapons93 the cia sources cited by the economist foreign report reportedly mentioned the development of enriched uranium as goal of the new north koreaniranian agreements recent information has disclosed that north korea had negotiated with pakistan for prime minister benazir bhutto to turn over to north korean officials detailed da ta on developing highly enriched uranium when she visited north korea in 1993 94 us officials at the time reportedly concluded that iran was the most likely customer for north korean nuclear weapons the cia reportedly was concerned that nuclear cooperation including the transfer of materials would be difficult to detect95 the next reported stage in north koreaniranian nuclear cooperation in 2003 and afterwards appears to have been influenced by the reported joint advancement of the nodong shahab program in iran by north koreas development and reported sale to iran of the more advanced musudan intermediate range ballistic missile originally designed by the soviets to launch nuclear warheads 96 and by the reported initiation of joint development of the taepodong longrange missile after 2000 stepped up visits to iran by north korean nuclear specialists in 2003 reportedly led to north koreaniranian agreement for north korea to either initiate or accelerate work with the iranians to develop nuclear warheads that could be fitted on the north korean nodong missiles that north korea and iran were jointly developing iran was reported to have offered shipments of oil and natural gas to north korea to secure this joint development of nuclear warheads 97 north koreans reportedly were seen at iranian nuclear facilities in 2003 by this time large number of north korean nuclear and missile specialists reportedly were in iran98 the german news magazine der spiegel quoted western intelligence service circles as describing iran in 2005 as offering north korea economic aid if pyongyang continues to cooperative actively in developing nuclear missiles for tehran 99 during this

2006 that iran was trying to expand the nose cone of the shahab 3 nodong missile so that it could carry nuclear warhead they described an iranian project 111 as nuclear research effort that includes work on missile development100 in march 2006 reuters reported an intelligence report given to reuters by nonus diplomat that described irans plans to develop nuclear warheads for the shahab 3 missiles101 most recently it has been reported that the international atomic energy agency has evidence that iran had developed designs of what appeared to be nuclear warhead and that the nuclear smuggling ring linked to pakistans nuclear czar aq khan had acquired blueprints for an advanced warhead that could be mounted on nodong missile both north korea and iran had received other types of missile and nuclear technology from khan102 also in 2008 the iaea has disclosed documents and photographs showing iranian work in redesigning the cone of the shahab3 missile in order for it to carry nuclear warhead 103 the february 2008 report of the national council of resistance of iran also claimed north koreankoreaniranian collaboration in nuclear warhead development at secret sites inside iran104 it alleges that the iranian defense ministry has secret facility at khojir on the edge of tehran codenamed b1nori8500 that is engaged in the development of nuclear warheads for intermediate range ballistic missiles north korean specialists are at this facility according to the national council the national councils report so far has not been verified or refuted by governments or other organizations european and israeli defense officials stated in early 2007 that north korea and iran had concluded new agreement for north korea to share data from its october 2006 nuclear test with iran 105 in february 2008 an iranian delegation reportedly visited north korea that included officials from irans atomic energy agency106 two other forms of north koreaniranian nuclear collaboration have been reported recently at least one involved direct north koreanirg collaboration in 2005 the iranian leadership is reported to have initiated huge project to develop underground bunkers and

participated in the design and construction of the bunkers and tunnels in early 2005 myong lyudo leading north korean expert on underground facilities traveled to tehran to run the program of north korean assistance108 thus as in the case of reported north korean assistance to hezbollah in the construction of underground bunkers and tunnels th irg apparently made further use of north koreas skills in developing underground military facilities the second reported form of collaboration involved joint assistance to syria in developing the syrian nuclear reactor that israel bombed in september 2007 the bush administration has said nothing about iranian involvement in the syrian reactor however the online service of the german news publication der spiegel has cited intelligence reports seen by der spiegel that north korean and iranian scientists were working together at the reactor site at the time of the israeli bombing some of the plutonium production slated for the reactor was to have gone to iran which viewed the reactor as reserve site to produce weaponsgrade plutonium as supplement to irans own highly enriched uranium program 109 similar description of north koreaniranian revolutionary guard cooperation in the syrian reactor came in two reports from washington in the japanese newspaper sankei shimbun the newspaper reported in september 2008 information from source familiar with the syrian nuclear issue that secret iranian revolutionary guards base in iran housed plutonium reprocessing facility designed to reprocess nuclear fuel from the syrian reactor 110 sankei shimbun reported from washington in july 2008 several specific visits of iranian officials to the syrian reactor in 2005 and 2006111 the sankei shinbun report of july 12 2008 also described two visits of high level iranian officials to north korea in february and may 2008 the iranian delegation included officials of irans atomic energy organization and national security council the apparent purpose of these visits according to the report was to ensure that north korea would maintain secrecy about its nuclear collaboration with iran in its negotiations with us assistant secretary of state christopher hill the sankei shimbun report of september 12 2008 also described two forms of nonnuclear military cooperation between iran and north korea inside syria one of these reportedly involves north korean scientists and military personnel working with iranian and syrian counterparts at chemical weapons plant in northern syria the second reportedly involves plan by the iranian revolutionary guards to deploy small north koreanmade submarines in military port in syria

prevent north korea from producing more weapons grade plutonium for atomic bomb production north koreas resumption of disablement after the us removal announcement of october 11 2008 appears to strengthen the prospect that disablement will be completed by the time president bush leaves office in january 2009 this would be the immediate achievement in removing north korea christopher hill and others reportedly have argued within the bush administration that the administration should give the highest priority in its north korea policy to limiting and eliminating north koreas plutonium program because the plutonium is the known source of north koreas production of atomic bombs other issues such as the alleged north korean highly enriched uranium program and north koreas proliferation activities therefore should be given less priority or deferred into the future112 removing north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism also will open the way for what assistant secretary of state hill has described as phase three of nuclear negotiations beyond the february 2007 six party nuclear agreement us goals in phase three negotiation would be the full dismantlement of yongbyon securing control over north koreas plutonium stockpile and eliminating north koreas stockpile of nuclear weapons this prospect however is much more uncertain since north korea is certain to present new demands for us concessions as part of any deal for further reduction of its plutonium program given north koreas long track record of seeking financial subsidies from other governments in nuclear and other negotiations one of pyongyangs phase three demands could be for the united states to follow the removal of north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism with an affirmative act of proposing that the international monetary fund and the world bank extend financial aid to north korea removal from the terrorism support list ends the legislative requirement that the us president oppose proposals of aid to north korea from international financial agencies there are potential negative consequences for us policy in removing north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism japanese officials have warned that there would be shortterm damage to us relations with japan if the bush administration removes north korea without any substantive progress on the japanese kidnapping issue 113 us ambassador thomas schieffer has expressed such concerns since october 2007 some us experts also believe there may be damage114 however sizeable number of members of japans diet has voiced opposition to the bush administration removing north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism japanese press and majority public opinion also appears to oppose the us action115 there also could be potential for longerterm damage to the usjapan alliance that could affect future japanese policies toward us military bases in japan and

and possibly expand its support for terrorist groups and other state sponsors of terrorism in the middle east north koreas expansion of these activities since 2000 appear to constitute major threat to us national security policy interests in the middle east relatedly the united states will longer have the terrorism support list as negotiating lever if it ever decided to address north korean activities in the middle east in negotiations with pyongyang indeed chief objective of north korean leader kim jongil in prioritizing removal from the terrorism support list may be to weaken the us diplomatic hand if the united states should decide to place north koreas activities in the middle east on its policy agenda
