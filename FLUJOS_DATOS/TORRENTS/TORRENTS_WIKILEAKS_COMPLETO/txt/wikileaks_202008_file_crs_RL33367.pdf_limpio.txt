along with the expansion in the number and rang of patents there are growing concerns over whether the current system is working efficiently and effectively several recent studies recommend patent reform and several bills have been introduced in recent congresses that would make significant alterations in current patent law other experts maintain that major alterations in existing law are unnecessary and that while not perfect the patent process can and is adapting to technological progress at the present time the patent laws provide system under which all inventions are subject to the same requirements of patentability regardless of the technical field in which they arose however inventors and innovative companies in different industries tend not to hold identical views concerning the importance of patents reflecting varying experiences with the patent system innovators in biomedical industries tend to see patent protection as critically important way to prohibit competitors from appropriating the results of companys research and development efforts typically only few often one or two patents cover particular drug in contrast the nature of software development is such that inventions often are cumulative and new products generally embody numerous patentable inventions as result distinct industries may react differently to patent reform proposals under consideration

of this title4 patents are issued by the united states patent and trademark office uspto generally for term of 20 years from the date of filing the patent grants its owner the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention to be afforded patent rights an invention must be judged to consist of patentable subject matter possess utility and be novel and nonobvious the applicati on must fully disclose and distinctly claim the invention for which protection is sought the grant of patent does not necessarily provide the owner with an affirmative right to market the patented invention for example pharmaceutical products are also subject to marketing approval by the food and drug administration fda5 federal laws typically require that pharmaceutical manufacturers demonstrate that their products are safe and effective in order to bring these drugs to the marketplace uspto issuance of patent and fda marketing consent are distinct events that depend upon different criteria 6 patent ownership is perceived to be an incentive to innovation the basis for the technological advancement that contributes to economic growth patent title provides the recipient with limitedtime monopoly over the use of his discovery in exchange for the public dissemination of information contained in the patent application award of patent is intended to stimulate the investment necessary to develop an idea and brin g it to the marketplace embodied in product or process although it does not guarantee that the patent will generate commercial benefits the requirement for publication of the patent is expected to stimulate additional innovation and other creative means to meet similar and expanded demands in the marketplace innovation produces new knowledge however innovation typically is costly and resource intensive studies demonstrate that the rate of return to society as whole generated by investments in research and development rd lead ing to innovation is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by the person or organization financing the work 7 some estimate that the social rate of return on rd spending is over twice that of the rate of return to the inventor ideas often are easily imitated as the knowledge associated with an innovation is dispersed and adapted to other products and processes that in turn stimulate growth in the economy patents permit novel concepts or discoveries to become property when reduced to practice and therefore allow for control over their use issuance of patent furnishes the inventor with limitedtime exclusive right the benefits of which are mitigated by other factors particularly the requirements for information disclosure the length of the patent and the scope of rights conferred the process of obtaining patent places the concept on which it is based in the public domain in return for monopoly right to the application of the knowledge generated the inventor must publish the ideas covered in the patent as disclosure system the patent can and often does stimulate other firms or individuals to 4 35 usc101 5 for more

developments or meet similar market needs patents may also provide more socially desirable outcome than its chief legal alternative trade secret protection trade secrecy guards against the improper appropriation of valuable commercially useful information that is the subject of reasonable measures to preserve its secrecy8 taking the steps necessary to maintain secrecy such as implementing physical security and enforcement imposes costs that may ultimately be unproductive for society9 also while the patent law obliges inventors to disclose their inventions to the public10 trade secret protection requires firms to conceal them the disclosure obligations of the patent system may better serve the objective of encouraging the diffusion of advanced technological knowledge patents may also prevent unproductive expenditures of time and money associated with rd that duplicates other work the patent system thus has dual policy goalsproviding incentives for inventors to invent and encouraging inventors to disclose technical information 11 disclosure requirements are factors in achieving balance between current and future innovation through the patent process as are limitations on scope novelty mandates and nonobviousness considerations12 patents give rise to an environment of competitiveness with multiple sources of innovation which is viewed by some experts as the basis for technological progress this is important because as professors robert merges and richard nelson found in their studies in situation where only few organizations controlled the development of technology technical advance appeared sluggish 13 not everyone agrees that the patent system is particularly effective means to stimulate innovation some observers believe that the patent system encourages industry concentration and presents barrier to entry in some markets 14 they suggest that the patent system often converts pioneering inventors into technological suppressors who use their patents to block subsequent improvements and thereby impede technological progress15 others believe that the patent system too frequently attracts speculators who prefer to acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in socially productive activity such as bringing new products and processes to the marketplace16 8 american law institute restatement of unfair competition third 39 1995 9 david d

in theory because they do not confer perfect appropriability in other words they allow the inventor to obtain larger portion of the returns on his investment but do not permit him to capture all the benefits patents can be circumvented and infringement cannot always be proven thus patents are not the only way nor necessarily the most efficient means for the inventor to protect the benefits generated by his efforts study by yale universitys richard levin and his colleagues concluded that lead time learning curve advantages eg familiarity with the science and technology under consideration and salesservice activities were typically more important in exploiting appropriability than were patents that was true for both products and processes however patents were found to be better at protecting products than processes the novel ideas associated with product often can be determined through reverse engineeringtaking the item apart to assess how it was made that information then could be used by competitors if not covered by patent because it is more difficult to identify the procedures related to process other means of appropriation are seen as preferable to patents with the attendant disclosure requirements 17 g20g152g149g142g561g152g143g561g18g138g157g142g151g157g156g561g146g151g561g4g146g152g150g142g141g146g140g138g149g561g20g493g6g561 the pharmaceutical industry perceives patents as critical to protecting innovation several studies over the years have demonstrated the important role patents play in the pharmaceutical sector of the 18 major manufacturing industries analyzed by richard levin and his colleagues only drug companies rated product patents the most effective means of insuring that firms can capture the profits associated with their innovations 18 later research by professor wesley cohen and his colleagues demonstrated that patents were considered the most effective method to protect inventions in the drug industry particularly when biotechnology is included19 these studies reinforce earlier work by the late professor edwin mansfield that indicated 65 of pharmaceutical inventions would not have been br ought to market without patent protection in contrast to the 8 of innovations made in other industries 20 patents may be particularly important in the pharmaceutical sector because of the relative ease of replicating the finished product imitation costs vary among industries for example while it is expensive complicated and time consuming to duplicate an airplane it is relatively simple to chemically analyze pill and reproduce it 21 the degree to which industry perceives patents as effective has been characterized as positively correlated with the increase in duplication costs and time associated with patents22 early research in this area by mansfield indicated that in certain industries patents significantly raise the costs incurred by nonpatent holders wishing to use the idea or invent around the patentan estimated 40 in the pharmaceutical sector 30 for major new chemical products and 25 for typical chemical goodsand are thus viewed as 17 richard c levin alvin k klevorick richard r

impact on the costs associated with imitation eg in the 715 range for electronics and may be considered less successful in protecting resource investments23 the costs associated with imitating pharmaceuticals are extremely low relative to the innovators costs for discovering and developing new compound24 studies by dr joseph dimasi of tufts university and others indicate that the capitalized cost of bringing new drug defined as new molecular entity rather than new formulation of an existing pharmaceutical product to the point of marketing approval is 802 million 2000 dollars 25 additional research done by analysts at the federal trade commission found the costs to be even higher between 839 million and 868 million 2000 dollars26 at the same time the total capitalized costs appear to be growing at an annual rate of 74 above general price inflation27 large portion of new drug costs in terms of money and time are associated with the size and breath of clinical trials necessary to obtain fda marketing approval according to study supported by the federal reserve bank of boston only 10 of potential drug candidates reach the human trial phase and only small portion of these actually reach the market28 in research presented at conference sponsored by the federal reserve bank of dallas duke universitys henry grabowski found that only 1 of drug compounds reach the human trial stage and 22 of those entering clinical trials receive fda approval29 professor iain cockburn notes that as drug discovery became more scienceintensive it became not just more expensive but also more difficult to manage30 furthermore returns to new drug introductions vary widely and the median new drug does not bring in sufficient profits to cover the costs of bringing the product to the marketplace31 according to research by professors grabowski john vernon and dimasi only 34 of new drugs new chemical entities introduced generated profits that equaled the industry average rd cost

uncertainty of the clinical trial process lend consequence to patents in this area because the disparity between the investments of innovators and those of imitators is particularly large in pharmaceuticalsalmost as large as when software pirates simply copy the diskettes of an innovator33 while the capitalized cost of developing new drug to th point of market approval is over 800 million it takes only between 1 million and 2 million to obtain approval for generic version of the pharmaceutical 34 this difference is result of the costs associated with clinical trials needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of new drug data that could be utilized by generic companies if not protected by patent35 generic company does not have to fund these studies to get fda marketing approval under the provisions of the hatchwaxman act generic firms only have to prove that their product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug36 while patents are designed to spur innovation some experts maintain that certain patents particularly those on research tools37 in biotechnology hinder the innovation process professors rebecca eisenberg and richard nelson argue that ownership of research tools may impose significant transaction costs that result in delayed innovation and possible future litigation38 it also can stand in the way of research by others broad claims on early discoveries that are fund amental to emerging fields of knowledge are particularly worrisome in light of the great value demonstrated time and again in history of science and technology of having many independent minds at work trying to advance field public science has flourished by permitting scientists to challenge and build upon the work of rivals 39 eisenberg and her colleague at the university of michigan law school michael heller contend that in the future scientists might need to obtain numerous patent licenses in order to undertake basic research 40 similar concerns were expressed by harold varmus president of memorial sloankettering and formerly the director of the national institutes of health in july 2000 prepared testimony he spoke to being troubled by widespread tendencies to seek protection of intellectual property increasingly early in the process that ultimately leads to products of obvious commercial value because such practices can have detrimental effects on science

john walsh ashish arora and wesley cohen found that although there are now more patents associated with biomedical research and on more fundamental work there is little evidence that work has been curtailed due to intellectual property issues associated with research tools42 scientists are able to continue their research by licensing inventing around patents going offshore the development and use of public databases and research tools court challenges and simply using the technology without license ie infringement according to the au thors of the report private sector owners of patents permitted such infringement in academia with the exception of those associated with diagnostic tests in clinical trials partly because it can increase the value of the patented technology later research by cohen walsh and charlene cho found that only 1 of academic researchers ie those in universities nonprofits and government labs report having to delay project and none abandoned project due to others patents suggesting that neither anti commons nor restrictions on access were seriously limiting academic research 43 in addition to finding that patents did not interfere with ongoing rd the authors found that patents had significantly less impact on what projects were actually pursued than lack of funding time constraints or scientific competition however respondents doing research on drugs and therapies were somewhat more likely to report that unreasonable terms demanded for research inputs were an important reason for them not to pursue project 44

demonstrable and sustained increase in the number of software patents granted in the united states research by james bessen and robert hunt for the federal reserve bank of philadelphia noted that the 1000 software patents issued annually in the early 1980s 45 had increased to an annual total of 5000 by 1990 today over 20000 software patents are granted each year while software patents comprised approximately 2 of all patents awarded in the early 1980s they now account for ap proximately 15 of the total number of us patent issued each year46 experts differ as to their assessment of the role of patents in promoting innovation in the computer software sector this discussion centers around the issue of whether the increase in the number of patents is result of inventive behavior generated by intellectual property protection or result of changes in law during the 1980s and 1990s that made patents on software easier to obtain some experts argue that patent protection is not significant

an important role in generating new technologies particularly for small firms in the marketplace the nature of software development is such that inventions often are cumulative and new products generally embody numerous patentable inventions this has led to what has been described by some observers as poor match between patents and products in the software industry it is difficult to patent an entire product in the software industry becau any particular product is likely to include dozens if not hundreds of separate technological ideas47 this situation may be augmented by the multiplicity of patents often associated with finished computer product that utilizes the software it is not uncommon for thousands of different patents relating to hardware and software to be embodied in one single computer in addition ownership of these patents may well be fractured among hundreds or thousands of different individuals and firms studies by bessen and hunt explored the characteristics of software patents and determined that most are not owned by software companies but by large manufacturing companies they found that firms in just three manufacturing industries machinery electronics and instruments alone accounted for 66 percent of software patents yet firms outside the manufacturing sector employed 90 percent of computer programmers but together they accounted for only 25 percent of software patents48 this data leads the authors to the conclusion that patents may not be closely tied to the development of new software technologies ownership of such patents is concentrated in sectors that have large patent portfolios and use them for strategic purposes49 instead they believe that companies are utilizing patents as means to protect or leverage their investments rather than to generate more innovation through rd spending50 in industries where innovation is sequential and co mplementary as with software and computers some experts argue that strong patents interfere with the innovation process51 inventions in these sectors typically are built upon earlier technologies and are integrated into existing systems commentators pose that patents inhibit or prevent enhancements to existing products because the patent owner may not have the interest or capability necessary to generate improvements at the same time that other firms cannot advance the technology without infringing on the original patent not everyone agrees with this assessment professor robert merges maintains that patents have not hindered innovation in the software

the demise of small firms developing new technologies52 analysis of software companies by professor ronald mann indicates the importance of software patents to small companies particularly laterstage startups firms he notes that the software industry is co mprised primarily of small businesses and the data suggests different picture one in which software rd is impressively robust53 manns research indicates that small firms spend proportionally more on software rd than large companies research and development spending by software firms tends to be relatively stable over time as percentage of sales inde ed company size seems to be more important in explaining variations in rd spending within the industry 54 manns research also indicates that the importance of software patents is dependent on where the firm is in its development process patents play more significant role in laterstage startup companies when firms can generate revenues through licensing 55 at that point patents are useful as barter in crosslicensing agreements that the firm enters if it reaches sufficiently mature stage to be significant player in the industry56 patents may allow firm to differentiate its areas of expertise and innovative activity57 patents enable company to transform ideas into tangible form of property that can provide value this can be useful in negotiations for the acquisition of the firm while intellectual property is important to some investors but not to others it is considered significant factor when company is involved in acquisition negotiations or in an ipo 58 it can prevent large companies from appropriating small firms technology bradford smith and susan mann writing in the university of chicago law review concur with the argument that patents are beneficial for small software firms they maintain that pate nts prevent larger companies from utilizing the technologies developed by small businesses while allowing these companies to attract venture capital 59 the multiplicity of patents involved in computerrelated products has resulted in the extensive use of cross licensing in these industries such that one commentator argues licensing of software patents has become an industry unto itself60 instead of promoting innovation some experts maintain that the ownership of intellectual property has become an obstacle to the development and application of new ideas the expansion in the number of patents associated with software is consequence of the changes in patent law that make these patents easier to obtain rather than an indication of increased innovative activity there are indications according to bessen and hunt that patents are being substituted for increases in rd 61 the substitution 52 robert p merges the uninvited guest patents on wall

other sectors62 the propensity to patent software appears to be related to the utilization of the software by companies rather than to the rd resources expended in developing the product63 this is of interest because rationale behind the patent system is that it provides incentives for the additional investments necessary to bring product to the marketplace concerns have been expressed in the academic community that the propensity to patent and the extensive use of cross licensing has resulted in patent thicket where ownership of patent title is used to block others from innovating according to bessen and hunt this may have increased the attractiveness of strategy that emphasizes patent rights over strategy based on rd64 however other experts maintain that this might not be true assessment of the situation in an article for the virginia journal of law and technology david evans and anne laynefarrar argue it is not clear that patent thicket exists other industries with longstanding histories of patenting could be categorized as having cumulative and sequential rd yet they do not display signs of innovation gridlock 65 there are additional ways to prevent the use of patents to block innovation including the use of procompetitive patent pools and antitrust enforcement others agree that innovation in the software industry is not hindered by patent thicket in one study where actual software companies and investors were surveyed the analyst found new companies were not concerned with existing patent portfolios as barrier to their work as none of the startup firms interviewed suggested practice of doing prior art searches before beginning development of their products 66 because the software industry is so diverse it is difficult for any single patent or group of patent s to control major part of the whole industry67 g5g152g151g140g149g158g141g146g151g144g561g17g139g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 innovators in the biomedical and software industries tend to view patents differently and thus may exhibit divergent positions on the issues surrounding patent reform patent protection is critically important to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors as way to prohibit competitors from appropriating the results of companys research and development efforts however patents are not among the key means used to pr otect innovations in either the computer or semiconductor industries in those two industries firms rely more heavily on secrecy lead time and complementary capabilities to protect their inventions 68

the nature of software development is such that inventions often are cumulative and new products generally embody numerous patentable inventions while few companies other than those that manufacture drugs need to deal with the relevant pharmaceutical patents computers are ubiquitousand as result so is software authorship thus patent on drug creates potential liability for those companies in the pharmaceutical business while software patent creates potential liability for any company with its own website or software customizations regardless of its business 69 at the present time the patent laws provide system under which all inventions are subject to the same requirements of patentability regardless of the technical field in which they arose however as discussed in this paper inventors and innovative companies in different industries may not hold identical views concerning the role of patents and may have had varying experiences with the patent system as result distinct industries may react differently to any patent reform proposals under consideration by congress g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 wendy h
