unpleasant side effects from medications if neil got near horse he would flare up in seconds we would have to rush him home for hot shower drugs and rest said neils mother judy adams but neil loved horseshe wished he could spend time on the farm and learn to ride by the time neil was two years old he was already on allergy medication and two inhalers his breathing was the focus of the entire family with asthma reaching epidemic proportions in children under the age of five and allergies affecting as many as 40 to 50 million in the us neil is not the only one who has been so affected neil became nervous and out of control at home and in school continues mrs adams his teachers wanted to put him on ritalin and family members had patience with him i had to explain that he was just
