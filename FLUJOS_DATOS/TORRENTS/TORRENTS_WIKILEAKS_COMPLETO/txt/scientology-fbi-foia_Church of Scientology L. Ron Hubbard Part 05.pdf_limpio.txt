dianetics followed directions and not surprisingly considering that the technique has been developed by the empirical itiic method frox the ground up1 got and am getting results okay what results ai started as less than communist and am at this point by practical definition almost fascistthis latter qualified by the realisation that the goalaotlvated free society envisioned by our constitution is probably the sanest concept of government since the technically impossible attempts at democracy by the creekt some three thousand years ago t r n 1e ee in irlow to set the stage for ay first question first let ae define eoanunism fascism as they are understood in cianeties to dlaneticist the fnatural functional state of any saneijftsl healthy person is indicated by the word enthusiastic 1 diane tics postulates that the good lord did mighty fine job of constructing us enthusiasm as the normal state then for emergencies different psysioloical adjustments nervous muscular vascular glandular take place that are emotionally experienced as indicatively strong interest id interest content indifference boredomthreatening anger veiledhate fear grief apathy deepest apathy death from any of these psysiological adjustments the body is supposed to readjust itself automatically back up to enthusiasm from death this seems to involve getting reborn tou may sot like this mechanical description 1 know 1 dont but its convenient unfortunately this readjustment is accompanied by several side effects that man not understanding has decided to dispense with apathy comes off with deep signsj grief with bawling fear with perspiration hysterical laughter etc anger vith violent activity jiidetie daydreaas on the entire depressive situation seea necessary part of reattaining eathuauso and every single damned one of these things is treated by our society as uncouth animal something to be ashamed of or sign of weakness result people dont readjust back up to enthusiasm but instead by the tiae they are in their teensthey are on the average chronically depressed to anger and by the tiae they reach maturity theyve become intellectuals too beat to fight openly they start undermining with big words and twisted conceptions political states are reflections of emotional states our nation was conceived against background of unbelievable freedom and potential wealth by men vigorous and alive enough to carve nation from wilderness further they were coalesced by coal thus mingling and augmenting their strength they created nation reflecting their temperament time and to m great measurefreedom passes the sick mores of europe and its culture find their way to longer to vigorous baited states by the time of teddy roosevelt the temperament of the people finds best expression in

virulently contagiousyet the most direct source of his sickness is the fascist the man who scares the bejesus out of him i recognise mccarthy as far healthier stan than communist and as guidon of vigorous resemrgence of our nation let x know damn well that mccarthy bes erected more communists in this country with the exception of eitler than any man since john vesley managed to get castrated by some washington businessmen twentyodd years ago particularly among jews who five years ago would have knocked your block off if you spouted conmunisabut who now seeing in mccarthy the rising american hitler and smelling the stench of the furnaces froc just beyond tomorrow ere now muttering unfamiliar phrases about controlled economy or wasnt jack londons writing marvelous11 or you know soandso conmie makes some sense t that to such an extent that who used to feel nauseated trying to talk to be 8sbealthler than communist yes ibut mr mccarthy has split this nation ino million

freedom of thought and belief or would be veiw them as be viewed other sen when sick sick through controls when revolting serving valuable function as sympton of sickness in the society hot to be cured with the mankindold cyclic faecistcoaaisfascist eommie cure of more controls but with tbe new 1776 united states cure of great inspiring rewarding and ever higher goals and ever more freedom to attain them ill answer this question for myself by myself bat id like to know your thoughts on the matter itsecond question bow bow the blueblates can hospitalltation insurance policy__ be put on the marketthat would pay for length hospltelisatlon if you insure t group frequently tingle injury will wipe out the premiun that was paid for the whole group fro that time on you are covering any subsequent injuries that may occur in that group with money gained from premiums paid by other groupsor by otber people for entirely different line of insurance kids playground in sew jersey was insured aarly last year tbe first day the playground opened bqy broke hie leg fae doctors bill was bore than the entire seasons premium yet the protection lasted for the rest of the year and paid for several other injuries or lets look at it this way tbe only money that coaes into an insurance oonpany is the money that people pay as premiums plus the relatively small amount that can be gained by very careful investments of certain part of those premiums soae of this money is spent on administrative costs little goes to the stockholders some goes into legally required reserve tbe rest goes to pay loses f tye 4 fcuy t ihe common practice is that if over 5oje of the presium for s lineais spent on losses tbe rate is raised or the conditions of the policy restricted if only 30 of the premium is being spent on losses however the premium is lowered or the conditions of the line broadened 50 over losses might seem like hell of large margin of profit but when you consider that in some companies it costs an average 2 some times more to process every slip of paper concerning policies that comes into the companyend many of these slips mean money going out to an assuredthat grand profit soon starts looking very meager indeed i would say that on the average the insurance men rank among the most moral andcivic minded men in the countrv mna vwi rj jv ra they recognise the aoral crime of cancelling policy vhen person becomes chronically hi but they further recognise the yet greater moral crime of charging premium that could cover chronic illness and by so doing completely removing accident anil p health insurance from the financial reach of the aany people who can now receive at r least some benefit fron it if you or anyone else can find means of providing broad healthqaov at premium rate that people can affordjust mention it in dulcet tones round an insurance company the rigorous competition that exists between these companies will have them all providing it

supported himself in kansas by writing n lecturing and finally after few months unable ito bring about good public presence on thepart of the foundation and purcell he resigned from all connections in

further information on attack on hubbard assrt of scientologists of phoenix arizona ref first report of last week information has 3ust been received here that one of the maor contributing factors in the attack upon and collapse of the hubbard assn of scientologists in phoenix arizona was an accountant 2amei tferry11 rahn tli accountant first cans to c the organization in inarch volunteering to assist in accounting and income tax matters tax return ms given him for filing with the ibs this tax return c was then reported by the irs as never having been j filed and was then filed again by registered mailv j c his presence insisted upon by wm burke belknap as asan president this rahn proceeded in the absence of the treasurer and without her permission to delve into the books of the assn on the pretext that they were in serious error he pretended to discover many omissions and cast aserious shadow on the organization directors except bahcaap many rumors were started by this rahn which had foundation in fact finally rahm brought into the picture mr brewer reputed to lie from the ibs before employees in several visits mr breweralleged that1 while director wss actually engaged in some dark and underhanded activity and had used the organizatioii as blind and that i was in serious trouble with the iss which in consulting the main office is apparently not the case there being reason for it panieiced by this rahn and brewerthe organization directors belknap and one carol hadley spent littletime oa their actual duties and spent some six weeksinvolving themselves with this rahn and brevier whicby reason of such inattention but the organizationoffsfiws ihbiediate income and stopped all outgoingcorrespondence and activity qulte sufficient _in thiscas ta destroyjrlftji0l5c0 is whai1 happened i have had to act to preserye what few assttis and activities the organization had for with its locall credit deatroved ftnfl thout activity itsiiembershicredit destroyed and aits finances already involved in the humphrey suit collapsed as reports were due to the government until octafcear iqtb 1955 and as adequate time remained and is being used to make these reports the introductio of arstrange accountant against the wishes of the absezxir rebsttrfir and the interjection of supposed irs agent who may very well be an irs agent in phoenix and the rumors and threats made by these men it can be seen that this contributing factor was important the attack made by psychiatrists using evidently communist connected personnel on the elizabeth nj foundation in 1950 and 51 and the attack made on the wichita foundation in 1952 all ended on the same note of reports to iss and much rumor concerning what the irs would do however so far as anyone knows the irs itself took real notice of the 195051 and 52 attacks and waea contacted by myself did not seem to know anything about the matter the current attack on these organizations however is known to the irs for the iss has mildly interviewed concerning matters however the panic caused by the wild accusations and insinuations of this brewer prompted evidently by raha pronounced i think ran are new and strange to my experience with the irs however the accountant at the elizabeth nj foundation in 190 was continued in employment by one john jsaloney and d s purcell until aii1951 when 1 demanding better security and demanding review of the books as chairman of the board the post occupied in 1951 with the wictta fouadation was refused x ineifted on then lie detector check eing madeeoa personnel of whom i was not sw ome 3xhv rogers an officer of the elizabeth end tle wichita foundation registeredr fositive on communist leanings the registrar cole alyneck sp refused the test exid disappeared the accountant whose service had extendedover botli foundations became very nervous refused the test and disappeared hid name is not now knovffi to thus we have continued parallelism in these attack oa bianeties and scientology in accountancy accoitancy was target in 1950 1951 and 1955 by ajitantanta strange to the organization or of suspicious circumstance there might have been some parallelism in the public relations department if the organization now maintained one for the 1950 and 51 public relations man charles leonard registered positive on communism in the police checkat wichita in or around april of 1951 possibly in 1952 an ae van vogr writer from canada naturalised in the us and living in angeles and heavy fo of pianetics and scientology for years although pretending to be involved with it and em associate of gene benton sara hollister and others of stated communistic leanings made the statement in writing many times that the irs was after and the organization thing which call to the ibs failed to disclose thus the pattern of reporting to the irs or spreading rumors about the intention of the internal revenue service has been continued and confirmed and is at this time evidently the contributing factor in ending the life of the hubbard association of scientologists to the best of my recollection the accountant jerry rajm appeared in the organisation about three days after tie first despatch was sent to the department of defense ly wire concerning solution to brain washing i ean establish this more accurately when i obtain if i can possession of my f il and accounts f ubbar

even keel after the collapse of the organization in phoenix afizona the hasi and having begun operation in the east with more public success and enthusiasm than i am used to i have better perspective on what occurred in phoenix theattack on the hasi like the attacks on the 1950 hubbard dianetic research foundation found psychiatry and communist connected personnel very much in evidence and both active with defamation and very unreasonable and unsuccessful attack j but something has now occurred which seems strange at this juncture and entirely too pat i have received 3 from an unimpeachable source an invitation to goto 5 russia i hsve been told that this would be as easy as taking taxi to the airport but the oddity of this invitation is that the person extending it evidently on behalf of the russian government would not know anything about the trouble in phoenix he obviously has connection with anything or anyone in phoenix further he knows little or nothing of dianetics and scientology and their organizational history and would hot know by any usual means what occurred in phoeziix out of the blue on an acquaintance with from many many years ago he locates ae here is very quiet and casual and then gradually works into r the russian situation and finally with burst of enthusiasm confides in that in view of the state of my organizations inthe united states about vhich _c he would really know nothing in fact and in view of the us public attitude toward which is in actuality rather good considering and in view of the fct that i wan cincbrtqi be ruined by all the people

can go to russia as anadvisor or consultant and have my own laboratories and receive very high fees andfi is all so easy because it has already been ascertained that i cold get ay passport extended for russia and all i had to do was go to paris and there russian plane would pick up and that would be that indeed i suppose that that would be that this is my third invitation to go to russia the first was extended to lay member of amtorg in new york in 1938 who knew of my work in the field of the mind fhe second occurred less directly in 1948 after some personal difficulty fhis third has come

united states many scientologists think he is all right because i once quoted him this is very far from the facts and i hasten to give you the real story why richard m nixon must be prevented at all costs frost becoming president two years ago in washington this stans name appeared in newspaper article as uttering an opinion about psychology i called attention tc this opinion as matte of banal interest an article 2 j8o the founding of scientology shortly two members of the united states secret service stating they had been sent directly by nixon entered the establishment of the founding church of washington d c armed with pistols but without warrant or formal complaint and with foul and abusive language threatened the girls on duty there hulking over desks shouting violently they stated that they daily had to make such calls on lot of people to prevent nixons name fran being used in way nixon disliked these two mea stated they were part of nixon1 office and were acting on his express orders they said that nixon believed in nothing the founding church of scientology stood for their conduct before the ladles present was so intolerable that mary sue having heard the shout ing and curses from her office had to come and force these mento leave which they finality did but only after she threatened tfjjeillflteeolicec v scientologistswerepresent autht information was obtained of course from these agents asto their routine activities these were not creditable nixon constantly used the service against the voteless and helpless people of washington to suppress the use of hisname irv iifarsnithe founding church of scientology i as informing you of an exact event it convinced that in my opinion nixon is not fitted to be president i do not believe any public figure has right to suppress the use of his name in articles i do not believe public figure should enforce his will oa writers or organization by use of tfee secret service i believe democracy ceates to exist when deprived of freedck of speech i do cot believe any mao closely connected with psychiatry should hold_ high public office since psychiatry has lent its violence to political purposes llould you pleae write your ppera and tell your frieda that nixon did this and that his actlogr against private people in washington causes u to defy his cravings to be president it is my hope youll vote and make your friends vote but please doct vote for nixon even his own secret service agents assure us he stands for aothicg we do i do not tell you this because mary sue come close to serious lajury at nixons hands 1 tell you this because i think psychiatry and all fascist cosanieforces have had their day 4 1o the pounding church op scientology g want clean hands in public office in the united states lets begin by doggedly denying nixon the presidency matter what his secret service tries to do to us now in washington it is better far better for us to run the risk of saying this now while theres still chance than to fail to tell you of it for fear of reprisals and then be wiped out without defense by the secret service or other agency of nixon became president he hates us and has used

scientology the founding church of scientology is legally constituted churchy domiciled in the district of columbia it branches in other states and has many correspondents and members of its sister religious fellowship in all parts of the world the church of scientology is dedicated to the freedom of the spirit the entirety oi the activities of the church of scientology are dedica ted to this end to the freeing of the spirit of man scientology believes that the spirit of man is man himself not his body scientology believes that the spirit of man can be saved from the burden of past sins by the counseling and aiding of the spirit our ends are purely spiritual not secular by the means of scientology we believe man can be made free and pure free of the taint of past and free to do good to himself and his fellows scientology believes in religious freedom as guaranteed by the cons titution of the united states of america scientology will extend the hand of friendship to all who are believers in man as spirit scientology is deadly enemy of secular teachings as stated by such latter day philosophers as marx and others of that ilk f scientology believes that the united states of america and the world as whole requires religious freedom to survive istatement founding church of scieff washing ton cv fj january 5 1963 the seizure of the property and records of our religions organ ization the founding church of scientology at the instigation of the food and drug administration of the us department of health ed ucation and welfare is shocking example of government bureaucracy gone madd_ it iit direct and frightening attack upon the constitutional right of freedom of religion freedom of press and freedom of speech without any prior warning or opportunity for officials of the church to appear in court for hearing large force of united states marshals entered church premises and seized property and pamphlets used in the religious work of the church there is criticism of the court which issued the seizure war rant because it is not apparent from the warrant that the court was advised by the government department that the premises and property of church were to be entered and seized nor is it clear that the united states attorneys office was advised by the department officials that church owned or possessed the property and literature that was seized more than two months ago the food and drug administration interfered with the delivery to the church and its affiliated organiza tions of the imported scientific instruments which are used in connec tion with certain phases of the churchs religious activities protest was made with the baltimore office of the food and drug administration and ample evidence was submitted showing that the detention of the pro perty was in violation of the law and the constitution of the united states but up to this time the church and its attorney have received admin istrative ruling which couldbe appealed either within the department of health education and welfare or to the courts instead there has been subsequent seizure of property with out notice or prior court hearing for the church such as might have occurred under staiin op khruschev in russia if the legitimate work aad activities of one religious organization can be ruthlessly attacked and violated by one branctf of the united states government other religious organization is safe from similar or like illegal intrusion and attack the question directly raised is are we in america today living under godless government which intends ulti mately to destroy all religions and religious organizations there is nothing in the socalled warrant that was issued to ua die ate that the court was informed as it should have been that civil administrative proceedings were pending and had not been deci the fact are that the district office of the food and drug administ tion in cfijcago had previously ruled against the seizure or detention property uckras was seized by request of the same government agency in washington on january 4th and previously another government gency the customs bureau had made definite ruling that is in direct conflict with the basic contention of the food and drag administration on which its seizure of the churchs property was foundednecessar and expectatio of religion andsarpv ail the ionfat it will ndjpressionacfswiiroe given tojmi erjth in uic nuper uphold the constitutifl rights of freedom it is also hoped and expected that the secretary of the department of health education and welfare who is of differentreligious faith than the members of the church ofscientology will give his own personal consideration to the facts of the pending ease whichinr volve thonstitutional right of freedom of religion it is not too late yet tcorrect the excesses of his subordinates undoubtedly com mitted without authorization from him statement by l ron hubbard for the press january 5 1963 although i have few details all i can make of this is that the united states government not some special interest using the government has launched an attack upon religion and is seizihg and burning books of philosophy spiritual healing being legal under the laws of the pistrict does not in any way influence or explain this action the meter neither heals nor diagnoses we or any doctor know that the books do not talk about healing they talk of the laws of life and the spiritual character of man they are not subversive nor pornagraphic nor do they specialize in healing so the charges are completely false and will soon be dis proven in court as an author this is the only thing that concerns the government has begun to seize religious texts apparently burning of the books has begun in the united states where will this end complete cen sorship complete ignoring of the first amendment are churches to be attacked and books burned as normal course of action we have won through many attacks if there was anything truly wrong with us we would have fallen years ago we are still alive and the sun never sets on our organizations we will win through this one with ease as we have done nothing wrong but is this the beginning of the end for freedom of speech freedom of the press and freedom of religion and who else tomorrow or the next day will be subject to having his books forbidden seized or burned as the author of those books i am shocked to be told not to speak to man about freedom or the spiritual laws of life tomorrovipyotj too may have to start being careful about what you let us continue to write at all r l ron hubbar0 i second stafment by i ron hubbar ry commenting on the recent armsd raid on tfcphurch of scien tology under the direction of the federal food ana drug administra tion l ron hubbard author of the seized philosophical andreligious texts which are sheduled to be burned orotherwise disposed of by the us government said toward the endof august 62 i offered president kennedy my assistance and the help of scientology in narrowing the gap in the space race twice inrecent years the white house has specifically requested ted from us presentation of scientology to see what it could do to help the general effort we responded with mass of information as scientology can raise mens ability through the churchs processing procedures it could be of benefit in improving american scientists in their work on technical problems however as scien tology fell in the realm of the spirit and refused to consider man an animal sprung from mud the help was not accepted in august when kennedy had been president awhils i thought it only courteous to make the gesture again 1 did not realize that there were lesser officials of the government who were evidently imbued with ideas of religious persecution i would greatly like to have conference with mr kennedy on this subject i am sure we could come to some amicable understand ing on religious matters extreme measures such as attacking church and burning philosophical texts are not going to solve anything it puts america further ahead in the space race religion should not be factor in these matters if scientology can make smarter scientists i dont think we should forego this national victory jusjt because of some point of religious dif ference if we can make better pilots and astronauts without injuring their faith 1 dont see why we cant forego the idea that man is an an imal for bit the matter should sot rise to the heights of religious persecution religious bigotry has place in national victory less we do something to give america an edge over her enemies she will continue to be bled white by the tax collectors to support some stupid and costly science if by making smarter scientists and we have many cases that say we can we caa save america money and give her victory religious persecution should not be used to keep _ us from doing it _ however if president kennedy did grant an audience to discuss this matter that is so embarassing to thegovernment at home and abroad 1 would have to have some guarantee of safety of pers assail of my books have been seized for burning it looks though 1 will have to get busy and write another book l ron hubbard 8 fanuary 22 1963 honorable j edgar hoover director federal bureau of investigation jjnited states department of
