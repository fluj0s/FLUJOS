enhancement grants title ii part of the higher education act overview and reauthorization issues summary the teacher quality enhancement grants program title ii part of the higher education act or hea seeks to improve k12 teacher preparation programs at higher education institutions title ii part authorizes three types of competitively awarded grants state grants partnership grants and recruitment grants with the annual appropriation divided 45 45 nd 10 respectively among these kinds of grants state grants are onetime threeyear gran ts for such activities as holding teacher preparation programs accountable for the quality of their gra duates or reforming teacher certification requireme nts partnership grants are onetime fiveyear grants to partnerships that must include at least three entities an institution with high performing teacher preparation program school of arts and sciences and high need school district among required uses are teacher preparation program accountability and profe ssional development recruitment grants are onetime threeyear grants to states or partners hips supporting scholarships with teaching service requirement or activities to recruit highly qualified teachers for high need districts and schools states receiving hea funds must re port annually on the quality of teacher preparation including information on the pass rates of graduates on initial certification assessments higher education institutions enrolling heaaided students in their teacher preparation pr ogram must report nnually detailing among other things the certification exam pass rates of graduates states must establish procedures for identifying lowperforming teacher preparation programs if states withdraw approval or funding due to this designation the affected programs cannot enroll students receiving hea t itle iv federal student aid during the hea reauthorization process grantrelated issues may include program effectiveness ma ndated division of the annu

higher education exte nsion act of 2007 pl 110109teacher quality enhancement grants title ii part of the higher education act overview and reauthorization issues introduction1 there is widespread awareness that the subject matter knowledge and teaching skills of teachers play central role in the ccess of elementary and secondary education reform title ii part of the higher education act hea includes programs and provisions in tended to improve the overa ll quality of the k12 teacher preparation programs currently administered by higher education institutions hold these programs accountable for the quality of their graduates and strengthen recruitment of highly qualif ied individuals to teaching the 110th congress will likely consider legislation that would reauthorize the hea including its provisions in title ii addressing the quality of the k12 public school teaching force2 the statutory authorities in the hea expired at the end of fy2004 however they have been recently extended and currently remain effective3 this report provides an overview of th current programs and provisions of hea title ii part desc ribes available information on their implementation and identifies number of the key issues that may be part of debate over the reauthorization of this legislation the re port begins with disc ussion of the broader context within which the reauthorization of hea title ii part might occur context this section considers the current presence of higher education institutions in the preparation of k12 teachers as we ll as the growing federal

are invol ved in multiple ways in preparing individuals to enter k12 teaching approximately 1200 institutions of higher education award undergraduate degrees in elementary and secondary education in addition to earning baccalaureate degrees in education othe r undergraduates get ready to teach by participating in teacher education program while earning degree in an academic subject area still othe r individuals enter teaching through post baccalaureate certificate programs or masters programs offered by higher education institutions finally alternative routes to teaching that target for example individuals changing careers may also involve higher education institutions the quality of higher education progr ams preparing k12 teachers has been sharply called into question over the past several years teacher preparation programs have been criticized for providi ng prospective teachers with inadequate time to learn subject matter and pedagogy for teaching superficial curriculum for being unduly fragmented with courses not linked to practice teaching and with education faculty isolated from their arts and sciences faculty colleagues for uninspired teaching and for failing to prepar teachers to function in restructured or technologically quipped classrooms4 most recently critics have pointed to high rates of failure of recent graduates on initial licensing or certification exams5 one of the most publically reported instances of high failure rates was in 1998 when 59 of prospective teachers in massachusetts failed that states new certification exam6 the results were reported by institution prompting questions about th quality of the preparation and training prospective teachers had received from t hose institutions with low pass rates7 during the 1990s other states such as xas and new york began tracking the pass rates of the graduates from their teacher preparation programs and sought to hold those programs accountable for the perfo rmance of their graduates on licensing examshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31882crs3 8 in an october 21 2005 letter to chief state school officers the secretary of education announced that states not meeting the 20052006

highly qualifiedfederal involvement the federal government ventured into this area as result of the reauthorization of the hea in 1998 as will be explored in this report title ii of the hea authorizes several programs targeting k12 teacher preparation programs for improvement it also includes provisions to increase the extent to which higher education institutions are held accountable for the quality of their teacher graduates most recently the 107th congress amended the ementary and secondary education act esea to make k12 t eacher quality central requirement for elementary and secondary school districts and state educationa l agencies receiving funding under esea title i part th child left behind act of 2001 pl 107110 amended the esea to require stat education agencies to have plans

grant must report annually to ed and the house education and the workforce committee and the senate health education labor and pensions committee on progress toward certain specified objectives among these are increasing achievement by all students raising the academic standards required for entering teachingincluding incentives to require an academic major in the subject or discipline related to the one in which the individual plans to teach increasing the pass rate on initial licensing assessments increasing the number of teachers certified through alternative routes increasing the percentage of s econdary school classes in core subjects taught by teachers with academic majors in those or related fields or who are able to dem onstrate competence through subject tests or classroom perfo rmance in core subjects increasing the percentage of elem entary school classes taught by teachers who have academic majors in the arts and sciences or who can demonstrate competence through high levels of performance in core subjects decreasing shortages of qualified teachers in poor urban and rural areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31882crs5 9 partner institution is public or private higher education institution with teacher training program that 1 has either an 80 or higher pass rate by its graduates on state qualifying assessments for new teachers or is ranked among the

teachers to work w ith diverse student populations providing leadership training to pr incipals and superintendents and disseminating information on eff ective partnership practices in awarding these competitive grants ed is to give priority to applicants that involve businesses provide for an equita ble geographic distribution across the us and encourage activities that carry the potential for creating improvement and positive change each partnership that receives partnership grant must include an evaluation plan in its application that plan must include objectives and measures that are similar to those on which states must report with the inclusion of an objective to increase teacher retention in the first three years of teaching failure to demonstrate progress on these objectives and measures by the end of the third year of partnership grant can lead to termination of the grant teacher recruitment grants these onetime threeyear grants are awarded competitively to states or eligible partnerships meeting the eligibility criteria for the partnership grants states and partnerships have the same matching requirements for thes grants as they have under their separate grant programs see descriptions above recruitment grant funds must be used for either of the following teacher education scholarships s upport services to help recipients complete postsecondary educati on and followup services during their first three years of teaching each year of assistance requires year of teaching in high need leas or activities enabling high need leas and schools to recruit highly qualified teachers the authorizing statute appears to specify that recipients of recruitment grants must report annually to the secretary concer ning progress being ma to achieve the purposes of title

participating teacher preparation programs are changing their goals and aligning their offerings with district and school standards the partnerships are increasing the collaboration between education faculty and arts and sciences faculty and new relationships are emerging that link partnership institutions and other tities such as bus inesses and nonprofit organizations this interim report offers descriptive information evaluation of the impact of partnership grants on k12 students academic achievement will be reported on in the future the gao in its report described program implementation in that context it identified some difficulties the program has had and will have in evaluating its impact and cited key funding problem14 the gao found that in general teacher quality enhancement grant projects are focusing primarily on reforming requirements for certification and for teacher preparation 85 of grantees surveyed includes projects f unded under all three programs providing professional development to current teachers 85 of grantees surveyed and recruiting new teachers 72 of grantees surveyed gao posited that evaluating projects impact on teaching quality will be hard to

fined up to 25000 lowperforming teacher preparati on programs to continue receiving hea funds state must establish procedures for identifying lowperforming teacher preparation programs and for providing them with technical assistance an annual lis t of lowperforming programs and those at risk of such designation must be provided to the secretar of education states set the criteria for determining low performan ce and may include data collected under title ii part such as pass rates of graduates an institution of higher education with teacher education program that has lost state

requirementsthis requirement ed allowed teacher edu cation programs to report the pass rates of program completers institutions requiring passage of the initial certification exam as condition for program co mpletion had 100 pass rates19 three subsequent annual reports reite rate many of the findings included in the first report but find that areas in which progress is being made to improve teacher quality gao has also reported on the impleme ntation of the title ii accountability provisions in its december 2002 report cited above gao concluded that ed could not accurately report on the quality of teacher educa tion programs in general given the limitations of the information being collected as part of title ii accountability provisions the report was so critical of the use of the term program completer in determining pass rates noting that institutions and states could make their teacher preparation programs appear more successful than they actually were20 reauthorization

legislation during the r eauthorization process the congress may consider where the emphasis should be placed among these kinds of grants or the kinds of activities being supported how im portant is it to ve seas involved in addressing the improvement of teacher preparation or in strengthening teacher recruitment is the interaction among the various entities engaged in partnership grants likely to have significant impact on the quality of teacher preparation and recruitment nd if so should support for partners hips be expanded how should the congress respond to the concern expr essed by various higher education associations that the title ii programs offer little or direct support for improving teacher preparation at high er education institutions21 where should the balance be placed among investment in such activ ities as teacher preparation teacher recruitment professional development and accountability how much support should be directed to alternatives to tr aditional teacher

under the title ii provisions congress may consider whether to modify this framework proposals may be considered to bring the federal government more directly into the process through such steps as setting the low performance standards or imposing federal penalties independent of any state action against the teacher preparation program alternatively given how recently the current framework was

across states effectiveness of accountab ility based on pass rates congress may consider whether the emphasis in the t itle ii accountability process on licensing exam pass rates should be c onstrained or expanded the utility of the current pass ratebased system from national persp ective may be limited b ecause the selection of certification exams and the setting of passing scores are state specific and do not easily allow for interstate comparisons fu rther recent research concludes that many current licensing exams are not rigorous measuring essentially basic skills23 increased institutional pass rates on ch exams may say relatively little about whether teacher preparation programs are graduating students who will be good teachers nevertheless the premise that teacher preparation programs s hould graduate students who can pass initial credentialing exams does not appear to be at issue indeed there is some evidence th at higher education institutions may respond to low pass rates with what one set of researchers desc ribed as innovative strategies to enhance the content knowledge of prosp ective teachers as well as their writing and reading skills24 for some policymakers the limitations of the present system may suggest that the current federal involvement is but an initial step in multistep process necessary to improve teacher preparation program qua lity for example consideration may be given to establishing single nationwide standard although such proposal is likely to prove politically controversial for others the reporting burden and difficulty in making crossstate comparisons may sugge st refocusing of these provisions perhaps to measures of stat support for teacher preparati on or the alignment of state certification exams with state standards for teacher preparation program approval calculation of pass rates one of the more specific issues that the congress may debate during th reauthorization process is the calculation of pass rates this debate is likely to focus particularly on the 100 pass rates reported by some states and many institutions as described earlier such rates resulted in parthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31882crs13 from decisions made by ed regarding the definition of graduate and in part from institutional and state policies to the extent that increasing numbers of institutions report 100 pass rates the utility of thes rates as an accountability measure is undercut congress may consider various alternatives to address this issue for example institutions might be required to report the extent to which graduates passed certification exams the first time they took them regardless of how the institutions define graduate alternative measures to gauge the teaching effectiveness of graduates of program might be consid ered such as changes in the academic performance of teachers students or expressions of school administrator satisfaction or dissa tisfaction with programs graduates
