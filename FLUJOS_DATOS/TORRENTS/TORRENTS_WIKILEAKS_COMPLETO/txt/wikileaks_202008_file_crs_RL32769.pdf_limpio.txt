an annuity this annuity for an active duty nonretirementeligible member is determined by assuming the individual would have been eligible to retire with total 100 disability at the time of death under sec 1201 title 10 usc27 t h surviving spouses annuity is based on th amount of disability retired pay the servicemember would have received curre ntly the spouses share is 55 of the members disability retired pay if the surviving spouse is under age 62 and 40 if age 62 or over as result of language included in the fy2005 national defense authorization act this re duction in benefits for thos survivors age 62 and over is scheduled to be phase d out by april 1 200828 depending on when the individual entered the service the computation base may be either the terminal monthly base pay for those who entered service on or before september 7 1980 or the average of the 36 months or high three years during which the member earned the highest rate of base pay for those who entered the service after september 7 1980 the amount of monthly disability pay is comput ed either by multiplying the determined amount of base pay by the percentage disa bility or by computing 25 of base pay times the members years of service whichever is higher however this amount cannot exceed 75 base pay because the legislation assumes th level of disability is total 100 the amount of base pay or high three used would be multiplied by 75 for an active duty member who is eligible to retire the sbp benefit is computed to be 55 of the retired pay they would have been eligible to receive had they retired at the time of their death when survivor is also eligible to receive both sbp and dic see above they do not receive the full amount of both benefits rather the sbp benefit is offset or reduced on dollarfordollar basis by any dic benefits received if the dic benefit is larger than the sbp benefit then the survivor receives only the dic benefit if however the sbp benefit is larger than the dic benefit the survivor receives the full dic benefit and any sbp bene fits less an amount equivale nt to the dic benefit as result of legislation enacted in 200329surviving spouses of active duty personnel are allowed to designate their children if any as the recipient of the sbp benefit in order to avoid this offset this change was effective november 23 2003 children remain eligible to

benefits determining the value of d eath benefits to survivor s is highly dependent upon individual circumstances such variables include increases in benefits resulting from annual cost of living adjustments possible changes in eligibility such as remarriage tax implications etc in addition such an assessment would need to take into consideration all benef its incurred as result of military service of the decedent as noted above these would include social s ecurity benefits since dependency and indemnity compensation are integrated with sbp these benefits are considered here social security benefits have been excluded from these examples because the primary focus of this report is to exa mine the death benefits provided by the department of defense and th department of veteran ffairs any computation of death benefits based on hypot hetical situation is unlikely to be representative of the average or typical benef its received by the survi vors of military personnel who die while on active duty indeed the value of many of the benefits such as health care and commissaryexchange priv ileges cannot be quantified the following examples are at best rough estimates and are intended for illustrative purposes only the first example consists of marine corps corporal e4 who is killed while on active duty in iraq in january 2008 the co rporal has been in the service for four years given the above the co rporals spouse could r eceive 100000 death gratuity assuming the corporal had main tained full participation in the sgli the surviving spouse would also receive an additional 400000 the basic dic benefit for this corpor als spouse is 1091 per month january 2008 the 2008 base pay of the corporal is 204780 per month this is the figure used in determining the sbp benefit although the actual fi gure would be slightly less since it would be based on the average 36 m onths of base pay high three the disability pay of such an individual is 75 of base pay or 1535 per month under sbp coverage the surviving spouse would receive 55 of this amount or approximately 844 per month however because there is dollarfordollar offset with dic the entire sbp is offset by dic and the spouse receives only the monthly dic benefit of 1091 neverthe less the spouse remains ligible to receive sbp as long as heshe does not remarry prior to reaching the age 55 further sbp benefits are subject to annual cost of living incr eases assuming the surviving spouse is 30 years old at the time of the corporals death assuming cost of living adjustments and assuming the spouse does not remarry nd lives to the age of 74 528 months it is possible to compute an approximate life time benefit from sbpdic such an individual could expect to receive approximately 576048 from sbpdic if the death gratuity and sgli are added the total is 1076048httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32769crs16 table 1 corporals e4 death benefits death gratuity 100000 sgli 400000dic monthly 1091sbp monthly 816 less 1067 dic offset0 total dic only 1091 note amounts are rounded to the nearest dollar the second example consists of an air force lieutenant colonel o5 with eighteen years of service who dies while on active duty the basic dic benefit for the lieutenant colonels spouse is 1091 per month as in the case above the lieutenant colonels spouse would be eligible to receive both the death gratuity 100000 and the full sgli benefit 400000 the base pay of this officer is 721200 per month using the same assumpti ons as those in the above case the officers spouse can expect to receive approximately 2974 per month from sbp until age 62 if the spouse reaches age 62 before 2008 this monthly sbp am ount may be reduced after 2008 it will remain at 55 for the purpose of this example sbp will remain at the 55 level finally given the above assumptions such an individual could expect to receive life time benefit of approximately 1570272 from sbpdic with the death gratuity and sgli the total is 2070272 table 2 lieutenant colonels o5 death benefits death gratuity 100000 sgli 400000dic monthly 1091sbp monthly 2974 less 1091 dic offset 1783total dic sbp 2974 note amounts are rounded to the nearest dollar again it must be emphasized that these examples are for broad illustrative purposes only and can not incorporate the fu ll range of variables that could apply in any specific instance indeed the amount received can be increased by including social security benefits in addition many surviving spouses have designated their children as sbp beneficiaryies thus eliminating any offset that occurs when the spouse receives dic finally it is not possi ble to incorporate the full range of in kind benefits such as health care housing etc that may substantially increase the actual value of these benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32769crs17 60 united states government accountability office military personnel survivor benefits for servicemembers and federal state and city government employees gao04814 july 2004 summary page highlights of the re port may be obtained at http wwwgaogovappendix b government accountability office gao summary on military and civilian death benefits in july 2004 the government account ability office gao released report comparing death benefits of military and civilian government employees60 the following is verbatim reproduction from the summary of that report what gao found summary page the military provides survivor benefits that are comparable in type but not in amount to those provided by 61 civilian g overnment entities fede ral government 50 states and the district of columbia and 9 cities with populations of at least 1 million when employees die in the line of duty social security payments death gratuity burial expenses and life insurance are four types of lump sum survivor benefits provided by the military and at least some government entities the federal government and some states dditionally provide lump sum payment through their retirement plans recurring payments are also provided by social security to the survivors for deceased servicemembers and most deceased government employees in 61 civilian government entities gao studi ed other types of payments are specific to the military or civilian government entities gao identified two programs with recurring payments for the military and two other types of programs for the civilian government entities for the four hypothetical situa tions gao used to examine the amount of cash payments provided to survivors survivors of deceased servicemembers almost always obtain higher lump sums than do the survivors of deceased employees from 61 civilian government entities the amount of recurring payments to deceased servicemembers survivors in three of the four situations exceeds those provided by the federal government typically exceeds those provided by at least onehalf of th states but are typically less than those provided by onehalf the cities the military also provides more ty pes of noncash survivor benefits than do civilian government entities with some benefits being comparable in type and others differing among the entities the survivors of civilian government employees in some highrisk occupations may receive supplemental benefits death gratuity higher life insurance higher benefits from the retirement plan or co mbination of the three beyond those that the entities provide to civilian government employees in general for examplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32769crs18 survivors of federal stat and city government law enforcement officers and firefighters who die in the line of duty may be entitled to lump sum payment of more than 267000 under the public safety fficers benefits act further 34 states and 5 cities provide survivors of employees in highrisk occupations with additional cash benefits that are not available to survivors of state and city employees in general the addition of these supplemen tal cash benefits to those provided to the survivors of deceased general government employees can result in lump sum and recurring payments being generally higher for survivors of government employees in highrisk occupations than for servicemembers survivors
