community righttoknow act epcra summary introduction the emergency planning and comm unity righttoknow act epcra establishes requirements and framework to ensure that the us environmental protection agency epa state and local governments and the private sector will work together to control and if necessary respond to releases of hazardous chemicals to the environment this report describe s key provisions of epcra in addition it provides several references for more detailed informati on about the act and table that crossreferences sections of the us code with corresponding sections of the act the report highlights key provisions rather than providing comprehensive inventory of the acts numerous sections and addresses authorities and limitations imposed by the statute rather than the status of implementation or other policy issues overview the sudden accidental rel ease in december 1984 of methyl isocyanate in an industrial incident at the union carbide plan t in bhopal india and the attendant loss of thousands of lives and widespread inju ries motivated many in congress to support legislation to reduce the risk of chemical accidents in the united states the emergency planning and community righttoknow act 42 usc 1100111050 was enacted in 1986 as title iii of the superf und amendments and reauthorization act pl 99499 epcra established state commissions and local committees to develop and implement procedures for coping with re leases of hazardous chemicals and mandated annual re porting to government official s on environmental releases of such chemicals by the facilities that manuf acture or use them in significant amounts epa facilitates planning enforces comp liance when necessary and provides public access to information about environmenta l releases of toxic chemicals subtitle emergency planning and notification epcra established national framework for epa to mobilize local government officials businesses and other citizens to plan ahead for possi

section 302 requires epa to list extremely hazardous substan ces and to establish threshold planning quantities for each substance originally congress defined che micals as extremely hazardous substances if they appeared on list epa published in november 1985 as appendix in chemical emergency preparedness program interim guidance however epa has authority to revise the list and the threshold quantities of chemicals based on listing criteria the intent appears to be to include only chemicals in quantities that could harm people exposed to them for only short period of time the law directs each facility to notify the lepc for its district if it stores or uses any extremely hazardous substance in excess of its threshold planning quantity section 303 directs lepcs to work with facilities handling specified extremely hazardous substances to develop response procedures evacuation plans and training programs for people who will be the first to respond in the event of an accident upon request facility owners and operators are required to provide an lepc with any additional information that it finds necessary to develop or implement an emergency plan section 304
