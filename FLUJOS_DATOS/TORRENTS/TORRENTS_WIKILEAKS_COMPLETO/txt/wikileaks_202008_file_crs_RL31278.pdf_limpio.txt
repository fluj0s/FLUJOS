native american issues and resource usedomestic social policy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278arctic national wildlife refuge background and issues summary the rich biological resources and wilder ness values of northeastern alaska have been widely known fo r about 50 years and the rich energy resource potential for much of that time the future of these resources has been debated in congress for over 40 years the issue for congress is whether to open portion of what is now the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr to allow the development of potentially the richest onshore source of oil remaining in the united states and if so under what restrictions alternatively congress might choose to provide further protection for the refuges biological nd wilderness resources through statutory wilderness designation or to maintain the current status of the area under current law if congress chooses not to act th entire refuge will remain closed to development under provisions of the 1980 alaska national interest lands conservation act the coastal northern plain of the refuge is the focus of debate this remote and largely untouched area is an example of an arctic ecosystem that by virtue of being essentially intact is increasingly rare it has been called americas serengeti for the vast herd of caribou for the many nes ting and feeding migratory birds and for its predators such as grizzly bears polar bears wolves and golden eagles the area also is an immensely promising oil prospect which some feel could be as productive as prudhoe bay it is he ralded as place which could help reduce national dependence on foreign oil and keep the alaskan oil pipeline in use for decades advocates for devel opment foresee benefits to the oil industry the people of alaska and the national economy for over 20 years the debate over energy development in the refuge has been highly polarized and remains so president george w bush is committed to opening the refuge to development citing unrest in the middle east among his reasons and opposition to development remains strong as opponents point to other means of achieving national energy goals this report does not analyze specific propos als to develop or protect the refuge rather it provides basic material for analyzing possibilities and implications of the major issues that have been the focus of the legislative

from alaskas prudhoe bay eastward 200 miles to the canadian border is an area of unique natural wealth an area teeming with wildlife it has been called the serengeti of the arctic the eastern part of the region also contains one of americas best remaining onshore oil prosp ects beneath the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr see figure 1 this remote and largely untouched area is an example of an arctic ecosystem that by virtue of being esse ntially intact is increasingly rare it is an important habitat for musk oxen migratory waterfowl vast numbers of caribou and predators such as grizzly bears polar bears wolves and golden eagles moreover the coastal plain is immensely promising for oil and natural gas possibly on the scale of prudhoe bays resour ces its development could help reduce americas energy dependence to some degree and keep the alaska pipeline in use for decades benefitting the national economy the oil industry and people in alaska the purpose of the report when congress expanded the boundary of anwr in the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilc in 1980 it designated about 8 million acres within the earlier boundaries of the refuge as wilderness offlimits to any form of development however in tw sections of anilca congress postponed decision on wilderness designation of 15 million acres of the coastal plain called the 1002 area portion of anwr thought to be rich in oil and gas resources and required the department of the interior doi or interior to prepare detailed study of the area and to reco mmend how it should be managed interior finished its detailed analysis of oil potential wildlife resources impacts and mitigation measures in april 1987 in its report to congress doi estimated then that the chance of recovering economic quantities of oil at 19 figure that is very high by industry standards the repor t recommended that the entire area be made available for leasing the report and its recommendation genera ted controversy as have virtually all subsequent reports on this topic in intervening years estimates of oil potential have varied but enthusiasm for anwr oil velopment remains strong particularly in alaska likewise opposition to energy development continues to be strong based on concern for the area s wilderness values and wildlife httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs2 figure 1 shaded relief map of northeastern alaska source us dept of the interior fish and wildlife service httpwwwr7fwsgovnwr arcticshademaphtml nov 9 2001 minor modifications made to enhance clarity in monochrome this report goes beyond reporting the opposing views of development versus protection rather it provides backgr ound and basic material for analyzing possibilities and implications of emerging options the tradeoffs and possible alternatives much is at stake in the anwr decisi on for us energy interests for proponents of unspoiled wilderne ss and for the state of alaska on the one side if oil were found and develope d the additional domestic supply would be seen as enhancing national security although some opponents of opening anwr argue that the vulnerability of the taps pipeline to sabotage diminishes the national security argument further oil development w ould create several thous and shortterm jobs in alaska and elsewhere and substantia l number of longterm jobs as well the state would benefit from additional royalty income and many of alaskas native groups would benefit as well though so would face threats to important subsistence resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs3 on the other side many believe developing oil w ould irrevocably compromise the areas wilderness values defined as an area untrammeled by man some counter that the area has already been aff ected by man there are few remains of dewline construction and capped oil we ll in the 1002 area some argue too that the coastal plain itself is not of wilderness quality most would expect the area is bounded on the south by the spectacular brooks range but is itself mostly flat or rolling treeless tundra laced with shallo w streams most of which flow only during the brief arctic summer however the apparently hostile nature of the area belies its national and international significance as an ecological re serve it protects virtually undisturbed nearly complete spectrum of arctic ecosystems and is one of the last places north of the brooks range that remains legally cl osed to development those who favor preservation argue that when the united stat is serving as an international leader in the protection of vanishing ecosystem s development of the 1002 area would not set good international example thus if oil development occurred the issue would become how to ensure that development would be compatible as far as possible with the purposes of the wildlife refuge developing oil in the harsh fragile arc tic environment is expensive and risky since oil was discovered at prudhoe ba in 1968 oil companies and government agencies have done much to reduce environmental impacts eg through reducing the size of drill pads numbers of roads and size and locati on of support facilities and through improving wast management depending on statutory and regulatory requirements and with pr oper investment monitoring and enforcement energy companies could develop the 1002 area in wa ys that continue to reduce effects on plants and animals the choices before congress in the context of these tradeoffs the spectrum of alternatives before congress includes action which would maintain the status quo which prohibits drilling for oil and gas throughout the refuge authorize leasing in the coastal plai n of anwr to proceed under the current regulatory requirements and capabilities of doi allow leasing in the coastal plain of anwr to proceed but with special statutory and regulatory conditions w hich could be greater or less than currently required among variety of possibilities or proposals these conditions might include one or more of the following 1 limiting surface occupancy in th 1002 area to reduce environmental impacts recognizing evolving technology 2 requiring environmental controls phasing special area protection or enforcement mechanisms 3 requiring various measures for site restorati on or removal of infrastructure upon completion of il operations andor establishing bonding mechanisms to ensure accomplishing these goalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs4 1for maps of existing discoveries along the rth slope see the website of the division of oil and gas alaska department of natural resources at httpwwwdogdnrstateakusoilproduc tsmapsnorthslopenorthslopehtm4 reducing requirements for envir onmental review under the national environmental policy act or limiting judicial review of executive actions 5 allowing different standards for environmental protection or reclamation to prevail on native lands than on the remainder of the coastal plain designate the coastal plain as wilderness thereby foregoing any energy development and associated economic benefits but maintaining existing natural values and employment and subsistence opportunities exploring and developing the oil resource exploration does not necessarily mean that the coastal plain immediately would be spread with drilling pads service f acilities and pipelines companies may not discover economic quantities of oil or any oil at all if they do find ec onomic quantities and development occurs oil facilities likely would occupy only small though dispersed portion of the total area and it is unlikely that oil would be produced until 7 to 12 years after any cong ressional approval of exploration drilling proponents argue that this long lead time is reason for making decision now assessing the potential parts of alaskas nort h slope coastal plain have proved abundant in oil re serves and its geology holds further promise1 the oil bearing strata extend eastward from the national petroleum reservealaska npr past the prolific prudhoe bay field nd few smaller fields and may continue into and through anwrs 1002 area clearly key step in making decision on anwr is estimating how much oil might be there drilling both exploration and confirmation now prohib ited is the only method by which the 1002 areas petroleum potential can be ascertained with reasonable assuredness in the context of the uncertainties of oil discovery on its part the department of the interior without drilling has issued assessments in 1987 1991 1995 and 1998 of th amount of oil and gas that might be present in anwr those prepared after 1987 have been based upon progressively newer geological data from outside anw r and upon reinterpre tation of previous information using improving techniques and have changed estimates of anwrs oil potential two considerations might be noted at this point one is that the projected price of oil is key factor in estimating the amount of oil that might be economically recoverable the second is that the larger the area open to leasing and resultant oil company participation the more likely that company bidding will give the government the people of the united stat larger return for making resources accessible to private entitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs5 anwr oil us oil consumption and anwr gas based upon the results of the 1998 interior department assessment th 1002 area contains some of the most promising undrilled onshore geologic structures with petroleum potential known in the united states the us geol ogical survey usgs estimated that at 24barrel in 1996 dollars there is 95 chance that 20 billion barrels or more could be recovered and 5 chance of 94 billion barrels or more in comparison the prudhoe bay field originally wa s estimated at 1113 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil many argue that this large potential shoul d be explored and developed to offset the decline in domestic oil production domestic production without anwr is projected by the us energy information administration eia in its base case to be down to 56 million barrels per day bb ld by 2020 from 58 million bbld in 2000 while consumption is projected to rise from 197 million bbld to 267 million bbld other things being equal domestic out put without anwr would supply only about onefifth of us consumption with th rest coming from imports assuming higher price of 30 per barrel it appear s that potential peak output from usgss low and high anwr volumes of ec onomically recoverable oil at 300000 and 1575000 bbld respectively these would re present 5 and 28 rise in us output respectively at peak production possibly of greater importance are the gathering and transportation economics of both existing and prospective fields whic h include the cost of shipment through the taps pipeline combined producti on at prudhoe bay and other north slope fields is now at only about half of its p eak and is projected to rise only slightly between 2000 and 2020 development of and production from anwr would improve the commercial viability of currently producing north slope fields by spreading the per barrel cost maintenance and capital charges of operating the pipeline over larger number of barrels the possibility of large amounts of natu ral gas in anwr together with huge amounts of proven gas reserves in th prudhoe bay area not being produced presently may increase the appeal of oil and gas development of anwr to energy companies for economic reasons natura l gas generally has not been emphasized but becomes more attractive as demand grow s and prices rise construction of pipeline to transport natural gas to north american markets andor warm water port for shipping liquefied natural ga s would be necessary element controlling impacts if congress decided to authorize deve lopment then the issue would become whether and how to minimize effects on wildlife and the coastal arctic ecosystem and through them on native cultures changes in the ecosystem could result from several facets of oil development major intrusions would include large requirements for water and gravel and th displacement and disturbance of land animals and plants by pipelines roads airs trips and other infrastructure there is particular concern for caribou migration r outes calving and insect relief areas migratory bird nesting and staging effects of air and water pollutants and direct and indirect effects of human pr esence in addition because of mixed ownership in the area problems arise in how to establis h and enforce controls on developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs6 infrastructure the trend in north slope energy development is toward compactness reduction in numbers and mileag of roads centralization or reduction of support facilities re duction of hazardous wa stes and concentration of exploration and early development activ ities in winter when the frozen tundra makes cross tundra travel possible and when roads can be built from ice industry representatives now argue that the entire anwr area can be developed with only 2000 acre footprint opponents argue that the 2000 acres would be spread across the entire 1002 area is achievable only if one fails to count some major facilities and is misleading in any case since effects of the area covered by gravel may extend well beyond even broadly defined footprint limitation of the footpr int has begun to be major point of c ongressional debate physical environment much of the controvers over development of the 1002 area has focused on potential impacts on biological resources in the area however if development occurs ther also would be impacts on the physical environment and resources of the area land air and water as result of construction operations and human hab itation currently because the area is uninhabited except for kaktovik the c ondition of the physical environment has been characterized as pristine and nearly unaffected by human activity exploration and development activities would alter the existing physical environment for example oil field operations would result in air pollution emissions there would be need for larg amounts of water for drilling and ancillary activities including construction of roads drill pads and airstrips there likely would be impacts from both the mining and use of gravel as part of some of these activities exploration and development also would result in the generation of several types of waste str eams both from industrial opera tions and domestic wastes requiring disposal at i ssue are the individual and cumulative effects of such alterations and the ability of the natural environment to recover and be reclaimed when oilrelated ac tivities have ceased industry points out that companies use imp roved technology in the arctic today compared with that used in the past for development of existing sites in the arctic region which greatly reduces the footpr int of operations and relies on practices that minimize and provide for better disposal of wastes the result is less direct and indirect impact in terms of habitat loss and environmental cont amination moreover numerous environmental prot ection requirements administe red by federal and state authorities are intended to govern and regulate activities th at might take place critics however are concerne d about environmental effect s of routine operations in the fragile 1002 environment as well as th possibility of leaks and spills of various contaminating substances and whether ade quate safeguards would be adopted and enforced by regulators moreover critics argue that even careful development would lead to lasting changes in the fragile arctic environment alaska native ownership over 100000 acres in anwr are owned by alaska natives the surface of more th an 90000 acres is owned by the kaktovik inupiat corporation kic and the subsurf ace of these acres is owned by the arctic slope regional corpor ation asrc the remainin g 10000 plus acres are owned by individual natives some of the 100000 acr are within the legal description of the 1002 area some also lie along the coast but are legally described as outside thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs7 1002 area and all 100000 acres are within th refuge as whole regulation of development on these lands is problematic and is often not considered explicitly in legislative proposals see crs report rl31115 legal issues related to proposed drilling for oil and gas in the ar ctic national wildlife refuge special areas wildlife experts are particularly interested in threats of development to several sensitive or special areas for example on the southern edge of the coastal plain sadlerochit spring is of great biological importance because it never freezes other areas include the sout heast portion of the coastal plain where caribou calving is particularly likely to ccur certain staging areas for snow geese riparian areas important to musk oxen deep rivers and lakes important to overwintering fish and denning or nesting sites of bears and raptors to name few secondary development also of concern are the effects of possible spin off development both in kaktovik an alaska native settlement and distant early warning line dewline station on barter island just off the coast and on other native lands within the refuge kaktovik could be staging area for oil operations such development could compromise wild life and other envi ronmental values currently deadhorse at pr udhoe bay the oldest support center the kuparuk industrial center west of pr udhoe bay and to some exte nt alpine very modern oil development west of the kuparuk il field with much of its support activ ities reduced or taking place elsewhere offer alternate examples of how service support areas might be handled d eadhorse was left mostly to private decisions and its sprawl and contamination pr oblems led to the more compact controlled approach at the kuparuk facility still later the alpine field essentially eliminated the need for some kinds of additional suppor t facilities reduced the physi cal size of some of the remaining facilities and shifted still other operations to other sites by flying material in and out or carrying other equipment in on winter ice roads in the 1002 area facility reduction might continue and some needs might be shifted to native lands within and near the 1002 area future recovery whether strict statutory and regulato ry controls and strong government enforcement could protect wildlife values to the satisfaction of those opposing development is open to question wild erness values by definition would be compromised if full development occurred but for the long term an equally important question is whether after il production ceased the area could be and should be restored as nearly as po ssible to predevelopment conditions if major oil reserves were found energy companies might operate on the coastal plain for decades if natural gas were so found it too might be developed there is currently means to send natural gas to market either from the 1002 area or from prudhoe bay offshore oil fields might so be found and might be developed with onshore support in anwr any of these out comes could lead to significant human activity in the area for century or more assuming eventual dissipation of industr ial presence would the area eventually revert to something of its former condition new data exist to show that such an intensive presence could last many decades after activity ceases complete removalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs8 of all infrastructure seems unlikely and resulting water flow patterns might not even make it desirable the short growing season and low precipitation make complete revegetation of disturbed areas uncertai n recovery of animal populations and species diversity would depend on viable populations close enough to restock the area or site and possibly explicit controls limiting future presence so that the site or area can recover if congress decides to open anwr it may include rehabilitation

affordable and environmentally sound energy for americas future report of the national energy policy development group may 2001 p 59introduction the debate over whether to open the co astal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr to energy leasing has raged for decades with the main periods of controversy occurring in the 1950s before the re fuge was established the period 19771980 at the passage of the alaska national interest lands conservation act 1987 when the final legisl ative environmental impact statement fleis was released the early 1990s durin g the persian gulf war and the current debate which began months before the attacks on new york and washington but was certainly heated by those events the purpose of this report is to coll ect the background information and new developments that have arisen since th 1987 fleis and to discuss the possibilities and implications of emerging approaches to development the report does not focus on any particular legislation2 rather it provides backgr ound and basic material for analyzing proposals and ideas about deve loping or not developing the 1002 area the decision before congress the portion of alaskas north slope between prudhoe bay and the canadian border represents this countrys largest mo st diverse remaining example of largely untouched arctic ecosystem3 all major arctic species are relatively abundant in the area the coastal plain and adjacent areas are important habitat for caribou migratory waterfowl and such predators as wolves polar bears and grizzly bears however the coastal area is also very lik ely one of the nations best remaining oil prospects possibly containing quantities near ly as great as the fields at prudhoe bay4 congress recognized this conflict in values in 1980 when it expanded the existing arctic national wildlife range and renamed it the arctic national wildlife refuge in the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca pl 98 487 the major portion of the preexisting range was designated as wilderness and the remainder which constituted most of the ranges coastal plain was hotly contested because of its high biological value and potential oil resources the compromise reached in 1002 of anilca require d that doi intensively evaluate the oil potential environmental impacts and alternative policies for future disposition of 15 million acres of the coastal plain of anwr this 1002 area is approximately 100 miles wide and is 10 to 25 miles from north to south roughly to the margin of the brooks range see figure 2 doi was to

forbids energy development throughout the refuge until congress acts the issue has been debate d several times since 1980 c ongressional interest has been stimulated by fluctuating energy prices and by favorable environment in congress and strongly supportive presiden t the fluctuating oil prices close margins in control of the nate and concern over terrorism have all complicated the outlook in recent months congressional options can be divided in to categories decision could be postponed thereby continuing the developm ent prohibitions of 1003 the area could be made permanent wilder ness development could be permitted under current laws applicable to other federal lands or development could be allowed subject to specified restrictions scope of the report it is unclear whether congress will present the president with anwr legislation in the 108th congress the house passed an energy bill with an anwr development title in the 1st session of the 108th congress the senate is taking up energy legislation in the 1st session but chairman domenici committee on energy and natural resources has pledged to exclude anwr development from comprehensive energy bill in light of an earlier failure to include anwr development provisions in reconciliation bill for details of current legislation see crs issue brief ib10111 arctic national wild life refuge anwr controversies for the 108th congress in light of the tinuing debate this seems an appropriate time to review the history of the debate and what has been learned about the complex issues surrounding this decision this report provides the background for such analysis it summarizes and integrates relevant information and points of view on the economic legal environmental management and national energy concerns surrounding any decision on anwr the report does not attempt to focus on specific legislative issues bills or provisions but rather atte mpts to provide baseline for analyzing such proposals congress faces several difficult questions in deciding whether to open the area to energy development and if so under what conditions to do so these include how much oil might be recovered and how quickly might it begin to supply the country what would be the economic benefits nd costs of development to the nation to alaska specifically what role do native lands on the coastal plain play in the development of any energy resources and what environmenta l restrictions might apply to those lands specifically in the event of developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs12 what environmental impacts are likely to occur if the area is opened and how might these impacts be avoided reduced or mitigated is it possible for industry to limit the f ootprint of development and if so how widely scattered must the footprint be in order to permit full development after completion of several decades of energy production could the coastal plain ever be restored to an pproximation of its current condition how should revenues be shared between the federal and the alaska state governments the following chapters provide background and analysis on the questions raised above besides extensive informati on in the 1987 two volume fleis other information is now available in scientific reports economic analyses position papers and testimony many of these tend to be fo cused at one extreme or the other but not

is called the north slope of alaska consists of those lands north of the brooks range where waters dr ain into the beaufort and chukchi seas its area exceeds 100000 square miles 64000000 acres and includes the northern side of the mountains foothills and relativ ely flat coast plain the western part of the north slope is very broad with the cr est of the brooks range being as much as 250 miles from the coast the eastern part of the north slope which includes part of the refuge is relatively narrow with the crest of the range lying as little as 30 miles from the coast see figures 1 and 2 the foothills of the brooks range merge gradually into the coastal plain of the north slope the western portion of the plai n is extremely flat and much of it is covered in small lakes in the narrowe r eastern coastal plain the topography is sufficiently rolling that lakes are much less common in the refuge lying north of the arctic circle darkness and extreme cold prevail much of the year the area is underlain by permafrost permanently frozen layer 1000 to 2000 feet thick during the brief summer about 3 feet of soil thaws supporting lichens mosses grasses fo rbs and other low shrubby plants that make up the tundra although precipitation is low flat areas b ecome wetlands in summer most streams and rivers are frozen in winter flood in spring breakup and meander in braided channels of gravel until freezeup because the 1002 area has more topographic relief its drainage is bette r established and its vegetation is more woody than the wetland grasses that dominate prudhoe bay nd other developed areas foothills and the hilly portions constitute 45 and 22 respectively of the anwr coastal plain the foothills reach 1250 ft while the hills are mostly less than 100 ft above their surroundings fleis p 1819 however conditions on the north slope have changed somewhat since the fleis was prepared in 1987 in recent decad the climate of the north slope like that of most of the area north of the arc tic circle has been warming particularly during winter5 the warming has generally resulted in earlier greening of vegetation in the spring and later dieback in the fall in 2000 and 2001 spring snowmelt bucked this longer trend and was unusually late arctic natives basing their claims on traditional knowledge have reported decr easing predictability of weather patterns more

refuge chronology of the refuges history might begin in 1956 with the visit to northeastern alaska by naturalists olaus and margaret murie who reported the vast migrating herd of caribou that winter in the united states and canada around the porcupine river upon their return the muri worked with other scientists to set aside the area to protect the caribou herd and the whole relatively intact arctic ecosystem of which they were central part however the first group actually to propose that the area become national w ildlife range in recognition of the many game species found in the area was

create an arctic wildlife range was filed under the regulations in effect at the time this application segregated the lands in question removing them from disposal th is fact was important because on july 7 1958 the alaska statehood act was sign ed and on january 3 1959 alaska was formally admitted to the union on d ecember 6 1960 after statehood the secretary of the interior issued plo 2214 reserving the area as the arctic national wildlife range in figure 1 the outer boundaries of the 1002 area plus the wilderness boundaries were the boundaries of the range the supreme court has held that the initial segregation of lands was sufficient to prevent the passage of ownership of certain submerged lands within the refuge to the state of alaska at statehood8 alaska national interest

native village corporation of kaktovik rights to make certain selections and to enter into certain land exchanges the result is that kaktovik has surface rights to some lands inside and some lands outside the 1002 area however all of the kaktovik lands are within the refuge and are subject to the current restrictions on oil and gas velopment of 1003 of anilca and to 22g of ancsa which made

taps authorization the prudhoe bay discovery was great distance from markets andor warm water port from which to transport oil to markets development of the resource was thwarted for several years by lack of ag reement on how and by which route the crude oil would be transported out of the area alternative routes considered transporting the oil directly from the area by tanker was considered briefly but an ex periment failed pipe line routes were seen as the only viable option initially three gene ral pipeline routes we re conceptualized two never reached the stage of serious study one was an easterly route into canada to the mckenzie river delta then south to chicagoar ea destination and the other was southeasterly route along the alaska n highway into canada and then south into the united states the third was overland south to the port of valdez proponents of the first two routes argued that the oil was needed most in the midwest because it has indigenous source of crude oil midwestern interests favored it because of the prospective econo mic gain opponents contended that such routes were very long and therefore would cost more and take longer to build oil prices had not reached levels sufficient to justify further investigation the third route was ultimately chosen oil is shipped via taps south to the seaport of valdez on prince william sound then loaded on tankers destined for other ports proponents cited its shor ter length and therefore wer total cost and shorter construction period some opponents were concerned that the proximity of valdez to pacific rim countries ch as japan and korea presented too great temptation to export the oil others were concerne d about possible oil spills along the west coast export restrictions in original taps law much of

granted rightsofway over federal lands 30 usc 185u there was considerable opposition to the export of north slope oil and many saw growing domestic need for the oil in late 1973 as result of the arab oil embargo imposed during the arabisraeli war of oc tober 1973 and of the gasoline shortages resulting from petroleum allocation regulations the increased concern over us dependency on foreign oil br ought urgency to the pipeline debate compromise was soon reached over whether to exempt north slope oil from this prohibition the compromise was the transalaska pipeline authorization act pl 93153 87

between 1989 nd 1995 the combination of californian and federal offshore pr oduction north slope oil18 and imports resulted in such large quantities relative to demand that prices of crude oil in california fell below those elsewhere in the united states prices obtained by producers from california and north slope naturally suffe red as well and elicited c oncern and complaints from those producers attempts to obtain help were unsuccessf ul until 1995 despite arguments that the gains of exporting would outweigh the losse s for example june 1994 department of energy doe study found that exportin g alaskan crude oil would increase prices for both californian and alaskan produ cers and result in up to 100000 bbld more production in california and alaska combined than would be the case with continued export restrictions19 as result of avoiding the trip through panama alaskan oil would gain higher prices net of transportation costs if sold in japan doe predicted that higher resulting prices on the west coast would spur additional production in addition the study found ex porting north slope oil would stimulate imports of crude oil bette r suited to californias pe troleum product demand mix however the study acknowledged exporting alaskan oil would divert cargoes away from the us domestic merchant marine fleet and workforce20 these expected benefits and costs ss concern about petroleum in 1995 after three or four years of low world oil prices relative calm in the mideast and continued pleadings from west coast produ cers after two years of wellhead prices averaging below

strengthened belief that there are commercial quantities of oil in the national petroleum reserve alaska npra see figure 2 established in 1923 by president hardin g as naval petroleum reserve number 4 the 33 million acre reserve together with other government petroleum reserves was intended to help assure availability of fuels for the navy rationale for the reserves faded over time however as the likelihood of sustained interruption in oil supply declined and markets showed capacity to allocate and price petroleum when supply was uncertain in 1981 stew ardship of the reserve passed from the navy to the department of the interior doi and its designation was changed to national petroleum reserve alaska public law 96514 authorizes the secretary of the interior to conduct oil and gas leas ing and development in the npra four lease sales were held be tween 1981 and 1984 an exploratory well drilled in 1985 was dry but none of these leases was veloped and all have expired the area actually has been explored including drilling andor mapped by various federal government agencies or on their behalf on and off from 1901 through 1998 by 1996 total alaskan oil output had fallen below 14 million barrels per day many alaskans supported exploration of npra hoping that output from there would help offset the drop in royalty payments from reduced prudhoe bay production some argued that npra might assure sufficient throughput to keep the transalaskan pipeline running in add ition lease sales provide bonus bid revenue to the us treasury and the government collects royalties if there is production leasing in early 1997 the department of the interior doi initiated study of potential drilling areas in 46 million acr portion of the northeast part of the reserve and of the steps that

federal onshore oil and gas leasing system possible development sequence there are five phases of oil developmen t on federal lands the leasing process exploration development pr oduction and reclamation if economic quantities of oil are not found only three phases leasing exploration and reclamation would occur in large area with numerous tract s all of these phases could be occurring simultaneously exploration in some fields development in ot hers and production in still other fields exploration specialists might move from prospect to prospect for several years followed by construction and other worker s carrying out development where discoveries occurred and so on th following section describes these five phases27 where newer technologies are used th ey may reduce not only environmental damage or risk but also costs cost effective technologies would likely be used whether specified in legislation or not where savings are less likely legislation could be required to ensure use of advanced technologies or to ensure environmental standards with the latter pe rhaps driving development of still newer technologies however any federal require ments to use advanced or environmentally friendly technology may not necessar ily apply to native lands unless congress explicitly applies them see crs report rl31115 legal issues related to proposed drilling for oil and gas in the arc tic national wildlife refuge leasing phase through 1003 of anilca congress has clear ly reserved to itself the decision on whether to lease the coastal plain if it passes developmen t legislation it may choose to deviate from the typical pattern of leasing on other fede ral lands or other national wildlife refuges this section highlights how the leasing process would normally work and some of the leasing issu that might be considered by congress in legislation to open anwr in the leasing phase as it is carried out under the mineral leasing act of 192028 blm gathers information about an area of federal land based on data from federal agencies and industry submissions the l easing phase involves series of decisions and actions by the federal government and by oil corporations with each decision or action influencing the next then blm determines how much and what specific lands would be offered generally blm offers federal leases on competitive basis though noncompetitive leases may be offere d in some circumstances blm solicits bids on the tracts selecting the winning companies based on these bids competitive leases would probably be the norm in the 1002 area the entire process from initialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs26 29the mineral leasing act sets maximum of 5760 acres for tracts in competitive sales in alaskapublic notice to sales and to any pr oduction with public input along the way generally requires several years broa dly speaking congress may choose to pass legislation which entirely replaces the norma l processes for leasing on other federal lands or may selectively override or substitute for some of those processes the following is an abbreviated outline of the steps in competitive oil or gas lease sale it indicates as well the areas in past b ills where there were proposed changes from current practices leasing must be in accordance with relevant land management plans such as those for national forests or for blm lands but an analogous plan does not exist for anwr though the 1987 fleis carried out some of the same functions these plans are developed with public input and inform ation as did the fleis even if the federal lands in question are not subject to general land manage ment planning the nepa processes or special statutory pr ovisions may provide opportunity for public participation if anwr were opened to leasing congress might choose to specify that some of these planning steps or m easures for public par ticipation be included in the anwr leasing process alternatively given past reviews such as the fleis it might override some or all of the nepa process see compliance with nepa below the director of blm may elect to accept formal or informal nominations of lands to be leased if nominations are to be accepted company would normally nominate more land than those areas it felt most promising in order to conceal its intentions and avoid excessive attention by future competitors on what it believes are the best prospects in the case of anwr it seems highly likely that formal nominations would be part of any leasin g process and measures to provide for formal nominations have been included in bills in previous congresses in deciding which if any nominations to make compan ies would already be considering factors such as likely operating costs future oil prices and alternative or perhaps more attractive prospects in the united states or elsewhere in alaska the north slopes generally high operating costs would tend to be an especia lly important consideration as companies decided which tracts to nominate those companies with past experience elsewhere on the north slope might be more interested in participating than those lacking such experience blm would use the nominations and othe r information to determine how much land to offer if this is not set in legislation and in what tract sizes29 for example the geology of the area is markedly diffe rent on either side of the marsh creek anticline see figure 5 and the agency might wish to recognize that in some way in its selection of tracts in previous congre sses bills have often directed particular schedule usually setting fairly fast pace for the initial and subsequent lease offerings blm would not normally choose to offer millions of acres for bidding at once but instead offer portions over numbe r of years using previous discoveries and geologic information to termine future offerings httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs27 30see p 5 the federal onshore oil and gas leasing system previously citedat the time of any offering blm would also specify terms or conditions that may apply to particular tracts thes conditions might include in the case of anwr limits on surface occupancy size of footprint seasonal availability to exploration wildlife protection measures reclamation standards and the like congress could also specify particular term s or conditions in legislation to open the 1002 area to development and these terms and conditions could be major vehicle for environmental protection measures in the 1002 area though these terms and conditions might not necessarily apply to native lands see alaska native lands and rights below it would be essential for indus try to have firm idea of the terms and conditions of lease since these provisions would likely ffect the cost of operating the lease and therefore the amount comp any might be willing to bid for the tract leases under the mineral leasing act ar for 10 years and continue as long afterwards as oil and gas is being pr oduced commercially c ongress could choose any length for the leases under current law on the date of co mpetitive sale oral bidding takes place at specified location competition among comp anies is based on the size of their up front offer called the bonus bid bonus bid is required to be at least 2 per acre but bonus bids can total many millions of do llars for some tracts while others may receive bid at all payment of the bonus bid will occur at point when the winning bidder cannot yet be certain that il will be present as result even an anwr utterly devoid of commercial oil deposits might still earn millions of dollars for the federal government whether oil is ever produced or not according to blm leases on other federal lands are granted on the condition that the lessee will have to obtain blm approval before conducting any surf acedisturbing activities30 congress may choose to specify certain conditions or modifications on the requirement for this final step after lease is sold and before construction of roads or drilling platforms in typical lease under the mla successful bidder must pay 150acre in rent for its tracts in the first 5 years and 200acre thereafter the first years rental payment plus the minimum bonus bi d and 75 administrative fee is due on the date of the sale the remainder of the bonus bid must be received within 10 work days subsequent rental payments are due on the anniversary date of the lease in addition once production starts co mpanies pay standard 125 royalty on the sale of the oil they produce leases expire after 10 years unless production or specified steps toward production are occurring ssees may also voluntarily surrender the lease subject to requireme nts concerning abandonment of wells clean up and any final payments that may be owed generally speaking few bills in previous congresses have treated an anwr leasing program in this level of detail save for willingness to specify 125 royalty ra instead development bills usually direct the interior secretary to promulga rules and regulations to carry out the leasing program in order to carry out the provisions of the legislation frontier variations in typical frontier area where energy leases have been rare to nonexistent and geological knowledge is sparse blm might allow companies to conduct seismic exploration in the general area before specific tractshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs28 are designated anwr is not typical however because anilca had specific exploration provisions for the 1002 area once the sale tracts have been named further exploration might take place congress might specify whether additional exploration could occur before nominations were required however due to the seasonality of north slope exploration this choice could lengthen the time required to make first lease offering in the npr which has its own distinct regulations this exploration occurred for the first lease sale exploration took pl ace during the arctic winter and companies focused on da ta analysis once melted tundra made the area inaccessible far more exploration th took place on leased tracts in order to help the companies select specific drill sites in addition in frontier areas such as npra and elsewhere the nepa impact assessment process is occurring both before and during preparation for the sales full eis can add substantially to the time required to carry out sale even if it occurs concurrently congress has in several anwr development bills shown willingness to modify or eliminate nepa requirements on the basis that the 1987 fleis fulfilled that function thus leasing phase may overlap substa ntially with an exploration phase in the 1002 area while both of these phase s might be shortened by reducing requirements for environmental review for example there is limit to how much the process might be truncated furthermore in the ar ctic current technology limits exploration to the winter season only si nce blm would wish to consider the views of industry in selecting the tracts to be ffered views that will take time and further exploration to develop this too could lengthen the leasing process leasing on national wildlife refuges factor which congress might consider should it decide to open anwr would be the special circumstances that apply to leasing part of national w ildlife refuge since leasing would normally have to be determined to be compatible with the major purposes of the national wildlife refuge system and with the purposes of the particular unit of that system see compatibility with refuge purposes below while energy leasing does occur in the national wildlife refuge system it occurs in less than 10 of refuges and in virtually instance has leasing occurred after compatibility determination see box for examples if congress wished anwr development to occur as expeditiously as possible it could override the compatibility test in previous congresses bills have expressly addressed the potential conflict by stating that congress has determined energy leasing to be compatible with the purposes for which anwr was designatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs29 energy

ich industry and the federal government accumulate data about the area that will be or has already been leased exploration activity is most intense after leases have been purchased preliminary seismic exploration using two dimensional 2d ima ging technology continues to be used in early exploration in new areas it is carried out directly across frozen tundra without special ice roads in widely sp aced grid lines seismic exploration uses trains of rolligons large vehicles with enormous soft tires that spread their weight evenly across the surface for vibrating the surface and recording the result plus vehicles for carrying fuel mechanical repair facilities and crew of 80 to 120 people damage in the area around prudhoe is prevented by waiting until the tundra is wellfrozen though tractors with heavy rubber treads are required to pull some of the heavier equipment for the much less expensive but less precise 2d surveys lines may be several miles apar t but for the high accuracy of 3d seismic lines are about 1100 feet apart more explorati on using 3d seismic technology becomes economic in defining more precisely th boundaries of potential structures though drilling may occur based on 2d alone u nder the more advanced 3d technology finer grid lines are also run directly acro ss the tundra the better data resulting from 3d increase the chance that given well w ill be successful from 1 in 10 to perhaps 3 or 4 in 10 modern arctic exploration on the stateow ned lands of the north slope is carried out in winter while early phases involve travel across frozen open tundra subsequent exploration drilling uses combination of ice roads and ice pads each mile of ice road uses an estimated one million gallons of liquid water and road builders typically transport liquid water more than 10 miles since it may freeze before it is used technical solutions to water shortages c ould involve greater use of chipped ice scraped from lakes to supplement liquid water andor development of new technologies using desalination plant and heated elevated pipeline31 though such technologies could prove feas ible and some are already in use on the north slope they could also change the economics of exploration and ter development if data indicate economic quantities of oil may be present hole is drilled entirely in winter on thick insulated pads of frozen water these pads melt in summer leaving the tundra in relatively good condition32 if commercial quantity of oil is found the pipe is plugged and temporarily or even permanently abandoned covered by small cubesha

extreme western edge of current oilfield development on state lands near the npra see figure 4 show ing the alpine field two gravel pads linked by 3mile long combined road and runway support 112 wells heavy equipment to be used in the field was delivered to the nearest staging area in summer via gravel road once winter ice roads were built the equipment was transported to the field in summer access to alpine is by aircraft only while gravel roads link alpine with other north slope developmen t pipelines connect the alpine field to collection lines from several fields and these in turn connect to taps to carry the oil south since the 1987 fleis considerable advances have been made in the technologies surrounding the development phase these advances contribute to efficiency and often to reduced envir onmental impacts and some would likely be used required or not due to cost savings others might be used if required by the federal government or the state such requirements could change the economics of development one clear improvement since 1987 as result of improved data analysis at the exploration phase is that development can be more efficient since fewer dry holes are likely to be drilled other improvements are as follows advanced drilling drilling technology has evolved from single hole straight down into prospect to directional extended reach horizontal multilateral and designer wells all of these signs permit more fficient production of hydrocarbon reserves and allow ea sier connection to production fac ilities with fewer pipelines they also reduce the number of wellheads drill bit technology has improved allowing wells to be drilled faster drilling muds are less toxic cuttings generated during drilling can be stored in temporary reserve pits and then used in construction or reinjected into special wells for waste disposal34 efforts are made to avoid any surface discharge of wastes savings make it likely that these technologies would be used if anwr were opened legislative provisions might push further requirements drill pads with this advanced drilling tec hnology more of the oilbearing structure can be tapped from well head and drill pads can be located under very favorable conditions up to 7 miles in horizontal distance from target these technologies reduce developmen ts footprint as well as allow greater protection

main pad if the prudhoe bay ilfield and surrounding fields had been developed using this technology onl 4000 acres instead of the present 12000 acres would be needed36 production facilities like those at alpine would be scattered in network over producing fiel ds due to the 7mile maximum reach of horizontal drilling nd multiple pads could be needed for pr oducing fields pipelines would carry oil from the pads to collection line see production phase roads if development phase follo wed the model at alpine heavy equipment would be carried to staging area as near as possible to the drill site and accessible to the gravel road network that services the currently developed areas as soon as ice roads could be built the equi pment would be moved to the drill site where gravel pad would have been cons tructed previously all heavy equipment would be transported to the site during the winter equipment needed in the summer would be flown in along with personnel to an adjacent airstrip as at alpine gravel roads might be constructed to li nk pads within the same field if this model were followed the mileag of roads constructed in the 1002 area would be far smaller than was expected in the 1987 fleis for given size and location of discovery heavy reliance on ice roads could mean high demands for water if the staging area were just to th west of the 1002 area and discoveries were in the eastern portion of the 1002 area distance of roughly 100 miles alternatively staging areas could be located farther east perhaps by offloading barged equipment at kaktovik water mands might be further reduced perhaps by developing new technologies or by placing gravel roads to transport heavy equipment on native lands the feasibility of these options would also depend on the extent to which congress regulated development on native lands as opposed to federallyowned landhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs33 37the difference could be likened to the choice between counting the actual area touched by the supports of highway overpass or the outlin of the whole overpass as the footprint 38for example arctic powers website httpwwwanwrorgfeaturespdfstechfactspdf for january 9 2002 makes this claim figure 4 alpine oil field source arco alaska incorporated permit appli cation to us army district engineer alaska permit 2960874 colville river 18 jan 22 and 24 1998 map somewhat simplified for clarity in monochrome the meaning of footprints the footprint of development infrastructure is the area within the outline of any stru ctures on the surface of the land as these features might be shown on an ordinary tw dimensional map in the case of arctic energy development most observers appear to include gravel drill pads runways and roads in the total footprint of development however in the case of elevated pipelines some might choose to count only th base of the support arms holding aloft the pipelines footprint in the narrow sense rather than the entire length and width of the pipeline footprin t in the broad sense37 some would also count the surface covered by gravel mines ports water impoundments water trea tment facilities and the like footprint in the broadest sense arctic power consortiu m of development proponent s that includes industry has estimated that the 15 million acre 1 002 area could be developed with maximum footprint of 2000 acres38 some have assumed th at the footprint would be single compact unit of 2000 acres equivalent to 3125 square miles about 013 of the 1 002 area however fu ll development would be impossible if the footprint were single compact unit with advanced drilling technology extended reach drilling under favorable circumstances lateral drilling can reach 5 to 7 miles from drill site thus if development we re confined to compact box of 3125 mi2 equivalent to square 177 miles by 177 miles and optimum conditions obtained up to 105 of the 1002 area could be devel oped in contrast full development of the 1002 area would require the strategic placement of pads connector roads the type of road at alpine and pipeline s upports to be scattered about the 1002 area in networkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs34 39see crs report rl31022 previously cited fo r description of these technologiesmost development advocates do not oppos surface occupancy or footprint limitation to 2000 acres appare ntly feeling that such limit based on definition covering pads airstrips nd pipe supports would not hinder full development even if the term footprint were expanded to include conn ector roads like that at alpine where the road represents about 15 of the gravel surfaces they do not appear to consider 2000acre limit to be overly confining if however gravel mines water catch basins water treatment plants ts causeways and other possible features fleis p 99 were to be built and in cluded in 2000acre limit on footprint the broadest definition of the rm and if geology of the fields required more numerous or widespread wells there appear to be three possible responses to the problem 1 facilities might be modified perhaps thr ough improved technology in order to stay within 2000acre limit 2 some otherwis economic prospects might be missed or 3 the footprint limitation might be modified in some way finally if legislation did not apply limitations to native lands some additional prospects on federal leases might be developed from pads within these native lands by using advanced drilling technologies support facilitie s also could be located on the native lands within the refuge and as result avoid an acreage limitation if legislation did not specifically include such lands in the limitation production phase in production phase drilling equipm ent would be removed and small buildings housing oil pumps would be inst alled and connected to pipelines and for the 1002 area u ltimately to taps fewer employees are n ecessary during the production phase production fac ilities to extract hydrocar bons consist of drilling equipment and rigs central processing facilities which include oil and gas separation units power plants flowlines and crew offices and living quarters access roads gravel mines airstrips and possibly ts and desalination facilities should commercial quantities of oil be discovered in anwr it is likely that the most advanced production f acilities would be used in orde r to contain costs and minimize physical size and effect on the environment with current technologies permanent dr ill sites would be c onstructed of gravel or recycled cuttings from the exploration wells compact factorymanufactured production facilities woul d be transported to the site instead of built on site depending upon cond itions s limhole or coiled tubing drilling would be used39 multilateral wells wells with additional boreholes branching from common hole might be used in restricted spaces andor to share the same surface facility when wells not accessible to conventional rigs b ecame old the life of the reservoir may be extended by using throughtubing rotary drilled wells which go through existing production tubing unmanned production f acilities might be inst alled to exploit accumulations in remote sites precluding the need for crew fac ilities at those locations together these techniques re duce the amount of support facilities needed and the amount of waste the alpine

somewhat less acreage was act ually occupied than called for in the permit the size of the alpine complex is various ly cited as 93 94 97 and 98 acres depending on the source it is unclear exactly what portion of the development is reduced relative to the permitted size 41if commercial quantities were not found reclamation would occur after some years of exploration fws or blm or other agencies given such responsibility might condition development permits on mitigation reclamation or rehabilitation of affected lands if commercial quantities of oil were found cleanup needs might be fairly minimal although with the slow growth rate of vegetation in the arctic even minimal disturbance can take decades to recover see reclamation issues after development below 42the response of arctic vegetation to disturban ce is complex factors that tend to lengthen recovery include greater dryness changes in moisture conditions and soil compaction recovery is hastened by replanting with native plants and careful selective use of appropriate fertilizers recovery is slower than in temperate habitats see jay d mckendrick vegetative responses to disturbance in the natural history of an arctic

whatever standard was specified any au thorization to develop the 1002 area could include reclamation provisions41 if oil production were to occur industrial activity would probably last decades especially if natural gas resources could also be developed so reclamation would be decades in the future removal of gravel pads roads and runways pipelines support cente rs water treatment plants etc would come as production and therefore revenue was declining to ensure financial resources to support this fina l industrial phase so have suggested that companies be required to post bonds even with c onsistent use of the best available technologies decades of disturbance could require more decades for the disappearance of human intrusion in the slowgrowing environment42 it is unclear whether local residents or refuge managers would even wish to have roads or other facilities removed once ergy production ceases however as noted above new deve lopments in production fi eld facility construction and main tenance and in drilling and pr oduction have reduced the size of oil and gas field operations and since modern technology attempts to avoid any surface discharge the technical aspects of reclamation could be somewhat less demanding than for older fieldshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs36 43as noted above many opponents of refuge energy development focus less on the specific

there are many widely varying estimates of oil quantities in the 1002 area here is guide to these estimates and their meaning how much oil might be present the amount that might be present or in place is just starting point since it is not possi ble to extract all of the oil in field estimates are almost always given as rang of numbers first petroleum geologists ask what quantity of oil are we confident of finding there is good change of finding small amount or more and small chance of finding large am ount or more the probability levels used are fixe d by tradition at 95 chance of at least certain small amount and 5 chance of at least certain large amount the third number is the mean estimate the average of all of the estimated amounts the numbers could change with better data or better technology how much oil is technically recoverable this set of estimates does not take into account the cost of recovery and price of il and assumes that only current technology is used to recover the oil like the previ ous set of estimates it states the large 95 chance that certain small amount or more of oil is present the small chance 5 that large amount or more is present and the mean estimate these numbers always are smaller than the estimates of oil that might be present as technology advances this number also could change how much oil is economically recoverable these numbers are often the most useful they reflect assumptions about oil prices cost of produc tion etc they also are given as 95 mean and 5 estimates of small or more mean and large or more amounts if technology later advances cost s decrease or prices rise then these numbers could increase and viceversa estimates of economically recoverable oil tend to increase over time minimum field size is the smallest amount of oil that must be present in prospect for it to be commercial embedded in this concept are assumptions about future oil prices technology development and costs of production and transportation if these change this threshold will change at anwr the minimum field size usually is estimated at few hundred m illion barrels many smaller fields very close together might serve as well as larger one in

or elsewhere thus the primary question is how much oil can be extracted profitably each company has its own internal criteria for this the higher the price of crude oil the greater the proportion that would be econo mically recoverable high prices also could provide incentives to improve extraction technolog thereby reducing extraction costs the usgs estimated that at 24barrel in 1996 dollars there

probably would become attractive if and when larger fields were developed and infrastructure was in place thus if commercial oil fields were di scovered they most likely would be of different sizes and the coll ective overall quantity of ec onomically recoverable oil could be in very wide range and given that the size of possible overall discovery is unknown estimations of the overall cost of developing anwr are hypothetical advances in arctic oil nd gas development technolog equipment and facility configuration reduce both the extensiveness of facilities and the development cost per

will be perhaps more selective and regional as noted above peak production from any economically recoverable volumes of 203 billion and 937 billion bbl at 24 per barrel72 probably would be reached in about 2020 and would range from roug hly 300000 to 1400000 bbl per day eia projects world oil production to total 1066 million bbl per day in 201573 thus anwr production from the respective discove ry volumes at their peaks around the years 20132015 would range from about 03 to 09 of world output opponents of anwr have suggested that potential anwr resources are equivalent to us da ily demand for oil for matter of just months74 this does not consider the role which any incremental source of petroleum plays in markets which are dynamic consequently the impact of anwr production on world oil prices is likely to be variable depending upon market and political factors prevailing in the moment for proponents of development the oil shocks to the market in 197374 197980 1991 and 20002001 tend to loom large however review of the nearly thirty years since the time of the arab oil embargo and first oil price shock in 1973 sugge sts that it is more accurate to see this nearly thirtyyear period as one of ge neral price and supply stability that is periodically broken with s horter episodes when price became volatile and supplies of fuel less certain during any of th episodes even an additional 100000 bblday of refined product in cer tain regional markets mig ht have eased prices75 in times of uncertainty and even at the low rang of estimates of pot ential anwr production these volumes might help contain short term spike in prices in these moments it matters little whether the incrementa l supply comes from field holding six months national demand or sixty years potential supply because the price of product at the pump will not discriminate between the two some argue that anwr production could result in lower world oil prices if supply in the world market were rela tively tight in 2015 and the market was reasonably competitive in period of ge neral stability and balance in supply and demand production from anwr at the lower range of the estimates would probably have small effect on prices there is also the prospect that depending upon market factors and their internal economies op ec and other producers could cut their output to offset the supply effect of anw r as has occurred before this would depend upon the commitment of opec nations to try to support or defend price band for crude oil by cutting production as they did three times in 2001 at the same time internal revenue need s have sometimes prompted producing nations to sellhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs52 76for more on us energy policies see crs issue brief ib10080 energy policy

generally considered reasonable for the type of spending continuedoutput above their quotas additional oil supply from nonopec producers also makes it more difficult for opec to affect prices76 macroeconomic effects in general if energy prices fall the drop would tend to increase the amount of inputs afforded by businesses boosting the overall supply of goods and services higher ggregate income and lower prices would enable households to buy more goods nd services economic growth would speed up and if the economy is not at full em ployment more labor and capital would be employed once the adjustment to lower prices is completed growth would return to its prior rate but at higher output level however in analyzing the impact of changes in energy costs on the economy as whole or on individual sectors one n eeds to be aware that the relative price of oil has decreased since the oil price spik of the 1970s and early 1980s and energy use per unit of output has fallen as we ll the proportions of production costs accounted for by energy ve dropped across the economy and energy costs as share of gross domestic pr oduct gdp have declined consequently the relative impacts of energy price changes on the econom in general and on particular sectors can be expected to be smaller than they were 2025 years ago it appears also that any price effect woul d have to be consid erable and sustained for the macroeconomic effects to be reasonably noticeable for example the organization for economic c ooperation and development timated that an increase in oil prices of 10 per ba rrel above its baseline scenar io would result in us gdp being 02 lower one year and two years after the shock77 in contrast as noted above the price effect of 0309 ddition to world oil supply resu lting from anwr production probably would be small although econometric research findings suggest that the beneficial macroeco nomic result of price drop would not necessarily be proportional oil and gas

tend to redu ce other exports and expand other imports to some extent reversing the initial improvement possibly greater increase in demand for imports of other goods and serv ices could result from the higher level of economic activity caused by lower oil prices basically the trade deficit reflects the desire of americans to borrow abroad versus the desire of foreigners to invest or borrow in

including labor in alaska they would come to 325 billion and 70 billion again adjusting for price in creases since 1992 and assuming that oil producing companies and oil field service companies each accounted for half of the outlays it would lead to about half of th hypothetical jobs estimated for the united states as whole 30000 and 65000 respectively the ratios used however are national av erages and oil and gas industry wages in alaska are higher than average while the latter is beneficial in one respect it may translate into smaller number of jobs per billion dollars of outlays also advances in oil and gas development technology nd facilities since 1990 reducing the size of facilities may also reduce the number of jobs generated by such development furthermore if there were some sl ack in the alaskan economy if or when anwr energy development occurs jobs created by anwr could result in reduction in alaskan unemployment if the alaskan economy were at full employment the job gain could be transito ry moreover as noted earlier any jobs generated by anwr developmen t could come at the expense of an equal number of jobs lost in the rest of the economy this could include drawing oil industry resources capital and labor from oil pros pects elsewhere in the country to some extent the alaskan state government and ultimately alaskan citizens could benefit substantially from anwr development via its share of potentially billions of dollars of revenues from bonuses rents and roya lties alaskan citiz ens receive annual distributions from the states permanent fund which is endowed by revenues from mineral lease rentals royalties and bonuses and the statess share of federal mineral derived revenues the distribu tion in 2000 was 196386 per resident regarding only

relatively undisturbed condition led to its selection as the most suitable opportunity for protectin g portion of the remaining wildlife and its frontiers the area included w ithin the proposed range is major habitat particular ly in summer for the great herds of arctic caribou and the countless lakes ponds and marshe s found in this area are nesting grounds for large numbers of migratory waterfowl that spend about half of each year in the rest of united st ates thus the production here is of importance to great many sportsme n the proposed range is restricted to the area which contains all of th requisites for yearround use the coastal area is the only place in the united states where polar bear dens are found91 twentyeight years later the fleis echoed these remarks with

productivity in the short arctic summer many species arrive or awake from dormancy to take advantage of this richness and leave or become dormant during the remainder of the year caribou have long been the center of the deba over the biological impacts of refuge development but other species have also been at issue among the other species most frequently mentioned are polar b ears musk oxen and

npra as much as 130 miles the form development takes in the 1002 area would likely be quite different from earlier development with fewer ro ads and more overflights for example conditions have changed since prudhoe bay development began nearly 30 years ago winters tend to be milder t undra thaws earlier and freezes later and vegetation patterns have already begun to change in response to these changes93 animal life would be expected to respond to these changes sooner or later this section presents background information on various species as it might relate to energy development in the refu ge and the potential effects of development on these species caribou in 1987 the porcupine caribou herd pch was estimated at 180000 animals and is now timated at 129000 animals94 the herd winters south of the brooks range in central alaska and nor thwestern canada its winter range is centered on the porcupine river in canada and alaska in the spring the males and yearlings migrate north first followed by the cows who move north with the retreating snow line the entire herd calves in only few days in most years the cows reach the 1002 area and give birth ther concentrating their activity in areas that are greening most rapidly and that offer the high protein content required by growing calves and lactating cows95 if snowfall has been heavy or if cool spring delays snowmelt

pchpc_cyclehtml and annual calving maps at httpwwwr7fwsgov nwrarcticpchmapshtml much has been made of the failure of caribou cows to calve in the 1002 area in some years notably 1986 1987 2000 and 2001 in these years heavy snowfall or cool spring temperatures slowed the northern migration so that when calving occurred most cows had not yet crossed large flooding rivers or passed the brookshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs59 96stephen m arthur porc upine caribou herd calving survey june 2000 unpublished memorandum july 12 2000 7 p 97warren b ballard matthew cronin and heather

calves died in river crossings or fell prey to the golden eagle wolf and grizzly populations in the brooks range for radio collared cows in 2000 the june calf survival rate and the july calf to cow ratio were the lowest ever recorded96 even if migration is delayed the cows continue on to the 1002 area where they continue to forage as june days length and become warmer mosquitos bot flies and warble flies can reach tremendous num bers on the coastal plain while the bloodsucking habits of mosquitos are wellknown the flies pr esent major health problems as well these flies deposit their eggs in the nasal passages of the caribou or in wounds larvae feed and migrate thr ough the skin making holes in the skin when ready to emerge severely infested animals or those in weakened condition eg injured or older animals young calves lactating cows have restricted breathing or are otherwise weakened they may die or fall to predators when these flies are numerous herds may appear panicked seeking relief in areas where flies are less numerous mosquitos become active earlier in the summer and are deterred by cool windy humid conditions when they are numer ous caribou congregate near the coast where breezes are typically stronger temperatures lower and mosquitos consequently rarer the larger bot and wa rble flies tolerate somewhat higher winds but not shade they too prefer warmer temperatures and become active later in the summer97 consequently after calving is over and the herd has reached the 1002 area the herd generally moves to the coast to escape mosquitos as mosquito populations decline and fly populations increas the herd may return to inland areas where patches of snow gravel bars or hills offer less favorable c onditions for the increasing numbers of bot and warble flies at this time of year cows are at their lowest energy levels and according to the fleis access to insectrelief habitat and forage during this period may be critical to herd productivity p 25 the effects of exploration producti on and development in the 1002 area on caribou cannot be known with certainty unle ss such events actually occur and even then will undoubtedly be debated wh the 1987 fleis was released debate centered on the potential for displacement of the herd from its preferred calving area and b the coastal areas needed for relief from clouds of biting insects these remain the primary concerns major poi nt of debate has been the comparison of effects of development on th central arctic herd cah whose range is partly in the developed areas west of the refuge and the potential effect s of development on the pch whose summer range is primarily in the 1002 area comparisons of the two herds must be made cautiously since the pch is about 5 times larger than the cah calves in about 15 the area of the cah and annually migrates to overwinter south of the brooks range while the cah ge nerally remains yearround in the much broader coastal plain in and south of the existing oil fields httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs60 98c nellemann and r d cameron cumulative impacts of an evolving oilfield complex on the distribution of calving caribou canadian journal of

displaced from calving in the 1002 area this question can be divided into two parts would the pch likely be displaced from the 1002 area at calving time and more importantly if it were displaced would displacement have harmful effects on calving success for the first question the answer for the herd as whole base d on the prudhoe bay experience appears initially to be qualif ied individual animals esp ecially adult males habituate to the disturbance and sometimes seek out gravel pads and roads where insect attacks may be less severe the cah has grown since development began from 5000 to about 27000 however warning signs exist for instance brad griffiths and ray cameron and their students at the university of alaska fairbanks have shown that for the western portion of th cah cows have shifted their calving southward out of the development area and return to this rich foraging area only after their calves are older these studies also show that the greatest incremental impacts are attributable to initial construction of roads and related facilities and that the extent of avoidance greatly exceeds the physical footprint of an oilfield complex98 thus it is possible that habituati on could occur especially with males and yearlings but some displacement of co ws with young calves also seems likely the second question is the most crucial since displacement to another area is inconsequential only if calving success is equally good in the alternative areas more precisely if the herd is significan tly less productive in th alternative areas the difference serves not to show the availability of alternatives but rather to highlight the importance of the preferred area for clues scientists have examined the reproductive success both of displaced cows in the cah and of the pch in years when natural events prevented it from calving in the 1002 area griffiths and cameron have shown correla tion of calf survival in the cah with the amount of highprotein food in the calving area in the much narrower coastal plain of the 1002 area any cows displaced southward woul d calve in or nearer the brooks range where golden eagles grizzly bears and wo lves all calf predators are more abundant than on the plain cows displaced to the east and calving in canada tend to eat mosses and evergreens there rather than the more digestible cottongrass and other plants available in the 1002 area99 as noted above in 2000 when snows delayed migrating cows effects on cal f survival were severe100 in sum calving can and in some years does occur in areas other than the preferred 1002 area however evidence exis ts to suggest that calving success will be reduced when this occurs at pres ent displacement from areas of the most nutritious forage is rare event if it were to become common reduced fecundity could be expected smaller drill pads and fewer roads could combine to reduce displacement and with directional drilling pa ds might be sited to avoid areas of high quality forage even then the naturally cyclic nature of caribou populations might conceal all but large effect s for considerable time httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs61 101usgs wildlife research summaries 2002 p 31 102cited in the natural history of an arctic oil field p 91 103usgs wildlife research summaries 2002 p 29attempting to address this question of calf survival usgs scientists used existing field data on cari bou displacement elsewhere and combined it with five possible development scenarios described in previously published literature ranging from development only at the periphery of the northern and western portion of the 1002 up to one scenario that included most of the 1002 area and two full development scenarios then they examined the hypothetical outcomes that would have occurred had those areas been developed at that level with the actual data on the distribution of cows from 1980 to 1995 in effect they asked where would pch cows have gone in each of those 16 years of data if that level of development had been in place and if pch cows responded as other caribou cows do to various kinds of disturbance with this empirical model they then predicted pch calf survival in the areas to which the cows would have b een displaced the simulations indicated that substantial reduction in calf survival during june would be expected under full development of the 1002 area101 would caribou be displaced from insect relief areas relief from massive mosquito populations and then fly populations can be critical to the herd given the particular aversion of cows with young calves to developed areas the potential for conflict with development seems likely to be more important early in the calving season immediately along the coast breezes deter mosquitos any shore facilities or activitie s that block access to the coast could be most significant in this potential conflict later when bot and wa rble fly populations are peaking and calves are older cows with calves are likely to leave the coast and move inland in the cah they may join the rest of the herd when it rests on drill pads or under pipelines or other structures where shade discourages fly populati ons studies by pollard et have shown that temperatures were wer and wind speeds higher on gravel pads and mosquitos and flies were less common on gravel pads than on tundra102 thus gravel drill pads could join other features in providing fly relief to the pch once caribou become accustomed to the facilities however any such benefit is likely to be marginal for the pch since the herd tends to leave the 1002 area before the bot and warble fly populations have reached their peaks103 polar bears polar bears ursus maritimus probably rank right after caribou in generating attention in the anwr bate the beaufort sea population is estimated at about 20002500 bears and ranges along the alaskan and northwestern canadian coasts bears spend most of their adult lives at sea on the ice feeding primarily on seals female bears give birth about once every three years or less if previous cubs died young as they hibern ate while some fe males den on the ice pack other adult female s come ashore in either case they give birth to one to three cubs in the spring the females and c ubs leave the dens those with onshore dens return to join the rest of the population on the ice pack as

paradoxically one new technology may present more difficulties use of 2d seismic expl oration can be accomplished with crews working at considerable intervals between survey lines but for finer analysis of geological data industry may find 3d seismic exploration to be costeffective and preferable supplement however 3d crew s must work at much closer spacing than 2d thereby increasing the potential for conflict with denning bears however more recent studies suggest that denning polar bears may not be as seriously disturbed by human activities as previously thought certain dens exposed to high levels of activity did not suffer detectable reduction in productivity104 other possible conflicts include inhib ition of bears coming ashore for denning and the habituation of polar bears to hum an presence and the subsequent risk to human life protected under the marine ma mmal protection act nd an international agreement though not under the endangered species act polar bears are hunted relatively infrequently in alaska for subsistence and some may lose their fear of humans if human presence increases in the 1002 area as result of development conflicts with scavenging bears might b

species come from studies done in or near developed ar eas around prudhoe bay the populations of many species oscillate as is common in the arctic among shorebir ds only dunlin have shown long term declines though this trend is shown in other arctic areas and may be due to losses in their wintering habitat in east asia106 only 6 bird species are regularly found in the 1002 area in winter snow

scenario and under that envisioned in 1987 only one feature seems to have chan ged markedly much greater reliance onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs64 aircraft many more airstrips are now likely to be built and many more flights made especially in summer when more birds are present than seemed likely in 1987 the species most likely to be affected by these flights is the snow goose since their huge feeding flocks are highly sensitive to overflights and are easily startled away from foraging sites mitigation measures sugge sted in the fleis were careful facilities siting and controls on surface activities air transportation and hunting p 133 these remain important and it seems likely that reduced number of facilities could make siting easier but controls on air traffic seem more likely to be difficult than was assumed then protection of eiders which were not lis ted under at that time could also be an issue in the western part of the refuge where these rare birds are more likely to occur measures to prot ect both species of eiders could include restrictions on certain activities such as vehicular traffic noise construction within about 200 meters 660 feet of activ nests and bitat alteration other species arctic fox populations and brown grizzly bear populations on the coastal plain have increased from velopment due to increased scavenging the fleis noted that the increased populati on of foxes had damaging effects on their normal prey species such as young birds on which they continue to feed scavenging arctic grizzlies can become bituated to humans as they do elsewhere and become dangerous to human life as not ed in the fleis careful control of trash can mitigate both problems special areas if congress opened anwr it could choose to afford special protections to special areas four areas within the coastal plain are commonly considered to have exceptional ecological value and were identified as such in the fleis by far the most frequently mentioned is sadlerochit spring in the southernmost part of the 1002 area th spring maintains flow of water at 5058f yearround and keeps the river open for nearly 5 miles even in winter it represents the extreme northern range of some plants and birds and provides wintering habitat for fish mus koxen frequent the area during the research leading up to the secti on 1002 study 4000 acres around the spring were closed to exploration there are individual native allotments in the sadlerochit area which could complicate attempts to set it aside the kongakut river lies between the 1002 area and the canadian border and flows into the beaufort lagoon becau of the unusual and diverse offshore ecosystem and the presence of some of the north slopes very rare trees in the upper part of the watershed the area is considered ecologically valuable about 25000 acres of this system are included in the extreme northeastern part of the 1002 area the angun plains are in the eastern part of the 1002 area where evidence of pleistocene glaciation is considered special it comprises 36 square miles 23040 acres parts of the jago river drainage were identified in the fleis as nominees for system of ecological reserves the river flows from the brooks range into the 1002 area and to the sea east of kaktovik the report notes that the drainage contains complete array of tundra and floodplain vegetation types and provides habitat for crosssection of all arctic slope wildlife specieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs65 p 20 the particular areas suitable for such ecological reserves were not named by proponents of the idea and th fleis gave acreage figure for it physical environment status and effects much of the attention and controversy over explorati on and development of the 1002 area have focused on potential impacts on biological resources in the area however if development occurs there also will be impacts on the physical environment and resources of the area land air and water as result of construction operations and hum an habitation currently because the area is largely uninhabited the condition of the physical nvironment is almost pristine although rugged and challenging for mans use and essentially unaffected by human activity especially in terms of land and water the dominant physical characteristic is permafrost the permanently frozen layer whic h starts between 1 and 2 feet below the surface and has been found at depth of 2000 feet that impedes drainage and creates saturated soil conditions in most areas of the entire north slope permafrost and the surface layer on top of it are fragile and sp ecial construction techniques such as ice roads and structures built on pilings have been devised to protect them it is undisputed that exploration nd development activ ities will alter the existing physical environment oil field operations will result in air pollution emissions there will be need for larg amounts of water for drilling and ancillary activities including constructi on of roads drill pads and airstrips some amount of gravel will be mined as part of some of these activities and there likely will be impacts from both the mining and use of gravel exploration and development activities will result in the generation of several types of waste streams both wastes from industrial operations and domestic wastes requiring di sposal technologies at issue are the individual and cumulative effects of such alterations and the ability of the natural environment to recover and be reclaimed when oilrelated activities have ceased the industry strongly believes that the 1002 area can be explored and developed in an environmentally sens itive manner industry points out that companies use improved technology compare d with that used in the past for development of existing sites in the arctic region which greatly reduces the footprint of operations and relies on practices that minimize and provide for better disposal of wastes the result is less direct and indirect impact in terms of habitat ss and environmental contamination moreover there are numerous environm ental protection requirements administered by federal and state authorities that are intended to govern and regulate activities that might take place critic s however are concerned about effects of routine operations in the fra gile 1002 environment as well as the possibility of leaks and spills of various contaminating substances and whether adequate safeguards will be included in legislative pr oposals and adopted and enforced by regulators air quality air

significant amounts of ai r polluti on the power facilities needed to support operations on the north slope are quite large according to bpalaska the central compression plant at prudhoe bay has turbin capable of generating the equivalent of 429 megawatts of electric power enough power for city of 150000 people108 even though it burns relatively clean fuel natural gas the north slope complex emits an estimated 63786 tons of air pollution per year109 nitrogen oxide emissions which account for more than twothirds of the total are 23 times the amount emitted by washington dc110 despite these emissions as noted air quality on the north slope of alaska including that in anwr currently meets all national ambient air quality standards annual concentra tions of nitrogen dioxide measured at three monitoring stations in the prudhoe bay field were in fact 70 to 90 below the naaqs in each of the years 19962000 emissions of ot her criteria pollutant s were also within limits111 potential emissions from anwr sources were discussed in the final legislative environmental impact statement complet ed in 1987 and not subsequently updated the fleis concluded that the likely effect on air quality of the full leasing and development alterna tive would be minor112 it also noted that while it is difficult to predict the impacts on air quality in th 1002 area without knowing the scope timing and location of oil developm ent which is impossible to predict without further exploratory activity the maximum nnual emissions from the 1002 area would probably be analogous with pr esent north slope operations113 psd regulatory structure facilities in the 1002 area would be subject to the clean air acts prevention of significan t deterioration rules the psd program is designed to protect air quality where ambient concentrations of pollutants are better than required by national ambient air quality standards pollutants subject to psd requirements are particulate matter sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs67 114allowed levels of pollution in the psd program are termed increments because the standards specify maximum incremental concentr

mandatory cla ss i areas those for which the least increment of pollution is allowed facilities affecting class i areas may increase annual ambient concentrations of nox by only 25 gm3 25 of the naaqs anwr and specifically the 1002 area are not class i areas however the 1002 area has not been designated wilderness and the remainder of anwr while it is officially wilderness was not designated so until after the statute establishing the psd program was enacted thus like most other areas of the united states anwr is class ii area in such areas new facilities may increase concentrations of nox by 25 gm3 25 of the naaqs 10 times the amount allowed if the area were designated class i even this allowed increment could pose constraints for full anwr development in establishing the psd increments for nitrogen oxides in 1988 the environmental protection agency epa made specific note of their potential impact on the north slope stating that certain cl ass ii areas such as prudhoe bay alaska have ambient concentrations as much as 40 gm3 higher than in 1980115 which exceeds the 25 gm3 increment adopted if the fleis is accurate in projecting nox emissions from full development of anwr as analogous to levels observed at prudhoe bay emissions might exceed allo wed levels unless additional pollution control measures are adopted major new sources of air pollution in psd areas must undergo preconstruction review and must install best availa ble control technology bact state permitting agencies in this case the alaska department of environmental conservation determine bact on caseby case basis taking into account energy environmental and economic impacts more stringent controls can be required if modeling indicates that bact is insufficient to avoid violating an allowable

much discussed when anwr development was first considered in the 1980s is phenomenon known as arctic haze beginning in the 1950s arctic observers have noted the presence in late winter and early spring of persistent bands of haze that reduce visibility and change the color of clear skies from deep blue to pale blue or hazy gray the haze consists of suspended particles primarily sulfates that originate in europe and the formerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs68 116leonard barrie and jan w bottenheim s ulphur and nitrogen pollution in the arctic atmosphere in wt sturges ed pollution of the

precipitation and weak sunlight produces remarkably stable air masses in winter and early spring allowing the particles to remain airborne for weeks at time nd to spread thousands of miles from their point of origin arctic haze appears to be less of concern at present than it was in the 1980s with the breakup of the former soviet ion and the closure of many of the most heavily emitting industrial fac ilities in eastern europe and russia the haze has declined by as much as 50 since the mid1980s117 emissions from alaskas north slope appear to contribute relatively little to the problem water resources and wetlands issues of concern for potential oil exploration and development in the 1002 ar ea are the availability of water supplies and the impacts of production activities on th water and wetland resources of the area large amounts of water are needed for drilling and ancillary activities such as ice roads and airstrip construc tion as well as domestic use description of the resource according to the 1987 fleis free water is limited in the 1002 area and is confined to the surface and the shallow zone of soil located above the impermeable permafrost layer the refuge receives an average of 6 inches of precipitation annually study done in 1989 found 255 lakes ponds and puddles within the 1002 area most lakes are shallow and freeze solid in winter less than 25 were deeper than 7 feet and only 8 contained enough unfrozen water to build mile or more of ice road118 number of rivers and streams exist in the 1002 area most draining to the coast and th beaufort sea thes too are also usually shallow according to the fleis 99 of the 1002 area is classified as wetlands which are transitional lands found be tween terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table usually is at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water arctic wetlands are different from those in the lower 48 states however in warmer areas outside of alaska wetlands play significant role in floodw ater storage lateral water movement groundwater recharge and sedime nt and erosion control but in the arctic area the permafrost layer impedes drainage and prevents many of the processes normally attributed to wetlands from occurring because most arctic wetlands are not hydrologically linked to unde rground aquifers however this thin surface layer of soil and rock located above the permanen tly frozen layer is the area where the processes that sustain life in the arctic occur including the cycle of freezing in winter and thawing in the brief summer and where biological activity

areas and tiny shrubs and dwarf trees in the foothills and uplands water availability is cyclical during the year in the spring rapid snowmelt occurs throughout the area and melting s now flows to rivers because it does not penetrate the permafrost rivers run full riverbanks are severely eroded by ice and snow and there is extensive spring floodi ng turbidity from suspended sediments is high which impairs water quality in summer and fall rain follows which can also lead to fl ooding but at the time of freezeup in the fall low water supply conditions prevail most rivers go dry or freeze to the bottom and streamflow ceases during winter except below few warm springs currently water quality conditions in the 1002 area are not affected by human activity while the state does not have ex tensive information about water quality in the vast majority of alaskas watersheds because they are not actively monitored most are presumed to be in relatively pristine condition including the 1002 area due to the states size sparse populati on and general remote ness as of 1987 data were available on wate r quality below the permafrost in the 1002 area but the water beneath it is probably brackish according to the fleis effects of oil exploration and development the 1987 fleis identified the use of limited fresh water sources for i ndustrial purposes as having the potential for major adverse effects if exploration and development of the 1002 area occur it estimated that one exploratory well could require 15 million gallons of water 7 to 8 million gallons for constructi on and maintenance of an airstrip 12 to 15 million gallons per mile for road construction nd maintenance and 17 to 2 million gallons for drilling operations and domestic use despite technological improvements and smaller footprint for oil and gas operations in the arctic today discussed below estimates of water requirements are generally the same as presented in the fleis these water supply needs result from the fact that ice is the construction material of choice for the winter explora tion season to make temporary roads winter airstrips and drill pads in preference to mining of gravel discussed below this is done by spreading 6 inches of chipped i ce from rivers and lakes then spraying the area with fresh water to make temporary roads and pads that melt in the spring when they melt they leave significant damage to the tundra road construction techniques have evolved since early days of oil activity in the arctic temporary ice roads now allow construction of oil field pipelines during the winter months thus largely eliminating the need for permanen t gravel roads adjacent to pipelines120 source of water for ice roads airstrips and drill pads would need to be located but

would diminish the aquatic species that are food for migratory waterfowl heavy withdrawals from the canning river which flows freely in winter for many miles below warm springs could harm overwintering fish121 the deepest river basins are near the mouths of the canning and jago rivers if the brackish water from these basins were used for ice roads the result could be harm to tundra vegetation when the ice melts in the spring because the refuge has few deep lakes or lakes that do not freeze solid in winter it is believed that there is only enough water in the 1002 area for less than 50 miles of ice roads122 to meet water needs alternatives that might be considered include creating water reservoirs by excav ating deep pools in conjunction with gravel removal overflow during spring runoff would fill the basins and the accumulated water could be used for cons truction with sufficiently d eep basins habitat could be created for overwintering fish if econo mic quantities of oil were not found basins might be left in place or it would be nece ssary to find clean gravel to fill in the basins riparian habitat is heavily used by musk oxen in winter and siting of facilities in riparian areas w ith or without oil discovery would likely to be an issue companies might also melt lake and ri ver ice and snow or desalinate marine water oil companies also might consider transporting water by truck from existing developed areas such as prudhoe bay lthough the economics of doing so for long distances could be impractical another possibility is that oil companies might revert to building gravel roads for exploration and production as in the past elsewhere on the north slope on the north slope today most wastes associated with drilling as well as sewage and garbage are injected in dedicated disposal wells rather than in waste pits which greatly reduces surface impacts and water pollution incidents the oil industry has improved both technology nd practices to prevent and clean up accidental releases th at could harm the surface layer nd water however critics are concerned about the possibility of spills of various substances including waste oil acid ethylene glycol and drilling fluids especially given the relatively few lakes and streams in the 1002 area even small spills if not cleaned up can affect lakes and streams for example if spill on an ice pad melts in the spring the primary impact of contaminated water is its potential to reduce oxygen availability in receiving waters plus possible toxicity of the waste123 critics also are concerned that leaks and spills of oil fuel chemicals or brine could contaminat soils thus killing vegetation and resulting in s cattered small hab itat loss in addition they are concerned about the

standards will not be violated in addition th state requires development of oil discharge prevention and contingency plans for exploration or production facilities and proof of financial responsibility to ensure that owners and operators maintain adequate financial resources to respond to any spill and mitigat environmental damages the states department of fish and ga also would conduct review of any proposed project for possible impacts on anadromous fish there is little public information availa ble concerning oil industry compliance with state water quality standards permits and other environmental requirements the industry believes that as result of improved technology and operating practices especially in recent years its environmental performance in the arctic is good critics however point out that data compiled by the alaska department of environmental conservation demonstrate that on average several hundred spills of hazardous substances refine d oil products and crude oil occur each year at existing north slope operations and some argue that the oil industry should not be allowed into the 1002 area until it fixes chronic pr oblems with leaky and poorly maintained physical structures124 the clean water act requires that facilitie s must obtain permits which authorize discharge of processed wastewater these permits issued in alaska by epa establish specific limitations on pollutants in industrial waste or sewage that may be discharged from any facility to waters of the united states as well as general requirements such as monitoring and reporting cwa permits for oil and gas operations in the arctic typically require best management practices bmp plans which focus on pollution prevention rather than endofpipe discharge limits through specification of structural and operational cont rols maintenance and inspections outside of the 1002 area epa has issued general permit for onshore and

constructed of gravel pit water discharges of sanitary andor domestic wastewater from covered facilities and construction dewatering the general permit application process is streamlined because individual sources covered by ge neral permit do not need to apply to epa for sourcespecific permit if they file notice of intent and meet certain other qualifications they can be covered by the general permit the current general permit was issued in 1997 and extends to april 10 2002 it is possible that epa would also choose to issue general permit for any activities in the 1002 area epa also issues cwa permits for stormwater discharges of uncontaminated rainwater and snowmelt arctic drilling and pr oduction pads do not have conventional storm drains as in other parts of the country so stormwater discharges are in the form of surface runoff during th spring thaw season stormwater permits focus on plans to prevent releases of cont aminated runoff to waters of the united states the safe drinking water act sdwa authorizes program to protect underground sources of drinking water usd ws from contamination by injection through wells in alaska primary res ponsibility for regulation of injection wells through this program is split between epa and the alaska oil and gas conservation commission aogcc epa issues permits authorizing subsurface injection of non hazardous industrial wastes associated w ith oil exploration and development while the aogcc issues permits for wells used for injection of fluids brought to the surface from oil and gas production operati ons or liquid hydrocarbons which are stored underground injection of fluid wastes which cannot be recycled is preferred to the discharge to surface disposal pits or ponds underground injection is to be conducted so as to protect usdws howe ver in existing oil production areas on the north slope epa has determined that there are most likely not any aquifers beneath the permafrost which are fresh enough to qualify for protection as usdws thus the agency has granted several waiver requests from oil companies authorizing underground injection with less stringent re quirements than normal this could be precedent for anwr as well separate from the cwa discharge per mit program administered by epa 404 of the cwa also contains permit program administered by the us army corps of engineers under which dvance approval must be obt ained for discharges from any project that involves dredging or fillin g of the nations waters including adjacent wetlands because of the ex tent of wetlands in the 1002 area these requirements are likely to apply to nearly all oil exploration and development activities that might occur onshore in addition the rivers and harbors act of 1899 requires permits from the corps for construction of any dam or dike in navigable waterway or any structure in or over any navigable waterway if the structure affects the course location or condition of the waterbody125 if docks or

research and sanctuaries act title i known as the ocean dumping act which requires permit from the corps for the disposal of dredged material in the territorial seas for example for disposal of material dredged in the constr uction of channels in open seas needed to get to shore facilities in carrying out its regulatory responsibilities the corps evaluates project s through public in terest balancing process considering the pub lic benefits and detriments of all relevant factors including conservation econo mics aesthetics wetlands cultural values fish and wildlife values and navigation further the corps shares jurisdiction with other agencies for example the corps uses nvironmental guidelines issued by epa to evaluate impacts of proposed discharge nd consults with othe r federal and state agencies before issuing permits the coastal zone management act czma requires certification by states that projects to be located in states coastal zone are consistent with the states coastal zone management program the cw requires similar state certification concerning compliance with state water quality standards both would presumably apply to oil exploration and development activities according to epa officials however in part because of resource limitations the state of alaska frequently waives czma and cwa certification rather than using that authority to impose environmental conditions on projects126 waste disposal oil exploration and drilling result in the generation of several waste streams there are also sm all quantities of solid and hazardous wastes associated with

advances and heightened sensitivity on the part of the operators to the need for careful operation in the arctic environment offer an optimistic outlook but the possibility of an acci dent or deliberate violation of waste disposal permit or regulation always exists land and gravel use gravel is necessary co mponent of exploration and development activities on the north slope and gravel suitable for these activities is relatively valuable resource there131 however with the higher velocities of rivers in the narrow coastal plain of the 1002 area gravel is more bundant than in the broader developed tion of the coast plain to the west gravel roads and pads are constructed by piling gravel on top of tundra to provide base for aboveground structures and to insulate the permafrost that lies just below the surface the mining of gravel from streambeds and floodplains for such purposes can alter natural river drainage and cause increased erosion nd sedimentation ve getation covered with layers of gravel dies subtracting its re sources from the food web of the ecosystem in addition dust blown from the gravel stru cture may affect freezing and thawing of nearby vegetation as may any material wa shed from the gravel surface the blown dust might convey some unexpect ed benefits dust kicked up from gravel structures may cause earlier snow melt early melting stimulates plant growth and could provide earlier foraging areas for waterfowl possible contamination of the dust with wastes might counter benefits however the need for gravel for activities in the 1002 area if development occurs is likely to be much less than that for earlier years of oil development in existing areas for several reasons first gravel previously was used as the base for nearly all road and pad construction but today it is likely to be used only for permanent roads and pads because ice is the preferred construction material for temporary roads and pads although the availability of ad equate supplies of water is an issue for development of the 1002 area see water resources and wetlands above second gravel previously was mined to create reserve pits that held drilling muds and other produced wastes today however nearly ll wastes are recycled reused or disposed by underground injection thus greatly reducin g the need for reserve pits third even where used for drilling pads the amount of gr avel needed will be less because of the smaller overall footprint of sites if development in the 1002 area followed the pattern at alpine it would be if not entirely roadless then

substantial reduction in the miles of roads relative to earlier development however it is not clear whether roadle ss development along the alpine model would be economic in anwr according to recent report current leaseholders at the badami oil field 25 miles further east than the current easternmost permanent road on the north slope and about 25 miles west of the 1002 area are seeking permanent road to field133 the leaseholders argue that the leases are not economic without yearround road they seek state funding for the creation of this road if such road were built the badami area would represent the nearest staging area to the 1002 area thus depending on whether the badami road is built development in the 1002 area would require eith er construction of an add itional 25 or 50 miles of gravel road up to the refuge boundary plus ice roads into the 1002 exploration sites proponents of state construction of the ba dami road estimate that it would cost 50 60 million similarly the three most extens ive of 5 development scenarios in one recent model assume the presence of road parallel to pipeline as well as connector road to kaktovik in the 1002 area134 the absence of gravel road linked to currently developed areas would add to the cost of development of anwr potentially making some prosp ects uneconomic or adding to pressure to build gravel roads outside or inside the 1002 area on the other hand variety of factors including higher oil prices could mean that such costs would not be prohibitive caribou cows in existing oil fields with calves younger than few weeks old roughly during june in most years are known to avoid roads pads and other areas around human activity avoidance during this early period extends well beyond the footprint of facilities especially in early years of oil development135 see also caribou above if road mileage were redu ced impacts on calves at this sensitive time could be lowered in anwr as calving ends in early june and as the porcupine caribou herd pch tends to m ove to the coast and the western portion of the 1002 area for insect relief roads or runways oriented across the path of travel could be expected to disrupt the cows m ovement more than those oriented roughly parallel to it if calving were displaced to the foothills greater predation would apparently result if foraging is displaced from prime areas weight

congregate in these areas later in the summer when calves are older some cowcalf pairs may join them consequently interpreta tions of impacts based on the cah must be made cautiously due to the differing concentr ations of the herds and the differing availability of similar calving areas137 if road mileage were limited impacts would probably be lowered conversely if road s were not limited or if economic necessity later resulted in change in this rest riction impacts on the pch or other species such as tundra swans which tend to avoi d nesting within 200 meters about 650 feet of roads could be greater see also biological resources status and effects above changing footprint estimate 1987 vs 2001 there has been considerable focus in recent years on the reduced footprint that seems likely in any 1002 development given advances in ex ploration developm ent and production technologies as well as the possibility of added congressiona l restrictions on environmental impacts it may be useful to compare those features considered in the footprint as described in the 1987 fleis and how that might differ from scenario predicated on modern technologies in 1987 the fleis described the assumptions built into its full development scenario for the sake of maintaining data confidentiality the full development scenario shows highly generalized placement of production and transportation facilities based on typical north slope prospect characteristics for three localities within the 1002 area this assumes successful exploration in all three localities actual placement of oil production facilities and marine fac ilities on the 1002 area or location of the trunk pipeline from producing fields to taps pump station 1 depends upon sitespecific geotechnical engineering environmental and economic data that can be determined only after specific prospect has been drilled and discovery ma and confirmed138 the features considered in the fleis on p 99 are shown in table 4 along with the estimate given at that time for th space or miles that would be occupied by the feature in full development as hypothesized by the fleis the third column shows in qualitative terms how modern technology would probably change the estimate provided in 1987 assuming the sa full development scenario the highlights of the comparison are as follows some features would very likely or probably be reduced in total acreage or mileage few might even be eliminated these are spur roads with collecting lines connecting fewer pads in given oil fieldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs78 139some development advocates do not include roads connecting the pads for example rep sununu in an editorial discussing his amendment to hr 4 adopted aug 1 2001 to limit total surface occupancy in future development of the 1002 area to 2000 acres said his language did not include roads saying that most roads in the 1002 area would be made of ice manchester union leader aug 20 2001large permanent airfields supporting an entire area as at deadhorse or kuparuk permanent drill pads pits for gravel mines borrow pits major river or stream crossings given fewer roads main road paralleling main pipeline possibly such road and large central processing facility as at deadhorse or kuparuk possibly such facility in other instances new technology mig ht actually increase the demand for acreage devoted to some features marine and saltwater treatment facilities due to greater modern demand forwater but possibly substituted with smaller plants for fields near coast and small permanent airfields enough for each cluster of pads not supplied by permanent road assuming the same full development scenario as the fleis some features would probably remain the same main oil pipeline within the 1002 area and collecting lines from drill pads to main oil pipeline finally in some instances it is simply unclear whether some features would be built marine port facilitie s to offload barges and other heavy equipment main road from marine facility in 1987 the fleis in its hypothetical full development scenario estimated that the total acreage covered would be 5330 to 5980 acres comparison with scenario using modern technology suggests that the footprint as defined by the fleis in its table would be smaller but perhaps not markedly so if as suggested by arctic power prodevelopment gr oup cited earlier full development of the 1002 area could be accomplished by buildin g more than 2000 acres of facilities scattered appropria tely around developed oil fields and assuming the same oil fields as the fleis then either its definition of footprint is different from that used in the fleis or additional technological impr ovements may be require d it is the pads airstrips pad supports and connector ro ads that are typically considered when development proponents have recently referred to limiting surface impacts to 2000 acres other features such as pipelines gr avel mines and the like typically are not139 while the technologies used would be affected by economics direction by congress could specify higher or lower st andards than those assumed in the table moreover development

cycles of the arctic environment can make recovery ra tes much slower however there is research to show whether this type of vegetational damage w ould affect foraging animals140 the vegetation under ice roads and i ce pads may be damaged partly by compaction but also by being delayed in its spurt of growth in the brief summer where all debris is removed and spills have occurred little effect has been observed141 where insulation is used to maintain an ice pad over single summer damage appeared to be confined to ar eas around the edges of the pad where some thawing had occurred but sunlight had reached the plants evidence of recolonization began to appear in two growing seasons142 port and offshore activity the fleis assumed that 2 ports would be built to support development in the 1002 area it is unclear whether that assumption is still likely if water for ice roads is at premium port development could reduce the need for long ice roads from the west if port facilities were carefully sited and built offshore and connected to shore via causeways and in turn to ice roads they may prove attractive for the staging and move ment of heavy equipment offshore facilities may also be considered for placem ent of heavy equipment such as water treatment plants since such placement could put them outside any 2000 acre limit on surface occupancy if congress were to impose such limit the reduction in surface impacts would be traded for potential offshore impacts in the fleis the focus of impacts from causeways was on fish migration if ports were to be located on native lands

settle alaska natives aboriginal land claims the act established 12 forprofit native regional corporations and several hundred forprofit or nonprofit native village corporations natives were to own

regions represented by 12 existing native associations many of these 12 native associations became todays nonprofit regiona l corporations at least one the inupiat community of the arctic slope became

corporations ancsa also abolished all but one of the few reservations that then existed in alaska but village corporations on these few reservations could opt to forego regional shareholdings and instead take direct fee title to the surface and subsurface of their former reservations today many regional native corporations have subsidiaries in the oil supplies and services industries as well

kaktovik census statistics for 1990 show that 54 of arctic villages adults and 48 of veneties adults were in the labor force162 the gwichin argue that oil and gas velopment in the 1002 area will endanger the pch by threatening the herds calving areas and that because of their dependence on the pch they will suffer subsistence loss and harm to their culture when critics from the prodevelopment set of alaska natives argue that arctic village and venetie in the 1980s sold oil developmen t leases ultimately unsuccessful on their lands and that the villages seemed unconcer ned about endangering

united states received certain asrc lands in the gates of the arctic national park and asrc received the subsurface rights to the kic lands which it will be recalled are three townships within the

native rights the canadian government has consisten tly opposed development in the 1002 area citing risks to the pch and consequently to the gwi chin people found on both sides of the international border166 it also points to 1987 uscanada agreement on the conservation of the porcupine caribou herd under which each nation agreed to protect the pch and its habitat if one count ry plans to carry out an activity that may result in significant long term adverse impacts on the pch the other is to be notified and given the opportunity to consult before any final decision canada cites evidence of its commitment to the herd in its creation of ivvavik and vuntuk national parks on the canadian side which prevent development in impor tant calving and migration areas on its side of the border the embassy website notes the 1002 area of anwr contains the core of the critically important calving area for the porcupine caribou herd and canada is convinced that only perm anent protection of the plain will assure the herds longterm sustainability167 development proponents ofte n claim that the canadian position borders on hypocrisy since significant portion of the pch range in canada was leased for oil and gas development in decades past but commercial quan tities of hydrocarbons were not found and leases have been allowe d to lapse thus this argument goes canadian opposition arose

if energy development did occur then even under the most stringen t requirements for envi ronmental protection major question would remain what should be done after the oil andor natural gas are

producing fields in the 1002 area was over169 yet it also speaks of the longter m commitment of this area to industrial use based on oil and gas development170 and of longterm changes in the wilderness environment wildlife habitats and native community activities currently existing resulting instead in an area gove rned by industrial activities171 and it notes that complete restoration of disturbed site s may not be possible inasmuch as construction activities drama tically alter surface featur which determine plant species composition in the natural habitat172 these comments raise the question as to whether the 1002 area upon initiation of deve lopment remains an integral part of wildlife refuge with temporary albeit long interlude of i ndustrial activity or an area whose fundamental purpose has change d but continues to lie within the boundaries of national wildlife refuge whatever development mig ht be permitted should it be seen as essentially temporary serving immediate energy needs and then being removed followed by restoring the 1002 area habitat to cond ition as near as possible to its pre development state the answers to stions about rehabilitation of the 1002 area and the confidence in the response will cr ucially affect not only any development of the area but also will likely affect vi ews on whether the 1002 area should be opened to exploration and production in the first place conditions for rehabilitation total rehabilitation after development could be defined as restoration to state whic h trained ecologist could not distinguish from the original ecosystem so define d total rehabilitation of the 1002 area might require centuries and could be impossibl since it might be confounded by other longterm changes global warming changes in sea

could not easily or frequently detect human influences then such level might be an achievable but very difficult goal such goal would probably require not merely the removal of structures and equipment and stringent pollution control including the safe dispos of hazardous and other wastes but also the return to predevelopment human popula tion levels the removal of gravel roads and the restoration of native vegetation as yet major operating oil fields anywhere are known to have been shut down permanently and many have kept producing long beyond initial expectations due to enhanced recovery techniques thus there is little relevant experience to guide total closure of potential 1002 area devel opment interestingly in 1988 arco alaska said with respect to prudhoe bay th at large scale rehabilitationrestoration is neither currently practical nor requi red by federal or state regulations173 thus rehabilitation and restoration could be an important feature in congressional debate concerning the 1002 area human population levels in an oil field human population levels reach peak during the construction phase once producible field s been confirmed in 1987 the fleis estimated 1500 worker s at the peak of construction174 after major construction projects ar completed personnel levels drop to those needed for operations perhaps few hundred workers or for smaller construction projects such as the addition of new drill pads once energy production ceases it is hard to imagine what incentives would hold workers in the 1002 area since few other indus tries seem likely to seek the high cost of north slope operations an importa nt exception would be alaska natives presumably those in kaktovik especially with an increasing reliance on monetary economy both for personal and local govern ment income there may be pressure to maintain development to s upport possibly subsidized lternative local industries including tourism the north slope borough has stated that its support for 1002 development stems partly from cern over declining prudhoe bay revenues which are used for schools fire stations and other facilities over the years little debate has focused on the postdevelopment status of permanent human populations reflection in part of lack of deba on the longterm fate of the 1002 area in general removal of roads and gravel structures there is striking distinction between the access policies around development areas in the north slope versus those in the 1002 area as it is currently managed in the former road network provides relatively easy transpor tation but its use is largel restricted to authorizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs93 175under anilca title xi an applicant for permanent structure affixed to the ground eg gravel road or pad has to apply for right of way to cross federal land the reuse of the structure after development would have to be compatible with the purposes of the refuge if congress authorizes development it could choose different procedure more or less strict than the standard pro cess for applicants in the 1002 areapersons in the latter the lack of roads requires aircraft for most travel but the journey is relatively unres tricted if congress decides to authorize 1002 area development the fate of roads could have farreaching environmental effects175 under the scenario for development base d on current technologies fewer roads would be built than with older technology however if oil pri ces fall or operating costs rise the cost of reliance on expensiv aircraft might make construction of haul roads seem attractive especially for move ment of heavy equipment in addition it is unclear whether any restri ctions on road construction would apply to native lands and still less whether requirements for road removal would apply on native lands in any event under all current scenarios it is likely that at least some roads would be built if these are in unconnected small segments as at alpi ne their effects on human access would probably be quite small experience in national parks national forests and national wildlife refuges has shown that reducing human access can benefit sensitive species in such matters as preventing illegal hunting or reducing disturbance of nesting sites cal ving areas or spawning streams removing millions of tons of gravel from roads and pads some of it contaminated with oil or other toxins w ould be expensive but so would continued gravel maintenance to preserve culverts and other flow control measures costs would likely prevent either the total rem oval of roads once production ceased or the indefinite maintenance of the full networ k unless otherwise specified or required rehabilitation of gravel structures would likely include removal of culverts and bridges to ensure natural drainage gradin g and scoring of the road or pad surfaces and seeding of grasses and forbs care would be required to minimize erosion sedimentation and ponding proba bly only if there were need for gravel elsewhere would some portion of the gravel be removed from ab andoned roadbeds thus if leasing is allowe d and production is achieved th ere appear to be several options depending on the gravel structure nd congressional policy first some may wish to see certain useful structures retained even if all production ceases examples of such structures are water treatment plants and some airfields others such as drill pads seem unlikely to be useful in postproduction setting and would likely be priority candidates for remova l finally for roads there appear to be two basic options maintain some roads while rehabilitating rights of way for the rest or abandon all of the roads and reha bilitate the rights of way in an effort to return to pre development conditions if development were to result in increased tourism eg visitor centers or visitor cabins there might be considerable pressure to keep at least some roads open especially if tourism were seen as continuing source of income for natives after development ceased continuing access coul d be expected to prolong habitat disturban ce and delay

native plants would be key factor in restoration of anima l populations there is key distinction between the 1002 area and the developed areas to the west the rolling hills of much of the 1002 area support more shrubby woody vegetation while the wetlands of the developed areas are dominated by herbaceous vegetation thus restoration experience around prudhoe bay and environs may provide useful techniques for only part of the 1002 area moreover recent research has shown that none but the smallest and wettest patches on level ground recovere d unassisted to something approaching their original state in the medium term 2075 years176 in larger drier or more sloping sites revegetation where it occurre d often resulted in speci composition that differed from the original state wide

phaseout the requirement to remove all facilities and to rehabilitate the site is generally term or condition of lease sale thus far there is relatively limited experience in the arctic from which to judge the effectiveness of this requirement north slope fields that have been developed are still active and only relatively small number of drilling sites have been abandoned these abandoned sites include few artificial drilling islands in the beaufort sea and number of onshore sites several of which are in th npra at the abandoned island sites facilities and slope protection have been removed and the artificial islands were left to erode away the npra example is pa rticularly relevant to anwr development site cleanup in the npra before the recent return to npra prospects there were two rounds of drilling in the npra the most recent was between 1974 and 1981 when 28 wells were drilled in federal program under the supervision of usgs in that round each exploratory site included drill pad airstrip and source of water supply buildings and equipmen t were located on the drilling pad often on pilings to prevent thawing of the permafrost the pad design included fuel storage pit reserve pit for drilling fluids and cuttings and flare pit cleanup included removing miscellaneous debris cutting off pilings below ground level and filling the pits by grading off and contouring the gravel pads then revegetation of the sites was attempted using grass seed mixtures and fertilizer the program for revegetating the pads met with mixed success generally the least success was found at some

scenario estimated that 5650 acres scattered around the 15 million acre 1002 area would be physically covered with gravel less than 04 as noted previously see land and gravel use above somewhat less w ould probably be covered with the use of modern technologies though these features would still be scattered in various spots around the 1002 area until the affected areas we re restored and revegetated the impacts would remain visible at least as long as they were not concealed by snow and darkness as different requirements for rehabilitation might apply to native lands their inholdings might retain various st ructures or pads might remain for considerably longer period retention of facilities the other option the alternative to removing all drilling pads roads buildings airstrips and other facilities would be judgment that some of the development may be of longer term and or broader benefit than the oil and gas development in the immediate area in remote regions of hostile environment emergency shelters can be lif esavers building or other recognizable structure such as road or airstrip in featureless region can serve as visual aid to navigation which can also save

area opponents of energy development in anwr argue that variety of other options could provide the energy equiva lent of most projections of anwr oil production especially if one ssumes the high energy prices necessary to reach the most generous assumptions regarding refu ge resources more succinctly the high energy prices that would make refuge il economic would make variety of other energy options attractive as well recogn izing the great importance of oil in the transportation market opponent s most frequently mention increases in fuel economy for cars and light trucks and pr oduction of ethanol from cellulose181 increases in efficiency in other sectors heating and cooling especially are also mentioned others have argued that developing anwr oil thereby continuing national reliance on taps is harmful to us energy security especially with respect to terrorist attacks one author called taps among the gravest threats to us energy security due to the vulnerability of the pipeline lack of alternatives if it were seriously damaged and the difficulty of repairing the aging pipeline182 addition of any anwr oil would continue that risk in this line of reasoning consequently for not only environmen tal but also economic and security reasons opponents of anwr oil development believe that other options especially in the transportation sector are preferable to development of the refuge proponents downplay the economic rationale and practicality of the alternatives but have only recently begun to focus on continued reliance on taps as security argument exploration only some have argued that the 1002 area s hould be opened to exploration first before decision is made on whether to proceed to leasing those with this view hold that with greater certainty about the presence or absence of energy resources better decision could be made about whether to open the co astal plain for full leasing this idea has had relatively little support over the years for those opposed to

representing the craft workers for particular project plas establish the terms and conditions of work that will apply for the particular project the agreement may also specify source such as union hiring hall to supply the craft workers for the project typically the agreement is binding on all contractors and subcont ractors working on the project and specifies wage rates and benefits discusses proce dures for resolving labor and jurisdictional disputes and includes nostrike clause proponents of plas argue that they ensure reliable efficient labor source and help keep costs down opponents contend that plas inflate project costs and decrease competition there is little indepe ndent information and data to sort out these conflicting assertions and demonstrate whether pl as contribute to lower or higher project costs construction and other unions and their supporters strongly favor plas because they believe that plas help ensure access for union members to federal and federally f

disposition recurring issue in the anwr debate is that of disposition of possible revenues not only from oil but also from sale of gravel or water resources there are two parts to the disposition question how would revenues be split between the federal government and the state and b how would th federal portion be used federalstate split the mineral leasing act mla189 governs the leasing of oil and gas and certain other minerals from federal pub lic lands under 35 of the mla certain western states receive directly 50 of revenues received an additional 40 goes to those states in directly through the construction and maintenance of irrigation project s under the reclamation act of 1902190 before 1976 these percentages were 37½ and 52½ respectively because the territory of alaska did not benefit from the recl amation act it received only 37½ share of federal leasing revenues before enac tment of the alaska statehood act congress amended the mla to provide that the rritory would receive an additional 52½ share thereby putting alaska on the same footing as the other states191 section 28b of the alaska statehood act again amended the mla to change the references from territory to state of alaska192 section 317 of the fede ral land policy management act of 1976 amended the revenues section of mla to direct payment of 90 to alaska rather than the separate percentages previously stated193 the committee report accompanying the 1976 change states that the action was intended to clarify that alaska was to continue to receive 90 of the mineral revenues taken in from federal lands in alaska194 alaska has asserted that the 90 tota l referenced in the statehood act cannot be changed and must always be paid to the state because the statehood act is compact between the prospective state and the federal government others assert that the statehood act provision was technical one meant to recognize that alaska should receive share comparable to that of other states under the mla but does not preclude the congress from changing the mla or at times making special provision for leasing certain areas under different regimen alaska sued in the us court of federal claims asserting that because the united states had an obligation under th statehood act both to maximize mineral leasing in alaska and to always pay 90 share of gross receipts to alaska thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31278crs102 195alaska v united states 35 fed cl 685 701 1996 196ibid at 706 19710 usc 7433 198pl 96514 94 stat 2964united states had either breached the cont ract established by the statehood act or taken property of alaska by withdrawing some lands in alaska from leasing notably anwr and by deducting administra tive costs prior to the disbursement of the 90 revenues to the state the c ourt found that the statehood act and the previous statute providing the territory of alaska with the same shares as the other states simply plugged alaska into the mla along with the other states195 therefore congress could amend the mla eg to provide different way of calculating receipts and the changes would lawfully pertain to alaska furthermore the court concluded that the united states did not promise in the statehood act to make federal mineral lands produce royalty revenues for the state and that the united states therefore retained discretion over leasing decisions196 because of these findings the court also granted the gove rnments motion for summary judgment on the takings claim dismissing alaskas claim if the statehood act simply means that alaska will be treated like other states under the mla the question may be asked whether congress may legislate specially as to anwr and prescribe different reve nuesharing provisions congress has done so in the past eg with respect to the national petroleum reserves in which situation all of the revenues go into the federal treasury197 except for the national petroleum reserve in alaska in whic h instance the revenue sharing is 5050198 therefore arguably congress has flexibility in legislating regarding oil and gas leasing in the refuge including providing for the disposition of revenues from any such leasing uses for federal share of revenues proponents of opening anwr for oil production point out that the federa l share of any reve nues could be made available for various conservation pur poses including ameliorating impacts providing funds for research on renewable ergy sources or assisting other refuges and conservation areas while additi onal funding for these purposes would undoubtedly cheer many environmental groups it is difficult to name any such group whose views on anwr development have been swayed by such proposals wilderness designation in each
