whitaker legislative attorney american law division summary issue advocacy communications have become increasingly popular in recent federal election cycles these advertisements are often interpreted to favor or disfavor certain candidates while also serving to inform the public about policy issue however unlike communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate the supreme court has determined that issue ads are constitutionally protected first amendment speech that cannot be regulated in any manner according to most lower court rulings only speech containing express words of advocacy of election or defeat also known as express advocacy or magic words can be regulated as electionrelated communications and therefore be subject to the requirements of the federal election campaign act feca unlike express advocacy communications therefore issue ads may be paid for with funds unregulated by federal law ie soft money hr 2356 shaysmeehan as passed by the house would create new term in federal election law electioneering communication which would regulate political ads that refer to clearly identified federal candidate are broadcast within 30 days of primary or 60 days of general election and for house and senate elections are targeted to the relevant electorate generally it would require disclosure of disbursements over 10000 for such communications including identification of each donor of 1000 or more and would prohibit the financing of such communications with union or certain corporate funds likewise s 27 mccainfeingold as passed by the senate would regulate the same communications as hr 2356 in the same manner except with regard to the audience receiving the communication s 27 provides that the communication be made to an audience that includes voters in that election background used to describe political advertisements the terms issue advocacy and express advocacy were created by the supreme court and do not appear in federal campaignhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98282crs2 1 codified at 2 usc 431 et seq 2 see 2 usc 434 disclosure 2 usc 441b source restrictions 2 usc 441a contribution limits 3 424 us 1 1976 4 id at 4044 5 id at 44 n52finance law ie the federal election campaign act feca1 however whether an advertisement is classified as either issue advocacy or express advocacy will determine whether it is subject to feca regulation the attendant practical implications are significa nt if communication is deemed to constitute express advocacy it will be subject to the disclosure requirements source restrictions and contribution limits set forth in feca2 on the other hand if communication is deemed to be issue advocacy it cannot be constitutionally subject to any regulation and therefore may be funded with unregulated or soft money supreme court decisions in the 1976 landmark decision buckley v valeo 3 the supreme court provided the genesis for the concept of issue and express advocacy communications in buckley the court evaluated the constitutionality of provisions of the federal election campaign act feca that applied to expenditures relative to clearly identified candidate and for the purpose of influencing an election the court found that such provisions did not provide sufficiently precise description of what conduct was regulated and what conduct was not regulated in violation of first amendment void for vagueness jurisprudence furthermore the court was concerned under the overbreadth doctrine that the statute could encompass not only communications with an electoral connection but could encompass constitutionally protected issuebased speech as well in order to avoid these vagueness and overbreadth problems the court held that the governments regulatory power under feca would be construed to reach only those funds spent for communications that include express words of advocacy of the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate hence the buckley court began to distinguish between communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate and those communications that advocate position on an issue the court found that the latter type of communication is constitutionally protected first amendment speech and that only express advocacy speech could be subject to regulation4 further in an important footnote the court provided some guidance as to how to determine whether communication is express advocacy or issue advocacy that is the court stated that its construction of the subject provisions of feca would only apply to communications that included words such as vote for elect support cast your ballot for smith for congress vote against defeat or reject5 these terms are often referred to as the magic words which many lower courts have ruled are required under buckley in order for communication to constitute express advocacyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98282crs3 6 479 us 238 249250 1986 2 usc 441ba prohibits corporations from making expenditures in connection with any federal election 7 id at 249 8 fec definition of expressly advocating 11 cfr 10022 2001in the 1986 decision of federal election commission v massachusetts citizens for life inc mcfl the supreme court continued to distinguish between issue and express advocacy holding that an expenditure must constitute express advocacy in order to be subject to the federal election campaig n act feca prohibition against corporations using treasury funds to make an expenditure in connection with any federal election6 in mcfl the court ruled that publication urging voters to vote for prolife candidates while also identifying and providing photographs of certain candidates who fit that description could not be regarded as mere discussion of public issues that by their nature raise the names of certain politicians instead the court looked at the essential nature of the publication and found that it in effect provided an explicit directive to the reader to vote for the identified candidates consequently the court held that the publication constituted express advocacy7 federal election commission regulations in 1995 the federal election commission fec promulgated regulations defining express advocacy which are currently in effect expressly advocating means any communication thata uses phrases such as vote for the president reelect your congressman support the democratic nominee cast you ballot for the republican challenger for us senate in georgia smith for congress bill mckay in 94 vote prolife or vote prochoice accompanied by listing of clearly identified candidates described as prolife or pro choice vote against old hickory defeat accompanied by picture of one or more candidates reject the incumbent or communications of campaign slogans or individual words which in context can have other reasonable meaning than to urge the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidates such as posters bumper stickers advertisements etc which say nixons the one carter 76 reaganbush or mondale or b when taken as whole and with limited reference to external events such as the proximity to the election could only be interpreted by reasonable person as containing advocacy of the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidates because 1 the electoral portion of the communication is unmistakable unambiguous and suggestive of only one meaning and 2 reasonable minds could not differ as to whether it encourages actions to elect or defeat one or more clearly identified candidates or encourages some other kind of action8 prevailing view of federal circuit courts with the exception of the ninth circuit the prevailing view of the us appellate courts is that supreme court precedent mandates that communication contain express words advocating the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate in order to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98282crs4 9 807 f2d 857 9th cir 1987 cert denied 484 us

13 110 f3d 1049 1064 4th cir 1997constitutionally regulated in federal election commission v furgatch the ninth circuit in 1987 found that in order to constitute express advocacy speech need not include any of the specific words set forth in buckley v valeo 9 instead the court of appeals presented three part test for determining whether communication is issue advocacy first even if it is not presented in the clearest most explicit language speech is express advocacy for the present purposes if its message is unmistakable and unambiguous suggestive of only one plausible meaning second speech may only be termed advocacy if it presents clear plea for action and thus speech that is merely informative is not covered by the act finally it must be clear what action is advocated speech cannot be express advocacy of the election or defeat of candidate when reasonable minds could differ as to whether it encourages vote for or against candidate or encourages the reader to take some other kind of action 10 notably the third prong of the test exempts speech from constituting express advocacy when reasonable minds could disagree as to whether it encourages vote for or against candidate or encourages some other kind of action in contrast in maine right to life committee v federal election commissi on mrlc the first circuit invalidated the reasonable person standard which the federal election commission has promulgated into regulations consistent with the furgatch decision11 in mrlc the court found that the supreme court in buckley had drawn bright line that errs toward permitting things that affect the election process but at all costs avoids restricting in any way discussion of public issues according to the first circuit the advantage of this rigid approach as presented in buckley is that it notifies speaker or writer at the outset of what communication is regulated and what is not12 consisten t with mrlc in the 1997 case of federal election commission v christian action network the fourth circuit also found that the supreme court has unambiguously held that the first amendment forbids the regulation of our political speech underindeterminate standards further the court noted that the supreme court has held that express words advocating the election or defeat of candidate are the constitutional minima13 in june 2000 in vermont right to life v sorrell the second circuit similarly interpreted buckley to stand for the proposition that in order to regulate communication it must expressly advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate according to the second circuit the supreme court limitation reflects concern that because disclosure requirements can significantly infringe on privacy of association and belief as guaranteed by the first amendment they must be specifically directed to the governments legitimate purpose in seeking to insure the reality and the appearance of the purity and openness of the election process the supreme court adopted thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98282crs5 14 221 f3d 376 386 2d cir 2000 quoting buckley v valeo 424 us at 7679 15 238 f3d 1288 11th cir 2001 see also iowa right

expenditure political committee and political message were unconstitutional because the standard for triggering the application of the statute was advocacy with respect to public issues which violates the rule enumerated in buckley and its progeny 16 idstandard of express advocacy the second circuit opined to insure that the regulations were neither too vague nor intrusive on first amendment protected issue advocacy14 most recently on january 17 2001 in florida right to life v lamar15 the eleventh circuit upheld lower court ruling striking down florida statute because it unconstitutionally regulated issue advocacy through an overbroad definition of political committee the florida statute required disclosure of any group whose primary or incidental purpose is to support or oppose candidates issues or parties the court found error in the lower court enjoining the enforcement of the statute because it was unconstitutionally overbroad under the first amendment16 legislative overview in the 107th congress s 27 the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2001 mccainfeingold passed the senate on april 2 2001 with regard to issue and express advocacy it incorporates the snowejeffords amendment language and would create new term in federal election law electioneerin g communication specifically it would regulate political ads that refer to clearly identified federal candidate are broadcast within 30 days of primary or 60 days of general election and are made to an audience that includes voters in that election generally it would require disclosure of disbursements over 10000 for such communications including identification of each donor of 1000 or more and such communications would be prohibited from being financed with union or certain corporate funds with respect to corporate funds it exempts internal revenue code 501c4 or 527 taxexempt corporations from making electioneering communica tions with funds solely donated by individuals who are us citizens or permanent resident aliens unless the communication is targeted ie it was distributed from broadcaster or cable or satellite service whose audience consists primarily of residents of the state in which the candidate is running for office s 27 expressly exempts from the definition news events expenditures and independent expenditures if this definition of electioneering communication is ruled unconstitutional s 27 provides an alternative definition based on fec v furgatch 807 f2d 857 9th cir 1987 communication promoting supporting attacking or opposing candidate regardless of whether it expressly advocates vote for or against candidate and is suggestive of plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against candidate with regard to issue and express advocacy hr 2356 the bipartisan campaign finance reform act of 2001 shaysmeehan which passed the house on february 14 2002 is similar to s 27 it would create new term in federal election lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98282crs6 electioneering communi cation which would regulate political ads that refer to clearly identified federal candidate are broadcast within 30 days of primary or 60 days of general election and differing from s 27 for house and senate elections is targeted to the relevant electorate generally it would require disclosure of disbursement s over 10000 for such communications including identification of each donor of 1000 or more and such communicat ions would be prohibited from being financed with union or certain corporate funds with respect to corporate funds it exempts internal revenue code 501c4 or 527 taxexempt corporations from making electioneering communications with funds solely donated by individuals who are us citizens or permanent resident aliens unless the communication is targeted ie differing from s 27 it was distributed from broadcaster or cable or satellite service and is received by 50000 or more persons in the state or district where the senate or house election respectively is occurring hr 2356 expressly exempts from the definition news events expenditures and independent expenditures and differing from s 27 candidate debates and certain other communications expressly exempted by fec regulation if this definition of electioneering communication is ruled unconstitutional hr 2356 provides an alternative definition based on fec v furgatch 807 f2d 857 9th cir 1987 communication promoting supporting attacking or opposing candidate regardless of whether it expressly advocates vote for or against candidate and is suggestive of plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against candidate conclusion the supreme court in buckley and massach usetts citizens for life has distinguished between express advocacy and issue advocacy communications with the exception of the ninth circuit the prevailing view of the federal circuit courts is that supreme court precedent mandates that communication contain express words advocating the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate in order to be constitutionally regulated if communication fails to meet this bright line express advocacy standard most lower courts have considered it issue advocacy notwithstanding whether the communication is likely to be interpreted to favor or disfavor certain candidates while also informing the public about an issue
