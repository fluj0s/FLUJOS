issue despite passage of the energy policy act of 2005 epact pl 10958 shortly after epacts enactment hurricanes katrina and rita temporarily shut down production of oil and gas and refining capacity in texas and louisiana world and domestic demand for oil remained strong and other factors have placed pressure on gasoline prices and deliverability in the united states in the face of these developments and because the prospect that this episode of elevated prices is likely to be long one interest in energy policy remains high in the 110th congress when the united states experiences period marked by sharp increases in the price for energy and concern about the adequacy of essential supplies there is widespread concern that the nation has energy policy the nation has in fact adopted several distinct policy approaches over the years and many of the debates have been about determining the appropriate extent of the federal governments role in energy there were episodes from 19732003 when oil prices spiked but these were generally for comparatively brief periods overall the period was one of general price and supply stability it isnt so much that energy policy failed to be adequately responsive to past crises rather during lengthy periods of stability and declining prices for conventional fuels it has proven difficult to sustain certain policy courses that might help shield the nation from occasional episodes of instability because prices are now expected by some analysts to remain high the prospect for certain longerrange energy policies may now be more favorable traditionally the energy debate has been most vigorous over the balance to be struck between increasing supply and encouraging conservation however when markets are unstable debate turns on another axis as well that of shortterm versus longterm policies energy policy issues of continuing interest include corporate average fuel economy standards cafe for passenger vehicles improving us energy infrastructure including pipelines and refineries seeking effective means to promote energy conservation using currently available technologies and developing new technologies and alternative fuels

session of the 110th congress energy policy enters its eighth year as major legislative issue the previous congress passed massive energy bill the energy policy act of 2005 epact pl 10958 but subsequent developments worked to keep crude oil and gasoline prices high and interest in legislative solutions active epact was enacted on august 8 2005 successive hurricanes katrina and rita in late august and late september 2005 brought about the shutdown of more than 5 million barrels per day of refining capacity in texas and louisiana and initially shut down the 25 of us crude oil production and 20 of us natural gas production that comes from the outer continental shelf in the gulf of mexico world and domestic demand for oil has remained strong taking up most of the worlds spare production capacity the phaseout of the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and renewable fuels mandate in epact have placed additional pressure on gasoline price and deliverability in the united states in the summer of 2006 gasoline prices returned to the postkatrina peaks of more than 300 per gallon and stayed there throughout the peak driving season nevertheless us gasoline demand reached record high averaging over 95 million barrels per day in july during early 2007 gasoline prices were in the low to mid2 range the passage of epact had its roots in an unexpected jump in oil prices that began in the late spring of 1999 following production cut by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec in early 2003 oil prices were reaching into the mid30s prices rose even higher during 2004exceeding 50 per barrel for brief periodowing to growing world demand both in the united states and the far east inadequate refining capacity and hurricane ivan which reduced us production from the gulf of mexico for several months crude oil and petroleum product prices escalated further during 2005 these increases were initially attributable to growing international demand for oil that domestically put strain on us and world refining capacity then in august and september hurricanes katrina and rita caused further supply disruption this continuing period of volatility in fuel supplies and prices has been the fourth significant episode since 1973 to jog american awareness of the extent to which the us economy and lifestyle depend on inexpensive and plentiful energy however this surge in price represents departure from historic trends because the rise in the price for oil fuels and energy products has occurred for more than five years and has been sustained some analysts have coined the term demand destruction to describe priceinduced reductions in consumption but overall demand for oil has proven resilient world demand for oil has grown from roughly 78 million barrels daily in 2001 to roughly 84 million barrels daily during 2005 1 an additional departure from past patterns is that historically increases in crude oil prices owing to supply or international issues have driven product prices as the higher cost for crude feedstock is passed on however crude supply and stocks in 2005prior to the hurricaneswere adequate commitments by opec during the course of the year to maintain or boost production appeared to have little but shortterm effects on crude prices tightness in refined products prior to the hurricanes and the accompanying rise of product prices was function of insufficient refining 1 us department of energy energy information administration international petroleum annual at httpwwweiadoegovemeuipsrdemandhtml the latest

gasoline formulations the pressures on product prices appeared to work backwards to support higher prices for crude the hurricanes exacerbated these dynamics further tightening product supply owing to problems with pipeline distribution as well as refining capacity and introducing at the same time an uncertainty about crude supply that had not been as strong worry prior to the storms in 2006 and 2007 number of factorsnew and oldhave contributed to an especially brittle climate for energy supply and price whenever the united states has experienced period marked by sharp increases in the price for energy and concern about the adequacy of essential supplies there is widespread concern that the nation has energy policy however not only does the nation have an energy policy it has adopted several distinct policy approaches over the years this report discusses those major policy approaches provides conceptual framework for categorizing energy policy proposals and briefly describes energy issues that remain current in the debate after the enactment of epact mo st policymakers acknowledged that epact would provide negligible price relief in the short term but they contended that it would encourage domestic production of oil and gas and further conservation and alternative fuel initiatives at issue for congress is whether there should be an additional policy response in the face of continued pressure on oil price and supply

arab oil embargo the united states has pursued number of different energy policy courses in the course of several episodes during this period when oil price and supply became unstable the us moved from set of policies more reliant on the federal government to policies more dependent upon markets this history is briefly summarized in the section to follow

government to solve the problem for both the short and longterm by 1975 refiner acquisition costs for imported crude oil had roughly tripled rising from an average cost of 4barrel bbl in 1973 to 1250barrel in 1974 however refiner acquisition costs for domestic crude did not even doublerising from 4bbl to 7bblowing to system of federal price controls that kept the price of domestic production below the market price this discouraged domestic production and encouraged imports however controls may have helped insulate consumers from some of the price increase which was the intended effect automobile fuel economy standards were enacted during the late 1970s to reduce gasoline consumption in the transportation sector at the same time hopes were invested in government funded research and development of conservation technologies and alternative fuels second supply interruption was triggered in1979 by the fall of the shah of iran and greatly reduced flow of iranian oil to world markets

letting the market set prices supporters of deregulation had argued in the 1975 debate would encourage the development of additional domestic supplies of oil as well as the development of alternative energy sources shortly after assuming office in 1981 president reagan accelerated the epca schedule for price decontrol energy policy in general became more marketoriented and the government role was lessened sustained high crude oil prices contributed to reduction in us petroleum consumption from 188 to 152 million barrels per day mbd from 1978 to 1982 there was more substitution of other fuels for oil more efficient consumption of oil and priceinduced conservation higher prices resulted in new oil production from nonopec nations allowing the united states and other consuming nations to diversify their sources of supply faced with loss of market share and revenue opec increased its own production in the mid1980s thereby lowering the price for crude oil in the course of the year from 1985 to 1986 world oil prices plunged in the united states refiner acquisition cost for imported oil fell from 27barrel to 14barrel prices remained depressed until fresh round of spikes in oil prices occurred in 199091 following iraqs invasion of kuwait in early august 1990 that resulted in cutoff of 43 million barrels per day mbd from world markets the price of oil which had averaged 16bbl at the end of july 1990 exceeded 28 by late august and reached 36bbl in september 1990 responding to the iraqi threat western and middle eastern nations found common ground that would have been unimaginable decade earlier by the late 1980s recognition had grown of the interdependence of oilproducing and oilcons uming nations the opec nations had come to recognize that longterm demand for their oil was je opardized by any prolonged period of high oil prices most did not wish to repeat the cycle of the early to mid1980s and boosted their production to make up for some of the lost supply consuming nations also coordinated the release of strategic stocks of crude and products prices began to fall in midoctober 1990 when the united nations approved the use of force against iraq prices fell more sharply after the united states and consortium of nations began conducting air strikes on iraq in midjanuary 1991

during all of these episodes importance was placed on conservation more efficient use of energy and development of alternative energy sources the oil shocks of the mid and late1970s spurred considerable spending on alternative energyincluding solar geothermal wind clean coal synthetic fuels alcoholbased fuelsand technologies to improve the efficiency of energy use regulations were developed to improve the efficiency of home appliances and to incorporate more energyefficient designs in buildings in the early 1980s states and utilities promoted energy efficiency as one form of demandside management to reduce the need for construction of new power plants many industries reengineered their processes to save energy conservation and efficiency were championed by some as lowercost and more environmentally appealing way to achieve greater energy security than policies to boost supply however largely because of

earlier each episode of short supply and higher prices spurs concern that the nation lacks an energy policy and has ignored past lessons however it is apparent from review of the years since the time of the arab oil embargo and first oil price shock in 1973 until 2004 that it is more accurate to see this 30year period as one of general price and supply stability that was periodically broken by short episodes of supply disruption and price volatility it wasnt so much that energy policy failed to be responsive to ear lier crises rather during lengthy periods of stability and declining prices for conventional fuels it proved difficult to sustain certain policy courses that might help shield the nation from future episodes of instability an energy policy that would most effectively shield the nation and the economy from the worst effects of supply shortages would be policy that might well deny the nation the full benefits of cheap and plentiful energy when markets are stable the periods of relative calm and stability result in markedly uncertain environment for inve stment in alternative fuels energy efficiency technologies and boosting the production of conventional fuels in regions where production costs are significantly higher than in the middle east state and local regulations and codes further cloud the climate for investment local opposition to new on and offshore production projects power plants electric transmission lines refineries and pipelines is often most effective during periods of price and supply stability but sometimes eases only after shortages have actually occurred however prolonged climate for higher pricesstemming from tightness in the supply of products and continuing instability in middle east regions where oil reserves are concentratedmay introduce new changes in the character and particulars of us energy policy this possibility is benchmark to keep in mind when thinking about energy policy conceptually and as subsequent debate on energy policy continues in congress g3g151g561g7g151g142g155g144g162g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g21g140g145g142g150g138g157g146g140g561 constructing balanced energy policy that will not undermine other competing and equally legitimate policy goals is complex problem how to boost energy supply without exacting an unacceptable toll on the environment how then to reduce gasoline consumption commodity central to the nations economy and lifestyle wh raising its price to achieve meaningful reduction in demand could be economically disruptive and politically unappealing should federal policy encourage the use of more expensive alternative fuels and technologies that heighten efficiency when opec has generally demonstrated capability to adjust the price of oil to keep it far cheaper than its substitutes debate over energy policy has produced an enormous range of proposals many of which have been adopted at one point or another over the years in general it is helpful to recognize the broad categories into which most proposals fall most energy policies are designed to affect either the supply of or the demand for energy products and they are at the same time designed to have an effect either in the near term or the longer term httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31720g7g151g142g155g144g162g561g18g152g149g146g140g162 g497g561g5g152g151g140g142g153g157g158g138g149g561 g8g155g138

balance to be struck between increasing supply and encouraging conservation however energy policy turns on the additional axis of short and longterm policies in the midst of high prices during the spring of 2001 policymakers were pressed to come up with i mmediate policy responses that would afford consumers price relief however at that time president bush was advising congress and americans that the administrations energy polic plan would focus on longterm remedies for the nations energy problems and that there would be immediate relief for consumers paying higher prices for gasoline electricity and other fuels the president and his supporters suggested that by setting out an actionoriented and actionable comprehensive policy markets and consumers should feel some shortterm reassurance this did not quell all the demands for more immediate action to reduce energy prices nor were they completely quelled during the protracted debate over omnibus energy legislation from 2003 until the enactment of epact in the summer of 2005 it is useful to clarify the differences between shortterm and longterm policy initiatives for example drawdown of oil from the strategic pe troleum reserve spr affects crude oil supply in the near term however enactment of tax incentives for investment in new oil drilling technologies might add to domestic crude supply further in the future

policies to affect supply such as potential use of strategic reserves have been sometimes very controversial because in the absence of very clearcut and widely acknowledged physical shortage such initiatives ar perceived to be thinly disguised efforts to grant price relief2 some suggest at times that high pricesleft uninterfered withare the best policy of all encouraging markets to provide more supply in due course and that federal policy should address only those most adversely affect ed by sharply higher prices the low income home energy assistance program liheap is one such effort to

extensive federal role is appropriate in energy policy however often that question recurs the context in which it is raised changes the current context has become distinctly different than in previous episodes us energy policy was primarily marketbased for roughly 20 years but policy makers have been weighing whether problems in some sectors and with some fuels are attributable to distribution or regulatory inefficiencies interfering with markets or whether government intervention may be necessary to protect consumers and the economy from problems to which markets cannot flexibly respond some critics of us energy policy argue that these inefficiencies and distortions are themselves the consequence of government interventionfor example clean air act requirements that have required the manufacture of several different regional formulations of gasoline strong economic growth during the mid and late 1990s at time of declining real energy prices resulted in growth in consumption even though efficiency of energy use is dramatically better than during the 1970s and 1980s growth in petroleum consumption in the united states as domestic production declines has meant commensurate increase in oil imports during the second half of 2004 growth in demand as well from the far east pressured spare oil production 2 the energy policy and conservation act pl 94163 epca authorizes drawdown of the strategic petroleum reserve upon finding by the president that there is severe energy supply interruption or in the event of circumstance that constitutes or is likely to become

unlike in the pastappeared unable to exert its historical effect of moderating crude oil prices there is recognition of the interdependence of producing and consuming nations however the political balance among the opec nations is delicate and can influence oil production decisions and whether opec is able to exert market control at all there is growing recognition that the recent shortages and price spikes in some regions of the country have been compounded by insufficiencies in the nations energy infrastructurerefining capacity gas and oil pipelines transmission lines and electric generating facilities some have questioned the advisability of locating so much of the nations refining capacity in the louisiana alabama and texas problems with gasoline supply and home heating oil stocks since 2000 imply some need to develop additional refining capacity and transport systems that will add both capacity and flexibility to distribution however national and local environmental regulation and requirements and local community sentiment affect the speed and ease of siting and building such facilities because high prices tend to eventually depress demand the industry is sometimes wary of making investment in capacity that would achieve profit targets only during shortlived periods of unusually high prices uncertainty about the course of the economy may also contribute to questions about the profitability of these investments concerns about greenhouse gas emissions add an additional measure of uncertainty policymakers have debated additional measures for refinery revitalization and streamlining the process for approval of refinery siting and construction

march 1999 when cuts by opec in world crude production sent domestic refiner acquisition costs for crude oil on sharp ascent from less than 11bbl in february 1999 to 2450bbl by december of the same year responding in part to intense lobbying by the united states the opec oil ministers boosted crude production and settled upon 2228 per barrel as desirable price band but the price band grew increasingly outoftouch and irrelevant as prices renewed their increase and surged during 2004 prices for crude breached 70bbl in may 2006 and remained in the 5060 range in early 2007

for price increases demand for petroleum products in the united states averaged 207 mbd during 2004 and 208 mbd in 2005 but averaged 206 mbd during 2006 increases in demand as well as declining domestic production have led to increased crude and product imports which averaged 136 mbd in 2006 101 mbd of crude and 35 mbd of refined product3 contributing to the gasoline price spike of mid2006 were rising prices for crude some resumption in demand and tilt toward the manufacture of distillates that was slowing additions to gasoline stocks in addition five fuel specification changes during 2005 put additional pressure on the gasoline supply system4 an ultralow sulfur diesel program that began in june 2006 required that 80 of onhighway diesel have more than 15 ppm parts per million sulfur content the elimination of mtbe methyl tertiary butyl ether placed pressure on ethanol supply and prices and incurred some loss to product yield in the manufacture of rfg reformulated gasoline the ability of the opec cartel to exert influence upon oil prices at critical times underscores thatwith respect to petroleumthe problem is less that the world supply of oil is tight than that so much of it is concentrated in other parts of the globe principally the middle east us dependence upon imported oil is now about 60 of total consumption absent some elusive technical fix there are limited prospects for si gnificantly reducing that figure without incurring economic hardship and lifestyle compromises however relatively modest increases in worldwide production or reductions in demand by consuming nations can substantially reduce the magnitude of oil price spikes

attention has focused on the clean air act standards that regulate the oxygen content volatility benzene and the sulfur content of gasoline refineries face state and local standards on how to achieve compliance with federal requirements the expiration in early may 2006 of the oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline and the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe spurred demand for ethanol leading to higher prices and tighter supply for ethanol one consequence of regional variations is that gasoline supply loses some of its fungibility one region experiencing shortage may longer be able to secure additional supply from nearby locality with different blend of gasoline distribution becomes more complicated because different blends sharing the same pipeline must be carefully batched to avoid contamination in the wake of the 2005 hurricanes and again in the spring of 2006 some standards were temporarily relaxed in an effort to improve gasoline production and ease distribution problems additionally foreign refineries that supply the us gasoline market do not make the regional formulations some have urged rationalization of clean air act standards that would permit harmonization of us gasoline standards this would introduce flexibility into the gasoline manufacture and distribution system that migh t bring prices down opponents of harmonization 3 us department

national wildlife refuge anwr for exploration are mostly longterm alaskan oil production which once touched 2 mbd has now fallen below 900000 mbd and without new production will continue to decline5 low production could result in rising transport tariffs on the transalaska pipeline with further adverse impacts on north slope production proponents of exploring anwr point to advances in exploration and drilling technology and methods that have significantly reduced the extent of surface disturbance while opponents concede this may be so they argue that these advances are limited to exploration and extraction and that considerable risk to the environment remains during the production and transportation phases opponents also suggest that the risks are not worth bearing especially if the resources in anwr turn out to be at the lower range of estimates providing only an additional 300000 bd of supply some respond to this argument by noting that the nation has experienced periods of tight supply when even an additional few hundred thousand barrels of crude oil per day would have significantly reduced gasoline and heating oil prices for some opponents any weighing of risks and benefits are pointless because citing the areas pristine character they argue that its ecology and habitat should not be disturbed under any circumstances there was some expectation that proponents of

combinedcycle power plants that could provide incremental electric supply to the nations power grid at highly competitive prices and with few environmental constraints plentiful supplies and relatively low prices for several years discouraged additions to natural gas reserves during the 1990s7 with surges in demand for electricity and colder winter in 20002001 residential and other consumers of natural gas suddenly faced sharply higher prices as competition grew for gas supplies at the wellhead gas prices rose from 216 per thousand cubic feet mcf in 1999 to 400 per mcf in 2001

perceptions of the balance between supplyoriented and conservationoriented policies that make up an appropriate energy policy to address the current matrix of energy problems for example environmental groups often ask why anwr should be opened to leasing if comparable amount of oil could be saved by raising motor vehicle fuel economy the energy policy and conservation act pl 94163 established new car corporate average fuel economy cafe standards beginning with m odel year 1978 currently the standards are 275 miles per gallon mpg for cars and 207 mpg for lightduty trucks including sport utility vehicles suvs proposals to raise the cafe standards have been controversial beginning with enactment of the fy1996 department of transporta tion appropriations act congress forbade the expenditure of appropriated funds to make an change in the current cafe requirements however study by the national academy of sciences nas requested by the 106 th congress to recommend appropriate cafe standards was released at the end of july 20019 while the report did not recommend specific level for cafe it did conclude that significant reductions in fuel consumption could be achieved within 15 years utilizing existing technologies were increases in new car fuel economy achieved by reducing vehicle weight or disproportionately encouraging the sale of small vehicles the study allowed that additional fatalities could result however some members of the nas panel dissented suggesting that the analysis of the relationship between fuel economy and vehicle safety is extremely complex there is little question that the price hikes during past episodes of tight energy supply spurred many improvements in energy efficiency some argue however that the easiest and lowestcost efficiency gains have been
