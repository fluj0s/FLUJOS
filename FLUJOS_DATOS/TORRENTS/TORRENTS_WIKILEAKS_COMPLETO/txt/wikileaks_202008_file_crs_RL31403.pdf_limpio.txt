januaryo ctober 2006 the us deficit reached 190 billion many associate this deficit with the concomitant loss of american jobs in industries competing with rapidly rising imports from china some policymakers as well as leaders of industry and labor blam china for unfair trad practices including deliberately undervaluing its currency wh ich they claim create an uneven playing field for us companies when competing against imports from the prc uschina trade issues are often driven by larger policy objectives us trade with china is but one aspect of the overall us policy of engagement with the prc policy that serves broader us interests trade also underpins beijings development strategy and contributes to domestic s upport for the prc government this report presents data and analysis of chinas trade that shed light on various policy issues provides an overview of recent us legislative initiatives and examines the goals and constraints of us trade policy toward the prc some of the specific questions addressed are how the us trade balance with china compares with those of the european union and ja pan whether imports from china are merely replacing imports from othe r pacific rim nations and how imports from china by industry compare with imports from other countries the rationale for us policy and initiatives allowing trade with china to develop is part of the overall us strategy of engagement with the prc the rationale behind engagement is that working with china through economic diplomatic informational and military interchanges helps the united states to achieve important national security goals such as preventing nuclear proliferation defeating global terrorism defusing regional conflicts fostering global economic growth and championing aspirations for human dignity1 these goals are aimed at achieving us national inte rests of security and prosperity for all americans and projecting us values abroad us trade policy toward china is ba sed upon the assumption that trade between the two countries has both economic and political benefits 1 in general trade with china benefits both sides and allows for more efficient allocation of available resources 2 the rapidly developing chin economy affords rare opportunity for us businesses to become part of huge and rapidly expanding market 3 chinashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31403crs2 2 see sections

significant as china accounting for quarter of the worlds popula tion armed with nuclear wea pons and member of the security council cannot be ignored or isolated according to some experts globalization and economic in terests may be exerting moderating influence on beijings policies toward protecting chinas national security interests however the chinese communist partys determination to maintain political legitimacy through economic growth also creates nsions with other countries and with emerging nonparty political actors the possible problems or challenges rais ed by the us strategy of economic engagement with china include adjusting to economic competition in sectors where china has comparative advantage res ponding to prc unfair trade practices and the rise of an economically powerful china that is becoming more assertive in global affairs 1 imports from china may be entering in such increased quantities that they are substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to competing us industries2 2 imports from china may be dumpe d subsidized or unfairly aided by government entities in china which still wield considerable influence in the economy3 3 according to some economists and many policymakers the us trade deficit with the prc stems in large part from beijings policy of maintaining an undervalued currency 4 china has poo r record of adopting or enforcing internationally recognized standards fo r working conditions and environmental regulation which in addition to violating human rights and harming the environment may provide prc businesses with unfair competitive advantages and 5 us economic engagement with china arguably contributes to the legitimacy of the socialist government and the strengthening of chinas military by facilitating general economic development us trade law and wto regulations can deal with injury from imports and unfair trade practices trade disputes with china would normally be first discussed bilaterally before taking the case to the wto for dispute resolution chinas alleged violations of international labor and environmen tal standards as well as its own laws and government regulations

fifth the us industrial sectors most at risk from import competition from china are generally labor intensive but china is moving quickly up the technology ladder the sectors in which the united

with germany in automobile production however china is not major global importer or exporter of cars and it remains heav ily reliant upon foreign technology in this sector17 sixth prc data show much

prc counts many of such reexported goods as us ex ports to china some analysts argue that the us department of commerce overstates the us trade deficit with china by as much as 21 because of the way that it calculates entrepot trade through hong kong19 according to prc data chinas trade surplus with the united states in 2005 was 114 billi on not 201 billion as reported by the united states

seventh some trade specialists suggest that the surge of us imports from china do not pose an additional threat to us industries and workers because it merely represents shif t of investment and

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31403crs21 balance of trade by sector in modern economies trade by sector generally follows two patterns the first is based on traditional comparative advant age in which one country trades with another in those products in which it has an abundance of resources or in which it is comparatively pr oductive the ited states economy is characterized by high technology extensive farmland with high agricultural yields expensive labor and deep capital as such the united states w ould be expected to be strong in exports of hightechnology goods food and grains and capital intensive products the chinese economy on the other hand is char acterized by abundant and cheap labor low capital intensity and mix of low medium and high technology both in manufacturing and agriculture as such ch ina would be expected to be strong in exports of not only laborintensive manufactures such as textiles and apparel shoes toys and light manufactures but also items produced under the tutelage of foreign companies that have invested in chinese factories these could include household appliances electronics tools or automobile parts one would expect trade that is conducted on the basis of comparative adva ntage to be unbalanced on sectorby sector basis the united states for example would run surplus with china in aircraft but ficit in apparel the second trade pattern occurs among industrialized countri and is called intraindustry or trade within industrial sectors this is typical of trade among north america the european union and industria lized nations of asia eg japan south korea and taiwan the products tr aded usually carry brand names are differentiated and may be protected by intellectual prope rty rights for example the united states both imports and exports items such as automobiles machinery electronic devices prep ared food and pharmaceuticals considerable share of us intraindustry trade is carried out within multinational corporation eg between ford motors and one of its related companies such as mazda in japan jaguar in the united kingdom or with other subsidiaries abroad large deficit in an intra industry trading sector in which the united states is competitive may indicate that the trading partner country is using import barri ers to tip the trade balance in its favor table 4 shows the us balance of trade with china by major sector most of the sectors in which the united states runs the largest trade deficits with china are as expected those that depend on mostly abundant and lowcost labor these include toys and sports equipment furniture and bedding footwear textiles and apparel and leather goods among the large defic it sectors however are machinery and mechanical appliances and electrical m achinery which reflect
