quantitative applications of highresolution lateholocene proxy data sets estimating climate sensitivity and thermohaline circulation influences rationale and overview of our proposed research this proposal is concerned with the last 1000 years compared say to late glacial times lateholocene climate variations were weaker and do not have as strong signaltonoise ratio in individual proxy records the period is vitally important however because the uncertainties in future climate predictions can be reduced through better understanding of how and why climate varied over this period improvements are required both to our records of the climate and to the history of possible causal factors because of the weaker signaltonoise ratio it is necessary to integrate many different proxy records to achieve climate reconstructions that are useful for accurately estimatingdetecting rapid climate changes in response to external forcings or internal variations such as the north atlantic oscillation nao or the atlantic meridional overturning circulation moc we propose to undertake this integration by synthesising with rigorous assessment of their true seasonal spatial and time scale responses existing and new lateholocene climate proxies and any additional records that might be developed and made available during the rapid climate change rcc programme we will apply these improved climate reconstructions to explore several key questions that relate to the feasibility of using surface proxies to define different aspects of past climate variability specifically we will quantify the extent to which the palaeodata can be used to i provide useful constraints on the range of climate sensitivities that are compatible with lateholocene climate changes ii detect the fingerprint of past changes in the moc and iii distinguish variations in the nao from externallyforced or mocrelated climate changes extensive use will be made of recent coupled oceanatmosphere general circulation model oagcm simulations described below both in providing estimates of the climate response to external forcings and to abrupt change in the atlantic moc and indeed other forms of internallygenerated climate variability and in generating synthetic proxy records thus we will be able to explore the capability of various hypothetical and actual networks of proxy data through subsampling and degradation of model output to represent various possible proxy data sets for addressing the above questions and ultimately apply actual proxy data to estimate climate sensitivity and past moc and nao variations with quantified uncertainty reliance on oagcm results to address issues of uncertainty means that conclusions will be model dependent we propose to use integrations from two of the best regarded climate models to address this issue our spatiallyresolved hemisphericglobal climate reconstructions will also be disseminated for use in addressing other rcc objectives scientific benefits and relevance to users the integration of various networks of highresolution proxy data together with the reconstruction of largescale climate variations from them will be of great benefit to wide range of climate scientists they will be relevant to those attempting to establish the evolution of past climate investigating the behaviour processes and mechanisms operating in the climate system or attempting to evaluate the performance of climate models on decadaltocentennial time scales our proposed work using climate model output to generate synthetic proxy data will give clear and quantitative guidance to potential users and to the palaeoclimate community as to the quality and quantity of proxy data that are required to answer certain policyrelevant questions our estimates of the likely range of possible climate sensitivities likely because it is the range that is compatible with past climate changes and forcings will be of direct relevance to those making forecasts of future climate change specific objectives 1 our overall objectives are to assess the capability and then use late holocene climate proxies for obtaining quantitative climate reconstructions with optimal seasonal and spatial representation b distinguishing the role of past variations in the atlantic moc and the nao as drivers of circumatlantic climate variability and c better constraining estimates of the sensitivity of climate to external forcing changes 2 in achieving these overall objectives we will also meet the following objectives extend our existing data bases with additional lateholocene climate proxies b reconstruct spatiallyresolved global climate variations over the past 1000 years with focus on the circumatlantic region and with quantified uncertainty ranges c use climate model output as synthetic proxy data subsampled and degraded by noise andor age uncertainties to quantify the ability of proxy data as function of their coverage seasonality and reliability to estimate past variations of moc strength via the detection of modelbased estimate of the fingerprint of moc variability in the presence of other externallyforced and internallygenerated climate variations d use climate model output as synthetic proxy data to quantify the ability of proxy data to estimate past variations of the nao on time scales from annual to centennial in the presence of other externallyforced and internallygenerated climate variations use climate model output as synthetic proxy data to quantify the value of proxy data for constraining estimates of the sensitivity of climate to external forcing changes as function of the proxy data characteristics and the uncertainty in external forcing changes over the past 1000 years f apply the results of 2c 2d and 2e to our actual proxy data and climate reconstructions from 2a and 2b to obtain estimates of past moc and nao variations and to estimate the range climate sensitivity to external forcings that is compatible with past climate changes overall approach the time evolution of the moc strength is unknown but can be estimated from data set recording the spatial seasonal and multivariable evolution of climate provided that the pattern including spatial seasonal and multivariable structure and magnitude of response to change in the atlantic moc is known any estimate will be uncertain due to the influence of other internallygenerated and externallyforced climate variations that may not be independent of the moc uncertainty will be further increased if the recording of the evolution of climate is imperfect and incomplete this is the case with climate proxy data and to lesser extent with instrumental climate data but nevertheless it is possible to use such data to identify the occurrence of the multivariate seasonal and spatial fingerprint of change in the moc and hence estimate the influence of past moc changes objective 1b we will use climate model estimates see below of the climate signals and climate noise and use synthetic proxy data to explore how the accuracy of estimating the past moc influence depends on the coverage seasonality and reliability of proxy records objective 2c on the basis of these results we will use actual climate data different predictor networks such as 20th century instrumental data or the reduced coveragereliability of pre20th century instrumental and proxybased reconstructions to estimate the past evolution of the moc strength and quantify the error in these estimates objective 2f estimating the climate sensitivity1 objective 1c is different problem because unlike for the moc strength estimates of the time history of external forcings are available crowley 2000 thus while we still need to rely on modelbased estimate of the pattern of climate response to external forcings principally solar volcanic and anthropogenic over the last 1000 years we can estimate the magnitude of the responses rather than assuming the modelbased magnitude and hence the climate sensitivity from the observed wigley et 1997 allen et 2000 knutti et 2002 or reconstructed crowley 2000 variation of climate this estimate will be uncertain due to errors in forcings and errors in proxy reconstructions and we will investigate using synthetic proxies derived from degraded model output how the size of the uncertainty range depends upon the coverage seasonality and reliability of proxy records objective 2e we will apply our results to existing and improved proxy data sets to obtain the range of climate sensitivities that are consistent with our imperfect knowledge of lateholocene climate changes objective 2f ultimately we may ask how good and extensive proxy records of the past 1000 years need to be to constrain the climate sensitivity more tightly than the current ipcc consensus of 15 to 45 k for the radiative forcing equivalent to doubling of co2 and which locations seasons and variables typically temperature or precipitation have the strongest influence we will also assess whether it is the accuracy of the external forcing estimates or the accuracy of the climate reconstruction that is the limiting factor in constraining the climate sensitivity for the recent period knutti et 2002 showed that it is the uncertainty in the tropospheric aerosol forcing that prevents the observed climate record from providing an upper limit on the climate sensitivity the nao has been an important driver of circumatlantic climate variability during the extended boreal winter especially over recent decades hurrell 1995 wanner et 2001 and various attempts have been made luterbacher et 2002a and references therein to reconstruct the past history of its variability because of its relevance to the detection of unusual climate change and to the atlantic moc dickson et 1996 prior to the availability of instrumental atmospheric pressure observations all nao reconstructions rely on the indirect ie via the local temperature or precipitation relationship between natural or documentary proxy and the atmospheric circulation pattern of the nao by using synthetic proxies derived from model output and then subsequent application with real proxy data networks we will evaluate the reliability of proxybased nao reconstructions that are calibrated over relatively short periods of interannual variability for reconstructing longerterm variations ie is there timescaledependence in the nao influence especially in the presence of external climate forcings we will address for example the issue of whether cooling in northern europe driven partially by external climate forcings eg during the socalled little ice age might be used to imply perhaps erroneously period of low nao index and the extent to which more widespread proxy data and combinations of moisture and temperaturesensitive proxies might alleviate this problem ie distinguish between internal and external climate drivers we also analyse the model simulations to address the related question of whether changes in atlantic sea surface temperatures driven by changes in the moc might interact with the nao or at least interact with proxies in nao sensitive locations keigwin and pickart 1999 keigwin and boyle 2000 bond et 2001 we will then use the synthetic proxy approach to assess the accuracy and coverage of proxy data that is necessary to distinguish between nao and moc variations research programme and data sources data requirements the proposed project has two distinct data requirements climate model oagcm simulations and climate proxy data the project will focus on climate variability over the last 1000 years this is limit dictated by the model simulations that we will use though we will not exclude the relatively few proxy records that extend back before ad 1000 some of the simulations will be used to provide synthetic proxy data for addressing the questions outlined in the project objectives the strong rationale for this approach is that they come from system that is fully known ie the models climate state including atlantic moc nao etc can all be precisely diagnosed and thus their use in estimating some aspect of the climate state can be unambiguously tested in order for the results to be relevant to the behaviour of real climate proxies we will use simulations that have been subjected to forcings similar in character to those that have driven the real climate system over the past 1000 years the synthetic proxy data will be derived by subsampling the model output to much reduced spatial seasonal and multi variable coverage followed by degradation to represent imperfect proxies of climate various noise models white red spatially correlated or uncorrelated will be tested to reproduce the influence of nonclimatic influences guided by an analysis of the reliability of real proxy records to represent some proxy types we will also average or subsample in the time domain ie reproducing lowerthanannual temporal resolution or stretchcompress the time series to reproduce dating uncertainties again guided by the known characteristics of real proxy records eg jones et 1998 model data this project will focus principally on the output from two stateoftheart oagcms hadcm3 developed and run at the hadley centre for climate prediction and research uk and echam4hope developed by the max planck institute for meteorology and simulations run by the gkss both in hamburg germany the use of two quite different climate models is particularly important because it will allow some assessment of uncertainty in the simulated signals if appropriate simulations from additional climate models are completed during our project then we will endeavour to obtain collaborative access to their output and thus extend this inter model comparison millennial length control simulations providing internallygenerated climate variability are already complete from both hadcm3 and echam4hope simulations under various external forcings are also available to define each models response to external forcings the signal of climate response to change in moc will be derived from the hadcm3 simulations of vellinga and wood 2002 this signal from one simulation from one model is clearly uncertain it is likely however that ensembles of simulations from multiple models will become available during this 4year project and we will make use of these to test how the uncertainty in this signal affects the ability of surface proxies to register the effect of changes in atlantic moc simulations of the response to natural and anthropogenic forcings over 15002000 hadcm3 and 10002000 echam4hope are either underway or already complete forcings used include orbital solar irradiance volcanic aerosol greenhouse gases tropospheric aerosols tropospheric and stratospheric ozone and land use change these simulations will provide synthetic proxy data and also possible realisation of the climate state over the last 500 or 1000 years which can be attempted to be reconstructed using the synthetic proxy data modelling centre collaborations the hadcm3 oagcm simulations will be provided by simon tett and by agreed collaboration with michael vellinga and richard wood all at hadley centre those from echam4hope will be provided by hans von storch gkss and ulrich cubasch mpi through an ec funded project soap that begins in november 2002 the proposed project will benefit from the soap project but addresses objectives that are clearly different from those of soap which has focus on validating climate models we will also use the estimated histories of external forcings with quantified uncertainty updated from crowley 2000 that have been used to drive the 15002000 and 10002000 simulations of hadcm3 and echam4hope analysis of proxy data the second phase of the project involves applying the results obtained using synthetic proxy data to real proxy data to provide answers to the questions raised in our objectives we propose to devote considerable amount of effort to working with proxy data and extending and improving our existing proxybased climate reconstructions eg briffa et 2001 work is required for two purposes first the creation of synthetic proxy records from model output requires an estimate of the reliability of proxies at recording local climate this is related to the uncertainty range about any climate reconstruction based on that proxy record including information on their seasonal and mutlivariable sensitivity as well as consideration of how this reliability depends upon time scale from interannual to inter centennial second our existing treeringdensity based reconstructions of growing season temperatures over the northern hemisphere extratropics must be extended and improved to provide useful quantitative answers to the questions raised in our objectives thus we must make use of multiple proxy types details below and also the early instrumental records from the circumatlantic region to provide the longest data for calibration and erroruncertainty quantification highresolution instrumental and proxy climate data sources instrumental data to be used for calibration and testing of seasonal reconstructions include gridded data sets of monthly temperature and precipitation currently extending from 1851 and 1900 respectively jones and moberg 2002 new et 2000 longer data are available for europe extensive monthly series back to the 1750s and daily temperature series for eight locations camuffo and jones 2002 these and other early instrumental temperature records from the circumnorth atlantic will be supplemented by newly obtained early west greenland data starting in 1784 and icelandic starting in 1780 data to be digitised as part of this proposed project many of the surface climate proxy records are already archived in our data base briffa 2000 briffa et 2001 jones et 1998 2001 and the bulk of additional highresolution records will be compiled during concurrent ecfunded project soap these include many new treering records and calibrated climate reconstructions based on them they originate from extensive updated data in the eastern provided by ed cook and southern provided by david stahle united states many new or updated treering records will also become available from scandinavia the alps northwest africa and canada during the early stages of the proposed project one important focus for detailed comparison integration and climate calibration of numerous some very recent palaeoclimate proxies will be greenland besides the grip and gisp records sigfus johnsen has provided the new north grip isotope records and ellen mosleythompson will collaborate in the analysis of numerous multicentury accumulation records with good spatial distribution over greenland arising out of the parca project mosleythompson et 2001 other annualresolution ice core tropical coral and excellent documentary recordsreconstructions will also be used eg the recent 1000year record for the benelux countries assembled by van engelen et 2001 and gridded european reconstructions from luterbacher et 2002b lowerresolution climate proxies in the proposed project we will also carefully consider the utility of selected lowerthanannual resolution palaeoclimate records from land including lake sources these will include an analysis of extensive borehole records huang et 2000 made available by henry pollack diatom or chironomidderived reconstructions with advice from andre lotter ian snowball and atte korhola speleothem data with data and advice from tim atkinson andy baker and frank mcdermot and possibly veryhighresolution pollen records with advice from john birks we are also anxious to incorporate within our analysis framework new high and lowerresolution records that might be constructed and made available within the rcc thematic programme if they proceed then we consider that the projects proposed by battarbee lakebased proxies barber peatbased proxies finch speleothembased proxies and mccarroll treering isotopes represent excellent potential for collaboration in the later stages of the project these data will require examination for specific quantitative application within the project in terms of dating control and defined uncertainty ranges but will be utilised if there is clear advantage in doing so though note that the annualresolution data will be the main focus of the project synthetic data from the climate model simulations will be used to evaluate the impact of systematic or random dating biases on our ability to integrate and calibrate imperfectly dated records we will also examine the calibration of the lowerresolution data emphasising the use of long instrumental records or calibration of lowerresolution proxies against calibrated high resolution proxies uncertainties may be compounded but nevertheless must be quantified perhaps using total least squares approach allen and stott 2002 work plan to clarify how the project will be structured the main tasks to be undertaken are listed below note that some of the tasks must continue in parallel the numbering is for convenience rather than to imply simple sequential time table 1 obtain oagcm outputs and the forcing histories that were applied to each simulation 2 analysis of model outputs including intermodel comparison to identify responses to applied forcings signaltonoise ratio relative to the control run and to diagnose simulated moc nao etc 3 subsample degrade and time average the model output in many different ways determined in part by task 5 to produce many synthetic proxy networks of varying skill and geographicseasonal coverage 4 derive multiple or principal component regression relationships between simulated moc and series in synthetic proxy network and apply them to obtain reconstruction compare this with the simulated moc and repeat for many different networks including the same network but with different noise realisations for the degradation to assess the skill of proxies at estimating moc variations as function of the proxy network appraise this skill in comparison with control run estimates of noise and thus assess the utility of the surface proxies 5 repeat 4 but for the nao use actual proxy networks from published nao reconstructions to facilitate their intercomparison and where differences exist between reconstructions to assist in explaining the reasons for the differences 6 reconstruct global and northern hemisphere temperature spatial mean and spatial patterns from the synthetic proxy data see task 9 for more on methods then follow the approach of crowley 2000 by using energybalance models with various forcings within the estimated uncertainty range and various climate sensitivities to find the range of sensitivities that reproduce the spatialmean within the control run internallygenerated variability noise range repeat using the allen et 2000 approach with spatial patterns of signal response from the models but scaling them to find the range of scaling factors that are consistent with model internallygenerated climate noise this approach is based on optimal signal detection allen and stott 2002 allen et 2002 procedures where optimal refers to the use of natural variability estimates to focus on regionsseasons whose signaltonoise ratio is highest it will also be possible to incorporate estimates of the erroruncertainty associated with the proxybased reconstructions when following this approach the detection procedure will yield ranges of consistent scaling factors for each forcing or the forcings could be combined under the assumption of equal average scaling factors to yield single range from which the implied climate sensitivity range can be computed we will apply these techniques to hierarchy of cases from an assumed perfect knowledge of forcings and climate thus limited only by internally generated climate noise through perfect knowledge of climate but with uncertain forcings to various imperfect uncertain knowledges of climate and forcings to assess the dependence on proxy networks 7 collate archives of existing proxy data see earlier for further information this will be facilitated by concurrent ecfunded project soap which will assemble many annual resolution proxies additional lowerresolution proxies will be collated 8 compare individual proxies with instrumental climate data to assess local climate response of each annual resolution record thus we will improve upon the black box approach of eg mann et 1998 of using all available proxies without consideration of their local climate signal rather we will reconstruct climate variables and seasons that are actually recorded in all the proxies in selected subset 9 produce spatial climate temperature reconstructions using the proxy data to obtain largescale areaaveraged andor spatiallyresolved time series with best coverage over recent centuries reducing in coverage and skill back to 1500 and further reduction back to 1000 multivariate methods such as principal component regression will be used with calibration against instrumental data and independent verification synthetic proxy records from oagcm output will be used to assess our ability to obtain independent and reliable reconstructions of warm and cold season climate land and ocean surface climate and spatiallyresolved versus spatiallyaveraged climate given the available proxy data comparisons will be made with existing regional and hemispheric reconstructions eg mann et 1998 briffa et 2001 luterbacher et 2002b 10 reconstruction of the nao and moc using calibrated temperature and moisturesensitive proxies task 8 and estimation of the climate sensitivity using spatial reconstructions of temperature task 9 use the modelbased synthetic proxy analysis tasks 4 5 and 6 to provide uncertainty ranges on each of these outputs draw conclusions from the results of this project about the utility of proxy data for this type of application and the implications for future climate change extension to ocean proxies clear synergies exist between our model and proxybased assessment of the ability of surface climate proxies for indirectly and imperfectly measuring the strength or heattransport of the atlantic moc and the modelling support from the hadley centre for assessing the performance of instrumental monitoring systems see rcc website httpwwwnercacuk fundingthematicsrccmodellingsupportmocshtml we will build upon these synergies through our agreed collaboration with michael vellinga and richard wood hadley centre by limited and preliminary extension of our analysis to consider the utility of selected oceanic proxies in addition to terrestrial proxies though we acknowledge the additional difficulties involved in assessing model and proxy reliability when there is little instrumental data available for comparison this could include some quasi ocean proxies such as palaeo sea level records which can be compared with simulated ocean water density van der schrier et 2002 and linked with external forcings and moc variations very recent reconstructions of water temperature for locations along the western european seaboard and iceland based on highresolution ocean sediment cores are or will be available soon from eystein jansen and hans peter sejrup and via the ec funded project holsmeer coordinated by james scourse justification of resources almost all of the resources requested are for the employment of postdoctoral research scientists to undertake the various proposed tasks during the first 60 of the project period while dr osborn is coordinating with prof briffa an ecfunded project soap simulations observations and palaeodata more junior eg recently completed phd scientist will be employed to work on the compilation local calibration and integration of various climate proxy data sets and to test approaches for the creation of synthetic proxy data and begin their application to estimating past climate variations and climate sensitivity during the final 40 of the project period the greater and broaderranging expertise of dr osborn will be employed to undertake the more demanding tasks such as the full application of the methodology with synthetic and real proxy data to answer the latter questions raised in the project objectives the reconstruction of largescale climate and the interpretation of the results in the context of current and future climate change issues about 3 weeks per year of computer support technician is included to assist with certain data processing and data handling tasks including regular backing up of disk storage modest travel costs are requested to cover travel to the hadley centre and for visits to other colleagues for collaborative work and exchange of data and expertise in addition partial costs towards the attendance at the agu fall meeting in the usa in 2005 are requested items included under consumables are for costs related to publication of project output in high impact factor journals page reprint and colour charges and also for the purchase of dedicated and backed up computer storage to cope with the large model data sets that will be analysed management and training the overall project management will be undertaken by prof briffa who has proven trackrecord for internationalquality research in this and related areas and has successfully coordinated ec and nercfunded projects the coinvestigators will provide the necessary direction in their fields of expertise dr tett in the application of optimal signal detection algorithms and prof jones in the characteristics availability and use of early instrumental and climate proxy data postdoctoral training will be given to two scientists focussing on the interdisciplinary skills that are necessary for research at the interface between proxy data and numerical climate models this project will therefore help to address the serious lack of scientists with the required breadth of knowledge and skill to pursue this scientific grand challenge highlighted in the rapid climate change science plan recently completed phd scientist will receive initial training in the characteristics of model and proxy data and methodologies for coping with these and allowing joint analysis dr osborns training will be continued in this area following on from earlier training during 19992001 nerc project extending it into areas such as optimal signal detection climate reconstruction using lowerresolution proxies as well as providing experience in project management dissemination of scientific output and data stewardship we will strive to maintain our reputation for publishing highlyrespected work in high quality and high impact factor journals at more widely accessible level we will ensure that current scientific perspectives are highlighted on our webbased set of climate information sheets httpwwwcruueaacukcruinfo these are targeted for nonexperts and currently receive about 3000 independent visitors per month highly efficient method of outreach to broad range of scientists media and members of the public new climate reconstructions based on improved proxy data sets and improved reconstruction methods will be made available to other rcc projects during the project and made publicly available at the end of the project there is currently nerc designated data centre with strong remit for climate proxy records but our climate reconstructions would be provided to the british atmospheric data centre if appropriate and would certainly be lodged with the world data centre for paleoclimatology hosted by the us national geophysicalclimatic data center and will also be disseminated via the climatic research units own website which has permanent and wellpublicised section for the distribution of data sets references allen mr stott pa mitchell
