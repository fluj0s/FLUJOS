division congressional research service the library of congress us assistance to women in afghanistan and iraq challenges and issues for congress summary this report reviews us funding for programs directed toward women in afghanistan and iraq women in these two countries have faced particularly difficult conditions under the taliban and baathist regimes although there have been notable improvements since the ouster of these regimes in 2001 and 2003 respectively women still face real challenges in the areas of education health care political participation and in many cases basic human rights the national and international response to the plight of afghan and iraqi women may have an important impact not only on the women being directly assisted but also on their countries as whole in terms of more widespread access to education health care and political and economic participation this report will be updated as events warrant contents background 1 us assistance to afghan

challenges for women in afghanistan and iraq 8 designating funds for women 9 future developments 9 us assistance to women in afghanistan and iraq challenges and issues for congress background the issue of womens rights in afghanistan and iraq has taken on new relevance following the usled military actions in afghanistan in 2001 the usled invasion of iraq in 2003 and subsequent reconstruction efforts in both countries one of the major questions facing the united states in the postwar reconstruction process is the extent to which it can help women participate often for the first time in their lives or the recent history of their countries in political educational and economic life after years of warfare genderbased repression and economic exclusion advancing the position of women and committing adequate resources to womens and girls education have both been linked on global level to the achievement of efficient and stable development particularly in postconflict regions1 congressional initiatives focused on women in these countries have covered range of political economic and social issues particular areas of emphasis include the incorporation of women in local and national governance the inclusion of womens rights in new constitution participation by women in the workforce universal access to education provision of adequate health care and supplying humanitarian assistance to needy families this report focuses primarily on foreign aid appropriated by congress to united states agency for international development usaid and the state department for humanitarian and reconstruction activities in afghanistan and iraq but also touches upon iraq programs funded through the departments of health and human services agriculture labor and defense2 afghanistan overall conditions for women in afghanistan have vastly improved since the fall of the taliban in 2001 particularly in terms of education and job opportunities many refugees have returned millions of afghan girls now attend school and it is longer illegal for women to work great deal remains to be done however in improving the basic standard of living and means of livelihood for most afghan 1 for further discussion see crs report rl32376 women in iraq background and issues for us policy by aaron d pina 2 the state department july 2002 and 2003 reports us support for afghan women children and refugees provide good summary of the overall funding from the usg the 2004 report is expected to be distributed in late june 2004 crs2 women although women may legally work for example many still face serious challenges in finding culturally appropriate jobs in most areas of afghanistan women still find it difficult or impossible to work in open areas where they may come into contact with men within easy commuting distance of home at tolerable hours with reasonable pay furthermore most afghan women and for that matter most men have had little or education and lack employable skills while women have gained substantial ground in political participation especially since passage of the recent constitution guaranteeing them minimum number of parliamentary seats they nevertheless continue to face conservative attitudes in many rural areas of the country particularly in the south and east3 among the breakthroughs in 2005 woman was appointed governor of province bamiyan4 iraq in marked contrast to the talibans repressive treatment which was rooted in longstanding rural afghan customs iraqs policies toward women have historically been more liberal even compared to other countries in the middle east iraqi women fared reasonably well under the provisional 1970 constitution which granted them equal rights with men including the rights to go to school own property work and hold political office the condition of women worsened somewhat under the regime of saddam hussein however particularly after the first gulf war when hussein turned more to islamic and tribal traditions that held women in inferior positions in addition the economic conditions brought about by international sanctions after the gulf war are said to have affected women disproportionately5 conditions appear to be improving for some women living in iraqs cities who are regaining greater civil rights and educational opportunities in the wake of the us led invasion of 2003 the political process in particular has opened up the new constitution requires 25 female representation and women are serving in the government as members of the cabinet and the iraq governing council there are women governors in the provinces however although progress is being made on the political front in other ways women are worse off under increasingly islamist policies especially in southern iraq women in rural areas continue to face growing difficulties particularly in places where religiously conservative local leaders have gained power6 gender discrimination 3 information is

austere dress requirements all bear the hallmarks of regression rather than progress in womens development and integration other problems women face are similar to those of the population as whole economic insecurity and the threat of political and sectarian violence while women are being forced to cover up in southern iraq in other parts of the country it is reported that some women wear head scarves as means of protection and anonymity the fragile situation on the ground in many parts of the country is limiting the provision of humanitarian assistance and makes meeting basic needs such as adequate food shelter and medical care daily struggle women in the kurdish areas to the north are reported to have more opportunities and face better treatment than women in the central and southern portions of the country us assistance to afghan women identified below are specific legislative earmarks to support programs for afghan women and children and general funds that identify women and children among the program beneficiaries this is not meant to be an exhaustive inventory of all usfunded projects that may address womens needs providing such list would be both debatable and difficult because many projects addressing overall societal issues such as refugee care and resettlement health education and job training do not mention women but may implicitly benefit them

uncertainty and insecurity while conditions for women in afghanistan have improved markedly since the fall of the taliban afghan women are still among the most socioeconomically disadvantaged in the world female literacy is estimated at 20 while girls school enrollment has skyrocketed in the last few years there are still onethird fewer girls than boys in primary school23 turning to health according to the world health organization who afghanistan has the worlds second worst maternal mortality rate and fifth worst neonatal mortality rate24 while iraq is good deal more industrialized than afghanistan its health indicators prior to the 2003 invasion were very poor its neonatal mortality rate was in fact worse than that of afghanistan iraq has historically had much better and more genderbalanced educational system than afghanistan but girls school attendance especially in rural areas still lags behind that of boys25 while congressional funding for democracy building civil society development and participation in the workforce will have an important affect on womens lives in each country the rehabilitation of the basic education and health care infrastructure for afghan and iraqi women is equally if not more vital 20 support to iraqi women op cit 21 education usaid nd httpwwwusaidgoviraqaccomplishmentseducationhtml 22 usaid accomplishments in iraq mar 2003 to mar

ways congress has had an impact on the situation for afghan women has been through series of legislative earmarks to date in iraq although some funds have been designated to include women such as 10 million for the iraqi womens democracy initiative congress has not used legislative earmarks extensively for womens programs future developments in consideration of the funding appropriated in recent years there are some similarities in the approach taken by the united states to improve the lives of afghan and iraqi women however not only are afghanistan and iraq starting from different economic and social points but the timetables for reconstruction will differ as well based on events and challenges on the ground although it is too soon to draw specific lessons from either country as congress examines the progress of reconstruction programs for women it may be important to consider the effect of religious versus secular forces the variation in local traditions and cultures and the differences between rural and urban communities to see if the assistance provided to afghan and iraqi women is effective and can be used as model in future postconflict regions for other versions of
