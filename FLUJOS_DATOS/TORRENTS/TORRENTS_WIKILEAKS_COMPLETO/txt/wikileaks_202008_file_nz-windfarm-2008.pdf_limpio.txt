apiti wind farm 2008 annual emission reduction report version 1 confidential 2008 apiti annual emission reduction report page 2 of 14 confidential and commercially sensitive apiti wind farm 2008 annual emission reduction report 1 background the report fulfils the reporting obligations set ou t in the 2003 project agreement between meridian and the crown 2 the project the apiti wind farm is meridians first new zeal and wind farm the 90 mw wind farm is located on saddle road north of the manawatu gorge it is situated across 1150 of farmland owned by four separate land owners includi ng meridian the 55 turbines each have capacity of 165 mw the first mw size machines to be used in new zealand the electricity generated from the site is sufficient t generate electricity for approximately 45000 average homes it is the first wind farm to supply into electricity directly into the national grid key dates during the development and construction f apiti wind farm project announced and public consultation commenced 8 may 2003 resource consent applications lodged 20 june 2003 resource consents granted with appeals 4 septemb er 2003 karakia and construction commencement

sensitive appendix 1 sets out the generation from each turbin and combined generation total of 314595585kwh the total electricity output of the project as measured by the revenue meter is 9480783kwh less than this combined total because the revenue meter output incorporates generation losses generation losses include wind farm distribution losses ie cables between turbines transformer losses trans mission losses and local service supply at the apiti substation this is within expected l imits there is other generation that is not part of th project that flows through the above meters meridian expects to generate the full amount of eli gible generation during the commitment period wind resource is variable from season to s eason and the 2008 year was significantly low wind year
